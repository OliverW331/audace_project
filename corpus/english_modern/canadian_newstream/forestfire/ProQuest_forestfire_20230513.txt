Full text: Filmmaker Janice Zolf came to Montreal as an outsider, to make a film about fashion designer Marie Saint Pierre. And she fell in love - with the city and with the art she discovered at what felt like every turn.
"I think when you live in Montreal you take it for granted," said the Edmonton native, who worked for years as a television arts and entertainment journalist based in London, Ont.
The first time Zolf experienced Cité Mémoire, Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon's imaginative and lyrical take on some of the characters and events in Montreal's history, "my heart pounded on the street," she recalled. "I was in awe."
Cité Mémoire, which launched in 2016, is awesome, as anyone who has experienced it knows. Tableaus projected at night, mainly onto blind walls in Old Montreal, are accompanied by dramatic texts and original music. Lemieux and Pilon, internationally acclaimed multimedia artists known, among other things, for their work on Cirque du Soleil productions, created the concept and design for the more than two dozen tableaus; playwright Michel Marc Bouchard wrote the dramatic script for each short, movie-like tableau.
Actors in the tableaus don't speak but are portrayed in what Lemieux has called "the poetic way. ... This is our language, Victor and me - the idea of dreamscape." The audio, available in English, French, Spanish and Mandarin, is accessed by downloading a free mobile app to one's smartphone or tablet.
Having been a journalist for so long before turning to filmmaking, Zolf knows a good story.
"I put myself in the position of the audience - and I could feel there was a story in it," she recalled.
Zolf approached Lemieux about doing a film. A senior CBC producer based in Montreal, Carrie Haber, said the CBC would air it, which meant Zolf could secure funding from sources including the Rogers documentary fund.
Into the Light with Cité Mémoire, a 44-minute documentary written and directed by Zolf, takes viewers behind the scenes with Lemieux, Pilon and Bouchard. The film took Best Short Documentary and Best Female Director, Short Documentary, at the Arte Non Stop Film Festival in Buenos Aires, which wound up on Oct. 30; the previous week, it won the Old Oak Audience Choice Award at the Forest City Film Festival in London, Ont. It will stream on CBC Gem on Friday and air Saturday on CBC Montreal.
People to whom Zolf showed the film often described it as "a virtual road trip to Montreal." With the COVID-19 pandemic making travel difficult or impossible, a virtual road trip is a good thing.
For Montrealers, Cité Mémoire would make a fine pandemic outing: It's outdoors, for one, evenings are mostly quiet these days, and physical distancing is easily maintained.
Among several tableaus depicted in the film is one showing an orphaned Holocaust survivor, a teenage boy, stepping off a train in Montreal in 1947 as a couple waits for the little girl they were expecting; hundreds of such orphans were adopted by families in Montreal and other Canadian cities.
Another juxtaposes - and contrasts - the stories of two Black people in Montreal more than 200 years apart: Marie-Josèphe Angélique, a slave charged with setting a fire in Old Montreal, was tortured until she confessed and was hanged in 1734, although her guilt was never proved; baseball legend Jackie Robinson played in 1946 with the Montreal Royals - and in 1947 suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first Black player in Major League Baseball.
"As a spectator, I felt that these people lived in the dark stones - and it was the light that brought them to life and made them real," Zolf said.
A few tableaus featured in the film are unavailable or being moved, including a delightful one in which hockey legend Maurice "Rocket" Richard almost single-handedly moves his brotherin-law's belongings from one flat to another - before scoring five goals that night for the Canadiens.
When the projectors haven't been knocked down in a windstorm, a mermaid-like Suzanne - she of the 1967 Leonard Cohen song - is projected onto the Old Port clock tower. Through archives licensed from Lemieux Pilon 4D Art showing footage and images by Jean-François Gratton, Cité Mémoire's director of photography, viewers see the underwater dancer depicting Suzanne as the tableau was being shot.
Cité Mémoire closed during the pandemic lockdown in March. Before reopening in June, Lemieux and Pilon created a moving tribute seen in the film to the resilience of Montrealers: It features a flame projecting onto the Palais du Justice and faces projected on to different sites, accompanied by words describing their attributes, in the many languages heard in Montreal. sschwartz@postmedia.com
AT A GLANCE Into the Light With Cité Mémoire will air on CBC Gem on Friday at 9 a.m. and Saturday at 7 p.m. on CBC-TV in Montreal. On Nov. 26 the French version of the film, Au coeur de Cité Mémoire, will air on Club Illico. It is set to air nationally on CBC in English on Jan. 2, 2021. Cité Mémoire is runs Wednesday through Saturday, from dusk to 11 p.m. It closes for maintenance in January and February.

Full text: Filmmaker Janice Zolf came to Montreal as an outsider, to make a film about fashion designer Marie Saint Pierre. And she fell in love - with the city and with the art she discovered at what felt like every turn.
"I think when you live in Montreal you take it for granted," said the Edmonton native, who worked for years as a television arts and entertainment journalist based in London, Ont.

Another juxtaposes - and contrasts - the stories of two Black people in Montreal more than 200 years apart: Marie-Josèphe Angélique, a slave charged with setting a fire in Old Montreal, was tortured until she confessed and was hanged in 1734, although her guilt was never proved; baseball legend Jackie Robinson played in 1946 with the Montreal Royals - and in 1947 became the first Black major-league player with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
"As a spectator, I felt that these people lived in the dark stones - and it was the light that brought them to life and made them real," Zolf said.
A few tableaux featured in the film are unavailable or being moved, including a delightful one in which hockey legend Maurice (Rocket) Richard almost single-handedly moves his brother-in-law's belongings from one flat to another - before scoring five goals that night for the Canadiens.
When the projectors haven't been knocked down in a windstorm, a mermaid-like Suzanne - she of the 1967 Leonard Cohen song - is projected onto the Old Port clock tower. Through archives licensed from Lemieux Piilon 4D Art showing footage and images by Jean-François Gratton, Cité Mémoire's director of photography, viewers see the underwater dancer depicting Suzanne as the tableau was being shot.
Cité Mémoire closed during the pandemic lockdown in March. Before reopening in June, Lemieux and Pilon created a moving tribute seen in the film to the resilience of Montrealers: It features a flame projecting onto the Palais du Justice and faces projected on to different sites, accompanied by words describing their attributes, in the many languages heard in Montreal.
AT A GLANCE
Into the Light With Cité Mémoire will air on CBC Gem on Friday at 9 a.m. and Saturday at 7 p.m. on CBC-TV in Montreal. On Nov. 26 the French version of the film, Au coeur de CIté Mémoire, will air on Club Illico. It is set to air nationally on CBC in English on Jan. 2, 2021.

Full text: Filmmaker Janice Zolf came to Montreal as an outsider, to make a film about fashion designer Marie Saint Pierre. And she fell in love - with the city and with the art she discovered at what felt like every turn.
"I think when you live in Montreal you take it for granted," said the Edmonton native, who worked for years as a television arts and entertainment journalist based in London, Ont.
The first time Zolf experienced Cité Mémoire, Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon's imaginative and lyrical take on some of the characters and events in Montreal's history, "my heart pounded on the street," she recalled. "I was in awe."
Cité Mémoire, which launched in 2016, is awesome, as anyone who has experienced it knows. Tableaux projected at night, mainly onto blind walls in Old Montreal, are accompanied by dramatic texts and original music. Lemieux and Pilon, internationally acclaimed multimedia artists known, among other things, for their work on Cirque du Soleil productions, created the concept and design for the more than two dozen tableaux; playwright Michel Marc Bouchard wrote the dramatic script for each short, movie-like tableau.
Actors in the tableaux don't speak but are portrayed in what Lemieux has called "the poetic way. ... This is our language, Victor and me - the idea of dreamscape." The audio, available in English, French, Spanish and Mandarin, is accessed by downloading a free mobile app to one's smartphone or tablet.
Having been a journalist for so long before turning to filmmaking, Zolf knows a good story.
"I put myself in the position of the audience - and I could feel there was a story in it," she recalled.
Zolf approached Lemieux about doing a film. A senior CBC producer based in Montreal, Carrie Haber, said the CBC would air it, which meant Zolf could secure funding from sources, including the Rogers documentary fund.
Into the Light with Cité Mémoire, a 44-minute documentary written and directed by Zolf, takes viewers behind the scenes with Lemieux, Pilon and Bouchard. The film took Best Short Documentary and Best Female Director, Short Documentary, at the Arte Non Stop Film Festival in Buenos Aires, which wound up on Oct. 30; the previous week, it won the Old Oak Audience Choice Award at the Forest City Film Festival in London, Ont. It will stream on CBC Gem on Friday and air Saturday on CBC Montreal.
People to whom Zolf showed the film often described it as "a virtual road trip to Montreal." With the COVID-19 pandemic making travel difficult or impossible, a virtual road trip is a good thing.
For Montrealers, Cité Mémoire would make a fine pandemic outing: It's outdoors, for one, evenings are mostly quiet these days, and social distancing is easily maintained.
Among several tableaux depicted in the film is one showing an orphaned Holocaust survivor, a teenaged boy, stepping off a train in Montreal in 1947 as a couple waits for the little girl they were expecting; hundreds of such orphans were adopted by families in Montreal and other Canadian cities.
Another juxtaposes - and contrasts - the stories of two Black people in Montreal more than 200 years apart: Marie-Josèphe Angélique, a slave charged with setting a fire in Old Montreal, was tortured until she confessed and was hanged in 1734, although her guilt was never proven; baseball legend Jackie Robinson played in 1946 with the Montreal Royals - and in 1947 became the first Black major-league player with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
"As a spectator, I felt that these people lived in the dark stones - and it was the light that brought them to life and made them real," Zolf said.

Quebec braces for grim month of isolation: Partial lockdown in 'red zones' begins as report highlights uptick in symptoms of anxiety and depression among Quebec adults

Author: Andrew-Gee, Eric

Full text: The little guitar shop that Michel Pellerin runs out of his basement in Thetford Mines, Que., can stay open - for now. But his girlfriend will not be able to visit him for a while.
These are the strange new burdens that about five million Quebeckers are starting to settle under, as the province returns to a partial, nearly month-long lockdown in an attempt to control a surge in coronavirus cases. The province exceeded 1,000 new cases on Friday, the largest daily increase since early May.
Now, bars and restaurants like his favourite sushi place, Le Rouge Poisson, must close their dining rooms and limit themselves to delivery and takeout.
Gathering places such as movie theatres and music venues must close, leaving the professional musicians who make up most of his clientele unable to perform on the elaborate, mother-of-pearl-inlaid instruments Mr. Pellerin has made for them.
Although these restrictions are less severe than those in the spring, many people are bracing for a grim October. After a summer of relative freedom, the emotional whiplash of returning to a state of confinement risks worsening a mental-health crisis already plaguing Quebec.
"It hurts even worse to fall back into it," Mr. Pellerin said.
Perhaps most difficult of all, private gatherings between households are forbidden - with a few exceptions for essential workers like plumbers - enforceable by $1,000 fines on the spot. Those who live alone, such as Mr. Pellerin, may have a visitor from one other address - but since he has joint custody of children from a previous relationship, his girlfriend will not be able to visit as often.
Along with many Quebeckers, the guitar-maker feels anxiety about what the future will hold for a province that once again finds itself the epicentre of Canada's pandemic. No other jurisdiction in the country has imposed such strict limits on daily life since the spring's first wave.

Premier François Legault has also made it clear that these "red zone" rules - applied from Oct. 1 to 28 in the Greater Montreal area, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region where Thetford Mines is located - could be extended if the public-health situation warrants it.
More than six months into an unprecedented global crisis, in which Quebec has one of the world's highest death rates, the province's suffering is to some extent quantifiable. One in five Quebec adults reported symptoms in line with depression or anxiety in early September, a University of Sherbrooke study found. The situation is most severe among anglophones, health care workers and young adults, said Dr. Melissa Généreux, who led the research.
Although no comparable, population-wide survey of mental health has been done before in the province, previous studies of the Canadian population suggest how severe the pandemic's mental-health toll has been. A 2015-16 survey across Canada found that 10 per cent of young adults suffered from symptoms compatible with depression. Today, in Quebec, the figure is 31 per cent.
Among the 6,261 Quebeckers surveyed by the polling firm Leger for the study, it was city-dwellers who were most depressed and anxious. But Dr. Généreux also worries about residents of another, more figurative region: the internet. People who receive their information about the pandemic from social media or other digital sources, rather than directly from the government or traditional media, tend to have a harder time processing it in a psychologically healthy way.
Information overload is one of the ways this crisis is unusual in the literature of mental health, said Dr. Généreux. Previous disasters like the train derailment in Lac-Mégantic, Que., or the devastating forest fires in Fort McMurray, Alta., didn't produce the same waves of facts and opinions that can feel overwhelming during the pandemic. "Now we're drowning in messages, from government, from the media, from social media and from our social circles."
The Sherbrooke research team is calling for an urgent increase in mental-health resources from the government as the second wave extends into fall, including teams specializing in psychiatry deployed in communities and more support to medical workers.
Some Quebeckers feel it's not the renewed confinement that is causing their angst but government decisions that seem arbitrary and high-handed. Martine St-Victor, a Montreal public-relations professional, decried the Legault government's "Crayola-box type of communication tactics" that she believes are patronizing and opaque.
She wonders, for example, why museums are being closed (she sits on the board of trustees for the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal), but not big-box stores like Costco, which tend to be more crowded. The Premier has faced similar criticism for shuttering libraries while leaving most shops open, though he clarified this week that members of the public can still take out books, just not gather inside.
"Why are you shutting this down? Show me numbers," said Ms. St-Victor. "Stop talking to us like we're two-year-olds."
Mr. Legault has explained that he is trying to find a balance between clamping down on the social activities known to spread the virus while preserving schools and the economy. He has also offered up to $100-million in financial aid to businesses that are being forced to close in the red zones.
But there is no eliminating collateral damage in a partial lockdown of society. Even those who have managed relatively well during the pandemic have their pangs of regret and longing as the second wave drags on.
Emcie Turineck, a Montreal illustrator, says she doesn't mind staying at home - her work allows it, and she's a bit of a homebody anyway. She and her boyfriend are both good cooks, so eating in is fine. The past six months have actually been a good time for introspection and self-discovery, she said.
But Ms. Turineck does worry about not being able to visit friends who are having a harder time, and her mother, who lives about an hour north in Saint-Sauveur, Que.
There are also some little things, seemingly insignificant, which she can't help but pine for as the province enters an early hibernation.
"Even if I don't go out that much," Ms. Turineck said, "it would be nice to go bowling."

3:30 p.m. Ontario strip clubs, worker advocates say provincial shutdown is unfair
From The Canadian Press:
Strip club operators are voicing frustration over the Ontario government's move to shut down their establishments, saying the closure was ordered without consultation and treats the industry unfairly.
The province announced the shutdown late last week, saying it was needed to reduce transmission in high-risk businesses.
Mauro Mastrucci, who owns the Airport Strip Club in Mississauga, Ont., said clubs weren't warned about the order and argued the measure discriminates against the adult entertainment industry.
"It's totally frustrating," he said, noting that his club had plexiglass barriers, required customers to wear masks, and checked temperatures at the door in an effort to follow public health guidelines.
Two Toronto strip clubs made headlines this summer after COVID-19 cases were linked to the establishments. But Mastrucci said restaurants and bars have also seen cases and have only had to close temporarily while his industry has to deal with a province-wide shut down.
"How can they distinguish that it's more likely that strip clubs will be able to spread COVID-19 and bars and restaurants won't," he said.

2:05 p.m. Quebec's new measures include appeal to youth, adoption of COVID-Alert app
Following up on my live coverage, here's our full story, by Philip Authier in Quebec, on Premier François Legault's briefing this afternoon.
2 p.m. No plan to mandate masks in classrooms, Arruda says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.
The premier said he will announce details about police enforcement - roadblocks and how officers will handle 1) protests in which people don't wear masks and 2) illegal gatherings in homes.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province will soon embrace the federal exposure-notification. The final details are being worked out and an announcement is expected in the coming days.
Legault was asked about masks in classrooms. He said public health has not recommended that Quebec change its decision not to make face coverings mandatory for children in class.
Some other jurisdictions, including Ontario, have mandated masks in classrooms.
But Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director, suggested it would be "very difficult" for Quebec students to wear masks for eight hours a day in classrooms.
He said the bigger risk is students congregating outside of school.
12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety: study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found that 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks.
"It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well," Généreux said. "It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."
More details here
Noon In reversal, Quebec moves to adopt federal exposure-notification app
After months of opposition, the Quebec government is readying itself to adopt COVID-Alert, the exposure notification application developed by the federal government.
The move comes as the province experiences an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting the province is in a second wave.

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:
10:45 a.m. Legault, Dubé, Arruda to provide update
With three regions about to go on red alert, Quebec officials will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. today to provide an update on the situation.

Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday
Three regions in Quebec, including Greater Montreal, will be under the government's COVID-19 "red" alert status as of Thursday - a decision that affects some 5 million people across the province.
Quebec Premier François Legault made the announcement yesterday, calling the situation "critical" while detailing the measures that will be in effect during a one-month partial shutdown in red zones.
The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

3:30 p.m. Ontario strip clubs, worker advocates say provincial shutdown is unfair
From The Canadian Press:
Strip club operators are voicing frustration over the Ontario government's move to shut down their establishments, saying the closure was ordered without consultation and treats the industry unfairly.
The province announced the shutdown late last week, saying it was needed to reduce transmission in high-risk businesses.
Mauro Mastrucci, who owns the Airport Strip Club in Mississauga, Ont., said clubs weren't warned about the order and argued the measure discriminates against the adult entertainment industry.
"It's totally frustrating," he said, noting that his club had plexiglass barriers, required customers to wear masks, and checked temperatures at the door in an effort to follow public health guidelines.
Two Toronto strip clubs made headlines this summer after COVID-19 cases were linked to the establishments. But Mastrucci said restaurants and bars have also seen cases and have only had to close temporarily while his industry has to deal with a province-wide shut down.
"How can they distinguish that it's more likely that strip clubs will be able to spread COVID-19 and bars and restaurants won't," he said.

2:05 p.m. Quebec's new measures include appeal to youth, adoption of COVID-Alert app
Following up on my live coverage, here's our full story, by Philip Authier in Quebec, on Premier François Legault's briefing this afternoon.
2 p.m. No plan to mandate masks in classrooms, Arruda says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.
The premier said he will announce details about police enforcement - roadblocks and how officers will handle 1) protests in which people don't wear masks and 2) illegal gatherings in homes.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province will soon embrace the federal exposure-notification. The final details are being worked out and an announcement is expected in the coming days.
Legault was asked about masks in classrooms. He said public health has not recommended that Quebec change its decision not to make face coverings mandatory for children in class.
Some other jurisdictions, including Ontario, have mandated masks in classrooms.
But Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director, suggested it would be "very difficult" for Quebec students to wear masks for eight hours a day in classrooms.
He said the bigger risk is students congregating outside of school.
12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety: study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found that 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks.
"It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well," Généreux said. "It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."

Noon In reversal, Quebec moves to adopt federal exposure-notification app
After months of opposition, the Quebec government is readying itself to adopt COVID-Alert, the exposure notification application developed by the federal government.
The move comes as the province experiences an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting the province is in a second wave.

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:
10:45 a.m. Legault, Dubé, Arruda to provide update
With three regions about to go on red alert, Quebec officials will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. today to provide an update on the situation.

10:05 a.m. No, Virginia, there will not be a Santa Claus parade this year
Santa Claus is not coming to town.
Montreal's Christmas parade has been cancelled due to the pandemic - and organizers in Sherbrooke and Quebec City are considering following suit.

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday
Three regions in Quebec, including Greater Montreal, will be under the government's COVID-19 "red" alert status as of Thursday - a decision that affects some 5 million people across the province.
Quebec Premier François Legault made the announcement yesterday, calling the situation "critical" while detailing the measures that will be in effect during a one-month partial shutdown in red zones.
The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

3:30 p.m. Ontario strip clubs, worker advocates say provincial shutdown is unfair
From The Canadian Press:
Strip club operators are voicing frustration over the Ontario government's move to shut down their establishments, saying the closure was ordered without consultation and treats the industry unfairly.
The province announced the shutdown late last week, saying it was needed to reduce transmission in high-risk businesses.
Mauro Mastrucci, who owns the Airport Strip Club in Mississauga, Ont., said clubs weren't warned about the order and argued the measure discriminates against the adult entertainment industry.
"It's totally frustrating," he said, noting that his club had plexiglass barriers, required customers to wear masks, and checked temperatures at the door in an effort to follow public health guidelines.
Two Toronto strip clubs made headlines this summer after COVID-19 cases were linked to the establishments. But Mastrucci said restaurants and bars have also seen cases and have only had to close temporarily while his industry has to deal with a province-wide shut down.
"How can they distinguish that it's more likely that strip clubs will be able to spread COVID-19 and bars and restaurants won't," he said.

2:05 p.m. Quebec's new measures include appeal to youth, adoption of COVID-Alert app
Following up on my live coverage, here's our full story, by Philip Authier in Quebec, on Premier François Legault's briefing this afternoon.
2 p.m. No plan to mandate masks in classrooms, Arruda says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.
The premier said he will announce details about police enforcement - roadblocks and how officers will handle 1) protests in which people don't wear masks and 2) illegal gatherings in homes.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province will soon embrace the federal exposure-notification. The final details are being worked out and an announcement is expected in the coming days.
Legault was asked about masks in classrooms. He said public health has not recommended that Quebec change its decision not to make face coverings mandatory for children in class.
Some other jurisdictions, including Ontario, have mandated masks in classrooms.
But Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director, suggested it would be "very difficult" for Quebec students to wear masks for eight hours a day in classrooms.
He said the bigger risk is students congregating outside of school.
12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety - study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found the pandemic is hitting three groups particularly hard: young adults aged 18 to 24, anglophones, and health workers.
"In our study, 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks," Généreux said. "It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well. It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."

Noon In reversal, Quebec moves to adopt federal exposure-notification app
After months of opposition, the Quebec government is readying itself to adopt COVID-Alert, the exposure notification application developed by the federal government.
The move comes as the province experiences an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting the province is in a second wave.

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday
Three regions in Quebec, including Greater Montreal, will be under the government's COVID-19 "red" alert status as of Thursday - a decision that affects some 5 million people across the province.
Quebec Premier François Legault made the announcement yesterday, calling the situation "critical" while detailing the measures that will be in effect during a one-month partial shutdown in red zones.
The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

- François Legault (@francoislegault) September 29, 2020
2:05 p.m. Quebec's new measures include appeal to youth, adoption of COVID-Alert app
Following up on my live coverage, here's our full story, by Philip Authier in Quebec, on Premier François Legault's briefing this afternoon.
2 p.m. No plan to mandate masks in classrooms, Arruda says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.
The premier said he will announce details about police enforcement - roadblocks and how officers will handle 1) protests in which people don't wear masks and 2) illegal gatherings in homes.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province will soon embrace the federal exposure-notification. The final details are being worked out and an announcement is expected in the coming days.
Legault was asked about masks in classrooms. He said public health has not recommended that Quebec change its decision not to make face coverings mandatory for children in class.
Some other jurisdictions, including Ontario, have mandated masks in classrooms.
But Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director, suggested it would be "very difficult" for Quebec students to wear masks for eight hours a day in classrooms.
He said the bigger risk is students congregating outside of school.
12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety - study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found the pandemic is hitting three groups particularly hard: young adults aged 18 to 24, anglophones, and health workers.
"In our study, 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks," Généreux said. "It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well. It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."

Noon In reversal, Quebec moves to adopt federal exposure-notification app
After months of opposition, the Quebec government is readying itself to adopt COVID-Alert, the exposure notification application developed by the federal government.
The move comes as the province experiences an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting the province is in a second wave.

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:

The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

2 p.m. No plan to mandate masks in classrooms, Arruda says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.
The premier said he will announce details about police enforcement - roadblocks and how officers will handle 1) protests in which people don't wear masks and 2) illegal gatherings in homes.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province will soon embrace the federal exposure-notification. The final details are being worked out and an announcement is expected in the coming days.
Legault was asked about masks in classrooms. He said public health has not recommended that Quebec change its decision not to make face coverings mandatory for children in class.
Some other jurisdictions, including Ontario, have mandated masks in classrooms.
But Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director, suggested it would be "very difficult" for Quebec students to wear masks for eight hours a day in classrooms.
He said the bigger risk is students congregating outside of school.
12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety - study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found the pandemic is hitting three groups particularly hard: young adults aged 18 to 24, anglophones, and health workers.
"In our study, 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks," Généreux said. "It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well. It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."

Noon In reversal, Quebec moves to adopt federal exposure-notification app
After months of opposition, the Quebec government is readying itself to adopt COVID-Alert, the exposure notification application developed by the federal government.
The move comes as the province experiences an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting the province is in a second wave.

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:
10:45 a.m. Legault, Dubé, Arruda to provide update

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday

1 p.m. Quebec provides update 12:10 p.m. Youth, anglophones, health workers most affected by pandemic anxiety - study
Young people, anglophones and health workers have been the most affected by pandemic anxiety and depression, a new study suggests.
The study, by a team at the Université de Sherbrooke, found that one in five Quebecers reported having symptoms "consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression" in the two weeks prior to the survey, conducted between Sept. 4 and 14.
The situation is even more acute in Montreal, where one in four adults reported such symptoms, the study's authors said.
"What we're seeing now in Quebec are levels of depression and anxiety that are considerably higher than what was observed pre-pandemic," researcher Mélissa Généreux said. "These levels are similar to those observed in Fort McMurray six months after the 2016 forest fires."
The study found the pandemic is hitting three groups particularly hard: young adults aged 18 to 24, anglophones, and health workers.
"In our study, 37 per cent of adults aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the previous two weeks," Généreux said. "It is concerning that a significant portion of young people are not doing well. It is equally striking that anglophones are twice as likely as francophones to have anxiety or depressive symptoms."

11:25 a.m. Hospitalizations rise as Quebec reports 799 new cases, 7 deaths
(This item is being updated)
Quebec has recorded 799 new cases of COVID-19, the provincial government announced this morning.
Montreal had the most cases of any region, with 234. Next were Quebec City (169) and the Montérégie region south of Montreal (121).
The seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 690. It has not been that high since May.
Seven new deaths were reported. Two occurred over the past 24 hours, the others between Sept. 22 and 27.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 jumped by 35 to reach 247.
That's the biggest one-day rise in hospitalizations since June.
Among those in hospital, 41 are in intensive care - four more than the previous day.
"The big increase in the number of cases is leading to a big increase in the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Christian Dubé said via Twitter.
"It is to spare our already weakened health system that we must do everything to limit our contacts and curb the spread of the virus."
After dropping significantly on Saturday, testing ramped up on Sunday, with 26,366 people screened. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
This chart shows the seven-day trend:

10:10 a.m. 'One address stays together' as Montreal heads into partial lockdown: Plante

10:05 a.m. No, Virginia, there will not be a Santa Claus parade this year
Santa Claus is not coming to town.
Montreal's Christmas parade has been cancelled due to the pandemic - and organizers in Sherbrooke and Quebec City are considering following suit.

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday
Three regions in Quebec, including Greater Montreal, will be under the government's COVID-19 "red" alert status as of Thursday - a decision that affects some 5 million people across the province.
Quebec Premier François Legault made the announcement yesterday, calling the situation "critical" while detailing the measures that will be in effect during a one-month partial shutdown in red zones.
The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

1:05 p.m. 'The situation remains critical,' Legault says
Quebec's "latest numbers are worrying and the situation remains critical," Premier François Legault said at a press conference this afternoon.
The sharp rise in cases is leading to a jump in hospitalizations and deaths, Legault noted.
Noting that more than half of Quebec's new cases are among people under 30, he appealed to young people to be more careful and avoid social situations.
"If young people transmit the virus to their parents or grandparents, it puts lives in danger," Legault said.
His message to youth: "If we want to limit deaths, the solution is in your hands. Please apply public health rules and convince your friends to do so."
Legault also promised to unveil "financial measures" in the coming days to help businesses that will have to close temporarily when Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region go on red alert on Thursday.

10 a.m. Quebec City police investigate death threats against mayor after radio boycott announced
Quebec City police confirmed on Tuesday that they have launched an investigation after online death threats were received by Mayor Régis Labeaume.
The threats follow an announcement by the Labeaume administration that the city would be pulling its advertising from a local radio station that aired COVID-19 conspiracy theories and refused to run a public service announcement from the provincial government warning the public not to be taken in by "charlatans."

9:30 a.m. 'Go protest in a potato field,' Plante tells anti-maskers
"We're seeing the progression and it's accelerating in every Montreal neighbourhood, though the west is less affected," Dr. Mylène Drouin, the head of public health for Montreal, told a press conference this morning.
Montreal has been reporting about 240 new cases per day over the past week or so, Drouin said.
Most outbreaks are small, with 10 to 15 cases. There have been about 30 outbreaks in schools, 30 in workplaces and six in daycare settings, she said. Some are also occurring due to parties and get-togethers after sporting events.
Drouin said transmission isn't typically being spread by people in classrooms or offices. Instead, it's occurring in break rooms, lunch rooms or during carpooling or after-work activities.
Drouin also said too few young adults are coming forward to get tested.
"We are missing cases," she said, adding that anyone with symptoms or who have contact with someone who is infected should get screened.
Public health officials are launching a four-week social media ad campaign this week targeting young adults. One of the taglines: "Don't ignore this call"
Mayor Valérie Plante pleaded with Montrealers to follow health directives.
"We need to do efforts - all of us," Plante said at the same press conference. "That means no gatherings and no types of socialization."
She said gatherings in parks with friends and family are no longer acceptable, even if you're keeping a two-metre distance. Only people from the same household should visit parks together, the mayor added.
"If your friends ask you to go to the park with the kids, say no," Plante said.
The mayor singled out the Tam-Tams, the weekly outdoor summer party at the foot of Mount Royal.
"Gatherings like those we saw at the Tam-Tams last weekend are not acceptable," Plante said.
Plante was asked about a planned anti-mask protest in Montreal on the weekend.
She said people who protest without following health directives are putting vulnerable Montreal neighbourhoods at risk.
"In Montreal, we're not like that - we stand in solidarity," Plante said.
Her message to demonstrators: "Go protest in a potato field."
8:15 a.m. Montreal on red alert as of Thursday
Three regions in Quebec, including Greater Montreal, will be under the government's COVID-19 "red" alert status as of Thursday - a decision that affects some 5 million people across the province.
Quebec Premier François Legault made the announcement yesterday, calling the situation "critical" while detailing the measures that will be in effect during a one-month partial shutdown in red zones.
The measures will be in effect as of Thursday and last for the following 28 days.

8:10 a.m. What could Quebec have done to better prevent a second wave?
As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
When the second wave was still a bump, the provincial government's response lacked severity, several experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Montreal, Quebec City and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

Full text: Tuesday's Environment Canada weather forecast for the Montreal area called for sunny skies with clouds expected to move in later in the day. However, the overcast that placed a shadow over the city beginning Tuesday morning doesn't mean the federal agency was wrong.
The dull yellowish grey pall that covered the Montreal area was, in fact, wildfire smoke blown across most of the North American continent from burning forests in British Columbia and the western United States.
Environment Canada announced on its Twitter account Tuesday morning that "smoke coming from the fires in the western part of the continent is visible this morning in the sky for southern Quebec. This smoke is too high in the atmosphere to affect the quality of the air we breathe, but it makes the sky greyer."
The smoke has been drifting eastward from B.C. for the past five days.

Mixed messages, missed chances in COVID fight

Full text: Last spring, when Montreal was the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Quebec resisted making masks mandatory in public places, even as face coverings became a preventive measure implemented widely around the world. Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, offered every excuse in the book for why he didn't think they were necessary. People would put them on wrong. It would offer a false sense of security. He preferred convincing people to wear them rather than forcing them.
By summer, however, after the city of Montreal, transit agencies and most businesses had already decided to make them a requirement, the Quebec government finally came around. Lo and behold, the number of new COVID-19 cases ebbed. And despite a modest resurgence in late July, the coronavirus has remained mostly manageable, despite a loosening of social restrictions.
You'd think the government might have learned a thing or two from this experience. Delaying more stringent regulations for fear of offending a vocal minority that doesn't like to be told what to do failed to produce a significant backlash. And waiting so long to introduce more serious measures may have hampered efforts to flatten the curve of transmission in Quebec earlier. But here we are, facing the same hesitancy all over again with digital contact tracing. SEE HANES ON A2 Quebec has opted out of deploying the app developed by the federal government, which will use smartphone data to anonymously monitor the movements of participants newly diagnosed with COVID-19 and automatically alert anyone who might have been exposed. Plus, Quebec announced Tuesday that it will not proceed with the rollout of its own app after parliamentary hearings on the matter over the summer.
Éric Caire, the junior minister in charge of digital transformation, said the province will nevertheless test a made-in-Quebec alert system "just in case" a second wave hits and the government decides it might come in handy after all.
The usual antagonisms with Ottawa feel especially tiresome in the midst of a pandemic. Quebec has zero credibility insisting its way of doing things is superior, given its questionable handling of the crisis early on. And Caire's lackadaisical approach is just baffling.
Citing the results of a poll conducted on the use of digital contact tracing, he said twothirds of respondents were in favour of harnessing technology to fight COVID-19. Meanwhile, 77 per cent of Quebecers surveyed believe an app would prove useful, and 75 per cent would likely install it. But, nah, never mind.
At best, this makes no sense. At worst, the government's actions are sharply at odds with its message.
Sitting at a safe distance from Caire in Montreal, Health Minister Christian Dubé went on at length about the need for vigilance in the coming weeks as kids go back to school and officials monitor the situation closely for signs of a second wave.
He thanked Quebecers for their sacrifices during confinement and their caution during the reopening. With an average of 80 new diagnoses a day, Quebec's current ratio of 10 cases per million population is among the best in the world.
"We succeeded in flattening the curve and we need to keep it flat," said Dubé. "If we manage to keep transmission to less than 20 cases per million, we can continue to live life the way we're living."
Great! But then, why is the government actively thwarting those efforts? On top of the apathy toward contact tracing, Quebec Education Minister Jean-François Roberge was cracking down on private schools planning to make masks mandatory in the classroom. Last week, he warned the Lester B. Pearson School Board against any requirements exceeding the universal ones set out by the government. Only children in Grade 5 and up must wear masks, and only in the hallways or on the school bus; they're not supposed to be obligatory during classes.
Quebec should be using every means at its disposal to keep COVID-19 in check at this sensitive time. Instead, it is throwing caution to the wind while urging the public to be prudent.
The ministers kept using containment of a fire as a metaphor to describe Quebec's strategy for keeping the pandemic under control.
We're not going to let COVID-19 cases flare in schools, said Arruda.
The wind can quickly fan the flames of a brush fire into a fullblown forest fire, Dubé warned.
We don't need to get out the water bombers to put out a brush fire, Caire shrugged.
But, frankly, the Quebec government is playing with fire in all the mixed messages and missed opportunities. ahanes@postmedia.com

'We're a bit like the parents': Dubé says government will watch schools closely

Full text: As thousands of teachers return to schools this week, Health Minister Christian Dubé said he's confident the government has a good plan in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
However, Dubé cautioned the situation is fragile, and the government is watching closely to see how it evolves when children go back to class in the next few weeks.
"We're a few days away from back to school," Dubé said Tuesday afternoon at a news conference in Montreal. "I think we're a bit like the parents and we're all anxious to see how it will work out. But on our side, we're confident it will go well."
He said the average of cases in the last seven days amounts to roughly 80 new cases per day, or 10 per million, which he said is an acceptable number for the moment, especially compared with other jurisdictions. The government gets more concerned when the number of cases grows to 160 per day, or 20 per million.
"We need to make sure that Quebecers will follow the rules because we're doing well right now," Dubé said. "But every day, we still have four, five or six outbreaks, and we have to monitor them closely. We see every day that these bushfires want to expand, and our job is to make sure it doesn't become a forest fire."
Public health director Horacio Arruda was asked at the same news conference about criticism of the government's back-to-school plan. A recent open letter by physicians and scientists who are parents of school-age children was particularly critical of the decision that masks are not required for students while in class.
Arruda said the government's plan was put together with experts and pediatricians, and that he's confident the rules put in place will help limit the spread of the virus.
"We found what we thought is a good balance, limiting the risk while promoting the development of children, which is very important," Arruda said. "I understand some people are concerned, but we are following this very closely, and if we have to tighten the measures, we will adjust."
Dubé played down the fact that more than 400 teachers at the Centre de services scolaire
de Montréal (formerly the Commission scolaire de Montréal) have been given permission to stay home because of a fear of contracting the virus.
"We have 100,000 teachers; you're talking about 400," he said. "We need to prove over the next few days that our measures will work, but we can't do that ourselves. It's teamwork. If you ask me, 'Is it normal that 400 teachers are nervous and are asking questions?', I would say to you it's normal."
Dubé said he's confident teachers and school administrators can put in place innovative measures to limit the spread of the virus, as nurses have already done in hospitals by retrofitting workstations sometimes with duct tape, if necessary.
"We are at war," Dubé said. "I think we need to understand where we are starting from. We have hospitals that are still in bad shape, but people have been able to do miracles with that. I think it's the same thing with schools. We know from the start that 54 per cent of our schools are in bad shape, and we have been investing. We understand that, but those kids need to be in school; they need socialization. They need to learn. Let's reassure (teachers)."
"I'm crossing my fingers for the first week," Dubé added. "Then, after it goes by, we'll see what happens and adjust."
Arruda said the measures in place allow teachers to have access to protection for times when they can't maintain two metres of distance from their students.
"The most important is two metres distance, and wear a mask if you can't respect it, and wash your hands," he said.
Also at Tuesday's news conference, the Legault government confirmed it is dropping the idea of asking Quebecers to download a COVID-19 tracing application on their phones.
But it has not ruled out trying such an app in the future should the pandemic situation worsen.
Quebec's minister of governmental digital transformation, Éric Caire, made the announcement, and said traditional methods of tracing COVID-19 infections, in which health workers track down the contacts of a person who was infected, are adequate.
"Because the pandemic is under control at the moment, we have decided not to go ahead with it," Caire said. "But we are readying the groundwork so we can roll it out quickly if we need it."
Caire said rolling out the app now would be the equivalent of "putting out a brush fire with a water-bomber aircraft."
The government's decision comes despite the fact Quebecers said they were interested in the idea of an app in a recent consultation.
The drive to deploy an app fell apart in early August after experts appeared before a committee of the National Assembly studying the idea.
The experts told the committee - made up of MNAs of all stripes - that there were big questions about the safety, reliability and efficiency of such apps. Nearly all the 18 experts expressed doubts about the technology.

"We have 100,000 teachers; you're talking about 400," he said. "We need to prove over the next few days that our measures will work, but we can't do that ourselves. It's teamwork. If you ask me, 'Is it normal that 400 teachers are nervous and are asking questions?', I would say to you it's normal."
Dubé said he's confident teachers and school administrators can put in place innovative measures to limit the spread of the virus, as nurses have already done in hospitals by retrofitting workstations sometimes with duct tape, if necessary.
"We are at war," Dubé said. "I think we need to understand where we are starting from. We have hospitals that are still in bad shape, but people have been able to do miracles with that. I think it's the same thing with schools. We know from the start that 54 per cent of our schools are in bad shape, and we have been investing. We understand that, but those kids need to be in school; they need socialization. They need to learn. Let's reassure (teachers)."
"I'm crossing my fingers for the first week," Dubé added. "Then, after it goes by, we'll see what happens and adjust."
Arruda said the measures in place allow teachers to have access to protection for times when they can't maintain two metres of distance from their students.
"The most important is two metres distance, and wear a mask if you can't respect it, and wash your hands," he said.
Also at Tuesday's news conference, the Legault government confirmed it is dropping the idea of asking Quebecers to download a COVID-19 tracing application on their phones.
But it has not ruled out trying such an app in the future should the pandemic situation worsen.
Quebec's minister of governmental digital transformation, Éric Caire, made the announcement, and said traditional methods of tracing COVID-19 infections, in which health workers track down the contacts of a person who was infected, are adequate.
"Because the pandemic is under control at the moment, we have decided not to go ahead with it," Caire said. "But we are readying the groundwork so we can roll it out quickly if we need it."
Caire said rolling out the app now would be the equivalent of "putting out a brush fire with a water-bomber aircraft."
The government's decision comes despite the fact Quebecers said they were interested in the idea of an app in a recent consultation.
The drive to deploy an app fell apart in early August after experts appeared before a committee of the National Assembly studying the idea.
The experts told the committee - made up of MNAs of all stripes - that there were big questions about the safety, reliability and efficiency of such apps. Nearly all the 18 experts expressed doubts about the technology.

4:25 p.m. In Montreal, more women than men affected by COVID-19
The city's public health department released the following findings in an analysis of how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting men and women differently in the Montreal area:
More women than men in Montreal have contracted COVID-19. Women account for 58 per cent of all cases. Researchers theorize that it is because more women work directly with people, such as in health care occupations, than men
46 per cent of women who have contracted the disease are health care workers, as compared to 19 per cent of men
In terms of hospitalizations it was virtually equal: women made up 51 per cent, men 49 per cent
Although the disease is more prevalent among women, the disease is more severe in men, and mortality rates are higher. Researchers don't know why yet.
Psychologically, however, it is women who are more affected. More women have been afraid of being infected or infecting others, had problems sleeping and experienced moments of anxiety.
See a summary of the report here and the full report (in French) here.
3:45 p.m. Virtual 'contact free' tickets coming to Montreal buses
Riders on Montreal-areas buses will be able to use virtual "contact free" tickets available for purchase via smartphones as of Sept. 1.
They will cost $3.50 each and be valid for 120 minutes once activated. They can be purchased at the Apple app store or at the Google Store at Chrono or Transit.
Once activated, the user will show the bus driver the screen of their phone before boarding.

3:45 p.m. Troubling uptick of COVID-19 among the young: Labos
Basic statistics indicate that the greater the number of young people who are infected, the greater the number of young people who will die, even if such deaths are likely to remain relatively rare, writes columnist Dr. Christopher Labos.
The troubling trend in recent days has been the uptick of new coronavirus infections in young people. New cases in those under 40 have been on the rise especially in places like British Columbia and Ontario. The uptick in new cases was so concerning to officials that recruited actor Ryan Reynolds to reach this younger demographic.
See the full column by Dr. Christopher Labos here.
2 p.m. Hundreds of teachers staying home over COVID-19 fears
With classes set to resume on Thursday, Quebec's largest school service centre is scrambling to fill spaces, reassign posts and deal with last-minute retirements.
The Centres des services scolaire de Montréal (formerly the Commission scolaire de Montréal) has granted medical exemptions to 420 teachers who fear they could contract COVID-19 if they return to the classroom during the coronavirus pandemic.
About 991 teachers had applied for medical exemptions, the centre said. The service centre has 9,500 teachers.

1:20 p.m. Quebec averaging fewer than 80 cases a day: Dubé
Quebec has been averaging fewer than 80 cases a day over the last week, indicating it has the pandemic under control at this point, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said Tuesday at a press briefing in Montreal.
That works out to approximately 10 cases per million inhabitants.
A flattened curve represents 20 cases per one million, so Quebec should not go beyond 160 cases a day, Dubé said. The province recently saw a spike to 180 cases, which was worrisome, Dubé said, but public health authorities were able to contain the outbreaks.
"As long as we keep cases below 20 per 1 million, we can continue life as we know it now. It's not perfect, but it's manageable," Dubé said.
Quebec registered 62 new cases on Tuesday.
MNA Éric Caire confirmed Quebec will not be using a province-wide smartphone tracing app to try and limit the coronavirus at this point, because experts had many reservations about such an app's efficacy. Quebec's contact tracing system is working well at this point, given the low number of cases. If numbers surge, Quebec could look into using the app, he said.
Asked why Quebec is not mandating masks in classrooms when hundreds of teachers have expressed concern and many are not returning to class, public health director Horacio Arruda said the government is striking a balance between children's need to learn and socialize, and the risk, which the government deems minimal if a two-metre distance is observed. If cases increase, the government could mandate masks, he said.
Teachers have argued it will be impossible to maintain spacing in classes of 38 children with small rooms.
Dubé stressed it was crucial to contain spread of the disease so regular surgeries can be carried out. "We must do this for the people who are sick, and not just those who have COVID. I'm thinking of people who have cancer."
"The virus is still present," Dubé said. "I distinguish between a small fire and a forest fire. ... Every time there is wind, the small fire can become a forest fire. If people are not careful, there could be so many small fires that it becomes a forest fire."

12:15 p.m. Young people make up nearly 50 per cent of cases: Tam
Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam reported young people under 40 account for 46 per cent of all new cases of COVID-19 in the country.
The 20 to 29-year-old age group is particularly over-represented, accounting for 25 per cent of cases nationally, but only 14 per cent of the population.
While most young people will only experience mild symptoms, their infections "build a reservoir of the virus that can spill over, affecting young and old," she said during the federal government's daily press briefing on Tuesday. Tam encouraged all Canadians to do their part to stem the spread of the pandemic.
Nationally, Canada now has 125,647 cases, and 9,083 deaths. More than 48,000 people are being tested daily, on average. About .7 per cent test positive.
An average of 400 people test positive daily, down from the 1,800 positives experienced during the pandemic's peak.
12 p.m. Marguerite-Bourgeoys service centre offers virtual classes
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school service centre (formerly known as a school board) announced it is putting in place a virtual school for students on its territory who have to stay at home during the pandemic for medical reasons.
It has dubbed the online school ÉVA, for École virtuelle assistée.
Classes will be offered for pre-school, elementary and high school students. An educator will be available to guide students. Students must have a medical certificate indicating they cannot attend class.
The virtual school is scheduled to begin Sept. 8. The creation of the ÉVA school will allow the teachers of the 75 elementary schools and 14 high schools of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys to focus completely on students who will be in class, the service centre said.
For students who have to miss a short period of school will be aided by personnel at their school.

'We're a bit like the parents': Dubé says government will watch schools closely

Full text: As thousands of teachers return to schools this week, Health Minister Christian Dubé said he's confident the government has a good plan in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
However, Dubé cautioned the situation is fragile, and the government is watching closely to see how it evolves when children go back to class in the next few weeks.
"We're a few days away from back to school," Dubé said Tuesday afternoon at a news conference in Montreal. "I think we're a bit like the parents and we're all anxious to see how it will work out. But on our side, we're confident it will go well."
He said the average of cases in the last seven days amounts to roughly 80 new cases per day, or 10 per million, which he said is an acceptable number for the moment, especially compared to other jurisdictions. The government gets more concerned when the number of cases grows to 160 per day, or 20 per million.
"We need to make sure that Quebecers will follow the rules, because we're doing well right now," Dubé said. "But every day, we still have four, five or six outbreaks, and we have to monitor them closely. We see every day that these bushfires want to expand, and our job is to make sure it doesn't become a forest fire."
Public health director Horacio Arruda was asked at the same news conference about criticism of the government's back-to-school plan. A recent open letter by physicians and scientists who are parents of school-age children was particularly critical of the decision that masks are not required for students while in class.
Arruda said the government's plan was put together with experts and pediatricians, and that he's confident the rules put in place will help limit the spread of the virus.
"We found what we thought is a good balance, limiting the risk while promoting the development of children, which is very important," Arruda said. "I understand some people are concerned, but we are following this very closely, and if we have to tighten the measures, we will adjust."
Dubé played down the fact that more than 400 teachers at the Commission scolaire de Montréal have been given permission to stay home because of a fear of contracting the virus.
"We have 100,000 teachers; you're talking about 400," he said. "We need to prove over the next few days that our measures will work, but we can't do that ourselves. It's teamwork. If you ask me, 'Is it normal that 400 teachers are nervous and are asking questions?', I would say to you it's normal."
Dubé said he's confident that teachers and school administrators will "perform miracles" to ensure that they can put in place measures to limit the spread of the virus.
"Those kids need to be in school; they need socialization," he said. "I'm crossing my fingers for the first week. Then, when it goes by, we'll see what happens and adjust."
Also at Tuesday's news conference, the Legault government confirmed it is dropping the idea of asking Quebecers to download a COVID-19 tracing application on their phones.
But it has not ruled out trying such an app in the future should the pandemic situation worsen.
Quebec's minister of governmental digital transformation, Éric Caire, made the announcement, and said traditional methods of tracing COVID-19 infections, in which health workers track down the contacts of a person who was infected, are adequate.
"Because the pandemic is under control at the moment, we have decided not to go ahead with it," Caire said. "But we are readying the groundwork so we can roll it out quickly if we need it."
Caire said rolling out the app now would be the equivalent of "putting out a brush fire with a water-bomber aircraft."
The government's decision comes despite the fact Quebecers said they were interested in the idea of an app in a recent consultation.
The drive to deploy an app fell apart in early August after experts appeared before a committee of the National Assembly studying the idea.
The experts told the committee - made up of MNAs of all stripes - that there were big questions about the safety, reliability and efficiency of such apps. Nearly all the 18 experts expressed doubts about the technology.

3:45 p.m. Troubling uptick of COVID-19 among the young: Labos
Basic statistics indicate that the greater the number of young people who are infected, the greater the number of young people who will die, even if such deaths are likely to remain relatively rare, writes columnist Dr. Christopher Labos.
The troubling trend in recent days has been the uptick of new coronavirus infections in young people. New cases in those under 40 have been on the rise especially in places like British Columbia and Ontario. The uptick in new cases was so concerning to officials that recruited actor Ryan Reynolds to reach this younger demographic.

2 p.m. Hundreds of teachers staying home over COVID-19 fears
With classes set to resume on Thursday, Quebec's largest school service centre is scrambling to fill spaces, reassign posts and deal with last-minute retirements.
The Centres des services scolaire de Montréal (formerly the Commission scolaire de Montréal) has granted medical exemptions to 420 teachers who fear they could contract COVID-19 if they return to the classroom during the coronavirus pandemic.
About 991 teachers had applied for medical exemptions, the centre said. The service centre has 9,500 teachers.

1:20 p.m. Quebec averaging fewer than 80 cases a day: Dubé
Quebec has been averaging fewer than 80 cases a day over the last week, indicating it has the pandemic under control at this point, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said Tuesday at a press briefing in Montreal.
That works out to approximately 10 cases per million inhabitants.
A flattened curve represents 20 cases per one million, so Quebec should not go beyond 160 cases a day, Dubé said. The province recently saw a spike to 180 cases, which was worrisome, Dubé said, but public health authorities were able to contain the outbreaks.
"As long as we keep cases below 20 per 1 million, we can continue life as we know it now. It's not perfect, but it's manageable," Dubé said.
Quebec registered 62 new cases on Tuesday.
MNA Éric Caire confirmed Quebec will not be using a province-wide smartphone tracing app to try and limit the coronavirus at this point, because experts had many reservations about such an app's efficacy. Quebec's contact tracing system is working well at this point, given the low number of cases. If numbers surge, Quebec could look into using the app, he said.
Asked why Quebec is not mandating masks in classrooms when hundreds of teachers have expressed concern and many are not returning to class, public health director Horacio Arruda said the government is striking a balance between children's need to learn and socialize, and the risk, which the government deems minimal if a two-metre distance is observed. If cases increase, the government could mandate masks, he said.
Teachers have argued it will be impossible to maintain spacing in classes of 38 children with small rooms.
Dubé stressed it was crucial to contain spread of the disease so regular surgeries can be carried out. "We must do this for the people who are sick, and not just those who have COVID. I'm thinking of people who have cancer."
"The virus is still present," Dubé said. "I distinguish between a small fire and a forest fire. ... Every time there is wind, the small fire can become a forest fire. If people are not careful, there could be so many small fires that it becomes a forest fire."

12:15 p.m. Young people make up nearly 50 per cent of cases: Tam
Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam reported young people under 40 account for 46 per cent of all new cases of COVID-19 in the country.
The 20 to 29-year-old age group is particularly over-represented, accounting for 25 per cent of cases nationally, but only 14 per cent of the population.
While most young people will only experience mild symptoms, their infections "build a reservoir of the virus that can spill over, affecting young and old," she said during the federal government's daily press briefing on Tuesday. Tam encouraged all Canadians to do their part to stem the spread of the pandemic.
Nationally, Canada now has 125,647 cases, and 9,083 deaths. More than 48,000 people are being tested daily, on average. About .7 per cent test positive.
An average of 400 people test positive daily, down from the 1,800 positives experienced during the pandemic's peak.
12 p.m. Marguerite-Bourgeoys service centre offers virtual classes
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school service centre (formerly known as a school board) announced it is putting in place a virtual school for students on its territory who have to stay at home during the pandemic for medical reasons.
Classes will be offered for pre-school, elementary and high school students. An educator will be available to guide students. Students must have a medical certificate indicating they cannot attend class.
The virtual school is scheduled to begin Sept. 8.

'We're a bit like the parents': Dubé says government will watch schools closely

Full text: As thousands of teachers return to schools this week, Health Minister Christian Dubé said he's confident the government has a good plan in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
However, Dubé cautioned the situation is fragile, and the government is watching closely to see how it evolves when children go back to class in the next few weeks.
"We're a few days away from back to school," Dubé said Tuesday afternoon at a news conference in Montreal. "I think we're a bit like the parents and we're all anxious to see how it will work out. But on our side, we're confident it will go well."
He said the average of cases in the last seven days amounts to roughly 80 new cases per day, or 10 per million, which he said is an acceptable number for the moment, especially compared to other jurisdictions. The government gets more concerned when the number of cases grows to 160 per day, or 20 per million.
"We need to make sure that Quebecers will follow the rules, because we're doing well right now," Dubé said. "But every day, we still have four, five or six outbreaks, and we have to monitor them closely. We see every day that these bushfires want to expand, and our job is to make sure it doesn't become a forest fire."
Public health director Horacio Arruda was asked at the same news conference about criticism of the government's back-to-school plan. A recent open letter by physicians and scientists who are parents of school-age children was particularly critical of the decision that masks are not required for students while in class.
Arruda said the government's plan was put together with experts and pediatricians, and that he's confident the rules put in place will help limit the spread of the virus.
"We found what we thought is a good balance, limiting the risk while promoting the development of children, which is very important," Arruda said. "I understand some people are concerned, but we are following this very closely, and if we have to tighten the measures, we will adjust."
Dubé played down the fact that more than 400 teachers at the Lester B. Pearson School Board have been given permission to stay home because of a fear of contracting the virus.
"We have 100,000 teachers; you're talking about 400," he said. "We need to prove over the next few days that our measures will work, but we can't do that ourselves. It's teamwork. If you ask me, 'Is it normal that 400 teachers are nervous and are asking questions?', I would say to you it's normal."
Dubé said he's confident that teachers and school administrators will "perform miracles" to ensure that they can put in place measures to limit the spread of the virus.
"Those kids need to be in school; they need socialization," he said. "I'm crossing my fingers for the first week. Then, when it goes by, we'll see what happens and adjust."
Also at Tuesday's news conference, the Legault government confirmed it is dropping the idea of asking Quebecers to download a COVID-19 tracing application on their phones.
But it has not ruled out trying such an app in the future should the pandemic situation worsen.
Quebec's minister of governmental digital transformation, Éric Caire, made the announcement, and said traditional methods of tracing COVID-19 infections, in which health workers track down the contacts of a person who was infected, are adequate.
"Because the pandemic is under control at the moment, we have decided not to go ahead with it," Caire said. "But we are readying the groundwork so we can roll it out quickly if we need it."
Caire said rolling out the app now would be the equivalent of "putting out a brush fire with a water-bomber aircraft."
The government's decision comes despite the fact Quebecers said they were interested in the idea of an app in a recent consultation.
The drive to deploy an app fell apart in early August after experts appeared before a committee of the National Assembly studying the idea.
The experts told the committee - made up of MNAs of all stripes - that there were big questions about the safety, reliability and efficiency of such apps. Nearly all the 18 experts expressed doubts about the technology.

1:20 p.m. Quebec averaging fewer than 80 cases a day: Dubé
Quebec has been averaging fewer than 80 cases a day over the last week, indicating it has the pandemic under control at this point, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said Tuesday at his press briefing in Montreal.
That works out to approximately 10 cases per million inhabitants.
A flattened curve represents 20 cases per million, so Quebec should not go beyond 160 cases a day, Dubé said. Recently, Quebec saw a spike to 180 cases, which was worrisome, but public health was able to contain the outbreaks, he said.
"As long as we keep cases to 20 per 1 million, we can continue life as we know it now. It's not perfect, but it's manageable," Dubé said.
Quebec registered 62 new cases on Tuesday.
MNA Éric Caire confirmed that Quebec will not be using a smartphone tracing app to try and limit the coronavirus at this point, because experts had many reservations about the efficacy of the programs out there.
Dubé stressed that it was crucial to contain spread of the disease, so that regular surgeries can be carried out. "We must do this for the people who are sick, and not just those who have COVID. I'm thinking of people who have cancer."
He also urged people to think about health employees.
"At the end of the day its our health professionals that can be impacted - we have to remember them."
"The virus is still present," Dubeé said "I distinguish between a small fire and a forest fire. ... Every time there is wind, the small fire can become a forest fire. If people are not careful, there could be so many small fires that it becomes a forest fire."
Quebec has increased the budget in order to support its medical teams tackling the pandemic, he said, and public health is working diligently to quickly control any outbreaks.
More details to come
12:15 p.m. Young people make up nearly 50 per cent of cases: Tam
Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam reported young people under 40 account for 46 per cent of all new cases of COVID-19 in the country.
The 20 to 29-year-old age group is particularly over-represented, accounting for 25 per cent of cases nationally, but only 14 per cent of the population.
While most young people will only experience mild symptoms, their infections "build a reservoir of the virus that can spill over, affecting young and old," she said during the federal government's daily press briefing on Tuesday. Tam encouraged all Canadians to do their part to stem the spread of the pandemic.
Nationally, Canada now has 125,647 cases, and 9,083 deaths. More than 48,000 people are being tested daily, on average. About .7 per cent test positive.
An average of 400 people test positive daily, down from the 1,800 positives experienced during the pandemic's peak.
12 p.m. Marguerite-Bourgeoys service centre offers virtual classes
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school service centre (formerly known as a school board) announced it is putting in place a virtual school for students on its territory who have to stay at home during the pandemic for medical reasons.
Classes will be offered for pre-school, elementary and high school students. An educator will be available to guide students. Students must have a medical certificate indicating they cannot attend class.
The virtual school is scheduled to begin Sept. 8.

Cyclists love new Terrebonne St. bike path, but some locals are wary

Full text: Since city crews installed bike paths on either side of Terrebonne St. a month ago, Annie O. and her two children have been riding their bikes eagerly every day along the east-west artery.
"It's much safer," said the 44-year-old Notre-Dame-de-Grâce resident, as she stopped her bike Saturday to wait for the red light on Terrebonne at Draper Ave. "I feel more confident riding with my 11-year-old and 8-year-old."
Two minutes later, Priyanka Vemuri came to a stop on her bike at the same corner. "I'm not a car driver, so I think it's a very good idea," she said.
Eliminating residential parking on either side of Terrebonne St. is the latest effort by Projet Montréal to transform the metropolis into a bike-friendly oasis. Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough mayor Sue Montgomery, who is no longer a member of Projet Montréal, supports the initiative.
The first phase involved painting street lines and installing green plastic posts along Terrebonne from Girouard Ave. in the east to Madison Ave. in the west. The borough intends to extend the bike paths to the end of Terrebonne at Belmore Ave., Montgomery's spokesperson, Annalisa Harris, told the Montreal Gazette.
Politicians, activists and school board officials have had their say about the project. People have been debating on social media.
But what about cyclists, motorists and residents who live on the leafy street? In some cases, a cyclist is also a motorist who lives on Terrebonne. One of them is a 74-year-old retired actor and devoted enthusiast of the handcrafted, high-end Cannondale bike.
"I love it," the Terrebonne resident said of the bike paths. "What I've noticed is that they slow down the traffic, which is a good thing."
However, he acknowledged some residents are "pissed off."
"For people who depend on the parking, it's not a good thing," he admitted. "In my case, that's not a problem because I have a driveway."
The longtime N.D.G. resident declined to provide his name to a reporter. Other cyclists were also reluctant to give their names.
Across the street, 54-year-old Colin Parsons was sitting on the steps of a duplex overseeing his garage sale of old albums and CDs. Business was slow on a lazy summer afternoon.
Parsons, who moved to the upper level of the duplex recently, said he's not against bike paths, but he accused the borough administration of imposing the project on the neighbourhood without adequate consultation.
"I don't like having to park around the corner," he said. "I'm all for the environment, but a bike path is like using a squirt gun in a forest fire. The real problem are the pipelines."
Parsons warned when the junior campus of Willingdon Elementary School reopens on Aug. 31, finding parking will prove impossible, and motorists will be jockeying for spots on narrow side streets.
The bike paths will stay on Terrebonne until October, when work crews will remove the green posts for winter. For Parsons, October couldn't come soon enough.

Full text: Good afternoon,and welcome to Globe Climate, a newsletter about climate change, environment and resources in Canada.
Earlier this year, federal scientistssaid that a majorityof forests in Canada face a higher-than-normal wildfire risk this summer, especially in the West.
This week,Canada announced it is investing $5-million tocreate a national wildfire research network, years after the Canadian Forest Service warned that wildfire expertise and research was not keeping up with dramatic shifts associated with climate change.
We know that warmer weather causes multiple increases to risk of fire, including drier forests and more lightning.
We're learningfrom a study by University of British Columbia that there are immediate, harmful health effects of wildfire smoke and researchers say thesmoke has the potential to makeviral respiratory infections such as COVID-19 even more severe.
Now, let's catch you up on other news.
Noteworthy reporting this week:
A deeper dive
Architects of Obama's green strategy have some lessons for Canada
Adam Radwanski is The Globe's climate change columnist and feature writer. For this week's deeper dive he talks about a piece he wrote after speaking with key architects of Obama's Recovery Act.
Amid all the recent talk of Justin Trudeau's government considering using coming recovery spending to fight climate change, which I've been covering along with others at The Globe, I thought it might be useful to reach out to some of the people who helped design Barack Obama's green-stimulus spending back in the last global economic crisis.
For one thing, that U.S.$90-billion component of Mr. Obama's 2009 Recovery Act stood as the Western world's biggest effort to use stimulus to achieve long-term emissions reductions, heading into the current situation.
For another, Canada's federal government mostly eschewed a climate focus in its great recession stimulus under Stephen Harper, so it seems like a good idea to learn from others' experiences now that we have a Prime Minister more inclined to go that route.
But I was especially curious to hear from the Obama folks because I was thinking (and writing) recently about the risk-reward calculus for governments using public dollars to place clean-tech bets that may or may not pay out. And I wanted to know what they took away from the experience of working on a stimulus program that arguably achieved its intended goals overall, but was vilified for an infamous failure in the form of the failed solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra's US$528-million default on a government-backed loan.
I wound up speaking with a couple of the key architects of Mr. Obama's plan, Carol Browner and Joseph Aldy, as well as the President's director of legislative affairs at the time. And I got their surprising case for why they wish they'd taken more risks like the Solyndra one - along with other lessons they think Canada and other countries going down this path should currently be heeding.

Opinion and analysis
The Norway maple is a bully, and shouldn't be confused with the sugar maple tree
Peter Kuitenbrouwer: "Pleasejust stop using Norwaymaples as a symbol of Canada. That ecological bully does not represent the best part of our nature."
Canada's recovery plans should focus on building the infrastructure of the future
Grant Bishop: "If confronting climate change is themoonshot of our time, this can be the Apollo program for a generation of engineers and scientists."
Here's what readers had to say
Readers had plenty to say about last week's deep dive story on Carbon capture and storage . We've selected a few comments on the piece to share.
Brian Burkes:"Keep developing new ways to create energy that are green. At the same time, keep making fossil fuels cleaner and safer - like CO2 capture. Why else would the Gates Foundation invest in carbon capture, if they didn't think it could be apart of the solution? … Simply shutting off oil and gas is not a viable solution, no matter how many times people repeat it."
Mr. Yellin:"Like hydrogen, this may just be a small part of the reduction in GHGs."
Buggsy2u:"Time to forget the corporate dreamers and dream of CCS and move on quickly with realities of an appropriate carbon tax and renewable energy for a next big leap in productivity with health and quality of life improvements of all living things on planet Earth."
Trickrisco:"Nobody mentioned embodied C02, the emissions required to build/maintain these machines. (Production of steel, aluminum, transportation, etc. etc.) . Did anyone crunch the numbers? When embodied emissions are considered, chances are CCS devices are net emitters of C02, or at least vastly more inefficient than claimed."
Making waves
Each week The Globe will profile a young person making a difference in Canada. This week we're highlighting the work of Albert Lalonde doing climate justice activism.
My name is Albert Lalonde and I'm an 18-year-old climate justice activist from Montreal and a member of la CEVES, a coalition that unites local youth climate activists from high schools, colleges and universities across so-called Quebec. We are behind numerous climate protests and initiatives across the province, including the Sept. 27, 2019 protest in Montreal that was attended by over 500,000 people. It is very clear for us that it's not a matter of not being heard any more, we have to force change and we have no other choice but to make it happen. Cynicism is a luxury my generation simply cannot afford. Apart from organizing protests, in order to secure myself, my family and my friends a healthy, safe and just future, I shamefully need to sue my own government in order to seek proper protection as part of the La Rose v. HMTQ youth climate litigation.

Full text: An improperly extinguished campfire is the likely cause behind a major forest fire in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region that remains out of control, Quebec's forestry minister told a news briefing on Sunday.
"This photo is possibly where fire started," Pierre Dufour told reporters in Roberval, holding up a photo of a campfire surrounded by charred land.
"In this case, it wasn't someone with a chalet, it was someone in a boat who'd probably stopped to camp with a tent and lit a fire that wasn't properly extinguished."
Dufour said it serves as an example why citizens need to heed authorities when they ask open fires not be lit - given the enormous amount of damage it can cause.
An open fire ban was renewed in regions across the province on Friday ahead of the St-Jean Baptiste holiday coming up next week.
Dufour and Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, who is the minister responsible for the region, toured the area by helicopter on Sunday.
Laforest called the intense hot spell unprecedented for the region, but said she was hopeful that rain forecast would assist firefighters.
The aggressive forest fire was on the move Sunday, but efforts by firefighters on the ground and a change in winds towards the north means a Hydro-Quebec power plant in the area would be spared.
The fire, which started in Chutes-des-Passes, 160 kilometres north of Saguenay, has grown steadily, ravaging an area of 62,396 hectares on Sunday, double the size compared to Friday.
Authorities set up 10 road blocks, closing off an area of 100 kilometres by 80 kilometres, and urged anyone in the sparsely populated area to leave.
The fire is the largest of 18 forest fires in the province as of Sunday. Their impact was felt as far away as Montreal, where Environment Canada issued a smog warning Sunday afternoon because of a peat fire in the Kamouraska area. Smog particularly affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease.
"The biggest concern with this fire, as usually is with out-of-control fires, is the weather," said Mélanie Morin, a spokesperson for SOPFEU, the agency that oversees forest fire prevention in the province. "This fire started Tuesday and has consistently grown day after day despite our suppression efforts."
Her organization has made several targeted strikes to protect strategic points like bridges, certain outfitters and the Péribonka IV hydroelectric station. The flames were only 1.2 kilometres from the station on Sunday morning.
Morin said they are patrolling the area, doing strategic attacks and have set up a sprinkler system near the installation.
Maxence Huard-Lefebvre, a spokesman for Hydro-Québec, said they are monitoring the situation closely, but there is no concern for any community being impacted by a power outage. Huard-Lefebvre added the installation is well protected against fire, built into the rock and partially underground.
Péribonka is dormant as a preventative measure but it's one of more than 60 stations that are linked as part of an interconnected network.
About 100 employees of SOPFEU, and about 60 forest firefighters are battling the blaze with another 18 reinforcements ready, and about 200 more arriving on Monday, said Josée Poitras, another SOPFEU spokesperson.

"There are many chalets in the area and the two affected regional county municipalities, Maria-Chapdelaine and the Fjord-du-Saguenay, have been scrambling since the start of this fire to reach the owners of these chalets," said Poitras.
"There are chalets that have burned down. Fortunately, there are no casualties and no one has been trapped by the fire."
Another fire in a bog near Rivière-Ouelle, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, forced the evacuation of nearby homes after winds created a smoky haze.
Municipal firefighters responded along with SOPFEU teams to that fire, which covered about 326 hectares on Saturday.
The provincial agency reports 450 fires this year - double the average of 228 by this time of year over the past decade.
Lightning strikes are considered the source of only three blazes - the vast majority have been caused by people.

Full text: A major forest fire is in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region continued to spread this weekend, with authorities sealing off roads and urging anyone in the sparsely populated area to leave.
The blaze covered 62,396 hectares on Sunday, double the size compared to Friday. It is the largest of 20 forest fires in the province as of Sunday, an increase of seven from the day before.
The fires' impact were felt as far away as Montreal, where Environment Canada issued a smog warning Sunday afternoon.
"High concentrations of fine particulates are expected and will result in poor air quality," said the warning, which said that poor air quality from a peat fire in the Kamouraska area would persist until late in the day. Smog particularly affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease, who should avoid intense physical activity, Environment Canada warned.
"The biggest concern with this fire, as usually is with out-of-control fires, is the weather," said Mélanie Morin, a spokesperson for SOPFEU, the agency that oversees forest fire prevention in the province.

Péribonka is dormant as a preventative measure but it's one of more than 60 stations that are linked as part of an interconnected network.
The fierce Lac-St-Jean fire is one of at least 12 current blazes in Quebec - but the only one considered out of control.
The fire started north of Dolbeau-Mistassini, in an area known as Chutes-des-Passes, first heading east for a few days before winds shifted the fire south towards Péribonka.
About 100 employees of the forest fire agency, known as SOPFEU, and about 60 forest firefighters are battling the blaze with another 18 reinforcements ready, and about 200 more arriving on Monday, said Josée Poitras, another SOPFEU spokesperson.

Planes and helicopters are being used to combat the blaze, with temperatures expected to feel like 40 C in the area, further complicating the work of firefighters on the ground.
It's too early to say what damage has been done as fires sometime miss pockets of area.
"There are many chalets in the area and the two affected regional county municipalities, Maria-Chapdelaine and the Fjord-du-Saguenay, have been scrambling since the start of this fire to reach the owners of these chalets," said Josee Poitras, another SOPFEU spokeswoman.
"There are chalets that have burned down. Fortunately, there are no casualties and no one has been trapped by the fire."
Quebec's Department of Forestry and Lands has closed an area of 100 kilometres by 80 kilometres, setting up 10 road blocks.
Premier François Legault said he was concerned about the situation in both regions and said the priority was to keep citizens out of harm's way.
"Our priority: the safety of Quebecers in nearby areas," Legault tweeted Friday night.

Environment Canada meteorologist Alain Roberge said that warm, dry weather was likely to persist. Despite rain in the forecast for Saturday, it may not be enough to help firefighters in the area.
"The worst part is that when the first showers arrive, they are often accompanied by thunderstorms," Roberge said. "So even if the rain is there, lightning storms can create new fires."
The fires are creating heavy smog in some parts of the province.
A fire in a bog near Rivière-Ouelle, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, forced the evacuation of nearby homes after winds created a smoky haze.
Municipal firefighters responded along with SOPFEU teams to that fire, which covered about 250 hectares on Saturday.
The provincial agency reports 444 fires this year - double the annual average on this date over the past decade.
Lightning strikes are considered the source of only three blazes - the vast majority have been caused by people.
An open fire ban was renewed in several Quebec regions on Friday.

Environment Canada meteorologist Alain Roberge said that warm, dry weather was likely to persist. Despite rain in the forecast for Saturday, it may not be enough to help firefighters in the area.
"The worst part is that when the first showers arrive, they are often accompanied by thunderstorms," Roberge said. "So even if the rain is there, lightning storms can create new fires."
The fires are creating heavy smog in some parts of the province.
A fire in a bog near Rivière-Ouelle, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, forced the evacuation of nearby homes after winds created a smoky haze.
Municipal firefighters responded along with SOPFEU teams to that fire, covering about 15 hectares.
The provincial agency reports 435 fires this year - double the annual average on this date over the past decade.
Lightning strikes are considered the source of only three blazes - the vast majority have been caused by people.
An open fire ban was renewed in several Quebec regions on Friday.

Full text: A major forest fire is in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region continued to spread Saturday, with authorities sealing off roads and urging anyone in the sparsely populated area to leave.
Its impact was felt as far away as Montreal, where Environment Canada issued a smog warning Sunday afternoon.
"High concentrations of fine particulates are expected and will result in poor air quality," said the warning, which said that poor air quality from a peat fire in the Kamouraska area would persist until late in the day. Smog particularly affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease, who should avoid intense physical activity, Environment Canada warned.
Mélanie Morin, a spokeswoman for SOPFEU, the agency that oversees forest fire prevention in the province, said the area covered by the aggressive blaze stood at 58,489 hectares - nearly double the size compared to Friday.
"The biggest concern with this fire, as usually is with out-of-control fires, is the weather," Morin said Saturday. "This fire started Tuesday and has consistently grown day after day despite our suppression efforts."
Her organization has made several targeted strikes to protect strategic points like bridges, certain outfitters and the Peribonka IV hydroelectric station.
Morin said they are patrolling the area, doing strategic attacks and have set up a sprinkler system near the installation.
Maxence Huard-Lefebvre, a spokesman for Hydro-Québec, said there's a one-kilometre buffer of untouched forest between the fire and the station.
Huard-Lefebvre said they are monitoring the situation closely, but there is no concern for any community being impacted by a power outage.
Peribonka is dormant as a preventative measure but it's one of more than 60 stations that are linked as part of an interconnected network.
The fierce Lac-St-Jean fire is one of at least 12 current blazes in Quebec - but the only one considered out of control.
The fire started north of Dolbeau-Mistassini, in an area known as Chutes-des-Passes, first heading east for a few days before winds shifted the fire south towards Peribonka.
About 100 employees of the forest fire agency, known as SOPFEU, and 49 forest firefighters are battling the blaze with a call for reinforcements from across the province.

Planes and helicopters are being used to combat the blaze, with temperatures expected to feel like 40 C in the area, further complicating the work of firefighters on the ground.
The area in the northern boreal forest has a large number of fishing camps, shacks and chalets.
It's too early to say what damage has been done as fires sometime miss pockets of area.
"There are many chalets in the area and the two affected regional county municipalities, Maria-Chapdelaine and the Fjord-du-Saguenay, have been scrambling since the start of this fire to reach the owners of these chalets," said Josee Poitras, another SOPFEU spokeswoman.
"There are chalets that have burned down. Fortunately, there are no casualties and no one has been trapped by the fire."
Quebec's Department of Forestry and Lands has closed the area.
Premier François Legault said he was concerned about the situation in both regions and said the priority was to keep citizens out of harm's way.
"Our priority: the safety of Quebecers in nearby areas," Legault tweeted Friday night.

Full text: Good morning and welcome to the Saturday-before-Fête-St-Jean edition of While You Were Sleeping.
Property purchased and lost - Quebec land deals gone very, very bad: The letter that Rosemary Lafrenière received in the mail in 2017 read like a bad joke. "We are pleased to inform you that the city of Montreal wants to be owner of two pieces of land show (sic) on the plan," the two-sentence missive from Montreal's real estate transaction division said. The next sentence invited her to sign a document that was attached and return it by post or email. The two pieces were vacant lots that Lafrenière had bought at public auction in 1986 with the hope of making a few bucks on resale down the road. Her parcels covered a bit more than an acre inside a 25-acre field in Pointe-aux-Trembles. So how much was the city offering Lafrenière to acquire her lots 30 years later? Nothing.

Out-of-control fire the size of 40,000 football fields is burning in Quebec: Wind and unabating heat have whipped a forest fire into an inferno north of Lac-Saint-Jean, unleashing pillars of smoke visible from space. SOPFEU, the provincial forest fire authority, declared earlier this week that the fire was "out of control." Dry weather and gusting winds on Thursday accelerated the blaze. It grew from 4,000 hectares that day to over 21,000 on Friday - about the size of 40,000 football fields.
Erin O'Toole camp seeks police probe, accuses MacKay camp of theft: Conservative leadership candidate Erin O'Toole's campaign says it has filed a formal complaint with police seeking an investigation of his rival Peter MacKay's organization. In a release late Friday, O'Toole's campaign says the complaint involves the theft of confidential campaign and strategy data.
Via Rail to require passengers to wear face masks as of Tuesday: Via Rail says passengers will be required to wear masks as of Tuesday to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 when physical distancing can't be maintained. The Montreal-based passenger rail service says it is making the change as ridership increases with the gradual reopening of the economy. The policy is in line with Transport Canada guidelines for wearing face coverings for planes, trains, ships and public transit. Masks are mandatory for employees who interact with customers. Masks must be worn throughout trips, except for when eating or drinking and when physical distancing is not possible in stations and at boarding. Via Rail says it will have a limited number of disposable masks available for passengers who don't have one at boarding.
Cineplex will not require moviegoers to wear masks: Despite at least one major U.S. theatre operator doing an about-face after a public outcry over its plan to open with a mask-optional policy, Cineplex is saying it will not make masks mandatory. The theatre chain announced its plans June 15 to begin opening cinemas, detailing reserved seating and social distancing requirements for staff and patrons, but made no reference to face coverings. In a statement to The Hollywood reporter on Friday, it said, "Taking the lead from public health authorities and provincial guidelines, we are not requiring guests to wear masks, but they are welcome to do so if they wish."

Full text: Editor's note: Today is the 20th anniversary of Maurice (Rocket) Richard's death on May 27, 2000, at age 74. To mark the occasion we are republishing the Canadiens icon's obituary, which was written by another hockey legend, Gazette sports columnist Red Fisher, who died on Jan. 19, 2018, at age 91.
Maurice (Rocket) Richard stood in this hockey cathedral, tears streaming down his face as the noise grew and grew, minute after minute for 10, 11 minutes, until there was no longer just noise in the Montreal Forum, but thunder engulfing it. Now and then, he would raise an arm - often both arms - pleading to the people, his people.
"Enough," he seemed to be saying to them on this Monday night of March 11, 1996, the night the building's lights would go dark forever. "Enough - I was only a hockey player."
Richard died yesterday in Hotel Dieu Hospital at age 78 after a battle of more than two years with abdominal cancer.
He was also a victim of Parkinson's disease.
Despite his protestations, Richard was much more than a hockey player.
He was the first National Hockey League player to score 50 goals in a 50-game season among his 544 in 978 regular-season games.
Richard was also the most intense athlete this game, this city, this province, this country ever has seen. He was everything that personified greatness. It was in this place - the Montreal Forum - where he was to become an icon, a legend.
He was, in every way, one of a kind.
As related by Chrys Goyens and Allan Turowetz in their book Lions In Winter, "Born Aug. 4, 1921, Maurice was the eldest son of Onesime and Alice Richard, who were part of the postwar exodus to the cities by young francophones all over Quebec.
"Onesime and Alice left their native Gaspe and settled in Montreal, where he went to work as a carpenter for Canadian Pacific Ltd.
"After a short time spent at the Plateau Mont Royal area, they moved to the isolated Nouveau Bordeaux district, in the north end of the city and across Rivieres des Prairies from what is now Laval.
"It was on that river, and in the schoolyards of the Bois de Boulogne and Laval that Maurice Richard developed his formidable talents."
The Rocket's best years already were behind him when I started covering the Canadiens at the start of the 1955-56 season. By then, after 13 NHL seasons, he had lost a step. He carried weight he found increasingly difficult to lose. But now and then in his last five seasons, he was once again the Rocket. On those nights, there was no finer sight anywhere this game of his life was played.
Richard's eye-snapping career numbers don't begin to describe what he meant to hockey in general and the Canadiens in particular. Winning at any cost was what he was all about. He was prepared to pay the price for every goal he scored, and no price was too high. He scored important goals, lifting spectators out of their seats everywhere in the six-team NHL, because he was as much the Rocket on the road as he was in Montreal. At any moment, anywhere, he could erupt with another big goal.
There was the night of March 23, 1944, when the Canadiens played host to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second game of their best-of-seven Stanley Cup semifinal. The Richard who was to explode into full flower the following season - when he became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in 50 games - had shown what he was all about that year. He had scored 23 of his 32 regular-season goals in his last 22 games. (A dislocated shoulder sidelined Richard for four games of the Canadiens' stunning 38-5-7 season, including a 22-0-3 home record.)
He would be getting special attention from the Toronto Maple Leafs on this March night, particularly since the Leafs had upset the Canadiens 3-1 in Game 1 two nights earlier. The Leafs' best defensive forward, Bob Davidson, drew the assignment. His instructions: Go everywhere Richard goes. Don't let him out of your sight.
Richard couldn't shake loose from Davidson's clutch-and-grab tactics in the first period. Everywhere the Rocket went, Davidson followed, but Richard left the Leafs reeling with three goals in the second period. He added two in the third in what was to become the greatest individual performance in NHL playoff history. Maurice Richard 5, Toronto 1.
Until that night, no other NHL player had scored five goals in a playoff game. The Canadiens eliminated the Leafs with victories in the next three games and then swept the Chicago Blackhawks in four. He was to score 12 goals in nine playoff games that season, the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup in 13 seasons, and the marvellous legend of Maurice Richard was born.
"He was a wartime hockey player," one-time Canadiens general manager Frank Selke once told a reporter.
"When the boys come back, they said, they'll look after Maurice. Nobody looked after Maurice. He looked after himself. When the boys come back, they said, they'll catch up with him. The only thing that caught up with Maurice is time."
"When he's worked up," said Selke, "his eyes gleam like headlights. Not a glow, but a piercing intensity. Goalies have said he's like a motor car coming on you at night. He is terrifying. He is the greatest hockey player that ever lived. I can contradict myself by saying that 10 or 15 do the mechanics of play better. But it's results that count. Others play well, build up, eventually get a goal. He is like a flash of lightning. It's a fine summer day, suddenly -"
"I first saw him in 1942," Ken Reardon, a former teammate who went on to become a Canadiens vice-president, told an interviewer. "I was playing for an army team. I see this guy skating at me with wild, bloody hair, the way he had it then, eyes just outside the nuthouse. 'I'll take this guy,' I said to myself. He went around me like a hoop around a barrel.
"'Who's that?' I asked after the game.
"'That's Maurice Richard,' the guy said. 'He's a pretty good hockey player.'
"'Yes,' I said, 'he is.' "
Maurice Richard on the night he received ovation on March 11, 1996, when the Forum closed.
The Richard legend wasn't supposed to develop as quickly as it did. The fact is, some hockey people felt it would never happen. His bones were as brittle as peppermint sticks, some people said. Injury-prone, they muttered. The problems started when he was invited to the Canadiens Seniors' training camp in 1940. He made the team, scored two goals in the first regular-season game, then caught his skate in a rut in the third period. His ankle snapped, and Richard missed the rest of the season.
The following year, he played well for the first 20 games, suffered a broken wrist in his 21st, missed the rest of the regular season, but returned to score six goals in four playoff games. The 1942-43 season was his first with the NHL Canadiens: this time he fractured his right ankle. Three major injuries in three years. Maybe, just maybe, his critics were right. Maybe he was indeed too brittle to play in the NHL.
The Stanley Cup year erased those fears, followed by his stunning 50-in-50 season. Three days after Christmas, Richard scored five goals and assisted on three others in a 9-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings. Remarkably, he scored 43 goals in his first 38 games, and in Toronto the following week he tied Joe Malone's record of 44 goals in a 22-game season.
A week later, the same teams were at the Forum, and nobody needed a road map to understand that the Maple Leafs, as a group, were prepared to do anything to prevent Richard from scoring his 45th. With nine games remaining in the season, Richard, as long as he remained healthy, was certain to eclipse Malone's record. The Leafs had no problem with that - as long as the goal wasn't scored against them.
It's why Richard once again had Toronto players following his every move. Davidson was on him. Nick Metz stayed close to him. Often, the team of Davidson and Metz would be all over him. Midway through the third period, with Richard still looking for his 45th, he shook off two Toronto defenders and swept in on Frank McCool. The sellout crowd of 14,000 held its breath, poised to erupt, but the Toronto goaltender stopped him. Then, with roughly four minutes remaining in the game, linemate Toe Blake caught Richard with a pass and, in one motion, he one-timed it at McCool. Goal!
Reports of the record-setting goal mention that the wild celebrations that followed held up the game for 15 minutes. Richard could do that to his people - over and over again.
Eight games remained in the season, so now the question was: Could he reach the magic 50? If so, when? If not, why not?
Richard was only one goal shy of the 50-goal mark - once thought to be unreachable - when the Canadiens played their final home game, No. 49 in the 50-game schedule. By now, his pursuit of the magic 50th had everyone following his every move on every shift.
Wouldn't you know it: late in the game against Chicago, he was awarded a penalty shot. Can you imagine the noise in the Forum when he moved in alone for the shot that would be heard around the world? Imagine also, then, the crowd's terrible anguish, the buzz of dismay, when a Chicago goaltender with marginal talent, Doug Stevenson, stopped the mighty Rocket. (Stevenson, a career minor leaguer, played only a total of eight NHL games with the Rangers and Chicago.)
The Canadiens travelled to Boston for the season's final regular-season game. The Bruins were leading the Canadiens 2-1 with fewer than three minutes remaining in the game. Dutch Hiller had scored the only Canadiens goal 8:24 into the second period, but now all of the attention was on Richard.
Time was running out, and so was the Rocket's attempt to score his 50th. Even the Boston crowd was on its feet when Richard came on the ice for what could have been his last shift of the regular season, his last chance to score the goal. Seconds later, centreman Elmer Lach collided with Boston goaltender Harvey Bennett, leaving Richard with what amounted to an empty net for the milestone goal.
Less than a minute later, Richard earned the assist on Toe Blake's winning goal. Eighteen seconds beyond that, Lach added a fourth.
Richard's 50-in-50 season was remarkable in many ways. He failed to score in only 16 games. At no time did he go more than two games without scoring.
His best streak was during a nine-game stretch between Jan. 20 and Feb. 10 when he scored 14 goals. His worst came in the last 13 games of the season, when he scored only seven. He didn't stop with his 50-goal regular season, adding six while the Canadiens were being upset in six games by the Maple Leafs in the Stanley Cup semifinal.
Fifty-six goals in 56 games - his place in Canadiens history and in the hearts and minds of his people was now assured.
It has been suggested, and there's a valid argument for it, that Richard's passion for winning was the start of the French-English "thing" in Quebec.
If he had been "only a hockey player," his suspension for the final week of the 1954-55 regular season and the playoffs after getting involved in a savage stick-swinging duel with Boston defenceman Hal Laycoe would have been little more than a hiccup in NHL history and, by extension, Quebec's.
Instead, it fanned the flames of a cultural revolution that went far, far beyond Richard the player.
He meant everything to his people, on and off the ice. When he and the Canadiens won, they won. When the Canadiens lost, they lost. When the perception was that he was treated harshly by constituted authority, it was his people who felt the pain and the anger.
Has it really been more than 45 years since that St. Patrick's Day morning in 1955? There was a hint of snow in the air, but nobody in Montreal was thinking about the weather on this day. The Detroit Red Wings were in the city, but the Canadiens would be playing without Richard. His people were in a foul mood.
There was trouble ahead.
You could sense it, breathe in the sour smell of it.
"Go to the Forum," I was told by my sports editor at the Montreal Star. "Just hang around. See what's happening. See if Richard is there. Talk to Howe. Find out what he thinks about this business."
"This business" was a city poised to explode because hockey's most electrifying player had been suspended for the last three games of the regular season and the entire playoffs.
Thousands of people jammed the sidewalks as Maurice Richard's funeral cortage passed on Ste-Catherine St. in downtown Montreal.
Richard had been in trouble with NHL president Clarence Campbell that season, once for referring to the president as a "dictator" in an article ghostwritten for him in a French-language newspaper, another time for butt-ending Toronto rookie Bob Bailey in the face.
Worse, Richard repeatedly tried to renew his attack on Bailey and refused to leave the ice when ordered by the referee. Now there had been the ugly, stick-swinging incident in Boston with Laycoe. There was also the matter of Richard striking linesman Cliff Thompson in his attempt to get at Laycoe.
The Canadiens and Bruins were fierce and unforgiving rivals in the six-team league. Bench-clearings were the rule, rather than the exception, because when teams met 14 times during the regular season grudges carried on from one game to another.
Richard had been the best - and fiercest - of hockey's superstars for a decade. Every opponent wanted a piece of him and he of them from the moment he became the first player to score 50 in a 50-game season. Ten years later, the regular-season schedule had increased to 70 games, and while Richard no longer was the goal-scorer he had been, his dedication to winning remained. The fire in him still burned.
The incident that led to Richard's suspension had happened the previous Sunday. Laycoe, who was generally regarded as a mild-mannered player, had struck Richard on the side of the head with his stick. Richard responded by high-sticking Laycoe on the shoulder and face. When Richard's stick was taken from him, he grabbed another and struck Laycoe twice on the back. Linesman Thompson, who was trying to restrain Richard, was struck in the face.
Three days later and the day before this Canadiens-Red Wings game in Montreal, NHL president Campbell brought down the decision that shook the hockey establishment in general and Canadiens fans in particular
Richard, poised to win his first scoring title, was suspended for the remaining three games of the regular season. He was also suspended for the playoffs. Gone was his opportunity to win his first scoring title. Also gone were the Canadiens' playoffs hopes.
Campbell, who had been urged not to attend the game by Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau, had arrived at his Forum seat several rows above ice level roughly halfway through the first period. By that time, the Red Wings led 2-0.
The moment Campbell was spotted in his seat, there were angry cries and threats from groups of fans. Eggs and tomatoes were thrown at the president.
At period's end, a fan walked up several steps toward Campbell, offering to shake hands. When Campbell reached for his hand, he was slapped in the face. Seconds later, a decision was made to forfeit the game to the visitors.
Even today, people remain bitter over the suspension that quickly developed into hockey's worst case of violence off the ice. In a matter of minutes, there was an outpouring of looting and burning. Cars were overturned. A mob of thousands shattered windows along Ste. Catherine St. Thirty-seven adults and four juveniles were arrested.
The wonder of it, though, was that nobody was killed on that black night, which was to become known as the Richard Riot. The next day, a visibly shaken Richard, who had attended the game, sat behind a forest of microphones, pleading with the people, his people, to exercise calm.
What made Richard the icon he was to become was the way he scored his goals. From the blue line in, there was nobody as fierce or intense.
It was the passion within him each time he swooped in on an opposing goaltender, often with another player, or players, clinging to his back. It was in his arms and in the barrel of his chest. It was in his eyes.
Big goals were all he was about. Playoff goals - 82 in 133 post-season games, a record that was to stand for more than two decades. Remarkably, after all these years, his six overtime goals remain a playoff record. His seven three-or-more-goal games in the post-season are behind only Wayne Gretzky's NHL-high 10. And even Gretzky was unable to match the five goals Richard scored in his 5-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Big goals: none bigger than the one he scored against the Boston Bruins in the seventh game of their 1952 semifinal.
Early in the second period of this pivotal game at the Forum, Richard was knocked out in a collision with Bruins forward Leo Labine. In the clinic, six stitches were needed to close a gash over his eye. The medical staff felt he was through for the night, but after spending the rest of the period and most of the third in the clinic, there he was sitting alongside linemate Lach on the bench. The score was 1-1. Four minutes remained in regulation time when Richard returned to the ice with Lach and Bert Olmstead.
Defenceman Butch Bouchard started the play that would become, to some people, the Rocket's greatest goal. Richard took the pass deep in the Canadiens zone, skated the length of the ice, wheeled around defenceman Bill Quackenbush, swept in on goaltender Sugar Jim Henry - and goal!
This hockey player, this icon, this remarkable athlete, had added yet another chapter to his legendary career. He had battled through a concussion to win yet another series for the Canadiens.
The next day, newspapers across the country carried a memorable photograph of Richard, blood pouring from his left eye, and Henry - his right eye blackened after being struck with a puck in Game 6 of the series - shaking hands.
The Canadiens were to become hockey's greatest dynasty - five consecutive Stanley Cups - during the first five seasons I covered the team with Richard as its captain.
By that time, the Richard flame didn't burn as brightly as it had during previous years. Injuries and the calendar had cut into his brilliance, although not into his dedication to winning.
The Canadiens were a close-knit family during those years. They would travel and, at times, party in a pack - but too often without the Rocket, their captain, among them. In those days, the team would play a Sunday night game in Detroit, then board a midnight train to Toronto where a Wednesday night game awaited them. In Toronto, at least a dozen, perhaps 15 players would get together during the day, but almost always without Richard. Nobody asked why. He was Maurice Richard; he danced to his own tune.
On Tuesday, it was back to the rink for a long practice because there was a game to be played the next night. The players had had their fun on Monday, Tuesday was a workday and Richard was there, practicing hard because there was a game to be won Wednesday.
Even then, there was a special aura about him. There was only one Rocket.
It's why in early July 1975, almost 15 years after Richard's retirement, Rick Salutin sat with me outside Banff, Alta., talking about the Canadiens, in general, and the franchise's brightest star in particular. Salutin was there because he had been commissioned to write a play about Les Canadiens.
"Tell me," he said, "about the Canadiens. What do they mean to the people of Quebec?"
I told Salutin that if you fight but don't win the real battle against those who are perceived to be the real rulers, you try to win elsewhere in a forum where you are successful. In other words, on the ice with the Canadiens.

Later, in an introduction to his play, which was first performed at the Centaur Theatre in February 1977, he wrote that it was very much the same answer he got at a bar in Quebec City.
"I watched a hockey game on television and marvelled at the frenzied involvement of the fans," he wrote. "I put to my drinking partner this question: 'How come?'
"She said: 'The Canadiens - they're us. Every winter they go south and in the they come home conquerors.' "
If the Canadiens were the conquerors, Richard was their commander-in-chief. He brought to them a tradition of winning that reached remarkable heights.
He wasn't the Richard of old when the Canadiens embarked on the marvellous adventure that would produce five consecutive Stanley Cups from 1956 through 1960, but they were the only five years I would see Richard play. His game had lost some of its shine. What remained, however, was the fire in his eyes, and the intensity. He was still the flag-bearer for a culture, for his people.
Anything less than winning was unacceptable and remained that way until he scored what turned out to be the final goal of his career in the 1960 Stanley Cup final against the Maple Leafs. It was his 34th in the finals.
It was also the only goal he scored in the playoffs that year, one in which the Canadiens allowed only 11 goals in series sweeps over Chicago and Toronto. As it developed, it was to be his last.
He reported to training camp several months later, scored four goals in a morning practice and later in the day, was asked to report to general manager Frank Selke.
I happened to be sitting outside Selke's second-floor office at the Forum when a grim-faced Richard strode in. Thirty minutes later, he stormed out.
"They want me to retire," he snapped.
Selke had pointed out to the 39-year-old Richard that in his last three seasons, injuries had sidelined him for 89 of 210 games. It was time, time for the torch to be passed. That night, a special 30-minute CBC live telecast delivered the news to homes across the country.
Richard's 544 regular-season goals are the most in Canadiens history. He was also this historic franchise's most revered player, but was he the best?
Others could skate faster than Richard. Some could shoot harder a pass better. Nobody, however, approached his intensity. Nobody wanted to win more. Not Gordie Howe, not Gretzky, not Mario Lemieux. Not anybody before his time, or since.
Richard brought the entire package to the arena. He inflamed his people on and off the ice. He stirred their souls like no one else before him or since.
He was, after all, the Rocket.

Full text: In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, I am filled with hope. Because now, more than ever, it's crystal clear: people can change their behaviour, and people want to do the right thing. From the huge sacrifice of self-quarantining, to the front-line workers' dedication, to the global co-operation of governments, the world has truly come together as one, like never before.
If we can do this, we can solve the climate crisis.
COVID-19 proves that we can choose to listen when scientists sound the alarm. We can see a crisis coming and choose to act immediately, introducing sweeping measures, even if they mean that society and the economy will have to adapt.
We can have a global, coordinated response and co-operation from every segment of society.
Currently, climate change is the last thing on most people's minds, but once COVID-19 is over, we will be heading straight into another crisis, and there is a lot we can learn by comparing the two.
If we thought that our societies don't have the money to pay for strong climate policies, or that they are simply not "economically feasible," we now realize this is not the case. With COVID-19, governments everywhere are pouring trillions of dollars into testing, health care, research and aid packages, not to mention that we have accepted a major economic crisis in order to save lives.
Climate action has been delayed for decades to avoid have an impact on the economy, but what has become clear with COVID-19 is that the economy is completely dependent on society and the environment; ignoring a crisis for the sake of the economy is not only immoral, it is also pointless. Just imagine the disaster that dropping COVID-19 safety measures in the midst of this global pandemic would bring. Not only would the death toll be absolutely horrendous, the cost for the economy would also be huge.
And when the climate crisis brings unbearable temperatures, ceaseless forest fires and constant floods, the economy will be as unstable as everything else.
We activists are told over and over that the massive changes we call for are impossible; that people won't be willing to change their lifestyles so drastically. And yet, here we are. The sacrifices made by nearly everyone would have seemed impossible a few months ago.
COVID-19 shows us that we are capable of profound change, but now, unfortunately, it comes with huge costs, both for our personal wellbeing and for the economy.
We need to come together to solve the climate crisis with the same intensity and commitment.
If we do it right, the cost will be far smaller. The difference is that with climate change, instead of a chaotic shutdown, we can have a deliberate movement toward a greener and better society. With plans like the GreenNew Deal, we can transition to a zero-carbon economy quickly while still maintaining, and even improving, everyone's wellbeing.
A time of crisis is also an opportunity for a new beginning, and that is exactly what we need right now. So before we rush to bail out polluting corporations and go back to the way things were, let's think of what we want for the future and take this as an opportunity to start heading in that direction. Finance Minister Bill Morneau's recent announcement that he will be asking for companies' environmental scorecard before offering loans, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement of $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned oil wells, are steps in the right direction. We need more creative solutions to get laid off workers back on the job without trying to revive dying industries like oil and gas again and again.
COVID-19 proves that we are capable of overcoming a crisis; there are no excuses left to keep pushing climate change aside.

Full text: Our lives are very different from what they were a mere few weeks ago. We watch in deep sadness and anxiety as the tally of deaths both here and beyond continues to rise.
Those of us fortunate enough to have avoided the dreaded disease owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroes in our midst. Above all, to all of the health-care community members who risk their lives daily to save those of their stricken fellow-citizens - but also to all those others whose untiring commitment ensures the continuing delivery of our essential services.
What is particularly striking and disturbing since the COVID-19 crisis exploded into a pandemic is the fragility of governments and institutions in responding to it. They are still scrambling to cope and find answers, some performing more effectively than others. However, the overall picture is of the emperor without his clothes, afraid, unsafe and unsure.
It was only a tiny short while ago that we were hearing continuous boasts about the booming economy, the ever-soaring stock market, and record-breaking job-creation and employment numbers. Then, in an instant, all those vaunted records evaporated like the mist, and turned into substantial losses and minuses. A totally new world reality has been born, and experts of all persuasions are telling us the pre-COVID-19 life we have known may never return.
Perhaps there is a lesson here for all of us, governments, institutions and individuals alike. The first is to be conscious of our own frailty, and of the dangers of taking ourselves too seriously - this applying above all to our leaders. COVID-19 is showing us how flimsy is the veneer of our structures and systems.
Second, we should reflect on our very concepts of government and governance, geared as they are to electoral success, and thus the short-term. The average life of a government is four years, and the actual operative time is significantly less. Platforms, policies and promises seldom dwell on long-term considerations. And when they do, they resort to cleverly couched notions and concepts, whose hallmark is elasticity and loose interpretation.
Yet the challenges we face as a collectivity are increasingly long-term ones. The population explosion, the depletion and desecration of nature and its resources; the huge disparities between have and have-nots; the incessant conflicts over ethnicity, faith and jurisdiction; and the corresponding challenges of meeting such basic needs as food, health and education, will continue to test the abilities and determination of our leaders and governments inevitably and increasingly. Every major forest fire is more devastating than the last, as is every tsunami, flood, earthquake or mudslide. Epidemics are likely to become pandemics, and COVID-19, sadly, may not be the last. Environmental and war refugees will keep roaming the world in ever-larger numbers in search of shelter and safety.
I know of Scandinavian governments that, several years ago, established precise and firm long-term energy plans until 2030, which to date they have observed faithfully. Even succeeding parties of other stripes respect them, conscious of not upsetting what has become an accepted national vision. The idea that long-term and visionary policies and plans, including targeted strategic systems and reserves in key sectors, do not possess electoral appeal is a fallacy.
Our world is changing in many ways. Younger generations, if our country and province are any guide, are highly educated and skilled, prescient and anxious about the future we are handing over to them.
So let us hope that COVID-19 may become a lesson in long-term anticipatory, preventive and reformative planning, and that our governments and leaders may have the courage and wisdom to aspire beyond electoral considerations. An increasingly aware and anxious citizenry will not only welcome it, but, it is to be hoped, demand it.

Transport Canada announced Friday those still taking flights in the country will be required to wear face coverings while travelling.
The new measure will come into effect on April 20.
In a statement, the federal government said travellers will be asked to cover their mouth and nose at Canadian airport screening checkpoints, when they cannot physically distance from others, or as directed by the airline employees.
"Aviation passengers on all flights departing or arriving at Canadian airports will also be required to demonstrate they have the necessary non-medical mask or face covering during the boarding process otherwise they will not be allowed to continue on their journey," the statement said.

4:30 p.m. Montreal widens sidewalks to facilitate social distancing
As part of its efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the City of Montreal is adding several "sanitary corridors" to widen sidewalks so pedestrians can pass each other while maintaining a safe distance.
The 4.5-metre-wide corridors, which close off part of the street next to sidewalks, were first tested in the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough with the installation of metal fences over Easter weekend.
In the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, they will be added on these streets:
Monkland Ave. between Draper and Girouard Aves.
Côte-des-Neiges Rd. between Jean-Brillant St. and Queen-Mary Rd.
Queen-Mary Rd. between Westbury and Clanranald Aves.
"I encourage everyone to stay home," borough mayor Sue Montgomery said in a statement. "However, going for a walk is good for our health. I am happy to allow pedestrians to enjoy beautiful spring days while maintaining a safe distance."

2:00 p.m. Situation at the Herron is under control as investigations continue, McCann says
Despite 31 seniors dying at the residence in the last month, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said Friday the situation is "under control" at Dorval's CHSLD Résidence Herron.
The regional health authority (CIUSSS) took over the residence on March 29 after staff reportedly deserted the nursing home en masse in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have since launched investigations into what went wrong.
But McCann said Friday the situation has much improved since the health authority took over, despite a Montreal Gazette investigation showing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/records-reveal-chaos-in-the-days-before-staff-abandoned-the-herron/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1587131893 ) that many of the 31 deaths took place after March 29.
"The situation is under control right now. The CIUSSS has provided a lot of staff and is organizing all the work," McCann said.
McCann said she also requested a "special inspector" review the situation and report back to her in coming weeks.
"We know there are three investigations," she added, "so we will wait for the results of those investigations and take all the measures we need to take."
1:30 p.m. 'I am taking full responsibility' for not increasing orderlies' wages, Legault says
Quebec Premier François Legault said Friday he takes responsibility for how ill-equipped the province's long-term care centres were to handle the coronavirus crisis.
Legault said he now feels his government should have increased orderlies' salaries long ago, helping with the chronic understaffing that's plagued the centres for years and left them vulnerable during the pandemic.
"I admit it, and I am taking full responsibility," he said. "If I had to do it again, I would have increased the (orderlies') salaries earlier, even without the unions' agreement.
"We entered this crisis ill-equipped."
But Legault said his government is now in a "problem-solving" mode and looking forward, not back at what could have been done. He said it's not time to argue over salaries but rather the time to focus on saving as many lives as possible.
"We are getting more staff in the residences," he said. "We're going through a tough situation but doing everything we can to take care of our elderly."

11:15 a.m. Armed Forces with medical training will aid CHSLDs in Quebec, Trudeau says
The federal government is sending members of the Canadian Armed Forces to help in Quebec's beleaguered long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday.
The centres, known as CHSLDs, are at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec - 70 per cent of the provinces COVID-19 deaths have occurred in the homes.
Roughly 125 members with medical training will be sent to Quebec.
"We will continue to work with the government of Quebec to find other ways to help them," Trudeau said during his daily briefing Friday. That could include help from the Canadian Red Cross and specialized volunteers registered with Health Canada, he added.
Quebec had made the request for help on Wednesday, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent in to help the centre's overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Trudeau said Thursday the federal government was evaluating the request but needed time to decide how it could best help. The Armed Forces are usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he said, so the request was "somewhat different."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already made two requests for members of the Armed Forces to be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord. Both were approved.
10:15 a.m. Records reveal chaos in the days before staff abandoned the Herron
As authorities continue to investigate the CHSLD Résidence Herron, the Montreal Gazette has obtained the complete records of all those who died at the Dorval long-term care centre from the beginning of March until the first two weeks it was placed under trusteeship.
The records provide new glimpses into the chaotic hours at the Herron before the staff deserted the nursing home en masse on March 29 in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.

9:00 a.m. Application filed for class-action lawsuit against CHSLD Herron
An application to launch a class-action lawsuit against the Herron long-term care residence has been filed.
The application, which was filed at the Montreal courthouse on Thursday, alleges "inhumane and degrading maltreatment" as a result of the residence's failure to ensure continued and adequate care.
The lead plaintiff is Barbara Schneider, whose mother, Mary Schneider, died at Résidence Herron on April 10 after contracting COVID-19.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have launched investigations into 31 deaths at the residence in less than a month.

Transport Canada announced Friday those still taking flights in the country will be required to wear face coverings while travelling.
The new measure will come into effect on April 20.
In a statement, the federal government said travellers will be asked to cover their mouth and nose at Canadian airport screening checkpoints, when they cannot physically distance from others, or as directed by the airline employees.
"Aviation passengers on all flights departing or arriving at Canadian airports will also be required to demonstrate they have the necessary non-medical mask or face covering during the boarding process otherwise they will not be allowed to continue on their journey," the statement said.

4:30 p.m. Montreal widens sidewalks to facilitate social distancing
As part of its efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the City of Montreal is adding several "sanitary corridors" to widen sidewalks so pedestrians can pass each other while maintaining a safe distance.
The 4.5-metre-wide corridors, which close off part of the street next to sidewalks, were first tested in the Plateau Mont-Royal borough with the installation of metal fences over Easter weekend.
In the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, they will be added on these streets:
Monkland Ave. between Draper and Girouard Aves.
Côte-des-Neiges Rd. between Jean-Brillant St. and Queen-Mary Rd.
Queen-Mary Rd. between Westbury et Clanranald Aves.
"I encourage everyone to stay home," borough mayor Sue Montgomery said in a statement. "However, going for a walk is good for our health. I am happy to allow pedestrians to enjoy beautiful spring days while maintaining a safe distance."

2:00 p.m. Situation at the Herron is under control as investigations continue, McCann says
Despite 31 seniors dying at the residence in the last month, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said Friday the situation is "under control" at Dorval's CHSLD Résidence Herron.
The regional health authority (CIUSSS) took over the residence on March 29 after staff reportedly deserted the nursing home en masse in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have since launched investigations into what went wrong.
But McCann said Friday the situation has much improved since the health authority took over, despite a Montreal Gazette investigation showing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/records-reveal-chaos-in-the-days-before-staff-abandoned-the-herron/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1587131893 ) that many of the 31 deaths took place after March 29.
"The situation is under control right now. The CIUSSS has provided a lot of staff and is organizing all the work," McCann said.
McCann said she also requested a "special inspector" review the situation and report back to her in coming weeks.
"We know there are three investigations," she added, "so we will wait for the results of those investigations and take all the measures we need to take."
1:30 p.m. 'I am taking full responsibility' for not increasing orderlies' wages, Legault says
Quebec Premier François Legault said Friday he takes responsibility for how ill-equipped the province's long-term care centres were to handle the coronavirus crisis.
Legault said he now feels his government should have increased orderlies' salaries long ago, helping with the chronic understaffing that's plagued the centres for years and left them vulnerable during the pandemic.
"I admit it, and I am taking full responsibility," he said. "If I had to do it again, I would have increased the (orderlies') salaries earlier, even without the unions' agreement.
"We entered this crisis ill-equipped."
But Legault said his government is now in a "problem-solving" mode and looking forward, not back at what could have been done. He said it's not time to argue over salaries but rather the time to focus on saving as many lives as possible.
"We are getting more staff in the residences," he said. "We're going through a tough situation but doing everything we can to take care of our elderly."

11:15 a.m. Armed Forces with medical training will aid CHSLDs in Quebec, Trudeau says
The federal government is sending members of the Canadian Armed Forces to help in Quebec's beleaguered long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday.
The centres, known as CHSLDs, are at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec - 70 per cent of the provinces COVID-19 deaths have occurred in the homes.
Roughly 125 members with medical training will be sent to Quebec.
"We will continue to work with the government of Quebec to find other ways to help them," Trudeau said during his daily briefing Friday. That could include help from the Canadian Red Cross and specialized volunteers registered with Health Canada, he added.
Quebec had made the request for help on Wednesday, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent in to help the centre's overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Trudeau said Thursday the federal government was evaluating the request but needed time to decide how it could best help. The Armed Forces are usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he said, so the request was "somewhat different."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already made two requests for members of the Armed Forces to be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord. Both were approved.
11:00 a.m. 'Pedestrian corridors' added in Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce
The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough is adding "pedestrian corridors" to give residents more space while out for walks during the pandemic.
Street sections being turned into pedestrian corridors include:
Monkland Ave., between Girouard and Draper Aves.
Côte-des-Neiges Rd., between Jean-Brillant St. and Queen-Mary Rd.
Queen-Mary Rd., between Westbury and Clanranald Aves.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced boroughs to review the layout of public spaces to try to minimize the spread of the virus," the borough said in a statement released Friday.
"I encourage everyone to stay home," borough mayor Sue Montgomery added. "However, going for a walk is good for our health. I am happy to allow pedestrians to enjoy beautiful spring days while maintaining a safe distance."

9:00 a.m. Why is Quebec the COVID-19 epicentre of Canada?
Quebec now holds two not-so-glorious records in Canada: the most confirmed cases - over 15,000, with 997 new cases recorded Thursday - and the highest number of deaths. With 143 new confirmed mortalities Thursday, the total is now 630.

11:30 p.m. Armed Forces with medical training will aid CHSLDs in Quebec, Trudeau says
The federal government is sending members of the Canadian Armed Forces to help in Quebec's beleaguered long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday.
The centres, known as CHSLDs, are at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec - 70 per cent of the provinces COVID-19 deaths have occurred in the homes.
Roughly 125 members with medical training will be sent to Quebec.
"We will continue to work with the government of Quebec to find other ways to help them," Trudeau said during his daily briefing Friday. That could include help from the Canadian Red Cross and specialized volunteers registered with Health Canada, he added.
Quebec had made the request for help on Wednesday, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent in to help the centre's overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Trudeau said Thursday the federal government was evaluating the request but needed time to decide how it could best help. The Armed Forces are usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he said, so the request was "somewhat different."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already made two requests for members of the Armed Forces to be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord. Both were approved
11:00 a.m. 'Pedestrian corridors' added in Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce
The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough is adding "pedestrian corridors" to give residents more space while out for walks during the pandemic.
Street sections being turned into pedestrian corridors include:
Monkland Ave., between Girouard and Draper Aves.
Côte-des-Neiges Rd., between Jean-Brillant St. and Queen-Mary Rd.
Queen-Mary Rd., between Westbury and Clanranald Aves.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced boroughs to review the layout of public spaces to try to minimize the spread of the virus," the borough said in a statement released Friday.
"I encourage everyone to stay home," borough mayor Sue Montgomery added. "However, going for a walk is good for our health. I am happy to allow pedestrians to enjoy beautiful spring days while maintaining a safe distance."

10:15 a.m. Records reveal chaos in the days before staff abandoned the Herron
As authorities continue to investigate the CHSLD Résidence Herron, the Montreal Gazette has obtained the complete records of all those who died at the Dorval long-term care centre from the beginning of March until the first two weeks it was placed under trusteeship.
The records provide new glimpses into the chaotic hours at the Herron before the staff deserted the nursing home en masse on March 29 in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.

9:00 a.m. Why is Quebec the COVID-19 epicentre of Canada?
Quebec now holds two not-so-glorious records in Canada: the most confirmed cases - over 15,000, with 997 new cases recorded Thursday - and the highest number of deaths. With 143 new confirmed mortalities Thursday, the total is now 630.
Why is that?

9:00 a.m. Application filed for class-action lawsuit against CHSLD Herron
An application to launch a class-action lawsuit against the Herron long-term care residence has been filed.
The application, which was filed at the Montreal courthouse on Thursday, alleges "inhumane and degrading maltreatment" as a result of the residence's failure to ensure continued and adequate care.
The lead plaintiff is Barbara Schneider, whose mother, Mary Schneider, died at Résidence Herron on April 10 after contracting COVID-19.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have launched investigations into 31 deaths at the residence in less than a month.

9:00 a.m. Quebec National Assembly adjournment extended to May 5
The adjournment of proceedings at the Quebec National Assembly has been extended to May 5.
On March 17, as a series of emergency measures sparked by the coronavirus outbreak took effect across the province, the legislature was adjourned until April 21.

5:00 p.m. Quartier Cavendish COVID-19 testing centre shutting down
The drive-through COVID-19 testing centre at Quartier Cavendish, first opened last month, will be closed as of Friday.
But the local health authority is opening a new designated COVID-19 assessment clinic in a parking lot at the Jewish General Hospital.
Read more about the new clinic here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quartier-cavendish-covid-19-testing-centre-shutting-down/ ).
4:30 p.m. Now more than 7,200 COVID-19 cases in Montreal
The city of Montreal reported 451 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 7,281.
An additional 90 deaths were also recorded, meaning 332 people have now died from the disease in Montreal.
But Montreal's public health director said she remains "confident" the city has reached the peak of the COVID-19 curve.
"If we look at the cases today and yesterday, we have attained a plateau," Dr. Mylène Drouin said on Thursday.
The situation continues to be most critical in long-term care facilities. Seventy-five per cent of the centres in the Montreal area are dealing with outbreaks, Drouin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also announced new measures aimed at helping the taxi industry, including a $260,000 grant to help taxi drivers install protective partitions in their cars.
Montreal is also setting up an automated call system that will call seniors to inform them about resources available nearby.
The calls will be made in English and in French, Plante confirmed.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said.
Now that the COVID-19 curve has flattened, Legault added, Quebec is preparing a plan to scale back its lockdown, which includes the opening of more businesses.
Legault also said that reopening Quebec's schools before May 4, which he mentioned last week and which provoked an outcry, is out of the question for now.
Read more about his daily briefing here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/coronavirus-quebec-loses-its-first-doctor-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-hits-630/ ).
1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. Quebec loses its first doctor to COVID-19
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
During his own daily briefing Thursday, Quebec Premier François Legault confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, Legault added.
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said( http://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/trudeau-lowers-the-bar-for-small-business-loans-says-rent-relief-coming-amid-coronavirus-crisis/wcm/2efc6b86-e326-47fa-87d3-fcf257744705 ).
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis.

5:00 p.m. Quartier Cavendish COVID-19 testing centre shutting down
The drive-through COVID-19 testing centre at Quartier Cavendish, first opened last month, will be closed as of Friday.
But the local health authority is opening a new designated COVID-19 assessment clinic in a parking lot at the Jewish General Hospital.
Read more about the new clinic here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quartier-cavendish-covid-19-testing-centre-shutting-down/ ).
4:30 p.m. Now more than 7,200 COVID-19 cases in Montreal
The city of Montreal reported 451 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 7,281.
An additional 90 deaths were also recorded, meaning 332 people have now died from the disease in Montreal.
But Montreal's public health director said she remains "confident" the city has reached the peak of the COVID-19 curve.
"If we look at the cases today and yesterday, we have attained a plateau," Dr. Mylène Drouin said on Thursday.
The situation continues to be most critical in long-term care facilities. Seventy-five per cent of the centres in the Montreal area are dealing with outbreaks, Drouin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also announced new measures aimed at helping the taxi industry, including a $260,000 grant to help taxi drivers install protective partitions in their cars.
Montreal is also setting up an automated call system that will call seniors to inform them about resources available nearby.
The calls will be made in English and in French, Plante confirmed.
#COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) : Today we are announcing measures to provide a safe working environment for our taxi drivers. The @BureauTaxi( https://twitter.com/BureauTaxi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) and the @MTL_Ville( https://twitter.com/MTL_Ville?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) are offering a grant of $260,000 to add protective partitions between the front and rear of the vehicles. #polmtl( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polmtl?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said.
Now that the COVID-19 curve has flattened, Legault added, Quebec is preparing a plan to scale back its lockdown, which includes the opening of more businesses.
Legault also said that reopening Quebec's schools before May 4, which he mentioned last week and which provoked an outcry, is out of the question for now.
Read more about his daily briefing here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/coronavirus-quebec-loses-its-first-doctor-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-hits-630/ ).
1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. Quebec loses its first doctor to COVID-19
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
During his own daily briefing Thursday, Quebec Premier François Legault confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, Legault added.
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said( http://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/trudeau-lowers-the-bar-for-small-business-loans-says-rent-relief-coming-amid-coronavirus-crisis/wcm/2efc6b86-e326-47fa-87d3-fcf257744705 ).
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.
Read more here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/some-family-caregivers-to-be-granted-access-to-chslds-as-reinforcements/ ).
10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.
Read more here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-bans-open-air-fires-in-monteregie-and-eastern-townships/ ).
9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said.
Now that the COVID-19 curve has flattened, Legault added, Quebec is preparing a plan to scale back its lockdown, which includes the opening of more businesses.
Legault also said that reopening Quebec's schools before May 4, which he mentioned last week and which provoked an outcry, is out of the question for now.

1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. Quebec loses its first doctor to COVID-19
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
During his own daily briefing Thursday, Quebec Premier François Legault confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, Legault added.
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said( http://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/trudeau-lowers-the-bar-for-small-business-loans-says-rent-relief-coming-amid-coronavirus-crisis/wcm/2efc6b86-e326-47fa-87d3-fcf257744705 ).
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

9:00 a.m. Montreal photographer aims to 'capture the soul' of shuttered restaurants
Montreal photographer Fannie-Laurence Dubé-Dupuis is documenting the city's deserted restaurants.
Dubé-Dupuis told reporter Susan Schwartz she's photographing the fronts and interiors of restaurants and bars "to succeed in capturing the soul of a place, sleeping, in all its sadness."

4:30 p.m. Now more than 7,200 COVID-19 cases in Montreal
The city of Montreal reported 451 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 7,281.
An additional 90 deaths were also recorded, meaning 332 people have now died from the disease in Montreal.
But Montreal's public health director said she remains "confident" the city has reached the peak of the COVID-19 curve.
"We have attained a plateau," Dr. Mylène Drouin said on Thursday.
The situation continues to be most critical in long-term care facilities. Seventy-five per cent of the centres in the Montreal area are dealing with outbreaks, Drouin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also announced new measures aimed at helping the taxi industry, including a $260,000 grant to allow taxi drivers to install protective partitions in their cars.
Montreal is also setting up an automated call system that will call people older than 70 years old to inform them about resources available nearby.
The calls will be made in English and in French, Plante confirmed.

Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
During his own daily briefing Thursday, Quebec Premier François Legault confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, Legault added.
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said( http://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/trudeau-lowers-the-bar-for-small-business-loans-says-rent-relief-coming-amid-coronavirus-crisis/wcm/2efc6b86-e326-47fa-87d3-fcf257744705 ).
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

Montreal photographer Fannie-Laurence Dubé-Dupuis is documenting the city's deserted restaurants.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said.
Now that the COVID-19 curve has flattened, Legault added, Quebec is preparing a plan to scale back its lockdown, which includes the opening of more businesses.
Legault also said that reopening Quebec's schools before May 4, which he mentioned last week and which provoked an outcry, is out of the question for now.

Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.

The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
The CHSLD network is at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in the province and is short of about 2,000 nurses and orderlies, either because they are off sick or are absent because they fear COVID-19.

The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
The CHSLD network is at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in the province and is short of about 2,000 nurses and orderlies, either because they are off sick or are absent because they fear COVID-19.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said. "It won't be easy, especially not in these exceptional circumstances, but I'm convinced we're able to get everyone working together to take care of our most vulnerable seniors."
Legault also confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, he added.
1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. A sad first
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
Exclusif: un premier médecin québécois décède de la COVID-19. Un spécialiste de la santé communautaire de 44 ans, de la Montérégie.
- Louis Lacroix (@LouisLacroixQC) April 16, 2020( https://twitter.com/LouisLacroixQC/status/1250825250830454787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said.
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have accepted to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
The CHSLD network is at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in the province and is short of about 2,000 nurses and orderlies, either because they are off sick or are absent because they fear COVID-19.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect but we'll adjust as we go," he said. "It won't be easy, especially not in these exceptional circumstances, but I'm convinced we're able to get everyone working together to take care of our most vulnerable seniors."
Legault also confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members that meet the criteria, he added.
1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. A sad first
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Exclusif: un premier médecin québécois décède de la COVID-19. Un spécialiste de la santé communautaire de 44 ans, de la Montérégie.
- Louis Lacroix (@LouisLacroixQC) April 16, 2020( https://twitter.com/LouisLacroixQC/status/1250825250830454787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said.
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

9:00 a.m. Montreal photographer aims to 'capture the soul' of shuttered restaurants
Montreal photographer Fannie-Laurence Dubé-Dupuis is documenting the city's deserted restaurants.
Dubé-Dupuis told reporter Susan Schwartz she's photographing the fronts and interiors of restaurants and bars "to succeed in capturing the soul of a place, sleeping, in all its sadness."

Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

9:00 a.m. Montreal photographer aims to 'capture the soul' of shuttered restaurants

Full text: The coronavirus pandemic( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ) has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The ministry says its decision is based on preserving the operational capacity of its forest firefighting agency (SOPFEU) and other firefighting services during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.
According to SOPFEU, there are no forest fires detected at the moment in Quebec.
Since the start of the 2020 fire season, nine fires have broken out over 0.3 hectares. Over the past 10 years, the average number of fires recorded at this time of year is 17, affecting 8.9 hectares.

Full text: Good morning and welcome to the Saturday edition of While You Were Sleeping.
Problems at long-term care homes in spotlight as House of Commons returns( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/problems-at-long-term-care-homes-in-spotlight-as-house-of-commons-returns/wcm/dc192f69-e50c-4478-ba9d-1dd96c9a8c68/ ): As the House of Commons returns Saturday in an effort to pass the wage subsidy bill to help beleaguered businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, Canada must also contend with major problems at long-term care homes. A group home for adults with disabilities just north of Toronto, Ont., reports that an outbreak there led most personal support workers to walk off the job Thursday. Meanwhile, regional health authorities in Quebec have taken over two facilities after troubling issues emerged in recent days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to make his televised address to Canadians from parliament on Saturday after doing it outside his home for the past 26 days.
Public health, police find bodies, feces at Dorval seniors' residence, sources say( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ): A privately run seniors' residence in Dorval that is grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19 has been described as a "concentration camp" - with unfed and soiled elderly residents inside - by health professionals who came to those residents' rescue, a Montreal Gazette investigation has found. Although the official COVID-19 death toll at Résidence Herron stood at two on Thursday, a worker said 27 residents have died in the past two weeks. This is highly unusual, as the facility reports an average of four deaths a month, the worker noted.
Meanwhile, the Canadian m( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/this-is-a-war-military-fight-against-covid-19-will-be-anything-but-easy/wcm/695a0dfc-72ab-4896-9e5c-ff3da456497e )ilitary is also going to war against COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/this-is-a-war-military-fight-against-covid-19-will-be-anything-but-easy/wcm/695a0dfc-72ab-4896-9e5c-ff3da456497e ): When 40 Canadian Rangers swung into action in northern Quebec this week to set up heated tents for COVID-19 screening and conduct other tasks in their local communities due to the pandemic, they formed the most visible military response to the crisis to date. The Rangers were mobilized in response to a request for assistance from provincial authorities, the first to the federal government because of COVID-19. Thousands more troops are standing by in case it isn't the last. But what exactly can the Canadian Armed Forces bring to bear in a fight with a pandemic? And how will commanders decide how to use troops who, once committed, could find themselves infected, or quarantined, and taken out of the fight? Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced last month that the military was mobilizing up to 24,000 troops so it would be able to respond to COVID-19 as well as floods and forest fires that have become commonplace in the spring in recent years. Equipment is being gathered at key military bases and warships have been ordered to wait off each coast.

Rush-hour traffic plummets as people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: A traffic-data analyst has watched as congestion has plummeted in major cities around the world

Full text: From his office in Amsterdam, Gijs Peters could see the response to the COVID-19 pandemic move across the world. In the beginning, though, he couldn't be sure exactly what he was looking at.
"It started really slowly," Peters said, speaking from home, since his office, like most places in the Netherlands, had been closed. "You see some minor changes, and you think it might be the weather. I mean, there's many things that affect traffic; a small change does not point to a pandemic." He didn't want to jump to a conclusion.
In late January, he noticed rush-hour traffic in China, specifically the city of Wuhan, wasn't as heavy as usual. Fewer people were commuting to work. Then, weeks later, the same thing happened in Northern Italy. The roads were emptier than usual.
As a data scientist and traffic expert at TomTom NV, Peters was seeing the anonymous, aggregate movements of about 600 million drivers across the world. TomTom provides location and navigation services to car manufacturers, Uber, Apple Maps and Microsoft, among others. You may have a TomTom GPS unit suction-cupped to your car's dashboard right now.
All that data - which TomTom states on its website is never sold and always anonymized - is used to tell your in-car navigation system or your smartphone where there's traffic and which alternative routes to take to avoid it. Last week, all routes looked eerily good.
There are usually two daily spikes in traffic congestion: one when people drive to work; the other when they drive home.
On Monday, March 9, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared the whole country a "red zone." Everyone was toldto stay home. The morning after that lockdown, Peters saw a dramatic drop in those two daily traffic spikes in Rome. There was barely a rush hour any more. Those curves, at least, were flattening, and fast.
This wasn't weather or people going on holidays. He could see the same pattern - a slow downward trend followed by a large and fairly sudden drop in traffic congestion - taking place in cities all over the world. "I want to be cautious in saying it's because of the virus, because we don't have that causality there, technically," Peters said. "It definitely seems to be correlated," he added. "I think you see the impact."
By the second week of March, Peters began to see what was likely the effect of self-isolation, social distancing and the shuttering of shops, restaurants and offices in North American cities. Canada's response to the pandemic could be seen in the traffic data, too.
At 8 a.m. on the average Thursday in Montreal last year, traffic congestion was at 56 per cent, according to a metric TomTomcallsits "congestion index." That means a journey will take 56 per cent more time as a result of heavy traffic. For example, what would be a one-hour drive with free-flowing traffic takes one hour and 34 minutes at 8 a.m. on the average Thursday in Montreal.
In comparison, on Thursday, March 19, the streets were relatively empty. The congestion index had dropped dramatically, peaking at just 10 per cent, a massive reduction in morning rush-hour traffic. A few days earlier, on March 16, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had urged all Canadians to stay home as much as possible. It looks as though Montrealers heeded the call.
In Vancouver last week, peak rush-hour congestion was down roughly 40 percentage points compared to the average weekday rush hour in 2019. In Calgary, it dropped roughly 25 percentage points. In Milan, the biggest city in Northern Italy, the congestion index dropped by as much as 64 percentage points as the country remained under lockdown.
In Toronto, the big drop-off in traffic volume was evident beginning around the same day Trudeau made the "stay home" announcement. During the Wednesday evening commute that week, the congestion index peaked at just 17 per cent. Compare that with an average of 72 per cent at the same time last year. A rush-hour commute that normally took 52 minutes would have taken 35 minutes. The roads were relatively empty.
"In North America, we have data on about 10 to 15 per cent of all cars driving around," Peters said. Data are gathered on everyone from occasional drivers, to professional delivery drivers, to Uber drivers and commuters. In other words, the data are representative of what's actually going on.
You can see the effect of the pandemic on Google Maps or GPS navigation app Waze, too. Highways that are usually displayed as thick red lines across major cities at rush hour are now often green.
It bucks a global trend Peters has seen over the past few years. "We've seen traffic slowly increasing in most cities in the world," he said.
There have been sudden drops in traffic before, because of road shutdowns owing to forest fires such as those in California last year, for example. But in Peters' experience, sudden drops like that have always been regional, not worldwide.
"That traffic has been so low, on average, in so many cities, all over the world, for multiple days and weeks is absolutely …" Peters' voice trailed off. "I've never seen that before."

WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKENHEARTED: FIRST PERSON

Full text: This week, First Person takes a closer look at love and heartbreak.
F ebruary 14th is the day we contemplate our hearts. Ideally, we find them robust and whole. Often though, they're a mess, blistered remnants choking the grate after the fire's gone. These hearts are Valentine's vestiges.
And they also deserve love.
"Heartbreak," writes poet David Whyte, "begins the moment we are asked to let go but cannot."
Among those things we're asked to let go: plans, rituals, security, expectation. History. A future.
Hope.
As for letting go of Dan, that was an extraordinary idea. After six intense years together, he was knit into my skin. And when he left, I unravelled.
Romantic heartbreak distinguishes itself from other sorrows by the dismissal and loneliness that are stitched through its wool. Here is the conscious exit of someone who has free will to do otherwise.
Here is the loss of a partner and best friend and self-worth. Of care and concern and comfort. Here is the loss of peace.
And so this is heartbreak's grim essence: a message from the universe that you are not precious and a sentence to process that on your own.
For me, heartbreak was all-consuming. It stole all my quiet pleasures - loving my lunch, remembering a movie, filling with music. These were extravagances I could no longer accommodate.
Now the whole of my being was occupied with mourning. Figuring, remembering, revisiting, untangling, replaying. Waiting for my phone to fill up with him. I could barely drive or walk or stay upright. My head was so crowded.
I worked to discharge its congestion to Dan regularly, after he left. I e-mailed him letters from sobbing coffee shops, I sent him texts, I mailed him cards sprayed with my perfume so it would travel into the avenues of his brain that we'd carved together. I left shattered messages on his machine, reading from notes in my car, always looking for the words that would convince him of my worth. Sometimes, I videotaped myself so he could see my pretty face and the way his rejection had made it bony and sad.
"Oh, my sweet darling one," I said, in a midMarch e-mail when I'd been six weeks on my own.
"I am in such pain. Please find a way back to me." I hadn't eaten since he'd boarded his train for Montreal in January, since he'd left me at Union Station, alone. I'd lost 25 pounds and I told him as much. I also told him to remember our love. "I wake up every morning and just cry and cry," I said. "Don't extinguish us."
But he never said a word.
People's experiences with heartbreak are as different as people. There is emerging acceptance and enlightened outlook; there is obsession and suicide. And there is madness enough to fire a factory.
History, literature and all the chairs in the coffee shop are heavy with heartbreak. Charlotte Bronte's Lucy Snowe shivered there. "Deeper than melancholy," she cried, "lies heartbreak." Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal to mark the scale of his anguish. Portugal's King Pedro, who honoured dead Ines by exhuming her and making his subjects swear allegiance to her reign. And Queen Victoria, who endured 40 years without her Prince Albert and must have etched with such relief "here at last I shall rest with thee" over the door of the mausoleum when she joined him.
Surely Dan heard my sorrow across the 500 kilometres that had separated us from the start. "I am beside you," he used to say to me from Montreal when I lay in bed in Toronto. But that was before he'd stopped saying anything at all.
I didn't stop though. I told him often that I interpreted his failure to write back and ask me to stop my campaign as reason to hope. If he didn't kick shut the door, I'd say, I would imagine a crack.
It wasn't manipulation - it was a plea for release.
There was no kick and the crack consumed me.
Sappho begged Aphrodite to "come to me again and release me from this want past bearing." Even Jesus Christ might have lost his life to heartbreak, say the scholars, noting the water that poured from his heart when soldiers plunged their spears there.
In my "want past bearing," I stayed alive and perceived the sun's passage across the sky and that was all. I could not listen to music. I could not be alone. I could not sit in my house surrounded by silence and tortured by yearning.
I packed up my children for uncharacteristic excursions to table-tennis parlours and arcades and boardgame cafés - anything to occupy them so I might climb into myself and wallow in the swill there.
One unbearable Sunday, I cried while driving the kids to a trampoline gym when a song called Let Her Go came on. "You only miss the sun when it starts to snow," my radio grieved. "Only know you love her when you let her go." After I parked, I stayed in the car to imagine Dan hearing the same lyrics and having to pull over until he could stop sobbing. The idea filled me with such complicated sadness.
Literary heartbreak allusions hit a high point in 1774 with the publication of Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. In this modern novel - considered the first - the sensitive Werther writes to his friend Wilhelm about falling in love with Charlotte, who's with Albert. Heartbroken, Werner eventually kills himself. "I suffer much," he writes, in the letter he leaves behind. "I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me, it is no more."
At Friday night art classes after my own lost charm, I would splash my sketches with tears and send my friends texts that said I was afraid I might die. Once, I visited an art gallery where visitors wrote wishes on strips of paper and hung them from the ceiling. I wrote mine with great care and attached it to one of the fishing lines, where it was instantly lost among hundreds of dangling desires.
"I miss you so much, Dan," my strip howled.
"Please come back."
I watched the fluttering paper forest for a long time, conjuring a scene where he would come into the gallery and find my note and know the message was mine and that he had to abide it. Valentine's Day or no.

One unbearable Sunday, I cried while driving the kids to a trampoline gym when a song called Let Her Go came on. “You only miss the sun when it starts to snow,” my radio grieved. “Only know you love her when you let her go.” After I parked, I stayed in the car to imagine Dan hearing the same lyrics and having to pull over until he could stop sobbing. The idea filled me with such complicated sadness.
Literary heartbreak allusions hit a high point in 1774 with the publication of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther. In this modern novel – considered the first – the sensitive Werther writes to his friend Wilhelm about falling in love with Charlotte, who’s with Albert. Heartbroken, Werner eventually kills himself. “I suffer much,” he writes, in the letter he leaves behind. “I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me, it is no more.”
At Friday night art classes after my own lost charm, I would splash my sketches with tears and send my friends texts that said I was afraid I might die. Once, I visited an art gallery where visitors wrote wishes on strips of paper and hung them from the ceiling. I wrote mine with great care and attached it to one of the fishing lines, where it was instantly lost among hundreds of dangling desires.
“I miss you so much, Dan,” my strip howled.
“Please come back.”
I watched the fluttering paper forest for a long time, conjuring a scene where he would come into the gallery and find my note and know the message was mine and that he had to abide it. Valentine’s Day or no.

Quebec politicians call for peaceful end to Kahnawake rail blockade

Full text: Quebec politicians hope peaceful negotiations and not force will end a rail blockade at Kahnawake that has paralyzed commuter trains and freight movement across Eastern Canada.
Mohawks say being relegated to a reserve on Montreal's South Shore means the government has - for more than 150 years - expropriated land to make way for train tracks, a seaway, power lines and highways.
But activists in Kahnawake turned that to their advantage last weekend when they joined a national protest movement in support of the Wet'suwet'en pipeline protest in British Columbia. Mohawks erected a blockade on the Canadian Pacific rail line last week and, for the third consecutive day Wednesday, their action shut down commuter traffic linking the South Shore to Montreal.
The blockade is backed by Kahnawake's elected band council and its traditional longhouse elders.
"I understand this is frustrating for commuters, but we're fighting for their rights, too. We're fighting so they can live in a country with free people and clean water. We're fighting for life," said James Nolan, who stood watch over a fire next to the blockade.
The blockade is in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en land defenders( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/vancouver-port-blockade-prompts-injunction-arrests-on-monday-morning/wcm/2b053bab-9ae7-4c61-8dd4-5b3d1a0d3e47 ) and hereditary chiefs, who are fighting to stop construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline project in northwest B.C. RCMP tactical officers began clearing them from the forest last week to enforce an injunction that would allow construction of the project to begin.
But that action was met with a nationwide resistance movement: paralyzing Via Rail traffic between Toronto and Montreal, shutting down the port at Prince Rupert and affecting commercial shipping in Halifax and Montreal.
And while Ontario police moved in Tuesday to disperse a Mohawk blockade near Belleville, Nolan says the Kahnawake structure is holding firm until the RCMP pulls out of Wet'suwet'en territory.
He says he was raised not only to believe in solidarity with other Indigenous Peoples but also to act on those beliefs. In 1990, when the military and police surrounded his sister community of Kanesatake, Nolan's father didn't give him a choice.
"He said, 'Well, boys, let's go.' I was 16, 17 years old and we were off to the checkpoints to hold down against the army," said Nolan, who was joined by his son James Jr. Tuesday.
"You're a teenager, you want to party and hang out with friends, but you're a part of something bigger. You have to stand up to the army, stand up for your people."
In Quebec City, politicians called for a peaceful resolution to the blockade.
"I invite government to be cautious (in its handling of the situation)," interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand told reporters. "But one thing is clear: we can't tolerate illegal acts.
"But the negotiation route always remains the best route to take. I invite the parties to continue to discuss. There has to be discussion on this, but we can't accept that there be illegality."
Exo, the regional authority that oversees local commuter rail service, describes the duration of the service interruption as "indefinite"( https://exo.quebec/fr/etat-services/train/ligne-candiac ) and has provided shuttle buses to get customers from the South Shore to Montreal.
The protest in Montreal blocked the Canadian Pacific rail line and affected commuters using stations in Candiac, Delson, St-Constant and Ste-Catherine, as well as the LaSalle and du Canal stations in Montreal.
About 25,000 Via Rail passengers have been affected by blockades in Ontario and Quebec. All Montreal-Toronto and Toronto-Ottawa trains have been cancelled until end of day Thursday.
"The only way they're going to pay attention is if we hit them where it hurts: their economy," said Sedalia Kawennotas, a Mohawk elder. "If this is an inconvenience for commuters, think about us. We've been inconvenienced for 500 years. This isn't just for us: how will they feel if their grand children don't have clean drinking water?
"This isn't for us, it's for the generations we haven't seen yet."
Montreal-based Canadian National Railway Co. said Tuesday it will be forced to shut down "significant" parts of its Canadian network imminently unless the blockades on its rail lines are removed.
Hundreds of freight trains have been cancelled since the blockades - in Belleville, Ont. and in northern British Columbia - began five days ago, CN said. CN said it has secured court injunctions for both locations and is working with local police to enforce the orders.
A representative from Canadian Pacific said Tuesday the company is monitoring the situation and would not answer when asked if it sought an injunction to clear the Candiac-Montreal line.
For Nolan, who works in security, there was never a question as to whether he'd take time away from his job to watch over the blockade. Him and a tight-knit group of protesters are standing guard in shifts.
"Our job isn't to go to work and make money, it's to protect our brothers and sisters," Nolan said. "They can arrest some of us, but they can't arrest us all. You see what these pipelines do, they explode, they spill, they destroy. We can't allow that to happen."

Full text: There's no way around it: commuter rail and freight traffic going from Candiac to Montreal passes through Mohawk territory.
Locals say the inconvenient truth of being relegated to a reserve on Montreal's South Shore is that the government has - for more than 150 years - expropriated land to make way for train tracks, a seaway, power lines and highways.

Full text: There's no way around it: commuter rail and freight traffic going from Candiac to Montreal passes through Mohawk territory.
Locals say the inconvenient truth of being relegated to a reserve on Montreal's South Shore is that the government has - for more than 150 years - expropriated land to make way for train tracks, a seaway, power lines and highways.
But activists in Kahnawake turned that to their advantage last weekend when they joined a national protest movement in support of the Wet'suwet'en pipeline protest in British Columbia. Mohawks erected a blockade on the Canadian Pacific rail line last week and, for the second consecutive day Tuesday, their action shut down commuter traffic linking the South Shore to Montreal.
The blockade is backed by Kahnawake's elected band council and its traditional longhouse elders.
"I understand this is frustrating for commuters, but we're fighting for their rights, too. We're fighting so they can live in a country with free people and clean water. We're fighting for life," said James Nolan, who stood watch over a fire next to the blockade.
The blockade is in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en land defenders( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/vancouver-port-blockade-prompts-injunction-arrests-on-monday-morning/wcm/2b053bab-9ae7-4c61-8dd4-5b3d1a0d3e47 ) and hereditary chiefs, who are fighting to stop construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline project in northwest B.C. RCMP tactical officers began clearing them from the forest last week to enforce an injunction that would allow construction of the project to begin.
But that action was met with a nationwide resistance movement: paralyzing Via Rail traffic between Toronto and Montreal, shutting down the port at Prince Rupert and affecting commercial shipping in Halifax and Montreal.
And while Ontario police moved in Tuesday to disperse a Mohawk blockade near Belleville, Nolan says the Kahnawake structure is holding firm until the RCMP pulls out of Wet'suwet'en territory.
He says he was raised not only to believe in solidarity with other Indigenous Peoples but also to act on those beliefs. In 1990, when the military and police surrounded his sister community of Kanesatake, Nolan's father didn't give him a choice.
"He said, 'Well, boys, let's go.' I was 16, 17 years old and we were off to the checkpoints to hold down against the army," said Nolan, who was joined by his son James Jr. Tuesday.
"You're a teenager, you want to party and hang out with friends, but you're a part of something bigger. You have to stand up to the army, stand up for your people."
In Quebec City, politicians called for a peaceful resolution to the blockade.
"I invite government to be cautious (in its handling of the situation)," interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand told reporters. "But one thing is clear: we can't tolerate illegal acts.
"But the negotiation route always remains the best route to take. I invite the parties to continue to discuss. There has to be discussion on this, but we can't accept that there be illegality."
Exo, the regional authority that oversees local commuter rail service, describes the duration of the service interruption as "indefinite"( https://exo.quebec/fr/etat-services/train/ligne-candiac ) and has provided shuttle buses to get customers from the South Shore to Montreal.
The protest in Montreal blocked the Canadian Pacific rail line and affected commuters using stations in Candiac, Delson, St-Constant and Ste-Catherine, as well as the LaSalle and du Canal stations in Montreal.
About 25,000 Via Rail passengers have been affected by blockades in Ontario and Quebec.
"The only way they're going to pay attention is if we hit them where it hurts: their economy," said Sedalia Kawennotas, a Mohawk elder. "If this is an inconvenience for commuters, think about us. We've been inconvenienced for 500 years. This isn't just for us: how will they feel if their grand children don't have clean drinking water?
"This isn't for us, it's for the generations we haven't seen yet."
Montreal-based Canadian National Railway Co. said Tuesday it will be forced to shut down "significant" parts of its Canadian network imminently unless the blockades on its rail lines are removed.
Hundreds of freight trains have been cancelled since the blockades - in Belleville, Ont. and in northern British Columbia - began five days ago, CN said. CN said it has secured court injunctions for both locations and is working with local police to enforce the orders.
A representative from Canadian Pacific said Tuesday the company is monitoring the situation and would not answer when asked if it sought an injunction to clear the Candiac-Montreal line.
For Nolan, who works in security, there was never a question as to whether he'd take time away from his job to watch over the blockade. Him and a tight-knit group of protesters are standing guard in shifts.
"Our job isn't to go to work and make money, it's to protect our brothers and sisters," Nolan said. "They can arrest some of us, but they can't arrest us all. You see what these pipelines do, they explode, they spill, they destroy. We can't allow that to happen."

West Island parks woo residents outdoors for winter activities

Full text: Winter in the West Island is a time when nature and leisure activities can dovetail beautifully.
Robert Prairie, a patrol leader at Morgan Arboretum( https://www.mcgill.ca/morganarboretum/ ), heads a team of volunteers that help to ensure a safe and fun experience for the many individuals and families who enjoy recreational destinations in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue.
Some of Prairie's most special memories while skiing the 26 kilometres of trails at the arboretum are related to the birds that inhabit the 245-hectare forest reserve.
"Sometimes I hear the resident great horned owl calling, and this is very special," he said.
Prairie has seen barred owls, snowy owls and red-shouldered hawks. More than 180 species have been observed there, and about 100 species breed at the arboretum.
Two of the eight trails open in the winter are mixed-use. Part of the role of the ski and snowshoe patrol team is to make sure that the rules in place for dogs are respected - creating one of the few dog-friendly places where owners and their dogs can walk, ski and snowshoe together.
There are also trails for more specific uses. Two trails are for walking and snowshoeing only, and there is a 4.4-km trail that is only for snowshoers.
An avid outdoors person, Prairie encourages people to think about snowshoeing as a good winter alternative to cross-country skiing.
"The nice thing about it is that sometimes the conditions aren't great for skiing," he said, "and even more than skiing, snowshoeing can be a great way to stay warm outdoors."
For those who want a classic cross-country ski trail, there is a 5.8-km loop, and after Prairie brought the suggestion to the arboretum, a 4-km skate-skiing trail was opened.
"The movement in skate-skiing is totally different. It is faster and a very good cardio activity," said Prairie.
Other activities at the arboretum include the coming Winterfest in February as well as a Full Moon Ski Event with date and time to be announced depending on weather and trail conditions.
"Last year, the moonlight ski event was a wonderful night with beginner, intermediate and advanced groups enjoying a night ski and hot chocolate afterward," said Prairie.
Open everyday from sunrise to sundown, day passes are available at the gatehouse from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can rent cross-country equipment and snowshoes at nearby John Abbott College. For more information, call 514-457-2737.
Also popular during the winter is Cap St-Jacques Nature Park( https://parcs-nature.com/public/en/cap-saint-jacques ) in Pierrefonds. On Jan. 11 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., there will be a free event to introduce the park's winter activities to the public. In the evening, the trails will be open from 6:30 to 9:30, along with the sugar shack so people can warm up, enjoy some pea soup or pancakes and have a warm drink around an outdoor fire.
In addition to the four cross-country ski loops at Cap St-Jacques, there is a 5-km snowshoe trail, and there is onsite rental of cross-country ski equipment, snowshoes, luges, sleds, sliding mats, and baby gliders.
Among the many activities throughout the winter there will be events on Saturday nights, including an introduction to Cani-cross on Feb. 1, where you can try skiing with your dog; a Valentine's Day trails night with festive treats; an outdoor fire on Feb. 15 and on Feb. 29, there will be a stargazing evening with Pierre Paquette from Astronomie-Québec( http://astronomie.quebec/ ).
Information and registration is required for all events and is available at 514 280-6871 or on the city of Montreal's Cap St-Jacques webpage( https://parcs-nature.com/public/en/cap-saint-jacques ).

Full text: Winter in the West Island is a time when nature and leisure activities can dovetail beautifully.
Robert Prairie, a patrol leader at Morgan Arboretum, heads up a team of volunteers who help to ensure a safe and fun experience for the many individuals and families who enjoy the local recreational destination in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue.
Some of Prairie's most special memories while skiing the 26 kilometres of trails at the arboretum are related to the birds that inhabit the 245-hectare forest reserve.
"Sometimes I hear the resident Great Horned Owl calling, and this is very special," he said.
Prairie has seen Barred Owls, Snowy Owls, and Red-shouldered Hawks, and more than 180 species have been observed there, as well as about 100 species are known to breed at the arboretum.
Two of the eight trails open in the winter are mix-use, and part of the role of the ski and snowshoe patrol team is to make sure that the rules in place for dogs are respected - creating one of the few dog-friendly places where owners and their dogs can walk, ski and snowshoe together.
There are also trails for more specific uses. Two trails are for walking and snowshoeing only, and there is a 4.4 km trail that is only for snowshoers.
An avid outdoors person, Prairie encourages people to think about snowshoeing as a good winter alternative to cross-country skiing.
"The nice thing about it is that sometimes the conditions aren't great for skiing," he said, "and even more than skiing, snowshoeing can be a great way to stay warm outdoors."
For those who want a classic cross-country ski trail, there is a 5.8-km loop, and after Prairie brought the suggestion to the arboretum, a four-km skate-skiing trail was opened.
"The movement in skate-skiing is totally different. It is faster and a very good cardio activity," said Prairie.
Other activities at the arboretum include upcoming Winterfest in February as well as a Full Moon Ski Event with date and time to be announced depending on weather and trail conditions.
"Last year the moonlight ski event was a wonderful night with beginner, intermediate and advanced groups enjoying a night ski and hot chocolate afterwards," said Prairie.
Open every day, from sunrise to sundown, day passes are available at the gatehouse from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You can rent cross-country equipment and snowshoes at nearby John Abbott College. For more information, call 514-457-2737.
Also popular during the winter, is Cap St-Jacques Nature Park in Pierrefonds, and this coming Saturday, Jan. 11, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., there will be a free event to introduce all park winter activities to the public. In the evening the trails will then be open from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., along with the sugar shack so people can warm up, enjoy some pea soup or pancakes, and have a warm drink around an outdoor fire.
In addition to the four cross-country ski loops at Cap St-Jacques, there is a five-km snowshoe trail, and there is on-site rental of cross-country ski equipment, snowshoes, luges, sleds, sliding mats, and baby gliders.
Among the many activities throughout the winter there will be weekly Saturday night events, including an introduction to Canicross where you can try skiing with your dog on Feb. 1, a Valentine's Day trails night with festive treats and an outdoor fire on Feb. 15, and on Feb. 29, there will be a stargazing evening with Pierre Paquette from Astronomie-Québec.
Registration is required for all events. Information is available at 514-280-6871 or on the City of Montreal's Cap St-Jacques webpage.

Ready, set, book: The most coveted timed-entry tickets, permits and lottery spots can disappear in a flash when traveller demand outstrips supply. Adam Bisby shares the dates you need to know to make vacation planning a breeze this year

Abstract: None available.

Full text: What do Peru’s Machu Picchu, the Roman Colosseum and the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam have in common? Aside from being enormously popular among travellers, all three use timed-entry ticketing to keep crowds in check.
One of the three is not like the others, however. While a wide range of entry times are available online for the Incan and Roman ruins, most if not all of the slots for the Dutch biographical museum are snapped up soon after they go on sale two months in advance.
Such are the vacation pitfalls of supply and demand. Machu Picchu’s 10.6-hectare Citadel can accommodate thousands of visitors daily, with several hundred admitted each hour. The Colosseum maxes out at 3,000 occupants. The recently renovated Anne Frank House, on the other hand, typically admits less than 50 visitors at a time, with total occupancy hovering around 300 people.
In short, planning ahead in 2020 is all about knowing what fills up fast – beyond obvious candidates such as the Tokyo Olympic Games and UEFA European Football Championship – and knowing when to book. That’s where this planning guide comes in.
BOOK IT ASAP Galaxy’s Edge, Walt Disney World, Orlando: While you can’t prebook an entry time for the new Star Wars-themed land in Disney’s largest theme park – even if the Force is with you – you can reserve experiences such as building your own droid, fashioning a custom lightsaber and sipping a Jedi Mind Trick cocktail at Oga’s Cantina up to 180 days before your visit.
This is especially advantageous should Galaxy’s Edge hit capacity and require timed-entry “boarding passes,” which are issued through the Walt Disney World app on a day-by-day basis.
Book one of the aforementioned experiences, and entry is guaranteed up to one hour before your reservation.
Passion Play 2020, Oberammergau, Germany: Performed once every 10 years since 1634 (with a few notable exceptions), this five-hour two-part staging of Jesus Christ’s final days is selling out rapidly. The play runs from May 16 to Oct. 4 in the 4,500-seat Passion Festival Theatre, with two- and three-day overnight packages, as well as tours from third parties such as Vacations By Rail, offering alternatives for securing tickets.
Foodie forays: With online reservation platforms such as OpenTable, Tock and Resy now including many of the world’s most highly regarded eateries, globe-trotting gourmands can confidently book 2020 tables and flights – in that order – at many of the venues on the most recent World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. These include Copenhagen’s Noma, Pujol in Mexico City and Le Bernardin in New York, to name a few, as well as the lone Canadian entry in the Top 100, Toronto’s Alo, and perennial contender Joe Beef of Montreal.
Dan’s Diner, Churchill, Man.: The second-annual instalment of Frontiers North Adventures’ popup dining experience along the frozen Churchill River is running from Feb. 29 to March 6 in 2020, with some seatings already showing limited space. Guests board a tractor-tired Tundra Buggy to reach Dan’s Diner, which serves regionally inspired meals under aurora-oriented skylights.
Northern Lights Resort & Spa, Whitehorse: Speaking of charged atmospheric particles, this upscale wilderness resort’s year-old Aurora Glass Chalets are sold out through March. The good news: According to the Yukon Department of Tourism and Culture, “Aurora season” starts up again in mid-August.
Featuring floor-to-ceiling wraparound windows at the foot of queen-size beds, the ensuite glass chalets offer wood-burning fireplaces, in-floor heating and kitchenettes.
Fire lookout towers, Oregon: Seventeen of the Beaver State’s fire lookout towers are proving to be hugely popular with visitors seeking scenery, serenity and inexpensive wilderness lodgings.
From the amply-decked Bolan Mountain Lookout to the panoramic Fall Mountain Lookout Cabin, the elevated lodgings tend to be booked solid through their six-month windows, with new options becoming available at 10 a.m. EST for a range of upcoming dates.
Highclere Castle, Hampshire, England: The main Downton Abbey filming location has embraced its worldwide fame by offering a range of themed tours, many of which are sold out through March. Availability starts to open up in the spring, with guided tours covering the state rooms, gallery and bedrooms that star in the Emmy Awardwinning show, as well as an exhibition of Egyptian artifacts in the Highclere cellars.
Otter Trail, Tsitsikamma National Park, South Africa: Permits for hiking this 45-kilometre trail along the rugged Garden Route coast, a scenic two-hour drive west of Port Elizabeth, are nearly sold out until early June. The hike usually takes five days to complete, with hikers overnighting in six-bed huts and spending their days admiring dense gallery forests, deserted sandy beaches and wildflower-strewn mountainsides.
JANUARY Parks Canada reservations: The reservation service for lodging, guided hiking and backcountry access in Canada’s 39 national preserves and historic sites covers everything from drive-in campsites and epic treks such as B.C.’s West Coast Trail to oTENTik tent-cabin hybrids and two-person microcubes. The first reservations become available on Jan. 3; check the website for specific park dates.
Hiking the Subway, Zion National Park, Utah: Such is the popularity of clambering along this surreal 400-metre slot canyon that an online lottery is held for all post-March permits. Entries must be submitted three months prior to planned trips, with status-notification e-mails sent to applicants on the fifth day of the following month.
FEBRUARY Dining on the Ocean Floor, Burntcoat Head Park, N.S.: A perennially sold-out summer series of six day-long events, this unique Maritime experience begins with a guided foraging expedition. Next, guests head to the top of Burntcoat’s red cliffs to lunch on fresh Nova Scotia seafood paired with local craft beer and wine. A private tour of the Cobequid Bay park follows, and then comes the main attraction: A three-course meal on the ocean floor, which six hours later will be 15 metres underwater. Dates for 2020 will be released in late January, with seats going on sale in early February.
MARCH The Last Supper, Milan: Guided tours in English of the Santa Maria delle Grazie monastery, where Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic mural covers an entire wall of the dining hall, tend to sell out several weeks ahead of time, with weeks turning into months over Italy’s busy summer season.
APRIL London Marathon: Should you want to work off more than a few sumptuous meals, the ballot to enter the 2021 London Marathon will likely open on April 24 – two days before the race itself – if 2019 timing is anything to go by.
MAY Namaste Niagara: If you’re looking to add some awe-inspiring majesty to your yoga sessions, this popular weekend program should do the trick. From July 6 to Aug. 1, Namaste Niagara uses the lower platform of the selfexplanatory Journey Behind the Falls attraction to combine the mindfulness of morning yoga with the peerless power of Ontario’s Horseshoe Falls. After the sessions, guests drive up the Niagara Parkway for a locallysourced breakfast overlooking the churning Niagara River and bucolic parkway. Tickets, which sell out quickly, will be available in May.

These are the top stories:
Inuit pop singer Kelly Fraser, who died by suicide, had been seeking help for PTSD
The singer-songwriter who garnered worldwide attention with her Inuktitut cover of Rihanna'sDiamondsdied by suicide at the age of 26 on Christmas Eve,her family said.
"Kelly suffered from PTSD for many years as a result of childhood traumas, racism and persistent cyberbullying," the family's statement said. "She was actively seeking help and spoke openly about her personal challenges online and through her journey."
Fraser blended her cultural influences, singing and rapping in both English and Inuktitut. She was nominated for a Juno and was recently crowdfunding for her third album, Decolonize.
Inuit have among the highest suicide rates in the world; in 2017, the rate was 106 for every 100,000 people.
In the wake of Fraser's death, NDP MP Charlie Angus reiterated his call for a national suicide-prevention strategy.
If you are having thoughts of suicide, call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868 or Crisis Service Canada at 1-833-456-4566, or visit crisisservicescanada.ca.

Dozens of flights have been cancelled in Montreal and Ottawa
Freezing rain and snow prompted Air Canada and WestJet to scrap or delaytrips during the busy holiday season. More than 70 departures were cancelled in Montreal alone as the airlines sought to cancel shorter flights that would disrupt fewer passengers.
Freezing rain poses a greater safety risk than snow because it gets on every part of a plane, an Air Canada spokesperson said.
Travellers leaving Montreal are also bracing for further disruptions should workers who fuel planes launch a strike action on Jan. 1.
Nissan's former chairman has fled Japan for Lebanon as his trial looms
Carlos Ghosnhas landed in Beirutmonths ahead of an expected trial for charges of hiding income and financial misconduct.
"I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution," he said in a statement, blaming a "rigged" Japanese justice system.
Ghosn holds French and Lebanese passports. Still, it's unclear how he was able to leave Japan while he was under heavy surveillance. Lebanon doesn't have an extradition treaty with Japan.
The 65-year-old's lawyers have said the charges are rooted in a conspiracy to oust him from Nissan in order to prevent a merger with France's Renault SA.
The repatriation of Canadarm-maker MDA comes at a critical time in the new space race
The acquisition by Jim Balsillie, John Risley and their investor group takes place just as global tech heavyweights prepare to launch thousands of satellites into orbit in the hopes of beaming internet services from space - initiatives that could use MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Inc. gear.
The purchase also solves some sticky problems for Ottawa,Jeffrey Jones writes: "It would have been much more troublesome for the Trudeau government to fund, say, a new Canadarm for NASA's next project - the Lunar Gateway space station - if the main contractor for the Maple Leaf-emblazoned grabber was being sold to another foreign buyer, in a deal requiring heightened national security scrutiny."

Iraq protesters break into U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad:The U.S. airstrikes on Sunday were inresponse to an Iraqi militia attack, but they have resulted in the most serious political crisis in years for the United States in Iraq, stoking anti-Americanism and handing an advantage to Iran in its competition for influence in the country.
Sydney sets off fireworks despite fires:The Australian city's iconic waterfront New Year's Eve fireworks display went ahead as scheduled even as smokeblanketed the regionfrom nearby wildfires. Three people were feared dead while thousands were trapped at a seaside town.
Russia's campaign to influence Mozambique election:Two months after the country's vote, Facebookhas uncovereda network of fake Mozambican pages with links to a Russian disinformation expert. The effort gave a boost to the ruling party in the days before the election.
MORNING MARKETS
Global equities driftedon Tuesday while the U.S. dollar ended 2019 on a subdued note following a buoyant year of stock market gains, driven in recent weeks by hopes of an imminent U.S.-China trade deal. MSCI's global share index was treading water but is on track for a 24 per cent rise in 2019 - the index's best performance in almost a decade. In Europe, equity markets were mixed in early trading, with Britain's FTSE slipping 0.4 per cent while France's CAC was little changed in thin trading. Germany's DAX was closed.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Yet again, another hate crime against Jews. Yet again, we hope the world will wake up
David Shribman: "These horrifying incidents have lost their ability to shock. They have become part of the background music of our time, a dirge that in its tragic, repetitive tones almost mimics the sound of shotgun fire."
TODAY'S EDITORIAL CARTOON
HOLIDAY READS
The Globe's top long-form stories of 2019
Here's a look at some of the pieces thatstood outto our readers this year:
How the RCMP found Canada's most wanted fugitives with a raven, a Cree trapper and luck
Searching for Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky in the dense forests of Northern Manitoba was like finding a needle in a haystack, but through perseverance and chance, the pursuersfound where their trail ended.
Brainstorm: How my 'mild concussion' became a dizzying, year-long ordeal
Most concussion patients are symptom-free within weeks. Reporter Kathryn Blaze Baum spent monthsstuck in a fog of pain, tinnitus, disorientation and health-care bureaucracy. How can someone heal when their brain won't co-operate?
David Milgaard works to help free other innocent people - even though it opens the wounds of his past
In 1969, he was arrested for a murder he didn't commit, and spent 23 years in prison as an innocent man. In his most in-depth interview in decades, David Milgaardtalked toJana G. Pruden about living in the shadow of a wrongful conviction, and what it means to be free.
The life-changing magic of making do
The antidote to endless, thoughtless consumption lies not in purging ourselves of the stuff we own, but rather, redefining our relationship with stuff altogether,Benjamin Leszcz writes.
MOMENT IN TIME
Guy Lombardo plays Auld Lang Syne for the last time
Dec. 31, 1976: For almost half a century, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians helped millions of people usher out the old year and bring in the new with their classic rendition of Auld Lang Syne, the beloved Scottish tune about the importance of cherishing lifelong friends. As a kid growing up in London, Ont., which had a large Scottish community, Lombardo had adopted the tradition of saluting the end of a year withAuld Lang Syne, a song everyone intrinsically loves but few actually know the lyrics to. When he and his band moved to New York in the late 1920s, they brought the custom with them, performing it for the first time at a New Year's concert at the Roosevelt Hotel. Thousands of New Yorkers heard the radio broadcast and loved it. Auld Lang Synebecame Lombardo's de facto theme song, earning him the nickname "Mr. New Year's Eve." In 1959, the Waldorf Astoria hotel wooed him away and, for the next 17 years, he and his Royal Canadians did a live TV broadcast from its Grand Ballroom that was seen in homes around the world. Lombardo died in November of 1977, at the age of 75. The ancient Scottish song he helped to popularize lives on, however, and still plays after the ball drops in Times Square. -Gayle MacDonald

Full text: The days shrink and night expands further into our waking hours. There are fewer chances to turn our faces toward the sun, and so we find other sources of warmth.
Many mainstream celebrations of fire and light are familiar. Kwanzaa. Hanukkah. Christmas. Others might be less so and offer an opportunity to learn about our neighbours. Pancha Ganapati is a Hindu holiday for Lord Ganesha, in which pine boughs and bamboo are decorated with blinking lights. The festival of Sadeh is "to honour fire and to defeat the forces of darkness, frost and cold" in mid-winter, according to the Iran Chamber Society( http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/festival_of_sadeh.php ).
Gifts of candles were given during the unrestrained Roman celebration Saturnalia, and for Hogmanay the Scots traditionally welcomed the new year with fireworks and whiskey.
The winter solstice is Dec. 21. That day, the sun sets in Montreal at 4:13 p.m. Pagans of old and their modern-day counterparts lit bonfires and stayed awake through the longest night of the year to be the first to welcome back the sun. My family, the Juhls, may celebrate the solstice with the Feast of Juul, an ancient Scandinavian celebration during which a yule log is burned to honour Thor.
Whatever your celebration - ancient, secular or godly - the good thing about winter's darkness is you can take the children to a nighttime light show and barely miss bedtime. Here are some ways you can welcome back the sun this December.
POP! by Gentilhomme is a light show that includes animation on the side of UQAM's Pavillon Président-Kennedy.
The Marche de Noël aux flambeaux is a community-style parade, with music pouring from balconies along de la Roche St., courtesy of such choirs as Ensemble vocal Les Jongleurs, Les Nanas, Les Petites Voix du Plateau et Les Voix Ferrées. Exchange non-perishable food items (or $2) for a torch to use on the Dec. 7 candlelit walk, which begins at 7 p.m. at Compagnons Park and ends at La Fontaine Park. Clay and Friends will perform, and at 8 p.m. the skies will explode with fireworks. mont-royal.net.( https://www.mont-royal.net/evenements/2019-12-07/la-marche-de-noel-aux-flambeaux/ )
Luminothérapie at Place des Festivals is celebrating its 10th birthday with a "POP!" by introducing five Gumby-like creatures: Pop, Popup, Popli, Popette and Popotin. "Gather in front of them," organizers say, "and your collective energy will awaken the whole gang." The colourful creatures will project a story on the wall of UQAM's Pavillon Président-Kennedy. Nearby, holiday activities run throughout December at Place Émilie-Gamelin. The POP! installation continues until Jan. 26. quartierdesspectacles.com( https://www.quartierdesspectacles.com/fr/a-propos/les-productions-du-partenariat/oeuvre/85/POP/ ).
The Fontaine boréale at Complexe Desjardins is a light, sound and water show that runs several times a day until Dec. 31. It features four five-minute "magical moods" that can be viewed from any floor of the mall. The installation is part of Le Noël de Lëon, which also boasts an orchestra, miniature train, carousel ($2 per ride) and the "real" Santa Claus. Noël de Lëon runs until Dec. 24. Monday to Friday 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closes at 3 p.m. on Dec. 24. 150 Ste-Catherine St. W. Showtimes for the fountain vary, and are listed at complexedesjardins.com( http://complexedesjardins.com/en/events/the-fontaine-boreale-show ).
The music of John Williams provides the soundtrack to fireworks in the Old Port of Montreal as part of Fire on Ice, presented on Saturdays from Dec. 14 to Jan. 4, 2020.
Aura Basilica is a series of multimedia installations projected onto the art and architecture of Notre-Dame Basilica. Visitors first tour the basilica, pausing to watch paintings come to life with eerie, quiet music in the background. For the second part of the show, guests sit in pews - there are no bad seats for this - and watch as the ceiling becomes the canvas for a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind orchestral light show. $15.50-$26.50, children 5 and under free. 110 Notre-Dame St. W. aurabasiliquemontreal.com( https://www.aurabasiliquemontreal.com/en/ ).
If the music of John Williams is your thing (and why wouldn't it be?), make some time for Fire on Ice. Fireworks will erupt over the outdoor skating rink at the Old Port Basin, their colours complimenting lights on the ice and over Terrasses Bonsecours. The sky is free, but day passes for the rink are $5.22-$7.83. Children 5 and under are free. Fireworks are Dec. 14, 21, 28 and Jan. 4, 8 p.m. oldportofmontreal.com( https://www.oldportofmontreal.com/event/fire-ice ).
Explore more at the Montreal Science Centre's new permanent exhibit, which has an entire section on light. Seven activity zones encourage exploration of geometry, air, motion, coding, matter, water and - you got it - light. There's also a gigantic bubble and an air labyrinth for mind-blowing scientific amusement. Weekdays 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., weekends 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. $9-$12.50. Children 2 and under free. Old Port, at the foot of St-Laurent Blvd. montrealsciencecentre.com( https://www.montrealsciencecentre.com/permanent-exhibition/explore ).
As you visit these attractions, find a way to detour to one or several of Cité mémoire's Grand tableau installations. Stories inspired by Montreal's history are projected onto walls throughout Old Montreal, the Old Port and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, and each chapter has a tantalizing name, like Babylon of the North, The First Executioner and The Beaver Rebellion. Apps available from Apple or Google add a "soundtrack and historical context available in four languages." montrealenhistoires.com( http://www.montrealenhistoires.com/en/cite-memoire/ ).
Using more than 10 million lights, Illumi calls itself the largest multimedia sound and light show on the plant. Illumi is an offshoot of Cavalia, and runs until Jan. 5, 2020, in Laval.
Illumi, Féerie de lumières comes alive in the most unlikely place: just off Highway 15 in Laval. The 47-metre-high tree is the jewel in the crown, and visitors travel through eight gems of the world to get there, from the Infinite Poles of north and south to the savannahs of Africa. Find exotic animals, Hollywood stars, a fire pit and interactive games under what Illumi calls the world's largest tree of lights. Free shuttles are available from the Montmorency métro station or, if you must drive, two free mini-trains take visitors to the site from satellite parking lots ($10). $14.50-$18.50. Children 2 and under free. VIP tickets are available. Purchase is by time slot, Tuesday to Thursday 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., Friday to Sunday 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. 2805 Souvenir Blvd., Laval. illumi.com/en/( https://www.illumi.com/en/ ).
There are 300,000 fairy lights along the Route des Gerbes d'Angelica in Mirabel. In summer, this is a series of 14 themed gardens. As the days get shorter, the enchanted forest is illuminated and children get the run of the place. There's animation, plus a bistro and food truck for hungry imps. Take the clown car, because the cost is $30 per vehicle, no matter how many people are in it. Friday-Sunday, 3 p.m.-9 p.m. (closes at 8 p.m. on certain dates; check the website). 6015 Rang St-Vincent, Mirabel. gerbesdangelica.com( https://www.gerbesdangelica.com/ ).
A ridiculously simple winter craft for the Feast of Juul, decorated by Hayley, Trevor and Jillian Juhl.
The easiest winter craft in the world
You'll need: battery-operated tea lights, a Sharpie, glue, some construction paper, ribbon, or leftover craft supplies. Whatever you have lying around.
You're making a snowman. The flame of the light is their nose. Use a Sharpie to draw on eyes and a mouth, and make a hat with construction paper. You can add bows or use pompoms as earmuffs - let your imagination go wild.
You can prop up your little snowperson or glue a ribbon to their back to turn it into an ornament.
Don't forget to name them.
Light up the Instagram challenge
Each week, we invite our readers to show us the Montreal they know by participating in a #mtlfriday challenge on social media. This week, show us your ornaments. Maybe it's on a tree, maybe it lives on a shelf; all interpretations are valid.

You're making a snowman. The flame of the light is their nose. Use a Sharpie to draw on eyes and a mouth, and make a hat with construction paper. You can add bows or use pompoms as earmuffs - let your imagination go wild.
You can prop up your little snowperson or glue a ribbon to their back to turn it into an ornament.

Full text: The days shrink and night expands farther into our waking hours. There are fewer chances to turn our faces toward the sun, and so we find other sources of warmth.
Many mainstream celebrations of fire and light are familiar. Kwanzaa. Hanukkah. Christmas. Others might be less so and offer an opportunity to learn about our neighbours. Pancha Ganapati is a Hindu holiday for Lord Ganesha, in which pine boughs and bamboo are decorated with blinking lights. The festival of Sadeh is "to honour fire and to defeat the forces of darkness, frost and cold" in mid-winter, according to the Iran Chamber Society( http://www.iranchamber.com/culture/articles/festival_of_sadeh.php ).
Gifts of candles were given during the unrestrained Roman celebration Saturnalia, and for Hogmanay the Scots traditionally welcomed the new year with fireworks and whiskey.
The winter solstice is Dec. 21. That day, the sun sets in Montreal at 4:13 p.m. Pagans of old and their modern-day counterparts lit bonfires and stayed awake through the longest night of the year to be the first to welcome back the sun. My family, the Juhls, may celebrate the solstice with the Feast of Juul, an ancient Scandinavian celebration during which a yule log is burned to honour Thor.
Whatever your celebration - ancient, secular or godly - the good thing about winter's darkness is you can take the children to a nighttime light show and barely miss bedtime. Here are some ways you can welcome back the sun this December.
POP! by Gentilhomme is a light show that includes animation on the side of UQAM's Pavillon Président-Kennedy.
The Marche de Noël aux flambeaux is a community-style parade, with music pouring from balconies along de la Roche St., courtesy of such choirs as Ensemble vocal Les Jongleurs, Les Nanas, Les Petites Voix du Plateau et Les Voix Ferrées. Exchange non-perishable food items (or $2) for a torch to use on the Dec. 7 candlelit walk, which begins at 7 p.m. at Compagnons Park and ends at La Fontaine Park. Clay and Friends will perform, and at 8 p.m. the skies will explode with fireworks. mont-royal.net.( https://www.mont-royal.net/evenements/2019-12-07/la-marche-de-noel-aux-flambeaux/ )
Luminothérapie at Place des Festivals is celebrating its 10th birthday with a "POP!" by introducing five Gumby-like creatures: Pop, Popup, Popli, Popette and Popotin. "Gather in front of them," organizers say, "and your collective energy will awaken the whole gang." The colourful creatures will project a story on the wall of UQAM's Pavillon Président-Kennedy. Nearby, holiday activities run throughout December at Place Émilie-Gamelin. The POP! installation continues until Jan. 26. quartierdesspectacles.com( https://www.quartierdesspectacles.com/fr/a-propos/les-productions-du-partenariat/oeuvre/85/POP/ ).
The Fontaine boréale at Complexe Desjardins is a light, sound and water show that runs several times a day until Dec. 31. It features four five-minute "magical moods" that can be viewed from any floor of the mall. The installation is part of Le Noël de Lëon, which also boasts an orchestra, miniature train, carousel ($2 per ride) and the "real" Santa Claus. Noël de Lëon runs until Dec. 24. Monday to Friday 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closes at 3 p.m. on Dec. 24. 150 Ste-Catherine St. W. Showtimes for the fountain vary, and are listed at complexedesjardins.com( http://complexedesjardins.com/en/events/the-fontaine-boreale-show ).
The music of John Williams provides the soundtrack to fireworks in the Old Port of Montreal as part of Fire on Ice, presented on Saturdays from Dec. 14 to Jan. 4, 2020.
Aura Basilica is a series of multimedia installations projected onto the art and architecture of Notre-Dame Basilica. Visitors first tour the basilica, pausing to watch paintings come to life with eerie, quiet music in the background. For the second part of the show, guests sit in pews - there are no bad seats for this - and watch as the ceiling becomes the canvas for a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind orchestral light show. $15.50-$26.50, children 5 and under free. 110 Notre-Dame St. W. aurabasiliquemontreal.com( https://www.aurabasiliquemontreal.com/en/ ).
If the music of John Williams is your thing (and why wouldn't it be?), make some time for Fire on Ice. Fireworks will erupt over the outdoor skating rink at the Old Port Basin, their colours complimenting lights on the ice and over Terrasses Bonsecours. The sky is free, but day passes for the rink are $5.22-$7.83. Children 5 and under are free. Fireworks are Dec. 14, 21, 28 and Jan. 4, 8 p.m. oldportofmontreal.com( https://www.oldportofmontreal.com/event/fire-ice ).
Explore more at the Montreal Science Centre's new permanent exhibit, which has an entire section on light. Seven activity zones encourage exploration of geometry, air, motion, coding, matter, water and - you got it - light. There's also a gigantic bubble and an air labyrinth for mind-blowing scientific amusement. Weekdays 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., weekends 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. $9-$12.50. Children 2 and under free. Old Port, at the foot of St-Laurent Blvd. montrealsciencecentre.com( https://www.montrealsciencecentre.com/permanent-exhibition/explore ).
As you visit these attractions, find a way to detour to one or several of Cité mémoire's Grand tableau installations. Stories inspired by Montreal's history are projected onto walls throughout Old Montreal, the Old Port and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, and each chapter has a tantalizing name, like Babylon of the North, The First Executioner and The Beaver Rebellion.

Montreal's birds are vanishing - and that's bad for all of us

Full text: Just to the north of the runways of Montreal's Trudeau International Airport, a gaggle of birders squeeze their way between towering cattails and leafy green reeds on an autumn Sunday to emerge upon an unexpected oasis, the Canadian equivalent of a waterhole in the African savanna.
Mallards and Canada geese by the dozen paddle through a vast pond in the Ipex Wetland as great egrets draped in frocks of glaring white spear ill-fated frogs at the shoreline. Green herons squabble over a plump dragonfly while on the mud flats, spotted sandpipers, killdeers and semipalmated plovers keep a wary eye on the Cooper's hawk surveying breakfast options from the branches of a dead tree.
The scene is all the more incongruous for its location: the wetland is perched precariously in the southern sector of a high-tech industrial park in the St-Laurent borough known as Technoparc Montréal, where 100 businesses with 7,000 employees have carved out space from forest and swamp over the last 30 years. The wetland got its unofficial name because it's located right next to Ipex, an international firm that builds plastic piping. The trail to the marsh runs alongside the firm's chain link fence.
The wild fringes of the Technoparc have become one of the city's premiere viewing spots because of its combination of wetlands, open fields and forests where birds can feed and breed in safety. In the space of a year, birders there have recorded 176 of the 250 bird species( https://montrealgazette.com/news/environmentalists-bird-enthusiasts-flock-to-technoparc-to-raise-awareness ) that live in Montreal, or use it as a stopover point on their north-south migrations, making it the most varied bird habitat in the city. Even in the depths of winter, the forests play home to hawks, owls and several non-migratory species.
But the wetlands are also emblematic of the uneasy balance and ongoing battle between commercial development and ecological preservation. None of the land within the Technoparc is protected, and most is mortgaged and up for sale.
Even in little known oases like the Technoparc, unregulated development poses a constant threat. Developers paid by the city put in a road and dike in 2017 that reduced the size of Montreal's largest wetlands by more than half.
"You should have seen this place in 2016," says professional ornithologist Joël Coutu, who leads regular bird-watching tours through the area. "It was like the Everglades."
Environmentalist received some happy news in late August with the announcement that Montreal's airport authority is turning 19 hectares of federal forest and marshland adjacent to the Technoparc, north of the airport and to the east of Golf Dorval, into a protected ecological park( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/new-ecological-park-to-be-created-north-of-montreals-trudeau-airport ). But ecologists say the fight to preserve the Technoparc lands is still crucial.
"You can see there are far fewer birds than there were just two or three years ago," says ornithologist Joël Coutu, who leads regular birdwatching tours through the Technoparc area.
The natural bounty of the site lies in contrast to the darker side of the big picture: the populations of one-quarter of Canada's bird species are on the decline, with several in free fall. Nimble flyers like chimney swifts and shore swallows that feed on insects have seen their numbers drop by more than 95 per cent since the 1970s, victims to pesticides, chemical pollution and a loss of habitat. In cities like Montreal, the dearth of chimneys and dead trees, slowly eradicated by the inexorable forces of development, has contributed to their fall. As with many species, climate change is also playing a role.
The bird population in Canada and the United States has experienced a net loss of nearly 3 billion birds, or 29 per cent of its total, since 1970, according to a study published in Science magazine( https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2019/09/18/science.aaw1313 ) in September. "This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse," the authors wrote.
Tragedy for bird species is also troubling for humankind, because their well-being is directly linked to our own. Healthy natural environments for birds means human populations will experience less flooding and erosion issues, better filtering of groundwater, and an increase in property values. It also translates into more habitat for all forms of wildlife, and the opportunity for citizens to find serenity in nature.
"What is good for birds is good for us," wrote the authors of The State of Canada's Birds, an overview of the country's avian population published this summer by Environment and Climate Change Canada with the aid of all provinces and territories, on behalf of the North American Bird Conservation Initiative Canada (NABCI).
Birds have long served as bellwethers for the human environment, their more delicate constitutions warning of unseen toxins.
"I think a world unfit for birds is unfit for humans," said David Bird, professor emeritus of wildlife biology at McGill University and a former longtime bird columnist for the Montreal Gazette.
"They act as canaries in the coal mine, which is basically what they're doing right now. The world is going to hell in a handbasket, and unless you do something about it ... You lose your birds first, then you guys are next."

Winner and loser species
"The avifauna of Montreal is in a constant state of flux," Bird notes, with some species emerging as winners and others as losers.
The 2019 State of Canada's Birds Survey( http://nabci.net/wp-content/uploads/39-004-Canada-State-of-Birds_EN_WEB-1.pdf ), which compared today's bird populations with those of 70 years ago, found one-quarter of the country's 449 species were declining rapidly, while another quarter were on the upswing and the rest holding steady.
Among the biggest winners were geese, waterfowl and duck species, buoyed by the efforts of ecological groups and hunting organizations that raised millions for wetland conservation projects. Raptors like peregrine falcons, Cooper's hawks, merlins and bald eagles, once on the brink of extinction because the pesticide DDT thinned their eggshells, are up 110 per cent since the 1970s thanks to international pesticide bans, and the birds' ability to adapt to urban milieus.

"Peregrine falcons and others learned to use Montreal's skyscrapers like cliff faces," Bird said. They also benefited from an abundance of pigeons and other urban delicacies to prey on, including back yard feeder birds like sparrows, northern cardinals and woodpeckers that have also seen a resurgence.
Canada's wetland birds, nesting seabirds and forest birds have stayed mostly stable. But grassland species like meadowlarks and Swainson's hawks have suffered a drop of 300 million birds since 1970 as agriculture overwhelms their habitats here and abroad. Shorebirds that depend on coastal areas and inland wetlands for breeding and wintering have seen their numbers drop by 40 per cent.
"The question is often just about space," said Marie-Anne Hudson, co-author of the State of Canada's Birds Survey and a senior bird surveys biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service at Environment and Climate Change Canada.
"We humans love our coastlines, at the risk of our shorebirds," many of which are travelling thousands of miles between the Arctic and South America, and need to eat regularly to maintain muscle and fat. "We're losing habitat to shoreline development, and there are ways that you can mitigate that, like setting aside the land, and carefully managing beaches so that shorebirds can reach them during this really brief window."
There are also little things that can be done that people don't think about, Hudson notes, like not letting their dogs run on beaches during migration periods "and scaring the crap out of all of these shorebirds."
Canadian seabirds - including species that nest in Canada or elsewhere and rely on our waters to feed - are in crisis worldwide, with 95 per cent considered at risk due to ingesting plastics, habitat loss and the destruction of bird colonies wrought by more frequent storms.
Aerial insectivores - birds that capture insects while in flight - have taken the hardest hit, mirroring the losses suffered by birds of prey in the 1950s.
The agile barn swallows and swifts that once flitted and swooped through Montreal's skies are a rarity now in eastern North America, for reasons not entirely understood. Part of the cause may be a marked decline in insect populations, with some studies estimating the overall global biomass of insects has dropped 40 per cent due to pesticide use.
A Great Grey Owl is a rare sighting in the Montreal area.
The causes
The No. 1 reason for falling bird populations is habitat loss. The trend toward monoculture food crops that drain marshes and uproot forests removes crucial feeding and nesting sites.
Urban development means fewer grasslands, forests, shorelines and wetlands in which to live, or stop over for a life-sustaining rest and food before continuing on a migratory journey. Montreal's Nuns' Island was once one of the best owl sites in the province, with half a dozen varieties visible there. Condo development that left no forest uprooted put an end to that.
Until recently in Montreal's Technoparc, birders would see 15 or 16 egrets and herons at the same time. In 2017, Technoparc Montréal, the city-funded non-profit agency responsible for attracting developers, put in a dike and a road that shrunk the marshes. Now, just one or two herons or egrets are typically spotted in the same area. The agency was disbanded by the city( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/technoparc-montreal-shakeup-brings-hope-to-environmentalists ) last year over concerns of mismanagement.
"You can see there are far fewer birds than there were just two or three years ago," Coutu said.
A station of the coming REM train line is being installed next door, causing further disturbance, although developers did agree to tunnel under the wetlands to preserve them.
In Montreal and throughout Canada, the rebirth of raptors like peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks has come at the expense of the American Kestrel, which is North America's smallest falcon and prey to the larger birds.
Agriculture producers have been winning the pesticide war on insects, leaving less food for birds, or poisoning them. A recent study published by the journal Science showed migratory birds like the white-crowned sparrow became anorexic after eating seeds laced with neonicotinoids( https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/common-pesticide-makes-migrating-birds-anorexic ), an agricultural pesticide commonly linked to the death of bees. Since many of Canada's birds migrate south, issues in stopover spots or nesting areas in the United States, Mexico and South America resonate here.
"Look at the Amazon," Bird said, referring to the widespread fires decimating forests and agricultural fields in South America. "If we destroy the habitat down there, it's the same effect as destroying it up here."
Climate change has also been wreaking havoc. Shifts in temperatures mean birds may arrive only to find the insects they normally feed on have not yet appeared. Increased wildfires, drought and sea levels contribute to a loss of habitat. A rise in the number and severity of storms means more migrating birds are killed en route, and shorebirds are seeing their colonies wiped out. Single-use plastics and chemical and oil spills are another hazard.

Reasons for hope
Coutu gazes at the great egrets and the imposing great blue herons, the Cooper's hawks and merlins flying over the marshlands in the centre of Montreal and sees a resurgence.
"These birds are all top predators - they're at the top of the food chain. If they can survive here, things are in good shape."
The Technoparc region is home to six birds of prey, including the red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks and the Northern Harrier. In the fall, six species of owls nest in the region, the only place in Quebec where you can spot so many species of the reclusive bird in one day. Waterfowl are abundant, signs that wide-scale conservation efforts like the North American Waterfowl Management Plan started in 1986, which has protected 80,000 square kilometres of Canadian wetlands and surrounding lands, can work.
Sightings in the Technoparc area of the at-risk least bittern, one of the world's smallest species of herons, and the endangered wood thrush could also improve chances the area will be protected.
"I'm not against development," Coutu said. "I understand there is an economic need. But I feel it can be done in a more ecological way, by building new industries near other existing industries, and not in the middle of a wetland."
Recent news about the ecological park being created nearby, and that Montreal is working to build the largest urban park in Canada,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-announces-plan-to-build-montreals-largest-urban-park ) called the Great Western Park, protecting 3,000 hectares of green space, means more habitat.
Here at home, citizens can help by restricting the movements of house cats, which kill millions of birds every year, and bird-proofing their windows to limit deadly collisions.
The new Champlain Bridge is using blue and green lights during migratory periods to lessen bird collisions.
Hudson put Feather Friendly Tape( https://www.featherfriendly.com/feather-friendly-solution-for-do-it-yourself-residential-applications/ )on her windows, a product made in Toronto that has small white dots spaced a couple inches apart, to deter birds. She also suggests window companies apply an ultra-violet film invisible to humans but visible to birds to their windows, and creating FLAP programs (Fatal Light Awareness Programs) that exist in cities like Toronto to rescue birds that have collided with the windows of buildings. Even the new Champlain Bridge is using blue and green lights( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/theyve-turned-on-the-lights-on-montreals-new-champlain-bridge ) as opposed to white during migratory periods to lessen bird collisions.
Above all, Hudson recommends citizens act as lobbyists, writing directly to companies that benefit from bird-threatening measures, like using habitat-destroying palm oil in their products, to say they will no longer buy their products unless they change.
"If enough of us do that, I'm hoping that they'll think with their dollars and say 'Okay, if we change this small part of our manufacturing process, then we can regain these customers.' "
Bird recommends buying "bird-friendly" coffee, made by growers who leave natural spaces for birds to nest in their plantations. Promoting green growth in back yards and putting up bird feeders are things people can do immediately, and see the impact, even right outside their windows.
"I just can't imagine being in a world where the only birds I'm going to see in my back yard are starlings and gulls and house sparrows," Bird said.
"All the bird populations are an important part of our culture and an important part of our environment. And if things aren't good for them, they're not going to be good for us."

Full text: Rufus Wainwright dresses up as Anna Wintour in his new video. Less than a week after Halloween, the Montreal singer-songwriter poses in drag as the famed Vogue editor-in-chief in the clip for his new song, Trouble In Paradise.
Directed and produced by Montrealer Mia Donovan, the black-and-white shows Wainwright staring into the camera - alternately uncomfortably, laconically, blankly and emotionally - at fairly close range.
He wears a blond bob wig, Wintour's iconic sunglasses and various necklaces. As the song proceeds, Wainwright ends up shirtless, with a hairnet, and later appears with his salt-and-pepper beard, sporting a leather jacket.
The video ends with images of what look like the California forest fires.
Steeped in lush, soulful harmonies and backed by slow, steady, country-tinged beat, it's a classic Wainwright torch song.
The first single off Wainwright's new album, his first proper studio release since 2012's Out of the Game, it talks about how appearances can be deceiving:
"There's always trouble in paradise," he sings. "Don't matter if your drinks are neat or on ice / There's always trouble in paradise / Don't matter if you're good or bad, or mean or awfully nice."

Full text: Leonard Cohen had a great sense of humour, but what strikes me most about his new video, Happens to the Heart, is how devoid of humour it is.
On Friday, Sony Music launched this "new" Cohen song, one of the tracks on the posthumous album Thanks for the Dance, which will be released Nov. 22. Cohen, arguably the most famous singer-songwriter to ever come out of Montreal, died on Nov. 7, 2016, at the age of 82.
Thanks for the Dance was built from bits and pieces of songs left over from the making of Cohen's last album, You Want It Darker, and was pulled together by his son Adam. The album features Daniel Lanois, Damien Rice, Beck, Feist, Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry and others.
The video for Happens to the Heart is directed by Daniel Askill, who has made videos for Sia and French band Phoenix, and is inspired by Cohen's experience as a Buddhist monk. It shows a young man walking through a lush forest; at the beginning, he is filmed from behind at a distance, wearing a Cohen-esque outfit, including a fedora and a dark trench coat. He eventually takes off all his clothes, meets a person who looks like a Buddhist monk and is given Buddhist robes. In the final shot, he sits on the edge of a cliff amid a bucolic landscape and begins to levitate.
Honestly, it's almost a Saturday Night Live spoof of a Cohen video. Happily, the song is quite good - maybe as good as anything on You Want It Darker - with a strong melody and some of Cohen's best lyrics in years. And yes the lyrics are quite droll.
It opens with this verse: "I was always working steady /But I never called it art /I got my s-t together /Meeting Christ and reading Marx."
And climaxes with this: "I had no trouble betting /On the flood, against the ark /You see, I knew about the ending /What happens to the heart."
That's Cohen at his best: funny, self-deprecating, insightful on matters of the heart.
The video is part of a bigger project from the digital channel Nowness that involves acclaimed filmmakers creating videos to accompany these songs.
In a statement, Nowness creative director Bunny Kinney said: "Our ambition with this series of short films is not only to uphold and celebrate Leonard Cohen's incredible artistic legacy with new visuals, helmed by some of the most exciting image-makers working today, but to also further explore Cohen's work and the core the matics of his music: from love and loss to artistic expression itself, identity, self-reflection, transformation and transcendence."
In another statement, Adam Cohen commented on Thanks for the Dance: "In composing and arranging the music for his words, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us. What moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. 'Leonard lives!' they say, one after the other."
I look forward to hearing the album, but watching the video, I feel it misses Cohen's personality. I remember the first time I met him, over smoked-meat sandwiches on the Main in 1989, around the time of his greatest album, I'm Your Man. I entered the restaurant expecting to meet a dark, dour poet, and left an hour later blown away by this remarkable man with a finely tuned sense of humour and a gentleness I had never witnessed from major entertainment stars. bkelly@postmedia.com Twitter.com/brendanshowbiz

Albums we never saw coming: From Bedouin Soundclash’s first record in nine years to a posthumous release from Leonard Cohen, these works have surprised – and thrilled – their fans

Full text: We live in age when albums arrive unannounced, so much as left at our doorsteps some time overnight. So while it’s hard to say any album is “unexpected,” the following albums were all surprising, one even coming from the grave.
TEGAN AND SARA: HEY, I’M JUST LIKE YOU The identical-twin Quins Tegan and Sara, who never forget each other’s birthdays, just turned 39.
It’s an odd time for a coming-ofage album, but here we are. It’s called Hey, I’m Just Like You, a synth-pop collection of reinvented songs recently unearthed from old cassette tapes of material written by the Calgary natives between the ages of 15 and 17.
Twelve tracks of teenage melodrama were recorded this spring in Vancouver with an all-female team led by Australian producer Alex Hope. I Know I’m Not the Only One has a line about backflips and “I’m upside down,” which rhymes with Tom Petty’s I Won’t Back Down and sounds like it, too. The album, accompanied by the duo’s memoir High School, is something much more tame than Carole Pope’s High School Confidential, but, then, Pope wrote that postgrad.
BEDOUIN SOUNDCLASH: MASS After a tour in 2012, the ska-rocking Bedouin Soundclash was “tapped out,” according to singer Jay Malinowski. He went on to pen an illustrated novella and release three solo records without bandmate Eon Sinclair. “Eon and I told each other we’d do something again only if we had something creatively to say,” Malinowski told The Globe and Mail. Not long ago, Malinowski was noodling on the piano when a song that sounded Bedouin-like came to him. He added a break-beat and sampled some big-band swing and sent the demo to Sinclair. From there, a long-dormant idea to work with Ben Jaffe of Preservation Hall Jazz Band was resurrected, resulting in MASS, a just-released contemporary-music experiment in electronica, Afro-pop and traditional New Orleans Jazz. The album (Bedouin’s first in nine years) was mostly cut in Marigny Studios in New Orleans, with one track (Edges of the Night) recorded live in two takes at Preservation Hall.
CELINE DION: COURAGE “I would be lying if I said I’m fine, I think of you at least a hundred times/‘Cause in the echo of my voice I hear your words, just like you’re there.” More than three years after the death of her manager-husband René Angélil, on Nov. 15, the pop diva Celine Dion will release her first English album since 2013’s Loved Me Back to Life. The title track to Courage (one of three singles released last month) is an earnest anthem sung to an arena’s last row, written by a song-crafting team that includes Stephan Moccio. Dion might well have drifted quietly into irrelevancy, but what we’re seeing is power-ballad perseverance. Health willing, mind you.
The so-called Dionaissance was put on hold recently when a lingering cold forced the cancellation of a series of concerts. Hearts will go on, but a diva needs her voice.
BRUCE COCKBURN: CROWING IGNITES In these days of demagoguery and environmental angst, one might have thought the outspoken Bruce Cockburn would have something to say politically. Instead we get Crowing Ignites, an eloquent but voiceless album that is more safe harbour than soap box. “There’s some expectation that I’m supposed to come out with something that says ‘Donald Trump is bad,’ but we all know that already,” Cockburn, 74, told The Globe. The acoustic Crowing Ignites was recorded with producer Colin Linden in a former horse-and-carriage firehouse in San Francisco (where Cockburn lives with his wife and young daughter). There, Cockburn had a “run” of new songs, including Bells Of Gethsemane, an impression of a looming dawn, with gongs, chimes and Tibetan cymbals. And as far as the album not having lyrics? “Listen, the Amazon rain forest is on fire, again, 40 years after I recorded If a Tree Falls,” Cockburn says. “I mean, what else do you say?” BRITTANY HOWARD: JAIME With two albums under its belt, Alabama Shakes was on the rise as one of the top young Southernrock groups on the circuit, led by the powerhouse guitarist and singer Brittany Howard, a Rosetta Tharpe-influenced revelation.
Then, Howard decided to go solo, an unusually early career move.
“Alabama Shakes was disconnected, though,” Howard told The Globe. “We had a hard time coming up with new material.”
On her own, after a cross-country road trip to California, Howard wrote the material of her dazzling solo debut Jamie on a laptop, MIDI keyboard and electric guitar, before presenting the demos to a band that included jazzer Robert Glasper. The result is an album of potent socio-political commentary and bold sounds that will please fans of Smokey Robinson, Parliament, D’Angelo and Average White Band. That it came together so quickly was a surprise to Howard, who had booked a month at historic Electro-Vox Recording Studios in Los Angeles, but only needed two weeks.
“There was no deliberation,” said Howard, who plays Vancouver’s Commodore Ballroom on Nov. 19.
“That it was so quick and easy was thrilling.”
LEONARD COHEN: THANKS FOR THE DANCE Vault-clearing posthumous albums are standard in the industry, but this coda from Leonard Cohen isn’t exploitative as most from-the-grave collections tend to be. Apparently, it was the dying balladeer himself, before he died three years ago, who requested that unfinished tracks from 2016’s You Want It Darker be completed. Producer-son Adam Cohen went to work within months of the funeral. Spanish laud player Javier Mas flew in from Barcelona to Los Angeles to use Leonard’s own guitar. Longtime collaborator Jennifer Warnes added background vocals. Other parts were recorded in Berlin, with guests that included Feist and local choir Cantus Domus. In Montreal, producers Daniel Lanois and Patrick Watson contributed. Nine tracks in all were created, among them the sparse lead single The Goal and the title track’s fedora-tipping farewell.

I remember the first time I met him, over smoked-meat sandwiches on the Main in 1989, around the time of his greatest album, I'm Your Man. I entered the restaurant expecting to meet a dark, dour poet, and left an hour later blown away by this remarkable man with a finely tuned sense of humour and a gentleness I had never witnessed from major entertainment stars.

Kelly: Why Leonard Cohen's Happens to the Heart video is so disappointing

Full text: Leonard Cohen had a great sense of humour, but what strikes me most about his new video, Happens to the Heart, is how devoid of humour it is.
On Friday, Sony Music launched this "new" Cohen song, one of the tracks on the posthumous album Thanks for the Dance, which will be released Nov. 22. Cohen, arguably the most famous singer-songwriter to ever come out of Montreal, died on Nov. 7, 2016, at the age of 82.
Thanks for the Dance was built from bits and pieces of songs left over from the making of Cohen's last album, You Want It Darker, and was pulled together by his son Adam. The album features Daniel Lanois, Damien Rice, Beck, Feist, Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry and others.
The video for Happens to the Heart is directed by Daniel Askill, who has made videos for Sia and French band Phoenix, and is inspired by Cohen's experience as a Buddhist monk. It shows a young man walking through a lush forest; at the beginning, he is filmed from behind at a distance, wearing a Cohen-esque outfit, including a fedora and a dark trench coat. He eventually takes off all his clothes, meets a person who looks like a Buddhist monk and is given Buddhist robes. In the final shot, he sits on the edge of a cliff amid a bucolic landscape and begins to levitate.
Honestly, it's almost a Saturday Night Live spoof of a Cohen video. Happily, the song is quite good - maybe as good as anything on You Want It Darker - with a strong melody and some of Cohen's best lyrics in years. And yes the lyrics are quite droll.
It opens with this verse: "I was always working steady / But I never called it art / I got my s-t together / Meeting Christ and reading Marx."
And climaxes with this: "I had no trouble betting / On the flood, against the ark / You see, I knew about the ending / What happens to the heart."
That's Cohen at his best: funny, self-deprecating, insightful on matters of the heart.
The video is part of a bigger project from the digital channel Nowness that involves acclaimed filmmakers creating videos to accompany these songs.
In a statement, Nowness creative director Bunny Kinney said: "Our ambition with this series of short films is not only to uphold and celebrate Leonard Cohen's incredible artistic legacy with new visuals, helmed by some of the most exciting image-makers working today, but to also further explore Cohen's work and the core thematics of his music: from love and loss to artistic expression itself, identity, self-reflection, transformation and transcendence."
In another statement, Adam Cohen commented on Thanks for the Dance: "In composing and arranging the music for his words, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us. What moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. 'Leonard lives!' they say, one after the other."
I look forward to hearing the album, but watching the video, I feel it misses Cohen's personality. I remember the first time I met him, over smoked-meat sandwiches on the Main in 1989, around the time of his greatest album, I'm Your Man. I entered the restaurant expecting to meet a dark, dour poet, and left an hour later blown away by this remarkable man with a finely tuned sense of humour and a gentleness I had never witnessed from major entertainment stars.

Full text: Artificial intelligence is booming in Canada and is already at work in our companies, hospitals, schools and homes. To help you keep up with the latest advancements, we've rounded up a collection of articles about how Canadians are leading the charge, and what comes next in this exciting field.
Going deep into the work of Canada's AI leaders
There are three people on the planet credited with being the founding fathers of deep learning, one of the most promising branches of artificial intelligence. Two of them work in Canada - Geoffrey Hinton in Toronto and Yoshua Bengio in Montreal. Both cities are among the fastest growing AI hubs in the world, and Edmonton will soon join their ranks, under the leadership of reinforcement learning guru Rich Sutton. What have they and their colleagues been working on lately? We visit their labs to find out.

A child's view of the oka crisis; Mohawk filmmaker Deer has waited 29 years to tell a girl's story against the backdrop of the 1990 incident, saying: 'It completely shattered my innocence, my sense of safety and self-worth'

Full text: For Tracey Deer, there is before and after the Oka Crisis.
The Mohawk filmmaker was 12 years old in 1990, when the land dispute erupted around the court decision to allow an expansion of Club de golf Oka's course by nine holes, infringing on Mohawk territory.
Barricades were erected, the police and then the army were brought in and the ensuing summer-long standoff made international headlines.
The conflict became a turning point for Indigenous rights in this country. But against that loaded political backdrop was the story of a little girl, a story Deer has waited 29 years to tell.
The writer-director, who has a background in documentaries and is the creator of the TV show Mohawk Girls, is currently on location in Kahnawake, shooting her first fiction Beans, which recounts the historic confrontation from the eyes of a child.
"Before the Oka crisis, me and my younger sister were kids," Deer recalled. "We were having a good time, playing in the woods, making mud. We had our dolls. It was fun every single day.
"Back then, once the sun came up, we were out after breakfast on our bikes ... and back by sunset. We were exploring the forest, having fires, fishing."
Deer attended a Mohawk immersion school with mostly white students, but her heritage had never been a problem. Until everything changed.
"The Oka Crisis told me I was different and that was a bad thing," Deer said. "It completely shattered my innocence, my sense of safety and self-worth. It was a very dramatic awakening to what it means to be Indigenous."
Underlining the personal nature of the story is the film's title, which doubles as her lead character's nickname.
Although Beans is a fictionalized account of the Oka Crisis, Deer drew heavily on her own experiences.
"Let me be really clear," she said. "This is not a story about the Oka Crisis. It's a story about a young Indigenous girl with the Oka Crisis as backdrop."
She spent seven years writing the script, attempting to strike a balance between the dramatic events that took place and a more small-scale drama. It wasn't easy.
"In draft after draft, the Oka Crisis kept taking too much room," she said. "I felt this need to ensure the audience understood every element (of the crisis). Then I took the time to say, 'Wait a second'and dig into my past as a young girl to figure out what pieces of it I felt imperative to share so that I could be - and my people could be - understood better."
The 30-day shoot involves several large-scale set pieces. On the day the Montreal Gazette visited, Deer was shooting a scene in which Beans and her sister head to the barricades with their mother to bring sandwiches to the Mohawk Warriors as tensions rise between the men and police.
As Deer spoke of another big scene in which Mohawks were heading across the river in boats to get food and medicine, it became unclear whether she was describing the shoot, drawing from memory or both.
"My people would encounter angry mobs at the docks, who didn't want to let them off or back on their boats," she said. "That's a set piece in the film."
Deer described multiple scenes of "race riots," including one that marked her to this day.
"Rocks at Whiskey Trench," she said. "That was when the army took over operations from the Sûreté du Québec. Rumour was that the army was planning to attack, so there was a decision that the women, children and elders should flee the community for safety.
"We left in a caravan of 200 cars. We were stopped at the Mercier (Bridge) and searched for hours by the army, who thought we had weapons. During the time we were waiting, at the other end, residents gathered. When we were finally allowed off, (the residents) pelted us with stones and chunks of asphalt."
The experience still haunts her. "It was the most traumatic moment of my life," she said. "It informed who I am, both for good and bad. It's a scene ripped directly from my memories; it was very hard to write."
The immediate aftermath of the Oka Crisis was particularly rough for Deer. She went through a dark period, questioning the implications of her Indigenous heritage.
As a teenager, she contemplated suicide.
"That would be the bad side," she said. "The good side was figuring out how to harness that traumatic experience and find something positive. It has really guided all my projects to date in regards to my goals to build bridges and help Canadians see us and understand us, so that something like that never happens again."
The Oka Crisis was when Deer decided not only that she would become a filmmaker, but that she would one day make a film about what happened from the point of view of a child.
"It's something I stated a very long time ago," she said.
"It's one of the scariest projects I've taken on. There was a lot of internal resistance. Luckily, I had a very supportive producer who let me find my way through it.
"There were so many things I wanted to say. I had to figure out how to get that all into a film. It took time, but it's always been one of my big goals, my dreams. It's incredible to be here now finally doing it."
Deer sees her movie as an opportunity to reframe the Oka Crisis. Still perturbed by what she calls the "very biased" media coverage of the conflict, which projected a negative image of Indigenous people to the world, she sees her first foray into fiction film as an opportunity to tell another side of the story.
In doing so, she hopes non-Indigenous filmgoers might better understand how those events were lived by the people on the other side of the barricades.
"I hope the film, by bringing viewers into one home and community during the uprising, gives them new perspective of what it was like on our end and why we did what we did," she said.
"I hope it builds compassion and understanding. I feel like so much context is missing in terms of what it means to be Indigenous in this country. So much of my work is to build that context so that it isn't so easy to dismiss us and categorize us as 'other.'" While Deer had obvious personal motives for telling her tale from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, she also knew that strategically it might be the most non-threatening way to bring outsiders in.
"It's very easy to connect with a child because of their innocence," she said. "And it's very hard to dismiss a child in pain and distress."
Deer's first feature comes at a time when Indigenous cinema is being celebrated and supported more than ever before in Canada. Government funding agencies are devoting more and more resources to Indigenous filmmakers.
As a reflection of those changes, Indigenous films comprised a significant portion of the 26 features in the Canadian lineup at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month.
"When I started my career 20 years ago, our presence was so minimal," Deer said. "Alanis Obomsawin was the centre point we were all able to look at and go, 'She's doing it, maybe I can, too.'"To now be in a time where we're a community and we're all doing it, where there's space for us and people want to hear from us? It's very inspiring."

Brazil's destructive forest fires have underlined one fact: The biggest challenges facing our planet respect no borders.
Yet, exactly when the international community was in dire need of global solutions, the logic of lonely powers continued to rapidly metastasize, weakening the spirit of multilateral co-operation. Even as the Group of Seven countries offered assistance and aid, the United States has been opting out from major accords and treaties, while China and Russia have been undermining the rules from within. Brazil, itself under the new, belligerent leadership of President Jair Bolsonaro, has also walked away from its international commitments and responsibilities.
At a time when some are pulling back on their commitments to multilateralism, we cannot afford to limit countries willing to reinforce international rules and co-operation. So we can send a clear message by inviting countries like Taiwan - a major industrialized democracy that wants to play a constructive role - to participate in more international decision-making bodies.
China, however, has been throwing its weight around in demanding other states deny Taiwan - which Beijing views as part of its "sacred territory" under One China principles - a presence on any United Nations body or initiative. To do so, Beijing has used pressure and fear tactics to pick off countries that have recognized Taiwan as a fully-fledged state. Six countries have cut ties with Taiwan since the 2016 election of the Democratic Progressive Party, which supports independence and sovereignty; most recently, the Solomon Islands, Taiwan's biggest ally in the Pacific, ended 36 years of diplomatic relations after receiving Chinese promises and US$8.5-million in development funds.
Universality is a defining principle of the UN. And yet, Taiwan is denied the simple right to sit, even as an observer, in its forums.
This has an impact on our lives, too. Taiwan's exclusion from the UN World Health Assembly creates a weak link in efforts to prevent and contain global disease outbreaks such as Ebola. This is particularly regrettable given Taiwan's know-how and resources in the health sector.
The same goes for climate change, which needs all the international goodwill it can get.
Despite having its presence at UN Conference of Parties meetings limited to that of a non-governmental organization observer, Taiwan has set ambitious emissions-reduction targets and has embraced renewable sources. It also wants to make a wider contribution to the global effort, providing technology, funds and expertise to ensure food security, green energy and biodiversity conservation - but is being denied the opportunity.
And for 11 days starting on Sept. 24, the International Civil Aviation Organization will meet in Montreal. This is the body that regulates international airspace and keeps our flights safe. Taiwan was a founding member of the ICAO, but China is again seeking to deny Taipei access to the meeting, even though Taiwanese airspace serves 1.7 million flights a year.
These are not UN forums of geopolitical importance such as the UN Security Council, but initiatives and organizations that focus on practical issues. Taiwan is not asking for UN agencies to take a side on China's territorial claims; they are merely asking to be invited as observers in order to contribute to global problemsolving.
Even though Taiwan is playing by the rules, the democratic world responds with indifference or even fear of upsetting China. It sends a signal that Beijing can demand and threaten its way around democratic capitals, especially as many investmenthungry Western states allow themselves to become susceptible to Chinese investment, which has increased 1,500 per cent in Europe since 2010 alone.
However, in return for this state-backed strategic investment, Beijing is also looking for political influence. Take Greece, for example, where significant Chinese investment after the euro zone crisis led Athens to block a European Union statement criticizing China's human-rights record. Other EU states with Chinese strategic investments also watered down an EU statement criticizing China's aggressive posture in the South China Sea.
Many would argue that our acquiescence is simple realpolitik toward a future superpower. But this is the key point - because if we do not stand up for international co-operation and rules, then indeed strong, selfish powers will dominate this century.
The result will be that democracy and the peace-sustaining, rulesbased international order will inexorably decline. The democratic world can start to fight back now - and one small but significant step would be inviting Taiwan to attend the ICAO assembly in Montreal.

Full text: For Tracey Deer, there is before and after the Oka Crisis.
The Mohawk filmmaker was 12 years old in 1990, when the land dispute erupted around the court decision to allow an expansion of Club de golf Oka's course by nine holes, infringing on Mohawk territory.
Barricades were erected, the police then the army were brought in, and the ensuing summer-long standoff made international headlines.
The conflict became a turning point for Indigenous rights in this country. But against that loaded political backdrop was the story of a little girl, a story Deer has waited 29 years to tell.
The writer-director, who has a background in documentary and is the creator of the TV show Mohawk Girls( https://aptn.ca/mohawkgirls/ ), is currently on location in Kahnawake shooting her first fiction feature, Beans, which recounts the historic confrontation from the eyes of a child.
"Before the Oka crisis, me and my younger sister were kids," Deer recalled. "We were having a good time, playing in the woods, making mud [pies]. We had our dolls. It was fun, every single day.
Tracey Deer, right, gives instructions to actress Rainbow Dickerson prior to rehearsal of a scene from Beans.
"Back then, once the sun came up we were out after breakfast, on our bikes ... and back by sunset. We were exploring the forest, having fires, fishing."
Deer attended a Mohawk immersion school with mostly white students, but her heritage had never been a problem. Until everything changed.
"The Oka Crisis told me I was different, and that was a bad thing," Deer said. "It completely shattered my innocence, my sense of safety and self-worth. It was a very dramatic awakening to what it means to be Indigenous."
Underlining the personal nature of the story is the film's title, which doubles as her lead character's nickname. Although Beans is a fictionalized account of the Oka Crisis, Deer drew heavily on her own experience.
"Let me be really clear," she said. "This is not a story about the Oka Crisis. It's a story about a young Indigenous girl, with the Oka Crisis as backdrop."
Set decorator Ben Turner moves some logs into place during construction of a barricade prior to filming of a scene from Beans, Tracey Deer's feature film about a Mohawk girl's experience growing up in Kahnawake during the 1990 Oka Crisis.
She spent seven years writing the script, attempting to strike a balance between the dramatic events that took place and a more small-scale drama. It wasn't easy.
"In draft after draft, the Oka Crisis kept taking too much room," she said. "I felt this need to ensure the audience understood every element (of the crisis). Then I took the time to say, 'Wait a second' and dig into my past as a young girl to figure out what pieces of it I felt imperative to share so that I could be - and my people could be - understood better."
The 30-day shoot involves several large-scale set pieces. On the day the Montreal Gazette visited, Deer was shooting a scene in which Beans and her sister head to the barricades with their mother to bring sandwiches to the Mohawk Warriors, as tensions rise between the men and police.
Extras with guns stand behind a barricade during rehearsal of a scene from Beans, the story of a Mohawk girl's experience growing up in Kahnawake during the 1990 Mohawk crisis.
As Deer spoke of another big scene in which Mohawks were heading across the river in boats, to get food and medicine, it became unclear whether she was describing the shoot, drawing from memory, or both.
"My people would encounter angry mobs at the docks, who didn't want to let them off or back on their boats," she said. "That's a set piece in the film."
Deer described multiple scenes of "race riots," including one that marked her to this day.
"Rocks at Whiskey Trench( https://www.nfb.ca/film/rocks_at_whiskey_trench/ )," she said. "That was when the army took over operations from the Sureté du Québec. Rumour was that the army was planning to attack, so there was a decision that the women, children and elders should flee the community for safety.
"We left in a caravan of 200 cars. We were stopped at the Mercier (Bridge) and searched for hours by the army, who thought we had weapons. During the time we were waiting, at the other end, residents gathered. When we were finally allowed off, (the residents) pelted us with stones and chunks of asphalt."
The experience still haunts her.
"It was the most traumatic moment of my life," she said. "It informed who I am, both for good and bad. It's a scene ripped directly from my memories; it was very hard to write."
The immediate aftermath of the Oka Crisis was particularly rough for Deer. She went through a dark period, questioning the implications of her Indigenous heritage. As a teenager, she contemplated suicide.
"That would be the bad side," she said. "The good side was figuring out how to harness that traumatic experience and find something positive. It has really guided all my projects to date in regards to my goals to build bridges and help Canadians see us, and understand us, so that something like that never happens again."
The Oka Crisis was when Deer decided not only that she would become a filmmaker, but that she would one day make a film about what happened, from the point of view of a child.
"It's something I stated a very long time ago," she said. "It's one of the scariest projects I've taken on. There was a lot of internal resistance. Luckily I had a very supportive producer, who let me find my way through it.
"There were so many things I wanted to say. I had to figure out how to get that all into a film. It took time, but it's always been one of my big goals, my dreams. It's incredible to be here now, finally doing it."
Deer sees her movie as an opportunity to reframe the Oka Crisis. Still perturbed by what she calls the "very biased" media coverage of the conflict, which projected a negative image of Indigenous people to the world, she sees her first foray into fiction film as an opportunity to tell another side of the story.
In doing so, she hopes non-Indigenous filmgoers might better understand how those events were lived by the people on the other side of the barricades.
"I hope the film, by bringing viewers into one home and community during the uprising, gives them new perspective of what it was like on our end, and why we did what we did," she said.
"I hope it builds compassion and understanding. I feel like so much context is missing in terms of what it means to be Indigenous in this country. So much of my work is to build that context so that it isn't so easy to dismiss us and categorize us as 'other.' "
While Deer had obvious personal motives for telling her tale from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, she also knew that strategically it might be the most non-threatening way to bring outsiders in.
"It's very easy to connect with a child, because of their innocence," she said. "And it's very hard to dismiss a child in pain and distress."
Deer's first feature comes at a time when Indigenous cinema is being celebrated and supported more than ever before in Canada. Government funding agencies are devoting more and more resources to Indigenous filmmakers.
As a reflection of those changes, Indigenous films comprised a significant portion of the 26 features in the Canadian lineup at the Toronto International Film Festival, earlier this month.
"When I started my career, 20 years ago, our presence was so minimal," Deer said. "Alanis Obomsawin was the centre point we were all able to look at and go, 'She's doing it, maybe I can, too.'
"To now be in a time where we're a community, and we're all doing it, where there's space for us and people want to hear from us? It's very inspiring."
Beans is expected in theatres in fall 2020.

"I hope the film, by bringing viewers into one home and community during the uprising, gives them new perspective of what it was like on our end, and why we did what we did," she said.
"I hope it builds compassion and understanding. I feel like so much context is missing in terms of what it means to be Indigenous in this country. So much of my work is to build that context so that it isn't so easy to dismiss us and categorize us as 'other.' "
While Deer had obvious personal motives for telling her tale from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, she also knew that strategically it might be the most non-threatening way to bring outsiders in.
"It's very easy to connect with a child, because of their innocence," she said. "And it's very hard to dismiss a child in pain and distress."
Deer's first feature comes at a time when Indigenous cinema is being celebrated and supported more than ever before in Canada. Government funding agencies are devoting more and more resources to Indigenous filmmakers.
As a reflection of those changes, Indigenous films comprised a significant portion of the 26 features in the Canadian lineup at the Toronto International Film Festival, earlier this month.
"When I started my career, 20 years ago, our presence was so minimal," Deer said. "Alanis Obomsawin was the centre point we were all able to look at and go, 'She's doing it, maybe I can, too.'
"To now be in a time where we're a community, and we're all doing it, where there's space for us and people want to hear from us? It's very inspiring."
Beans is expected in theatres in fall 2020.

Full text: Life appears easy for the pair of jaguar cubs at the Granby Zoo.
Since being born Aug. 6( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/endangered-worldwide-two-jaguar-cubs-born-at-granby-zoo ), the cubs have had one responsibility: to be each other's playmate. They spend the rest of the day sleeping, or having the scruffy black spots along their dark gold fur cleaned by their mother, Taiama, who's trying to keep them spotless.
The cubs, who have yet to be named, have been under the care of their mother in an isolated nesting area, as she raises them without the interference of her male partner Kuwan or the zoo's facility members. But little do the cubs know, they're also part of a bigger mission.
"We need to continue to increase genetic diversity," says Shannon Ferrell, the chief of veterinary services at Granby Zoo. "If not, we could end up in genetic bottlenecks, where we don't have enough diversity within the population to reproduce and have normal offspring."
Jaguars are "near endangered" because of poaching and deforestation, among other reasons, in such places as the Amazon. According to the World Wildlife Fund( https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/jaguar-the-amazing-amazon-big-cat ), their "range has decreased by half in the last 100 years ... resulting in reduced and even extinct jaguar populations in some countries."
In Canada, there are 11 jaguars in four zoos. Granby, about an hour east of Montreal, is among 236 zoos that are certified under the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, allowing them to participate in Special Species Programs to aid reproduction of certain animals. The Granby Zoo has 45 species in the program, including the jaguar.
Breeding jaguars isn't easy, Ferrell says, because you need a pair that is compatible, but don't share similar genetics. That's the case for Taiama, 7, and Kuwan, 6, who also produced a litter in 2015.
"We've been asked to reproduce a new litter for three years," says Patrick Paré, the director of conservation and research at the Granby Zoo. "When we have babies, it's because another zoo needs them."

The most recent cubs are the 43rd and 44th to be born at the Granby Zoo since 1977. They'll eventually be sent elsewhere, just like the pair in 2015, who were sent to zoos in Palm Beach and Philadelphia. Taiama came from Zoo Berlin, while Kuwan came from Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
Before the cubs go out to start their own families, they'll be under their mother's care for at least a year.
Guests can see them through a live feed beside their indoor enclosure. Ferrell says the cubs won't go outside till at least the 12-week mark. But the cubs are ahead of schedule in some regards; most jaguars open their eyes after a couple weeks, while Granby's cubs reached that milestone after a couple of days.
The zookeepers haven't touched the cubs. Instead they monitor the video feed, because a human scent could alarm Taiama and lead to her neglecting the cubs. At the six- to eight-week mark, the zoo will perform physical assessments, confirm their genders and vaccinate to prevent such diseases as canine distemper, which can be spread by feral cats or raccoons who enter the premises.
The zoo will keep the cubs and mother separated from the father. It's to prevent potential accidents, but it's also uncommon for the father to interact with his cubs in the wild. In a year, the mother might also become tired of her cubs.
The mother and cubs are currently in one of two ancillary rooms. When Taiama needs to exercise, the zookeepers open her door, leading to an underground enclosure that can be seen by the public through a window. But before that happens, the zookeepers make sure Kuwan doesn't have access.
Kuwan, father of two jaguar cubs at Granby Zoo, takes it easy. He hasn't met the babies, because in the wild it would be uncommon for him to interact with them.
Kuwan spends his time in the main area, consisting of grass and a few trees with a small pool of water to bathe and drink. There's also a high perch, much as they prefer in the wild.
To understand the species, the Granby Zoo collaborates with the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Jaguar Preserve in Belize, which aims to protect the animals and their environment. The jaguar can live in various ecosystems. They've been seen in Arizona's deserts, but they're most commonly found in tropical forests such as throughout the Amazon, which is currently in danger.
"For sure there is an impact, one that will be discovered for decades," says Paré, referring to the wildfires that have been devastating the Amazon forest for weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/brazil-bolivia-assessing-needs-after-canada-offers-15m-aid-for-amazon-fires/wcm/98e962d3-5572-4cf4-a092-78979aa8182d ). "It'll force jaguars to leave the forested areas and move closer toward human habitations."
As apex creatures, jaguars can be viewed as "umbrella species," Ferrell says. If jaguars aren't doing well, it means that the species and plants at the bottom of the ecosystem's apex can no longer support having a high level predator in the environment.
"Zoos are unfortunately becoming the last stronghold of animal diversity," says Ferrell. "Our jaguars won't enter the wild. But when the necessity is really there to have more in the wild, hopefully we'll have built up the genetic diversity to help."

Season of change - for the better: New travel experiences across Canada will help you make the most of fall's serenity, beauty and accessibility, Adam Bisby reports

Full text: It takes weeks for Jasper National Park's trembling aspens to finish dotting Alberta's Sunwapta Valley with bursts of gold.
Up at the head of the valley, however, another change happens overnight.
As of the first Tuesday in September, tour buses and RVs are less likely to crowd the parking lots surrounding the Columbia Icefield Discovery Centre. Fewer visitors explore the trails winding toward the toe of the nearby Athabasca Glacier, fewer tractor-tired snow coaches trundle across the six-kilometre-long sheet of ice and the new Glacier View Lodge (banffjaspercollection.com) is no longer booked solid.
Thankfully, this fall slowdown has little effect on the luxurious lodge's all-inclusive overnight packages. Until Oct. 13, when the 32-room property atop the Discovery Centre closes for the season, guests arriving in the afternoon are welcomed with cocktails and charcuterie before embarking on an after-hours snow coach tour. They then move back indoors for a three-course dinner at the window-lined Altitude restaurant, where an expansive outdoor patio provides a prime venue for stargazing amid the world's second-largest dark-sky preserve.
After breakfast the next morning, the package concludes with private access to the Glacier Skywalk, a cliff-edge walkway leading to a glass-floored observation platform that juts out over the valley at a height of nearly 300 metres.
Across Canada, fall travel options such as this one are becoming more plentiful and varied. As the busy summer season gives way to the so-called shoulder season of September and October - not to mention the low season of November and early December - the new experiences listed here become less crowded and more affordable. While fiery fall foliage and abundant wildlife make some of them especially appealing to the eye, in every case the combination of lower expectations and greater availability yields the greatest travel treasure of them all: a stunning surprise.
WINE AND DINE The Trius Tour, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont.
Launched in July, this 45-minute guided excursion blends wine pairings with Instagram-friendly art installations. Beginning in an outdoor terrace dubbed the Rosé Lounge, guests can sample the winery's 2018 blush against two picturesque backdrops: vineyards stretching to the horizon and a floral wall comprised of hundreds of faux roses. Next up is Canada's largest underground sparkling cellar, where Trius Brut is poured and a series of elegant aroma stations test olfactory skills. Guests then head to the barrel-lined Trius Red Cellar to try the winery's signature blend before proceeding to the standalone Sparkling House for a seat on a whimsical "muselet" swing and a simulated soak in a "Bubble Tub." The tour wraps up at the canopied Trius Brut Bar, Niagaraon-the-Lake's newest winery bar; triuswines.com.
Wines and Islands cruise, Gulf Islands, B.C.
Maple Leaf Adventures's recently refitted 138-foot catamaran, the Cascadia, will host several British Columbia winemakers as culinary guides on an all-inclusive voyage from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. As well as visiting Pender Island's Sea Star winery and exploring the bucolic archipelago's oak forests and white-shell beaches, guests will dine on locally sourced fare paired with the dozens of wines being sampled; mapleleafadventures.com.
Les Têtes Fromagères, Eastern Townships, Que.
What pairs better with the region's 140-kilometre wine route than its new cheesemakers circuit? Covering cheeses ranging from hickory-smoked Italianstyle Gouda to raw sheep's milk and goat's milk varieties, the 14stop tour also encompasses the dozens of microbreweries, farmers' markets and other culinary attractions in and around the cities of Sherbrooke and Granby; easterntownships.org.
Dumpling Trail tour, Richmond, B.C.
Three years after being launched as a self-guided circuit of Richmond's dumpling hot spots, Vancouver Food Tours has unveiled a guided version of the city's 20stop Dumpling Trail. Encompassing six tastings at six different restaurants - five served with tea and one with local beer - guests of the three-hour tour may encounter treats ranging from shrimp wrapped in tapioca-starch pastry to pork-stuffed siu mai topped with salmon roe; visitrichmondbc.com.
AUTUMN ARTS AND CULTURE Toronto Biennial of Art Starting on Sept. 21, the final Saturday of summer, this 72-day event is slated to install more than 100 works of art, including 20 new commissions, across 10 sites on or near Toronto's waterfront. The inaugural participants hail from 40-plus countries, including Canada, Brazil, France, Guatemala and Thailand; torontobiennial.org.
Canadian Museum for Human Rights, Winnipeg The only national museum outside the Ottawa region is adding some augmented reality to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since Aug. 20, visitors to the museum's third-floor gallery have been using iPads to make virtual people and objects appear in front of them, along with video, audio and historic images that highlight the value of the Charter. In the same gallery, the museum is also displaying the original 1982 Proclamation of the Constitution Act, a rarely loaned (and raindrop-smudged) document from Library and Archives Canada; humanrights.ca.
National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Speaking of national museums, on Nov. 8 the National Gallery will unveil the second instalment of its quinquennial series on international contemporary Indigenous art. Titled Àbadakone / Continuous Fire / Feu continuel, the exhibition will feature works by more than 70 artists identifying with dozens of Indigenous nations, ethnicities and tribal affiliations from Canada and around the world; gallery.ca.
INTO THE WILD Wildlife & Wellness, Nanuk Polar Bear Lodge, Manitoba Churchill Wild's remote Nanuk Polar Bear Lodge, about 30 km east of historic York Factory, is hosting this new tour package from Sept. 20 to 26. Arriving from Winnipeg via Churchill, guests can combine guided hikes and wildlife- and aurora-viewing with meditation sessions, pilates, yoga and evening presentations on Arctic ecosystems, landscapes and cultures; churchillwild.com.
Tweedsmuir Park Lodge, Stuie, B.C.
With nearby rivers teeming with migrating Pacific salmon, this upscale wilderness lodge just east of Bella Coola runs "Grizzly Safaris" from Sept. 1 through October.
This season, the lodge has added amenities including a bird- and bear-viewing stand near the lodge; a via ferrata rock-climbing network of metal rungs, ladders and wires; and single-track trails for both mountain bikes and ebikes; tweedsmuirparklodge.com.
FALL IN THE FAMILY Predator Ridge bike shuttle, Vernon, B.C.
A new daily shuttle service connects this golf, spa, cycling and nature resort to Coldstream, the northern terminus of the new Okanagan Rail Trail. Upon completing a 27-km southbound ride - on rented bikes if need be - shuttle-takers meet in the town of Lake Country for the return journey to Predator Ridge's spacious lodge rooms and private cottages, all of which feature full kitchens, balconies and fireplaces; predatorridge.com.
Above and Beyond exhibit, Canada Aviation and Space Museum, Ottawa From soaring into Earth orbit to joining a journey to Mars, this new exhibition highlights interactive challenges, vehicle concept models and prototypes, immersive media presentations and inspiring innovator stories. Developed by engineers and designers from NASA and the Smithsonian Institution - where it made its world debut in 2015 - Above and Beyond opens Sept. 28; ingeniumcanada.org.
Paddle into the Past, Métis Crossing, Alta.
A 90-minute drive north of Edmonton, this four-hour guided tour combines Métis culture and history with a scenic paddle down the North Saskatchewan River. In and around the Victoria District National Historic Site, guests can try their hand at cooking bannock over a fire, crafting Métis jewellery and clothes, dancing a Métis jig in a historic log homestead and paddling an authentic voyageur canoe; metiscrossing.org.
NEW SEASON, NEW DIGS Pluvio restaurant + rooms, Ucluelet, B.C.
Helmed by chef Warren Barr, this intimate property's restaurant focuses on seasonal and wild-foraged ingredients from nearby waters and forests. Think kombupoached Pacific halibut and Vancouver Island strawberry mille feuille. Next to the backyard kitchen garden, the bright and airy boutique hotel offers four rooms decked out in coastal greys and greens; pluvio.ca.
Stonehaven Le Manoir, SainteAgathe-des-Monts, Que.
Overlooking Lac des Sables in the leafy Laurentian Hills north of Montreal - which are always eyecatching in the fall - this former private mansion has been reinvented as a sybaritic complex of Italian gardens, sunny terraces, decadent dining rooms serving local poultry, duck, cheeses and greens, and 34 opulent rooms and suites; stonehavenlemanoir.com.
Inn at Fortune Bridge, Bay Fortune, PEI The sister property to celebrity chef Michael Smith's Inn at Bay Fortune has turned the community's historic general store into a Parisian-style boutique inn with whimsical grounds, a rooftop terrace and six regal rooms and suites. Should guests wish to attend the main inn's famous nightly FireWorks Feast, which features a 25-foot-long wood-burning oven, a 1957 classic Bentley will shuttle them there; innatbayfortune.com.

Full text: 'This is a good one; I like this parking lot." Matthew Rankin is calling via FaceTime in a perfectly square parking lot of the Sussex House apartments in Winnipeg's Osborne Village. It's 12:30 a.m., and his dying iPhone is plugged into an external outlet that allows Winnipeggers to jump-start their cars in the winter. He's been driving all day, having just wrapped a shoot in Grasslands National Park, where he filmed buffalo and a mysterious cloud shaped like Donald Trump for his contract position making experimental films for the National Parks Department of Canada.
In less than three weeks, his first film, The Twentieth Century, a biopic of sorts about Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, will premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness program.
The film is the product of years of hard work and mental and physical exhaustion: a laborious, partially hand-animated and meticulously designed feature that uses Mackenzie King as an avatar for Rankin's own personal anxieties about duty and honour, shame and sex. To paraphrase a 1962 essay by the film critic Manny Farber, it is termite art: a cult classic determined to burrow insidiously into the foundation of Canadian cinema, eating its own boundaries and leaving nothing in its path.
"I feel so delirious," Rankin says, his face framed by a glowing imprint of an apartment building once occupied by his late father Laird Rankin, a Winnipeg historian and arts writer who was the founding executive director of Canada's National History Society. He died unexpectedly in 2017, a few months after Matthew's short film, The Tesla World Light Project, premiered at Cannes.
"There's this thing where [your film gets into TIFF] and you sort of want to crow about that. It's the work of not only you, but lots of other people, and you want to congratulate and celebrate them. But in the age of social media, everyone compares themselves to each other and a lot of times, it's all so artificial. So now I'm in this weird vortex, where I have all of these publicity and distribution and PR and media outreach people who want to help strategize how to get my propaganda out there, and I just want to show how petty and pathetic my life is," Rankin says.
Rankin has a made a great film about Canada (which has already secured U.S. distribution by Oscilloscope Films), and an even greater one about the kinds of subjects somewhat contraband in our home and native land: unbridled romantic longing, living in fear of one's own mother, a perverse desire to masturbate with a dirty work boot, political ambition and shame.
An all-you-can-gorge Mandarin Buffet's worth of shame, the kind that bristles with ego and maudlin self-pity when sensitive young beta males sacrifice everything for a cause they're not even sure they believe in.
In The Twentieth Century's case, it's the formation of Canada itself, both as a country and an ideology, which validates WASP repression as the ultimate morality. Torn between trying to fulfill the dreams of his demanding mother (played by Louis Negin, a mainstay of Guy Maddin films) who has a vision of her son leading the country as prime minister and marrying the stately daughter (Catherine St-Laurent) of the Canadian Governor-General, and his own latent desire to defy her to abscond to Quebec City to marry a kindly Québécois nurse (Sarianne Cormier), the miserable Mackenzie King (Daniel Beirne) enters politics in Toronto at the turn of the century.
The film is a sorely-needed satire of Canadian identity, where punchlines such as "You will do more than your duty and expect less than your right!" and "Mother needs her puffin cream!" rightly smart. For Rankin, who doesn't consider himself patriotic, making satiric CanCon about a former Canadian prime minister is his civic duty.
"I think of Canada as a WASP fantasy that is essentially fictitious," says Rankin, who straddles his identity between his native Winnipeg and his Francophone lifestyle in Montreal.
"There's a lot of complacency in the way people think about Canada, as if it's some naturalistic, absolute entity, not just something we've imagined that might be just a total bedtime story. The extent of Canadian satire at this point is only Rick Mercer paintballing with Jann Arden."
"I'm also interested in the moment that history transforms into myth," the 41-year-old filmmaker adds.
"How our chronological passage through time becomes an ecstatic lie that we tell ourselves is true."
After his short films, also focusing on doomed historical figures - Mynarski Death Plummet and The Tesla World Light Project played TIFF, Sundance, and Cannes - Rankin became known for the artifice, stylization and theatricality of his work. The Twentieth Century melts the transcendental style of Eraserhead, classical Hollywood and Duck Soup's physical comedy into one rancid puddle of Rankin's Oldstyle Canadian Maple Walnut Ice Cream Cinema.
A bombastic score by Peter Venne aches with Vertigo's primordial strings, the Vaselinelensed 16mm framing by Vincent Biron features weird canted angles and frenzied zooms. And then there's the hand-animated backgrounds of the Toronto subway line and the forests of Vancouver, which are torn straight from the pages of a demented children's picture book.
The film is Canadian expressionism at its wildest and most beautiful.
"Matthew's got his own vision, and I have to applaud him; he started off way earlier than I did with his organized assault on the great traps of un-mythologized territory in Canada," fellow Winnipegger Maddin says.
As a teen, Rankin joined the Winnipeg Film Group, where he volunteered as a labourer on Maddin's films such as Twilight of the Ice Nymphs. Although they've never explicitly acknowledged it, Maddin says he passed Rankin the torch a long time ago.
"His subject matter just seems to tacitly understand that some truths can be improved upon with fiction, and I don't mean made more entertaining. I mean made more true, more felt, more memorable," Maddin says.
"Plus, he's committed to a visual arsenal that typically other Canadian filmmakers aren't. I recognize the same ardent fire in him that burns in my own beating chest."
When Rankin was a history student at McGill University, a chance encounter with the diaries of Mackenzie King led to the genesis of his first feature. As he writes on his film's Instagram page, "Reading King's journal in university overwhelmed me with the feeling that I was not alone.
Finally! Someone who was very nearly as maudlin, repressed, congenitally lonesome, Oedipusdemolished and pathologically self-pitying as me."
"I felt really connected to his worst qualities," says Rankin, who has kept a diary since the age of 12.
"He can be very vain, and he can be very petty and very self pitying and very self important.
He has these very maudlin outbursts about romance and virtue and righteousness. He strives for purity and he lives with a lot of shame, like deep, deep shame, wells of shame, bottomless shame.
"Ultimately, he achieved so many great things, yet he still lives with shame and torment. I feel like any story I could tell is kind of the same."
Beirne, who stars as Mackenzie King and is the film's comic soul, was about to move to Los Angeles when his agent sent him Rankin's script. By the third page, he knew he'd drop everything to be involved.
"It just didn't stop being inventive and creative and funny and wild and exciting," Beirne says.
"Matthew has created this world in which he is a perversion, but in the real world, he isn't at alI. It's something I aspire to, the ability to talk openly and entertainingly about shame."
While some Canadian filmmakers at this year's TIFF might hide behind sedate docudramas or conventional kitchen-sink narratives as a way to obfuscate their feelings, The Twentieth Century plunges into artifice to reveal some of the country's funniest, pettiest and most toxic emotions. For Rankin, this is his emancipation.
"That's something I noticed in the Mackenzie King diaries," he says.
"A lot of the stuff he obsesses over and is ashamed about is a fiction, but fiction is how we make sense of the world. If I could just verbalize it, I wouldn't even need to make the movie. I need an encounter of image and sound and the emotions only they can provoke - only. Only and together."
The Twentieth Century premieres at TIFF Sept. 10, 11:59 p.m.
(Ryerson), with additional screenings Sept. 12, 9:45 p.m.
(Scotiabank), and Sept. 14, 1:30 p.m. (Scotiabank)

Full text: Life appears easy for the pair of jaguar cubs at the Granby Zoo.
Since being born Aug. 6( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/endangered-worldwide-two-jaguar-cubs-born-at-granby-zoo ), the cubs have had one responsibility: to be each other's playmate. They spend the rest of the day sleeping, or having the scruffy black spots along their dark gold fur cleaned by their mother, Taiama, who's trying to keep them spotless.
The cubs, who have yet to be named, have been under the care of their mother in an isolated nesting area, as she raises them without the interference of her male partner Kuwan or the zoo's facility members. But little do the cubs know, they're also part of a bigger mission.
"We need to continue to increase genetic diversity," says Shannon Ferrell, the chief of veterinary services at Granby Zoo. "If not, we could end up in genetic bottlenecks, where we don't have enough diversity within the population to reproduce and have normal offspring."
Jaguars are "near endangered" because of poaching and deforestation, among other reasons, in such places as the Amazon. According to the World Wildlife Fund( https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/jaguar-the-amazing-amazon-big-cat ), their "range has decreased by half in the last 100 years ... resulting in reduced and even extinct jaguar populations in some countries."
In Canada, there are 11 jaguars in four zoos. Granby, about an hour east of Montreal, is among 236 zoos that are certified under the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, allowing them to participate in Special Species Programs to aid reproduction of certain animals. The Granby Zoo has 45 species in the program, including the jaguar.
Granby Zoo jaguar Taiama gave birth to these little charmers on Aug. 6, 2019. They are her third and fourth cubs.
Breeding jaguars isn't easy, Ferrell says, because you need a pair that is compatible, but don't share similar genetics. That's the case for Taiama, 7, and Kuwan, 6, who also produced a litter in 2015.
"We've been asked to reproduce a new litter for three years," says Patrick Paré, the director of conservation and research at the Granby Zoo. "When we have babies, it's because another zoo needs them."
The most recent cubs are the 43rd and 44th to be born at the Granby Zoo since 1977. They'll eventually be sent elsewhere, just like the pair in 2015, who were sent to zoos in Palm Beach and Philadelphia. Taiama came from Zoo Berlin, while Kuwan came from Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
Before the cubs go out to start their own families, they'll be under their mother's care for at least a year.
Guests can see them through a live feed beside their indoor enclosure. Ferrell says the cubs won't go outside till at least the 12-week mark. But the cubs are ahead of schedule in some regards; most jaguars open their eyes after a couple weeks, while Granby's cubs reached that milestone after a couple of days.
The zookeepers haven't touched the cubs. Instead they monitor the video feed, because a human scent could alarm Taiama and lead to her neglecting the cubs. At the six- to eight-week mark, the zoo will perform physical assessments, confirm their genders and vaccinate to prevent such diseases as canine distemper, which can be spread by feral cats or raccoons who enter the premises.
The zoo will keep the cubs and mother separated from the father. It's to prevent potential accidents, but it's also uncommon for the father to interact with his cubs in the wild. In a year, the mother might also become tired of her cubs.
The mother and cubs are currently in one of two ancillary rooms. When Taiama needs to exercise, the zookeepers open her door, leading to an underground enclosure that can be seen by the public through a window. But before that happens, the zookeepers make sure Kuwan doesn't have access.
Kuwan, father of two jaguar cubs at Granby Zoo, takes it easy. He hasn't met the babies, because in the wild it would be uncommon for him to interact with them.
Kuwan spends his time in the main area, consisting of grass and a few trees with a small pool of water to bathe and drink. There's also a high perch, much as they prefer in the wild.
To understand the species, the Granby Zoo collaborates with the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Jaguar Preserve in Belize, which aims to protect the animals and their environment. The jaguar can live in various ecosystems. They've been seen in Arizona's deserts, but they're most commonly found in tropical forests such as throughout the Amazon, which is currently in danger.
"For sure there is an impact, one that will be discovered for decades," says Paré, referring to the wildfires that have been devastating the Amazon forest for weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/brazil-bolivia-assessing-needs-after-canada-offers-15m-aid-for-amazon-fires/wcm/98e962d3-5572-4cf4-a092-78979aa8182d ). "It'll force jaguars to leave the forested areas and move closer toward human habitations."
As apex creatures, jaguars can be viewed as "umbrella species," Ferrell says. If jaguars aren't doing well, it means that the species and plants at the bottom of the ecosystem's apex can no longer support having a high level predator in the environment.
"Zoos are unfortunately becoming the last stronghold of animal diversity," says Ferrell. "Our jaguars won't enter the wild. But when the necessity is really there to have more in the wild, hopefully we'll have built up the genetic diversity to help."

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Pompeo says Huawei executive not a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade war
U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhouis not a bargaining chip in the United States's trade war with China.
Mr. Pompeo was in Ottawa Thursday meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the G7 meeting in France. He said the U.S. stands with Canada in the face of China's arbitrary detention of Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.
Relations between Canada and China have been strained since the arrest of Ms. Meng in December over U.S. allegations of violating Iran sanctions. China has accused Canada of arresting her at the bidding of the U.S. as part of a politically motivated trade war.
Meanwhile, the U.S.is locked in a different battlewith Beijing over trade issues.
In encrypted chats, Hong Kong protesters find support from mainland China
Support for protesters in Hong Kong has come from an unexpected place: internet users in mainland China who are turning to encrypted chats to show sympathy for the city's demonstrators.
Several of those conversations are taking place on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app that lets users be anonymous and has been key to helping Hong Kong protesters mobilize.
The Globe and Mail reviewed days of chats on several Telegram groups, revealing a deeper glimpse into the debate inside China than what is visible in state-controlled media.
The protests in Hong Kong started with calls for the cancellation of a controversial extradition treaty. To get caught up on the story, read our explainer here.
Prosecutors in Brazil to probe surge in deforestation, wildfires in the Amazon
Federal prosecutors in Brazilsaid they will investigatea spike in deforestation and wildfires raging in the Amazon state of Pará to find out whether environmental protections have been neglected.
The probe follows a surge in fires and destruction of the Amazon rain forest that experts blame on reduced protection of the vast rain forest under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Mr. Bolsonaro previously suggested some NGOscould be setting the blazes to damage his government's reputation after he cut their funding, but did not provide any proof for his claim.
A record-setting number of wildfires has been burning through the largest rain forest on Earth. Mr. Bolsonaro is under growing pressure for implementing policies that have opened up the area to development. For countries such as Canada, where climate change threatens to bring more intense wildfires, the Amazon's fate offers a grim vision of the future. Read The Globe's explaineron the Amazon fires to learn more.

TALKING POINTS
No one stood up for Carson Crimeni - or for Reena Virk - as they died. Will you?
"After Reena died, my wife and I spoke at schools across Canada in support of anti-bullying programs such as Pink Shirt Day. We campaigned, provincially and federally, for more policies to encourage inclusion. I thought that pouring myself into the fight against bullying could help heal my wounds; I thought I could make my pain productive and create a world where Reena's death was an isolated case. But now, even after they've scabbed over, those wounds are bleeding anew." - Manjit Virk, parent of Reena Virk
Liberals don't want to clear up the SNC-Lavalin scandal - they want it gone
"Hearing Mr. Dion wasn't going to add anything to the findings of his report, but it would allow for another airing of the affair, and the fact-findings that detail a long effort to help the company avoid a criminal prosecution. Better to just end it, take the lumps, and get it out of the news cycle." -Campbell Clark
The corruption trial of former president Omar al-Bashir is a victory for Sudan - and all of Africa
"What Mr. al-Bashir's trial means for other African dictators is profound. Even after decades in power and verbal and financial support from the likes of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, there is no permanent escape from judgment. Impunity, in other words, is ultimately a mirage." - Robert Rotberg,founding director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Program on Intrastate Conflict
LIVING BETTER
What it takes for iconic fashion brands to adopt sustainable practices
Increasingly, fashion mega-brands are seeking to create more Earth-friendly products.
In July, Zara announced its new sustainability initiatives, including recycling packaging and creating a new eco-conscious line. Not everyone celebrated the news. Eco-activists have railed against brands such as Zara and H&M for adopting sustainable measures when the best solution would be to not produce so many items at all.
But having access to more mindfully made clothing is better than not having it,writes Odessa Paloma Parker.
LONG READ FOR A LONG COMMUTE
In Quebec, demolition pits heritage advocates against developers
Quebec's iconic old towns like Montreal's Vieux Port and the capital's fortified city present an image of a province on top of heritage preservation. Butsome heritage experts questionif those landmark areas conceal holes in the province's system of heritage protection.
For decades, a languishing economy and property values acted as a heritage safeguard in Quebec. Developers were rarely interested in buying old property to build new. However, a robust economy in the past several years has unleashed the bulldozer and wrecking ball on old buildings at an accelerating pace.
At old churches, city halls and other buildings slated for demolition, the province's definitions of what's "heritage'" and what isn't are being put to the test.

Jason Kenny
"(Jason Kenny's) spiel makes the noted Conservative in Alberta sound an awful lot like a Quebec Liberal of yore. This probably isn't a coincidence. In invoking separation, and positioning himself as the last bulwark against it, Kenney has glommed onto one of the oldest hustles in the country - one that has served Quebec mightily for decades. His timing is characteristically impeccable; with Quebec's separatist threat on the wane, the country suddenly lacks a serious existential threat. The question is: can it work for Alberta as it did so well for Quebec?"

1841 house in St-Placide is an enduring tribute to Ô Canada poet

Full text: This charming old house in St-Placide, which borders Lake of Two Mountains, is called La Maison Adolphe-Basile Routhier( http://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/rpcq/detail.do?methode=consulter&id=92558&type=bien#.XUBivJNKiL4 ), a name that should be as well known as that of Calixa Lavallée, but which history has more or less forgotten.
Routhier wrote the poem Ô Canada, which Lavallée put to music and which, in 1980, became our official national anthem. Thankfully, the house where he spent his youth still exists to preserve his memory. The house occupies a 1,675-square-metre lot (5,500 square feet) close to the village and is surrounded by farmland with a pine forest in the back. In the garden stands an old wood-shingled milk house, with a crooked shed on the side to store firewood.
In the garden stands an old wood-shingled milk house with a crooked shed for storing firewood.
Built by Routhier's father in 1841 and listed as a Heritage building since 1983 by Quebec's Ministry of Culture and Communication, it is a fine example of late French colonial and early neoclassical-style architecture with thick stone firewalls. These fire-retardant walls were mandatory in urban areas, but not in a rural setting such as this one. The roof, covered in the front with what is called tôle à la Canadienne, has a gentle slope ending in a straight overhang decorated with a blue-painted wooden frieze. This roof style is a traditional technique that utilizes overlapping narrow strips of sheet metal, giving the appearance of fish scales. In the back, the more conventional batten-seam method was used.
The small shingle-clad annex on the right side of the house was added later on. It permits access to the basement and serves as a vestibule for coats, boots and such. The details in the masonry, the abundance of windows and the imposing twin chimneys are an indication that the Routhier family was well-off for the times. The 6.5-metre (9-foot) high ceilings were a rarity in those days. The interior floor plan has slightly changed over the decades; a few walls were taken down by previous owners to enlarge some rooms. Insulation was also added when the roof was redone. But the old ancestral look was preserved. So, when the current owners - Lyne Constantineau and Serge Bourgeois - bought the place in 2016, there was hardly any work to be done to make it their own. In the kitchen, they had some of the cabinets redone by an artisan and they changed all the windows, choosing a design similar to the original ones with antique-looking ironwork and latches. That was essentially the extent of the renovations carried out by the couple.
The wooden dining set was made in an old style by a cabinetmaker who used salvaged planks for the tabletop.
The house boasts many decorative and antique design elements preserved from the past, such as wall shelves and four cupboards built into the walls. Two are found in the dining room, one above a sitting bench, the other opposite the dining table. But what really catches the eye in this large room, is the Belanger 'Major' stove from the mid-1900s placed in front of the old fireplace. Although it works, it cannot be used for safety reasons, one of the restrictions imposed when living in a heritage building. An old butter churn stands beside the stove.
The Belanger 'Major' stove from the mid-1900s really catches the eye in the large dining room.
The red-stained wooden dining set was made by a cabinetmaker in the old-fashioned way and very much looks it. For the tabletop, he used old salvaged planks. During a recent visit, one of the seven cats in the house was relaxing on the original floorboards, which the owners believe are maple. The windows show the thickness of the stone walls, which are 76 cm (2.5 feet) thick.
The couple had some of the cabinets redone by an artisan in the long and narrow kitchen, which is fitted with a modern glass-top oven.
The maple-wood staircase leading to the upper floor is original, though the post, handrail and balusters were replaced over the years. A telephone from a bygone era hangs above an old, weathered bookcase holding various objects from the past. The ensemble has a harmonious vintage look.

The living room strikes the perfect balance between new and old, with modern comfortable sofas, stylish lamps, an antique grain scale converted into a coffee table and a cast iron wood stove encased in the old fireplace opening. As the neighbours are out of sight and hidden by trees, there was no need for curtains on the windows, including in the main bathroom, where ceramic tile flooring echoes the tones of the wooden door.
The main bathroom on the ground floor has ceramic-tile flooring that echoes the tones of the wooden door.
Constantineau chose pastel colours for the furniture and just a few decor elements - vases and paintings - so that the antique elements of the room, such as the wall shelves and the encased cupboard next to the wood stove, are fully highlighted. Some people passionate about antiques tend to clutter their home with their beloved treasures, which gives the impression of living in a museum. That is definitely not the case here. Constantineau has shown great restraint in the overall decor.
Lyne Constantineau chose pastel colours for the furniture and decor elements in the living room, striking a balance between new and old.
Age and humidity have sketched lovely patterns on the wood of the vaulted ceiling in the upstairs master bedroom. When the roof was redone and insulated, the original wide planks and beams were carefully replaced using the mortise-and-tenon technique, which has been used for thousands of years by woodworkers to join pieces of wood. The tenon, a small square or rectangle piece of wood carved at one end of a beam fits into the mortise, or slot, of another, a bit like Lego pieces. The floor, also made of the same wide pine planks, serves as the ceiling for the floor below. The queen-size bed with its ornate metal frame is covered with a quilt and throw in pastel colours that match the pillow cases. It is worth noticing that the same colours are found in the living room. The guest bedroom, also on this floor, is adorned with a leather armchair and another old butter churn. The paintings on the wall were created by Constantineau. The closet door looks almost like a painting, too, with the different coats of paint applied over the years carefully stripped to create an abstract motif of sorts.

Almost all people living in old houses will tell you the same thing, they are warm, cosy, with a 'soul', unlike most modern constructions.
"They were built to last by craftsmen with great skills. To live in one is, in a sense, a way to pay tribute to our ancestors," Constantineau declares. And in this case, to remember the man Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier, whose poetry is heard or sung by the young and old almost every day somewhere in Canada.

Full text: 'Now this is what Canada is supposed to look like," the young German woman seated behind me said to her friend.
After almost three hours on a bus bound for Ontario's Bruce Peninsula, we had left the noise, traffic and hustle of Toronto behind. The view out the window was now small towns, farmers' fields, livestock and lush woods.
I swivelled around and, in a friendly way, asked the visitor from Munich what exactly she meant by her comment. What had she expected from Canada?
"Big wide-open spaces. Lots of green. More natural." All the things she hadn't seen during her time in Toronto, basically.
I was headed up to Lion's Head Provincial Park in Georgian Bay in search of the same. It was a fair chunk of time to spend on a bus - especially since I was coming back the same day after just a few hours of hiking - but worth it, I decided. Because here is my completely unscientific theory, developed over decades of travelling at home and abroad: Three hours by car is the perfect length of time for a quick escape that actually feels like one. It's not so long that the journey is daunting, but it takes you far enough away that you're removed from your everyday surroundings and experiences.
And if you're short on time and need to squeeze everything into a single day, you can.
If I drive two hours in any direction from Toronto, I'm still in Southern Ontario. It all feels familiar, thanks to years of school trips and weekend jaunts. But after three hours, I'm on the Bruce Peninsula. And even though it's still technically Southern Ontario, it doesn't feel like it, as my new European friend can attest.
Lion's Head delivered as I expected. The trails - made rocky by the Niagara Escarpment - were challenging in parts but still manageable. Clean air flowed through the forest, past the pines and birch trees. The views were absolutely spectacular. Eating my lunch on the namesake promontory, I watched kayakers paddle along the shore to tucked away beaches. They glided over Georgian Bay - clear and blue and in some parts even that particular turquoise associated with much more tropical destinations. For a split second I forgot where I was, thinking I was staring out over the Atlantic Ocean. I was transported.
The three-hour rule works in most places. Head south from Montreal and you could end up in the dramatic landscapes of Vermont's White Mountain National Forest. From Halifax, you could end up in Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton or Kouchibouguac National Park in New Brunswick. (If you think all the Atlantic provinces are the same, you haven't explored them properly.)
One of my favourite examples: If you drive down from Calgary, as I did late this spring, you will end up at Waterton Lakes National Park. This mountainous beauty is practically a hidden gem when compared with Alberta's better-known parks; while Banff and Jasper brought in, respectively, 4,181,854 and 2,425,878 visitors last season, only 568,807 people ventured to Waterton. It's so off the radar that even a friend from Calgary hadn't heard of it.
You can get to the park in less than three hours, but better to lengthen the journey by taking the scenic route - Highway 22 - a.k.a. the Cowboy Trail. It's a lovely drive through ranching country, interesting rock formations and rugged scenery. As you approach Waterton, big peaks appear to rise out of nowhere: Here, the Rocky Mountains meet the prairies, with no foothills in between.
Once inside, Waterton Lake itself immediately commands attention. In the sun it sparkles; when the low early morning clouds roll in, it impresses with moodiness. Take a boat ride and you'll pass into Montana's Glacier National Park in the United States (no need to bring your passport).
Together, the two parks form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, created in 1932 and the first of its kind in the world. Keep an eye out for the 49th parallel - yes, it's visible! It's not a fence but a clear-edged swath of land cut through the forest. Pretty neat, right? And definitely not something you see every day.
To take in the park from above, tackle the Crypt Lake hike, a definite challenge (allow a minimum of six hours) that was named one of the world's "most thrilling" trails by National Geographic. The adventure begins at the boat-accessed trailhead, then continues for 17 kilometres - including almost 20 metres through a mountain tunnel. Shorter hikes abound, although some trails are still closed because of the 2018 forest fires that came right to the edge of town. On the upside, as the locals pointed out, on some of the routes that are open, the views are better than ever.
What most sets Waterton apart from its more famous counterparts though is the genuine small-town vibe. Population: 105. Everyone here truly does know each other - and you'll find bios of most of the families in the visitor's guide. You can order a pizza with bison and Saskatoon berries at 49 North Pizza, owned by the Kretz/Robinson family, or get outfitted at the Tamarack outdoor store, which has belonged to the Bakers for six generations. Dine at the Wieners of Waterton (depending on just how immature your sense of humour is, you may be sorely tempted to buy a hat) owned by the Lows.
You won't find any chain restaurants here beyond a Subway and a BeaverTails: no Chili's or Old Spaghetti Factory or Tony Roma's. That fact alone is enough to make you feel like you've left the "real world" behind.
One of my other travel theories is that an adventurous attitude comes more easily when in a new place, because we're already out of our comfort zone.
Also, you might never have a chance to try that zipline or eat that dish or jump off that cliff again. It's now or never.
So it was that I - a complete horseback newbie - saddled up with Alpine Stables (owned by the Barrus/Watson family) for a ride through dense, deer-filled forests and up hillsides covered in purple wildflowers. Josh Watson (fifth generation) put me instantly at ease. It probably did not hurt he looked like a cowboy straight out of central casting.
"Do you wear that jacket to look good in the tourists' photos?" I asked, referring to his oilskin duster coat.
"No," he replied with a laugh.
"I wear it because it's practical."
In other words: He's a man who knows what he's doing.
The ride culminated on a rise with a spectacular view of the park. Josh obligingly took pictures of me against the stunning backdrop as I tried to keep my horse from bolting off. I almost felt like a proper cowgirl. Had I been wearing a Stetson, I might have fully fooled myself.
Still, even a partial cowgirl transformation is pretty good for a mere three-hour drive.

Full text: Members of the environmental group Greenpeace raised banners in downtown Montreal on Wednesday morning to focus public attention on the effects of the oil industry on climate change.
The 13-by-3-foot banners were raised at the corner of de la Gauchetière St. and Robert-Bourassa Blvd. Each depicts an environmental disaster: drought, extreme heat, flooding, forest fires and violent storms.
Urban artist Roadsworth, whose real name is Peter Gibson, collaborated on the posters.
Greenpeace says the posters were raised at the same time the group held similar events in 25 other cities, including Manila, Athens, Oslo, New York and Amsterdam.

Full text: This summer has overall been relatively hot with some days especially hotter than others.
This Friday and Saturday will be hot with low humidity
"Starting on Sunday the humidity is going to be really intense," said Simon Legault, meteorologist with Environment Canada.
"We can say we are heading into another heatwave, but it won't be of the same intensity as last week," said Legault, adding that last weekend was the summer's first heatwave.
A heat wave is when the temperature is over 30 degrees for at least three days and the temperature doesn't drop below 20 overnight.
Environment Canada has issued two heat warnings already this summer.
Here is what to expect from the weather this weekend according to Environment Canada:
Friday
We can expect a sunny day with wind coming southwest 20 km/h in the morning. There will be a high of 31, humidex 34, with a UV index of eight, or very high. The night will be clear and the temperature will drop overnight to a low of 20.
Saturday
It should be mainly sunny day with wind coming southwest 20km/h in the morning. There will be a high of 32 and a 37 humidex. The night will be clear and the temperature will drop overnight to a low of 22.
Sunday
There will be a mix of sun and cloud, with a high of 29. The humidity will kick in, according to Legault. There is a 60 per cent chance of showers during the day and the night, which will also be cloudy. The temperature will drop to 21 overnight. Southern Quebec could see thunderstorm showers, according to Legault, but it is uncertain for Montreal.
Monday
We can expect to start the week on a sunny note with a high of 32. The temperature will drop overnight to a low of 24 with a clear sky. According to Legault, we can also expect to have a high humidex on Monday.
Increased fire risk
The society of forest protection from fires also calls for cautionary measures in the next couple of days as a danger of fires will be a risk across the province.
The regions most at risk until Sunday are Nord-du-Quebec, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie and Chaudière-Appalaches.
The society recommends using a fireplace with a fire screen with openings up to 1 cm in size to make a safe campfire.

Heavy Montréal: A lesson in the breadth of metal

Full text: So there you have it: Even Satan retires.
Even Mephistopheles wants Freedom 55. Hey, hit the links, reruns of Family Feud. BarcaLounger, riding mower in a tatty robe, hanging at the mall lecturing the young 'uns. After 38 years as the ne plus nega of death metal, as the darkest and devilest of major metal bands, Slayer is calling it a day and heading into that bad night.
The band is bowing out on a worldwide farewell tour that will roll until Nov. 30 (and probably beyond), and headline Sunday, July 28 at the 10th edition of Heavy Montréal, their last Quebec performance. There will be cheers and tears south of heaven, memories of a legacy of carmine performances, and questions why (of which more later). But perhaps it's just time. For when you gaze too long into the Slayer, the Slayer gazes into thee.
And what better place than Heavy Montréal, the Summer Pandaemonium by the River. Or as it's also known by the South Shore locals who loathe it, the F*** St-Lambert Festival. Two days, four-stage shopping for all your metal needs. From Anthrax to Watain, they'll muzzleload the amps, fans will man the stage barricades and Jägermeister pitstops, and they'll all pull the shades on the sweet sunshine of Île Ste-Hélène and invoke Samhain in midsummer.
Because while it's all about the Slayer, it's not all about the Slayer. Above all, Heavy Montréal is a lesson in the breadth of metal.
Gary Holt and Tom Araya of Slayer perform during the second day of the 2014 Heavy Montréal festival. Slayer is back this year.
Co-headliners Ghost will pop the bulbs on their necro-Broadway pop-metal. Playing their only summer fest show in North America, Saturday night's headliners are divisive - is it a cunning black metal/pop crossover that delivers onstage, or just pope-shtick with production values? - but undeniably marquee.
The fest is a two-day tour of what's happening from the major leagues out into the styx. You get two of the Big 4 (Slayer, Anthrax). There are the Lifers, such as 37-year vets Corrosion of Conformity. Where else can you find Memphis Christian metal band Skillet - who it's presumed will have their stage crosses rightside up - on a bill with bad Swedes Watain - who won't.
Ghost in 2013.
Amy Lee's Evanescence will reweave their gauze-goth hard rock for the lovelorn. Fire up your inhalation devices for Cali stonehengers Fu Manchu, and buckle up for Cattle Decapitation, the extreme end of death, who deliver the unexpected, using offence to prod response: they're actually an animal welfare protest band. Proficiency experts will head for tech-death Rivers of Nihil and Toronto's unquantifiable Devin Townshend.
Out in the woods, gambol with indefensible personal fave Nekrogoblikon, who have mascot John Goblikon onstage and truly do celebrate goblinhood. In a more mainstream register, there's whatever's left of the parted-out Quiet Riot, version umpteen (judgment reserved), and the ever-popular (and somehow always disappointing) Godsmack, doing their post-Layne Staley medley.
Comic relief
Tellingly, there's more room for comic relief here than at any other music festival. In the gag-glam vulgarity of Steel Panther, whose guitarist Russ Parrish once introduced "one of the best drummers in ... our band" and whose singer Michael Starr proudly declares "I am not a chubby Bret Michaels ... I am a skinny Vince Neil." In the same yuks register, Metalachi hail from Mexico / East L.A., sing in Spanish and play a crossbreed that should by now be self-explanatory. Less Les Paul, more guitarrón. Galactic Empire? Star Wars geeks, get front and centre.
Maurizio Iacono of Kataklysm.
Locally, celebrate Montreal stalwarts Kataklysm, noise/sludge band Great Sabatini, and truly promising Sergio Leone-stoners Mountain Dust. You'll get the odd miscast punk or hardcore band like Terror, but they'll still be welcomed and patronized, as this fest is known for its catholic (ahem) taste range.
There is also actual rock star Slash (who'd have blown the roof off the 2017 GNR show at Jean-Drapeau had there been one) with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Can't go wrong.
In its 10th edition, Heavy Montréal is as established as any other genre cluster in the city's cultural constellation. Like metal itself, it continually finds a way to shake off the leprosy and persist. For that, Heavy can look back to the 2014 edition breakthrough, when headliner Metallica blasted it into the global metalfest datebook, spearheading an event with blockbuster attendance of 75,000 over two days - something Nick Farkas, Evenko vice-president of concerts and events, described then as Heavy Montréal's "Eminem moment," or the flashpoint when something local/regional becomes international/destinational. Now, amid the tens of thousands at Parc Jean-Drapeau on the sultriest weekend of the year, you'll hear francos and anglos, but also Yankees and Southerners, Calis and Texans, and Euros from everywhere they do or don't stage a massive metal gathering.
Steel Panther.
And there is the mood, and the mode.
Both are embodied in the crowd. Tribalists from every genre, sub- and micro-genre. Blackened death kids in corpse paint and glamsters with enough Aqua Net to atomize the remaining ozone. Stoners, bikers, movingly awkward zitfacers. Dads with earmuffed toddler daughters on their shoulders, pregnant people in black F-U T-shirts in 30-degree sunshine. Bottle-blonds in black leather hot pants and five-inch heels crunching on gravel holding hands with beer-bellied dudes in leather vests heading for The Faceless. And the Forest. Osheaga also has its Forest area, but at Heavy Montréal, that zone exhales an illicit thrill. Come on in, it's bad in here. This is where the truly unpaid demonstrate their complete allegiance to their dark master. And I mean the ones onstage.
A codified celebration
From circle pits to walls of death, there is a codified celebration of a kind of violence here, or at least brute physicality. And yet in all the years covering every stage from noon to tomb time, I've not seen a single real fist fight. And it's not like these people don't drink.
Slayer was a different issue. Stepping back into their (our) history, the second time I saw them, in the Verdun Auditorium, a kid lurched out of the mosh pit, heading for me and my journalist notepad (rookie mistake). He wanted to register a comment, but all I could register was a front tooth, or half of it, broken off at a perfect 45-degree angle. Oh, and all the blood on his mouth and face.
I was concerned. After he crowed about how great he felt, he dove back into the melee. That was all you needed to know about Slayer, and when I interviewed guitarist Kerry King years later, he concurred, calling it "a brotherhood of insanity down there."
Which leads one to wonder: why would Slayer hang up the goat horns? When you're still the thrash/diablo superweights, the band once aptly nicknamed "the Rolling Stones of death metal," why? Singer-bassist Tom Araya is only 58. Fifty-eight. That's the new 29 in rock band years.
Well, in the 50th year since the unbirthing of metal by Black Sabbath, maybe it's just fatigue. They have taken their beating over the years, physically, with Araya's headbanging, and otherwise. In one of the great horror-coincidences of all time, Slayer had the misfortune of releasing their ninth album, God Hates Us All, in September 2001. As in, on Sept. 11, 2001. Timing really is everything.
Perhaps the subject matter just took its toll - all the serial killers, genocide, war, hell, torture, Nazism and the Big Guy. Most likely, King realized that, 33 years after you recorded Reign in Blood, routinely cited as a genre masterpiece, and six years after his co-founding guitar partner Jeff Hanneman died of cirrhosis, Slayer has served its sentence. There's nothing to prove and no incisors left to snap off.
So. Slayer bows. Whither the metal? With no real mainstream presence on radio, in movies, TV or magazines, and only in perfervid cult/niche websites, how is this supposed to survive?
A bright star
"No presence" is really the point, and this weekend is the object lesson. For 48 hours and all the months of anticipation that led up to them, none of it matters. With that absence from the mainstream, the live gathering is the Proof of Life. Every gathering in the global constellation of gatherings, in which Heavy Montréal is now a bright star.
It would be foolish to argue that metal is un- or apolitical. There are plenty of examples of politicized songs or albums - I mean, even cross faded Ozzy's Sabbath sophomore album leads with War Pigs. But that's not the same as the pull in other genres toward defined positions or even candidates. No, metal is anti-establishmentarian, nonspecifically rebellious and conveniently slotting into either end of the political spectrum, explaining why it has the broadest of them - from Gojira and Napalm Death on the putative left to you-don't-wanna-know on the putative right.
Is metal eternal? There are two tests. How old is it? At least as old as the fellow who coined the term "Heavy Metal." Ozzy? Dio? Nah. It was another junkie, appropriately, who wrote "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms - Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes - And the Insect People of Minraud with metal music." I mean, did William S. Burroughs nail it, or what?
And how young is it? Will Mosh Pit Girl be there( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/why-heavy-montreal-may-be-our-most-entertaining-festival )? The festival can only hope. If so, MPG, feel free to report your status, and your reviews to the email below.

Five to see
Given it's assumed you've paid to see the heavyweight headliners Slayer and Ghost, here are five on the undercard where you can wear your best none-more-black.
Watain, Saturday, 8:40 p.m., Forest Stage
So how down, demonic and dirty do you wanna get? Banned from Singapore for their theistic Satanism, infamous after 2014 Brooklyn Bazaar that had fans barfing after being showered with pig's blood, these Swedes take their ritualistic gore and Grand Guignol seriously - or as seriously as you can take commercially touring a satanic metal message rather than actually sitting in your pentagramular basement sacrificing the caprine. Led by Erik Danielsson, Watain is perhaps the darkest band on the bill, and in that Forest notch after the gloaming, their candelabrae, altars, pyro, upended crosses, animal bone displays and lurid red lighting will have maximum metallian effect.
Skálmöld, Sunday, 2:40 p.m., Forest Stage
There are always enough Scandinavian miscreants and meanies here to serve up a slaytanic smorgasbord. Let's go with this Icelandic Norse-volk-metal band, who were actually hailed by their "most-metal" President Guni Jóhannesson for "helping to maintain our literary and cultural heritage." Take that, Metallica! There's an epic transport to their Viking sound, which can be orchestral, melodic, rifftastic and almost goofy, but Björgvin Sigursson's song Mara is genuinely special.
Amy Lee of Evanescence.
Evanescence, Saturday, 8:25 p.m., Apocalypse Stage
Goth lite, gauzy orchestral, piano balladry, prog, hard and even a little electro, but Evanescence was really where they all intersected with Billboard's pop chart, driven by Amy Lee's soaring powerhouse vocals. And disguising your Christian values in those goth robes is a clever alchemic trick.
Mountain Dust, Sunday, 1 p.m., Apocalypse Stage
Despised Icon is worth it for drummer Alex Pelletier drumming alone, and Steel Panther is surprisingly reliable for laffs, but Montreal's Mountain Dust band sounds like a Next Big Thing just two albums out of the gates. It may fall in the Stoner camp (and they do love to camp), but from bluesy to psyche to Sergio Leone, they have a ridiculously weighty, mature sound and ambience filling out the heaviness. Groove like boulders down Mount Royal, the right kind of overreach, and massively passionate vocals that have absorbed a handful of singers just to roar it back in their faces. Going places.
Nekrogoblikon, Saturday, 3:15 p.m., Garden Stage
A green goblin? In the sunshine? See you there!
AT A GLANCE
Heavy Montréal takes place Saturday, July 27 and Sunday, July 28 at Parc Jean-Drapeau. For complete information, see heavymontreal.com( https://www.heavymontreal.com/en ).

Correction: An earlier version of this article gave the incorrect date for Slayer's headline appearance; they perform at Heavy Montréal on Sunday. Steel Panther guitarist Russ Parrish was misidentified. And Metal Church is no longer on the festival's lineup. The Montreal Gazette regrets the errors.

Full text: So there you have it: Even Satan retires.
Even Mephistopheles wants Freedom 55. Hey, hit the links, reruns of Family Feud. BarcaLounger, riding mower in a tatty robe, hanging at the mall lecturing the young 'uns. After 38 years as the ne plus nega of death metal, as the darkest and devilest of major metal bands, Slayer is calling it a day and heading into that bad night.
The band is bowing out on a worldwide farewell tour that will roll until Nov. 30, 2019 (and probably beyond), and headline Saturday, July 27, at the 10th edition of Heavy Montréal, their last Quebec performance. There will be cheers and tears south of heaven, memories of a legacy of carmine performances, and questions why (of which more later). But perhaps it's just time. For when you gaze too long into the Slayer, the Slayer gazes into thee.
And what better place than Heavy Montréal, the Summer Pandaemonium by the River. Or as it's also known by the South Shore locals who loathe it, the F*** St-Lambert Festival. Two days, four-stage shopping for all your metal needs. From Anthrax to Watain, they'll muzzleload the amps, fans will man the stage barricades and Jägermeister pitstops, and they'll all pull the shades on the sweet sunshine of Île Sainte-Hélène and invoke Samhain in midsummer.
Because while it's all about the Slayer, it's not all about the Slayer. Above all, Heavy Montréal is a lesson in the breadth of metal.
Gary Holt and Tom Araya of Slayer perform during the second day of the 2014 Heavy Montréal festival. Slayer is back this year.
Co-headliners Ghost will pop the bulbs on their necro-Broadway pop-metal. Playing their only summer fest show in North America, Saturday night's headliners are divisive - is it a cunning blackmetal/pop crossover that delivers onstage, or just pope-shtick with production values - but undeniably marquee.
The fest is a two-day tour of what's happening from the major leagues out into the styx. You get two of the Big 4 (Slayer, Anthrax). There are the Lifers, such as 37-year vets Corrosion of Conformity. Where else can you find Memphis Christian metal band Skillet - who it's presumed will have their stage crosses rightside up - on a bill with bad Swedes Watain - who won't.
Mary Goore of Ghost.
Amy Lee's Evanescence will reweave their gauze-goth hard rock for the lovelorn. Fire up your inhalation devices for Cali stonehengers Fu Manchu, and buckle up for Cattle Decapitation, the extreme end of death, who deliver the unexpected, using offence to prod response: they're actually an animal welfare protest band. Proficiency experts will head for tech-death Rivers of Nihil and Toronto's unquantifiable Devin Townshend.
Out in the woods, gambol with indefensible personal fave Nekrogoblikon, who have mascot John Goblikon onstage and truly do celebrate goblinhood. In a more mainstream register, there's whatever's left of the parted-out Quiet Riot, version umpteen (judgment reserved), and the ever-popular (and somehow always disappointing) Godsmack, doing their post Layne-Staley medley.
Comic relief
Tellingly, there's more room for comic relief here than at any other music festival. In the gag-glam vulgarity of Steel Panther, whose bassist Russ Parrish once introduced "one of the best drummers in ... our band" and whose singer Michael Starr proudly declares "I am not a chubby Bret Michaels ... I am a skinny Vince Neil." In the same yucks register, Metalachi hail from Mexico / East L.A., sing in Spanish and play a crossbreed that should by now be self-explanatory. Less Les Paul, more guitarrón. Galactic Empire? Star Wars geeks, get front and centre.
Maurizio Iacono of the Kataklysm.
Locally, celebrate Montreal stalwarts Kataklysm, noise/sludge band Great Sabatini, and truly promising Sergio Leone-stoners Mountain Dust. You'll get the odd miscast punk or hardcore band like Terror, but they'll still be welcomed and patronized, as this fest is known for its catholic (ahem) taste range.
There is also actual rock star Slash (who'd have blown the roof off the 2017 GNR show at Jean-Drapeau had there been one) with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Can't go wrong.
In its 10th edition, Heavy Montréal is as established as any other genre cluster in the city's cultural constellation. Like metal itself, it continually finds a way to shake off the leprosy and persist. For that, Heavy can look back to the 2014 edition breakthrough, when headliner Metallica blasted it into the global metalfest datebook, spearheading an event with blockbuster attendance of 75,000 over two days - something Nick Farkas, Evenko vice-president of concerts and events, described then as Heavy Montréal's "Eminem" moment, or the flashpoint when something local/regional becomes international/destinational. Now, amid the tens of thousands at Jean-Drapeau Park on the sultriest weekend of the year, you'll hear francos and anglos, but also Yankees and Southerners, Calis and Texans, and Euros from everywhere they do or don't stage a massive metal gathering.
Steel Panther.
And there is the mood, and the mode.
Both are embodied in the crowd. Tribalists from every genre, sub- and micro-genre. Blackened death kids in corpse paint and glamsters with enough Aqua Net to atomize the remaining ozone. Stoners, bikers, movingly awkward zitfacers. Dads with earmuffed toddler daughters on their shoulders, pregnant people in black F-U T-shirts in 30-degree sunshine. Bottle-blondes in black leather hot pants and five-inch heels crunching on gravel holding hands with beer-bellied dudes in leather vests heading for The Faceless. And the Forest. Osheaga also has its Forest area, but at Heavy Montréal, that zone exhales an illicit thrill. Come on in, it's bad in here. This is where the truly unpaid demonstrate their complete allegiance to their dark master. And I mean the ones onstage.
A codified celebration
From circle-pits to walls of death, there is a codified celebration of a kind of violence here, or at least brute physicality. And yet in all the years covering every stage from noon to tomb time, I've not seen a single real fist fight. And it's not like these people don't drink.
Slayer was a different issue. Stepping back into their (our) history, the second time I saw them, in the Verdun Auditorium, a kid lurched out of the mosh pit, heading for me and my journalist notepad (rookie mistake). He wanted to register a comment, but all I could register was a front tooth, or half of it, broken off at a perfect 45-degree angle. Oh, and all the blood on his mouth and face.
I was concerned. After he crowed about how great he felt, he dove back into the melee. That was all you needed to know about Slayer, and when I interviewed guitarist Kerry King years later, he concurred, calling it "a brotherhood of insanity down there."
Which leads one to wonder: why would Slayer hang up the goat horns? When you're still the thrash/diablo superweights, the band once aptly nicknamed "the Rolling Stones of death metal," why? Singer-bassist Tom Araya is only 58. Fifty-eight. That's the new 29 in rock band years.
Well, in the 50th year since the unbirthing of metal by Black Sabbath, maybe it's just fatigue. They have taken their beating over the years, physically, with Araya's headbanging, and otherwise. In one of the great horror-coincidences of all time, Slayer had the misfortune of releasing their ninth album, God Hates Us All, in September 2001. As in, on Sept. 11, 2001. Timing really is everything.
Perhaps the subject matter just took its toll - all the serial killers, genocide, war, hell, torture, Nazism and the Big Guy. Most likely, King realized that, 33 years after you recorded Reign In Blood, routinely cited as a genre masterpiece, and six years after his co-founding guitar partner Jeff Hanneman died of cirrhosis, Slayer has served its sentence. There's nothing to prove and no incisors left to snap off.
So. Slayer bows. Whither the metal? With no real mainstream presence on radio, in movies, TV or magazines, and only in perfervid cult/niche websites, how is this supposed to survive?
A bright star
'No presence' is really the point, and this weekend is the object lesson. For 48 hours and all the months of anticipation that led up to them, none of it matters. With that absence from the mainstream, the live gathering is the Proof of Life. Every gathering in the global constellation of gatherings, in which Heavy Montréal is now a bright star.
It would be foolish to argue that metal is un- or apolitical. There are plenty of examples of politicized songs or albums - I mean, even cross faded Ozzy's Sabbath sophomore album leads with War Pigs. But that's not the same as the pull in other genres toward defined positions or even candidates. No, metal is anti-establishmentarian, nonspecifically rebellious and conveniently slotting into either end of the political spectrum, explaining why it has the broadest of them - from Gojira and Napalm Death on the putative left to you-don't-wanna-know on the putative right.
Is metal eternal? There are two tests. How old is it? At least as old as the fellow who coined the term 'Heavy Metal'. Ozzy? Dio? Nah. It was another junkie, appropriately, who wrote "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms - Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes - And the Insect People of Minraud with metal music." I mean, did William S. Burroughs nail it, or what?
And how young is it? Will Mosh Pit Girl be there? The festival can only hope. If so, MPG, feel free to report your status, and your reviews to the email below.

Extraordinary Eastern Townships garden opens to public for fundraiser on July 20

Full text: Patterson Webster has been working for two decades on the garden at Glen Villa, the Eastern Townships home she shares with her husband, Norman, and she has created an extraordinary and rambling space that marries nature, history and art.
On Saturday, July 20, the couple will open their garden to the public as a fundraiser for the Massawippi Foundation. Tickets are $25 for morning or afternoon visits.
Glen Villa, a 750-acre property on the shores of Lake Massawippi in Ste-Catherine-de-Hatley, about 130 kilometres from Montreal, has been many things during the past 150 years: the site of two summer hotel resorts, a large dairy farm and summer cottages. Its original inhabitants, long before that, were the Abenakis.
Saturday marks the third time since 2016 that the Websters have opened their garden to benefit the Massawippi Foundation: Since its establishment in 2011, the foundation has raised more than $4 million. The money has supported community projects in the five municipalities around Lake Massawippi, conserved in perpetuity 1,200 acres of pristine forest and built several kilometres of trails open to the public.
The Upper Room, an area in the garden of Pat and Norman Webster's Glen Villa home.
But this is the first time visitors will be able to walk Timelines, a 2.9-km trail through fields and forests on the property featuring art installations "that explore ideas about memory, identity and our relationship with the land," as Pat Webster puts it.
She described Timelines in a post this month( http://www.siteandinsight.com/words-on-the-land/ ) on her Site & Insight blog and concluded: "The land speaks its own version, not through words but through sound and scent, taste, touch and sight. Walking the trail is a total experience and pictures convey only a tiny part of it."
Behind a child-sized Adirondack chair is a sign pointing toward an over-sized chair in the distance.
Among the trail's features:
Bridge Ascending, a sculpture by Quebec artists Satoshi Saito and Louise Doucet( http://doucetandsaito.com )built from the ruins of a covered bridge that once crossed the Massawippi River. It was destroyed by fire in 2002.
Part of an art installation, Abenaki Walking, created by Pat Webster to honour the history of the Abenakis.
Perspective: A sign behind a child-sized Adirondack chair points toward an oversized chair in the distance. The word Perspective is depicted in shrinking letters.
Orin's Sugar camp: Tin maple leaves hang from branches of spruce, pine and hemlock trees around a recreation of a sugar camp named to remember Orin Gardner, a farmer who once made maple syrup on the land.
The Grandchildren Trees: Eleven maple trees are named and dated to mark the birth of each of the Webster grandchildren.
Glen Villa's history is also reflected in a series of themed garden "rooms." There's the China Terrace, an imagined recreation by Pat Webster of Glen Villa Inn, a large resort hotel that stood on the site from 1902 until it was destroyed by fire in 1909. The "carpet' under the "dining table" is made of tiles featuring shards of hotel china she found on the property.
Pat Webster is seen on The China Terrace in the garden of her home in the Eastern Townships in this July 2016 photo.
The Upper Room, a formal garden set in the middle of the woods, is a memorial designed by Pat Webster to honour her mother and her beliefs. As she wrote in 2017 about the space( http://www.siteandinsight.com/the-upper-room-updated/ ): "It's a tribute to family and to the traditions I grew up with in Richmond, Virginia, when classically symmetrical architecture, brick and boxwood shaped our streetscapes and our view of the world." A series of sandblasted glass panels depict branches and leaves of a dogwood tree, as drawn by Montreal artist Mary Martha Guy. A pair of white oak benches designed by Webster sit at right angles to the panels and bring to mind church pews.
The Asian Meadow recalls the years the Websters spent in China: Norman Webster, who had a distinguished career as a journalist and worked as a foreign correspondent, reporter, editor-in-chief of both the Globe and Mail and the Montreal Gazette, was posted to the Globe's China bureau from 1969 to 1971.
The Lower Garden features perennial borders and a rock garden on the site of a former summer cottage. A nearby zinc spire from a 19th-century English church is a reminder of the time the Websters lived in England when Norman was the Globe's London correspondent.
AT A GLANCE
The garden at Glen Villa will be open to the public on July 20 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets for morning visits (9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.) or afternoon visits (12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.) are $25 and the money will go to the Massawippi Foundation. Tickets can be purchased the day of the event at the garden, but because space is limited, organizers suggest buying them in advance online( https://www.massawippi.org/ ) at massawippi.org.
Two brochures with maps, one to guide visitors through the garden and another to guide them along the Timelines trail, will be available in English and in French. Volunteers to answer questions in English and French and provide guidance will also be on site. Dogs are not permitted and neither is picnicking
Glen Villa is at 1020 Chemin de North Hatley, Ste-Catherine-de-Hatley, J0B 1W0 - less than 1 km from Hovey Manor( https://www.manoirhovey.com/en ) in North Hatley. More on the Massawippi Foundation( https://massawippi.org/ ) is at fondationmassawippifoundation.org.

As she wrote in 2017 about the space: "It's a tribute to family and to the traditions I grew up with in Richmond, Virginia, when classically symmetrical architecture, brick and boxwood shaped our streetscapes and our view of the world."
A series of sandblasted glass panels depict branches and leaves of a dogwood tree, as drawn by Montreal artist Mary Martha Guy. A pair of white oak benches designed by Webster sit at right angles to the panels and bring to mind church pews.
The Asian Meadow recalls the years the Websters spent in China: Norman Webster, who had a distinguished career as a journalist and worked as a foreign correspondent, reporter and editor-in-chief for the Gazette and Globe and Mail, was posted to the Globe's China bureau from 1969 to 1971.
The Lower Garden features perennial borders and a rock garden on the site of a former summer cottage. A nearby zinc spire from a 19th-century English church is a reminder of the time the Websters lived in England, where Norman was the Globe's London correspondent. sschwartz@postmedia.com

Full text: Jetting off to do research and attend conferences has become ingrained in the culture of academia. It's also a mark of status.
Speaking in glamorous capitals such as London or Berlin expands their networks and burnishes their reputations.
But anxiety about the environmental impact of air travel has reached a tipping point, leading academics around the world to call for a rethink. Professors are already conscious that their research must withstand ethical scrutiny and flying presents a further challenge.
In modern postsecondary institutions, where warnings about the danger of climate change are commonplace, academics are wary of being accused of hypocrisy. They're wrestling with the "flier's dilemma": Do the personal benefits of air travel outweigh its cost to the climate?
"Flying has been central to who I am and what I do," said Jaymie Heilman, a professor of Latin American history at the University of Alberta.
"I owe a debt to flying. I got where I am because I flew so much."
She learned Spanish by immersing herself in the language and culture of Central America.
She flew to Peru and Guatemala for research, and when she was in graduate school in the United States, she flew regularly to Canada. But last summer, the smoke from forest fires was so bad in Edmonton that she and her family had to stay indoors. It made her re-examine her choices.
Prof. Heilman has joined a movement of academics who are pledging to fly less, particularly when it comes to attending conferences.
At Concordia University, the entire geography department recently adopted a flying-less policy. Professors there have committed to limit the number of flights they take and publish a record of all their air travel annually.
They'll endeavour to travel by rail or bus to any destination within 12 hours of Montreal, and decline some conference invitations, all with the aim of encouraging "a low carbon working culture."
Flying accounts for about 3 per cent of global emissions, and it's mainly a habit of the world's elite.
Only 3 per cent to 6 per cent of the world population flew last year, and 80 per cent of the world has never been on an airplane. But for most wealthy North Americans, it's typically among the top three or four things, along with eating meat, car travel and family size, that have the biggest climate impact.
By some estimates, the carbon cost of a Toronto-London roundtrip flight are close to the equivalent of a year's driving, although strict comparisons are difficult due to the many variables involved.
A study at the University of British Columbia, led by geography PhD student Seth Wynes, found that the flying habits of UBC employees had almost as significant a carbon cost as the buildings on the Vancouver campus, which have been a major focus when it comes to green policies.
UBC staff (not all of whom are academics) produced emissions roughly the equivalent of twothirds to three-quarters of the emissions created by heating and running the university, Mr. Wynes found. In the geography department, which has a very efficient building, business-related air travel created about 30 times more emissions than the building.
The study also found that about 10 per cent of the employees were responsible for half the emissions, and a majority of the emissions were due to academics attending conferences. In another study, Mr. Wynes found that there is a correlation between higher emissions and higher salary.
"University institutions ... reward us for flying. The more you fly, the more you are esteemed," Prof. Heilman said.
"I do think it's moral to fly for research, particularly at this moment where we need to understand other parts of the world and each other. But for keynotes, where you're flying across the world, or even across the country to give a 20-minute talk, that's just absurd to me."
Prof. Heilman said she'll limit herself to one flight a year from now on. Many of her colleagues are making a similar pledge. She said making the decision was easy, but discussing it, as she did in a recent post on a website for historians, was more difficult.
"I joked with some friends that I should subtitle the article 'How to lose academic friends fast,' " she said, although the messages she received were mainly supportive.
Ryan Katz-Rosene, president of the Environmental Studies Association of Canada, has already flown once this year to attend a major conference in Vancouver, but he plans not to fly again until 2021. Not only is it an ethical choice, he says, but it's also about credibility.
"If I want people to believe me when I say that this is the most urgent challenge of our time, I'm eroding my own credibility as a scholar if I then go and fly around the world," he said.

Full text: New York looks stunning from the sunny top dock of a $10-million catamaran.
My sweet ride - the 97-foot 350-passenger Ocean Queen Rockstar - is one of the newest additions to NYC Ferry's 21-vessel fleet, which has expanded dramatically since it first plied the East River two years ago. More than nine million passengers later, the six-route, 20-stop service - which costs just US$2.75 a trip for adults - visits all five New York boroughs, with its Astoria and Rockaway docks both less than 20 minutes by car from Laguardia and JFK airports, respectively.
NYC Ferry is a scenic and sensible option for exploring the Big Apple, where, as is the case in many metropolises, public transit is so extensive, cabs and Ubers so prolific, and parking so scarce (and expensive) that renting a vehicle is not only unnecessary, it's more trouble than it's worth.
That's where these five North American getaways come in.
From flights and ferries to trains and bike routes, new infrastructure, offers and services are making car-free vacations more accessible, appealing and widespread than ever before.
NO CAMPING GEAR? NO VEHICLE? NO PROBLEM As well as being able to reach dozens of Canada's national and provincial parks without wheels of their own, passengers of the free Parkbus shuttle get a 50-percent discount on posted rates for Mountain Equipment Co-op's rental camping gear. (Rental reservations are recommended.)
There are MEC locations in all four of the cities from which Parkbus operates - Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax - with service out of Ottawa-Gatineau slated to launch soon.
If you also lack camping experience, Parkbus has partnered with Ontario Parks on a series of three-day, two-night "Learn to Camp" trips from Toronto to Grundy Lake Provincial Park just south of Sudbury.
For $149, groups of up to six participants receive expert instruction on setting up camp, building fires, and using provided equipment such as tents, air mattresses and camp stoves.
(Participants are responsible for food and bedding.) VOYAGE FROM VANCOUVER TO VICTORIA IN STYLE When V2V Vacations launched seasonal daily cruise service between downtown Vancouver and Victoria's lovely Inner Harbour in 2017, it cut at least an hour of driving from the journey while adding a dose of luxury aboard the 242-seat V2V Empress catamaran.
This season, V2V has unveiled a series of no-car-required day trips to the B.C. capital that cover diversions such as the Butchart Gardens and the Royal BC Museum, as well as guided brewery and cycle tours.
All day trips include return passage aboard the V2V Empress, with "royal" fares including upper-deck seating, a welcome drink and three-course light lunch or breakfast, sundeck access and food and beverage table service. The lone exception: "Sail & Fly," which combines a one-way morning voyage with a late-afternoon return trip on a Harbour Air seaplane.
FROM THE PACIFIC TO THE POTOMAC BY RAIL-TRAIL For a much more ambitious carfree journey, there's always the Great American Rail-Trail. Last month, the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy unveiled its preferred route for a 6,000-kilometre pathway between Washington and Washington State that ultimately aims to be entirely separate from vehicular traffic.
While there are some 90 trail gaps at present, 52 per cent of the former railway route is complete and available for public use, according to Rails-to-Trails.
Of the 125-plus existing trails, several are within an hour's bike ride of major airports. The 30kilometre Burke-Gilman Trail between downtown Seattle and Bothell is just north of SeattleTacoma International - where a bicycle assembly station and other cycling resources are pleasingly plentiful - while the eastern gateway to the Montour Trail is just a few kilometres from Pittsburgh International.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACKS WITH VIA RAIL Until Halloween, passengers on two of Via's less-travelled Quebec lines - Montreal-Jonquière and Montreal-Senneterre - can check bikes for free (with the proper reservation). The former line is especially appealing to cyclists, as Jonquière's train station is sandwiched between two of North America's best-serviced long-distance bike circuits: The Veloroute Des Bluets, which encircles Lac Saint-Jean for 256 kilometres; and the 435-kilometre Veloroute du Fjord du Saguenay, which skirts the Saguenay River, and its namesake national park, in spectacular fashion. Combine this with Via's $15-a-trip offer for children between the ages of 2 and 11, and entire families can travel car-free without breaking the bank.
FROM MONTREAL'S OLD PORT TO OLD-GROWTH FOREST After several unsuccessful attempts to establish a float-plane base on the Jacques-Cartier Pier, the Montreal Seaplane Airport was revived by a pair of tour operators in 2016. As well as providing regular air connections between downtown Montreal and Trois-Rivières, Hydravion Aventure joins Wet Set Montreal in offering a range of aerial day trips, including guided whale-watching via the Tadoussac seaplane base, and multiday excursions to the luxurious Hôtel Sacacomie, which is set on its namesake lake near La Mauricie National Park.
VISIT THE UNITED STATES' NEWEST NATIONAL PARK BY RAIL As well as being the newest national park in the United States, four-month-old Indiana Dunes must be one of the world's only preserves to have two railway stations within its borders. Running for 140 kilometres between Chicago's Millennium Station and South Bend International Airport, the electrically powered South Shore Line passes Indiana Dunes' Lake Michigan beaches, wildlife-filled wetlands, meandering rivers and leafy forests.
The aptly named Dune Park station is a half-hour walk from the 67-site Dunewood campground, while the Beverly Shores stop is just north of the Great Marsh Trail, which is renowned for its abundant birdlife.
Passengers who choose to remain on the train can take advantage of Indiana Dunes' partnership with the American Passenger Rail Heritage Foundation.
On select Saturdays, APRHF guides deliver talks about the park and other sights along the rails while riding the entire line round-trip.

Pikangikum First Nation faces second evacuation in weeks: Chief struggles to find nearby Ontario cities willing to take in residents fleeing fire

Full text: With a forest fire raging only kilometres away from Pikangikum First Nation in Northern Ontario, families with small children clustered at a school Wednesday to register as evacuees and wait to be flown out.
The continuing exodus marks the second time that forest fires have forced an evacuation of Pikangikum in just more than a month. While residents have been fleeing since the weekend, some are reluctant to go, as recent rains and winds have made the fire, which began on July 1, less of an immediate threat. Yet community leaders see this turn of events as more of a respite than a reprieve.
"It's going to flare up again because this fire is massive," Chief Amanda Sainnawap said in an interview at the makeshift command post set up at the Eenchokay Birchstick School in the community.
Her most pressing problem at the moment is finding cities and towns that will take in the residents of Pikangikum, which has a population of around 4,000 people. A full evacuation was ordered on Sunday night.
"I think we have evacuated about half of our community members, but there's a lack of host communities in Ontario, so now we're planning to look outside the province, as far away as Saskatchewan," she said. "Can you imagine sending people to Saskatchewan? People who hardly leave the reserve? ... English is not their first language."
Government officials who are continuing to evacuate the community say they are struggling to get everyone out - especially since many residents have only recently returned to Pikangikum after fleeing another forest fire in early June.
"Some of them flat out refuse," said Buster Kurahara, who serves as a sergeant with the Canadian Rangers. "Some won't open the door. We try to go back and change their minds."
Thunder Bay, the largest city in Northern Ontario, had said it could take in 400 evacuees and by Wednesday announced that it was near capacity already. Other Pikangikum residents were being moved to Lac Seul First Nation, Sioux Lookout, Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock Falls, Hearst and Dryden.
"We're actively recruiting more hosts," said Brent Ross, a spokesman at the Ministry of the Solicitor-General.
Saskatchewan has agreed to help, offering to play host to up to 2,000 evacuees, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced later on Wednesday.
"Extensive outreach has happened to our municipal partners and many have agreed to step up and help evacuees," the Premier said in a statement.
"We are committed to addressing any questions or concerns municipalities may have, but we urge them to move quickly to help those affected."
The latest conflagration threatening Pikangikum, Red Fire Number 39, was six kilometres southwest of the reserve, on the opposite side of Pikangikum Lake, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF).
While there has been substantial rainfall, Jonathan Scott, an MNRF Fire Information Officer, said Red Fire Number 39 still covered 50,755 hectares - an area larger than the Island of Montreal.
Another blaze, Red Lake Fire Number 23, nearly twice the size of the one threatening Pikangikum, had forced the evacuation of another First Nations community, Keewaywin, whose members were relocated to Sioux Lookout and Timmins.
Officials did not give an exact number of evacuees, but Keewaywin has 477 registered on-reserve members.
The Ontario government has requested federal assistance and a CC-130J Hercules military transport plane was dispatched from Winnipeg to begin airlifting residents on Sunday, with assistance from 23 Canadian Rangers.
By Wednesday morning, the Royal Canadian Air Force had relocated 261 people, Lieutenant Nadine Abou Rjeily said. Two more flights were scheduled for Wednesday evening, with each flight able to carry about 100 people.
Other residents had left on their own, taking a 20-minute boat ride to a spot known as Taxi Bay, where buses took them on a road leading to Red Lake, about 90 kilometres south.

Full text: Quebec institutes forest fire ban in large parts of province( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-institutes-forest-fire-ban-in-large-parts-of-province )
The ministry of forests, fauna and parks announced a ban, as of 8 a.m. Monday, on open fires in or near forests in several regions north of the St. Lawrence River.
Three stabbed in St-Léonard( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/three-stabbed-in-st-leonard )
A brawl in St-Léonard on Sunday afternoon ended with three men suffering from stab wounds. According to Montreal police, a fight broke out between six people on the balcony of a residential building on Choisy St.
Dunlevy: 40th Montreal jazz festival bids an emotional au revoir( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/dunlevy-40th-montreal-jazz-festival-bids-an-emotional-au-revoir )
There were tears, Saturday afternoon, at the closing press conference for the 40th Montreal International Jazz Festival. Organizers had just shown a short video of interviews with different performers at this year's event - from veterans Richard Galliano and Eric Truffaz to new schoolers Charlotte Cardin and Elisapie - singing the praises of our city's premier music fest and the two men who put it together, saw it through its first four decades and are now taking their final bow as they settle into retirement( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/montreal-jazz-fest-at-40-music-celebration-defines-summer-in-our-city ): Alain Simard and André Ménard.
Sebastian Aho officially re-signs with Hurricanes, says he didn't really want to join Canadiens( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/sebastian-aho-officially-re-signs-with-hurricanes-says-he-didnt-really-want-to-join-canadiens )

Jack Todd: With Leonard and Aho, fans are going nuts in the off-season( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/jack-todd-leonards-free-agency-frenzy-is-new-norm-in-sports )
It has never been clearer: the games outside the game have all but swallowed the sports we watch. There are parallel universes here, one where we watch games and scream and sigh, weep and cheer - and another where we devote our days (and a good part of our nights, judging from social media) to obsessing on where Kawhi will end up, whether Neymar Jr. will return to Barcelona, whether Bergevin should be fired for tendering an offer sheet.

Climate change lawsuit has merit

Full text: Re: "Young Quebecers present case for climate change class-action suit" (Montreal Gazette, June 7) Government attorney Ginette Gobeil, in trying to stop a class action accusing Ottawa of climate-change inaction, asks: "How could one demonstrate that measures already adopted by the federal government will not achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets?" In fact, Environment and Climate Change Canada itself admits that current government measures will reduce emissions by only four per cent by 2030, against Canada's target of 30 per cent.
And even if one includes government measures under development but not yet fully implemented, this reduction figure rises to only 19 per cent.
Besides, a 30-per-cent reduction in emissions by 2030, even if achieved by all countries, will not, according to climate scientists, limit global warming to the 2 degrees C target, let alone the less damaging 1.5 C.
The youth bringing this class-action suit are right to argue that excessive warming can endanger their rights to life and security if, as predicted, it will result in potentially deadly heat waves, floods, forest fires, drought, sea level rise and sea acidification, and diminishing world food supply.
The court should take seriously this suit and hopefully find in favour of it, so that the government is moved to increase and accelerate its efforts to reduce emissions and limit climate change.

Game of drones; High-flying students rule the air at a contest that rewards innovation in a booming industry. René Bruemmer drops in as projects - and budding careers - take off

Full text: One team flew their drone into a tree on the day of the national championships. And they weren't even the least fortunate ones.
The day before the big meet, the team from the University of Manitoba, competing for their first time, suffered a "fly-away" in trial run testing, which is defined by people in the industry as "something you hope doesn't happen to you."
Team Manitoba's drone flew up, looked fine, then pitched to one side and plummeted to the ground, losing one of its six propellers. Then things got worse. The hex copter suddenly started rising, out of control - 50 metres, 100 metres, 200 metres - with the student pilots unable to bring it back. It didn't help that the competition was on an airfield. The copter lost another propeller. Finally the power was cut, sending months of hard work and thousands of dollars in investments crashing to Earth.
"Everyone was like 'Wooooooh, damn, they're not competing anymore," said Alex Gouyet, vice-president of McGill University's AERO drone club.
Such was the nature of highstakes brinkmanship at this year's Student Unmanned Aerial System Competition, which pits the best in Canada's university aeronautical design clubs against one another to see who has the greatest chops in drone design, strategy and control.
This year's event was held in early May at the Centre d'Excellence sur les Drones airfield in Alma in Quebec's Saguenay region. Fourteen teams from schools including the University of Toronto, University of British Columbia and Université de Sherbrooke faced off at the competition organized by national industry association Unmanned Systems Canada to vie for bragging rights and potential careers.
Student competitors have been known to get job offers from industry executives and government officials who attend the event to scout new talent.
Once primarily the purview of the military and hobbyists, the market for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles - for everything from industrial inspections to monitoring crop health to real estate photography - is skyrocketing. The five-year market opportunity for drones has been forecast to hit $100-billion between 2016-20, according to Goldman Sachs. While the military remains the main purchaser, commercial and civil governmental use is growing rapidly.
Which is why the annual student competition features teams squaring off in real-life scenarios.
The event draws industry executives, sponsors and government officials looking for potential hires and to see what the brightest young minds are doing to advance technologies or develop new uses. Police forces go to see how theoretical applications can be put to real use. Businesses and governments come to see innovations that could be used to inspect large construction sites or pinpoint where forest fires are located.
Students who were once just teenagers with a passion for remote-controlled vehicles and a penchant for fiddling have become lucrative commodities.
Montreal soared at this year's competition, with perennial powerhouse École de technologie supérieure taking first place, with a $7,000 prize, and McGill finishing second. It was the first time McGill's drone club cracked the top five. They won $5,000, which will help to pay for expenses and recruit new members.
The competition, said Gouyet, the only management student among a team of electrical and mechanical engineering undergrads whose sole membership criteria is a love of drones, "was freakin' hard."
Despite their disaster, Team Manitoba, who had driven 26 hours from Winnipeg to attend, ended up winning the Pip Rudkin Memorial Award for Perseverance. On the day of the meet, they drove 240 kilometres to Quebec City to pick up spare parts, drove back and rebuilt their drone, but couldn't get it airborne.
"They never gave up," the judges noted.
Each year, teams are given tasks that mimic industrial, commercial or crime-fighting uses. Last year teams had to collect aerial footage of a simulated biker gang hangout and drop a payload the size of an egg onto a 10-centimetre target zone, with officials from the RCMP monitoring the proceedings.
This year students had to navigate their drones to a mock solar farm installation about a kilometre away, take an inventory of how many panels had been destroyed or damaged during a storm, and report back within 45 minutes.
The McGill team used two drones - one eight-kilogram, six-propeller hex copter named Carrier, capable of lugging a heavy high-definition camera, the other dubbed Recci (short for reconnaissance) that was more nimble, able to get in close, drop the payload and act as backup in case Carrier glitched. The flight operators navigating via live video feed had to be careful not to crash into each other. The drones had to fly in close enough to read clues typed out in 16-point font, and transfer a package onto a Velcro-covered receiving pad.
If their radio frequencies cut out, the drones were computer programmed to complete the reconnaissance task on their own, flying by GPS co-ordinates.
McGill scored high in part due to their rigorous pre-flight preparation and professionalism, which garnered extra points.
In the months before the meet, they practised repeatedly on a frozen airstrip surrounded by open fields on Île-Perrot off the western tip of Montreal, shivering in the rain to run through possible scenarios "10 times each." They honed their flying and visual imagery skills on miniature aircraft spliced together from spare parts and cannibalized drones, and topped with GoPro cameras. They made sure their computer program failsafes would fly their mini-copters automatically in the event of a radio-frequency breakdown.
For Adrian Wang, 19, who came to McGill from Harbin, China two years ago to study electrical engineering, the club has become the perfect marriage of hobby and academics.
"There are so many similarities to my major, and so many practical applications of the science," he said.
California native Alex Gouyet, 20, caught the bug as a senior in high school when his father bought him a nano drone that fit in the palm of his hand.
"I put it together, started to fly it and something activated in my brain," he remembered. "And I said: 'This is the coolest thing ever.'" During a gap year away from school, Gouyet spent time volunteering on farms in Alabama and Montana, sometimes using his drones to herd sheep and goats, which feared the buzzing aerial beasts.
Another stint at a vineyard in France taught him a love of the land and, combined with McGill management school's mantra of making the world a better place, gave him his future goal: creating a company that will send drones flying low over farmers'fields and use computer software to check the health of crops in a matter of minutes, a growth industry in the drone world.
In a few months, he's going to Kenya to work on a project to foil poachers using drones to track game.
Two weeks after the competition, the young flyers of McGill's Aero Club were back at the windswept fields of Île-Perrot, their eyes to the skies, testing Carrier and Recci and plotting strategy for next year's competition.
Once the work was done, they raced their own personal drones, souped-up aerial hot rods that can hit 100 kilometres an hour.
"Racing is definitely the most fun you can have with a drone," Gouyet said. "Especially five people, five drones following each other in formation - your life peaks when that happens." rbruemmer@postmedia.com

Full text: Arno Kopecky is the author ofThe Devil's Curve: A Journey into Power and Profit at the Amazon's Edge and The Oil Man and the Sea: Navigating the Northern Gateway.
Two weeks ago, I flew across the country to see what used to be known as a natural disaster. The pretty brick bungalow in which my mother-in-law, Jane, and her wife, Jacquie, expected to grow old, on the northwest tip of Montreal Island, had come under siege, and they needed help manning the barricades.
There was, and remains, a long line of belligerents pressed up against the sandbags. Most immediate of these was theLac Des Deux Montagnes, which rose up on April 26 and breached the two-metre retaining wall that normally hems in their backyard. Behind the lake, swelling its assault, is the Ottawa River; behind the river is the vast watershed of the Laurentians, caked with a long winter's record snowpack; and on top of all that fell the April rains, 150 per cent to 250 per cent above average across the region.
By the time I flew in from Vancouver on May 3, the deluge had forced10,000 Quebeckersfrom their homes, along with thousands more in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick - but not the two retirees living on Boulevard Gouin Ouest.
They've been through this before. The stress of the2017 floodshaved 15 pounds off Jacquie's spare frame and pushed Jane into retirement (a family doctor, she'd converted the basement into a clinic that succumbed to the rising groundwater). That perfect storm was described as a once-in-a-century flood. Let's call this one what it is: the first climate disaster to hit Canada in 2019.
There are factors beyond climate change at play. Chief among them is our relentless expansion of urban and agricultural infrastructure. Each year, we plow and pave over more of the land's absorptive capacity, forcing ever more rain and meltwater into overburdened arteries and basins. At the same time, we keep building farther into floodplains whose exposure keeps getting worse. Just ask your local insurer, or increasingly, your local level of government - while I was at Jane and Jacquie's, it was reported that Montreal-area municipalitieshave new flood mapsat their disposal, but are not making them publicly available at this time. Time for some hard talk on liability.
Data Gap: Poor flood-risk maps, or none at all, are keeping Canadian communities in flood-prone areas
Opinion: Climate change is a major factor in flooding - but it's not the only one
But here's the thing about climate change: It amplifies every ecological mistake our species ever made. In this case, consider that Quebec's spring precipitation has increased by 20 per cent over the past fifty years, according to a recent federalreportcalled Canada's Changing Climate. Under a best-case scenario of aggressive climate action, the same report forecast a further 7-per-cent increase in annual precipitation for the province by 2050.
Jane and Jacquie's home was built in 1930 as a summer cabin; it had been raised and renovated by the time Jacquie bought it in 1995. As they are painfully aware, it sits on a mini-floodplain - spring has always summoned the prospect of a leaky basement. But it wasn't until 2017, and then again three weeks ago, that the lake leapt two metres and turned their neighbourhood into a Louisiana bayou.
You could name a dozen contributing factors for how this came to pass. But if you're looking for a single term that wraps them all together, well, there happens to be one at the ready.
It was still raining when Jane picked me up from the airport. We drove west across a peri-urban landscape that showed no sign of distress whatsoever, until we turned a corner and the road disappeared into black water. From there, we advanced in hip waders, strolling heavily through knee-deep murk. Jane pointed out which of the houses we passed had been abandoned, which were damaged but still occupied and which remained unscathed. These discrepancies, she noted quietly, had not done wonders for neighbourhood unity.
We reached her own home two hundred metres in. Where the car should have been, a green canoe floated, tethered to the sandbag wall encircling the house. The bags weighed more than sixty pounds each, and there were about a thousand of them, and Jane and Jacquie, who are 71, had built the whole thing themselves. It took them four days. Now water lapped two thirds of the way up, and not a drop had made it through.

'Last year was supposed to be once in a lifetime': Quebec and New Brunswick brace for new reality of perennial floods
Over the wall, through the front door, and suddenly I was standing inside what felt very much like an anchored ship - whichever window you looked out of, all you saw was water.
"It is a lot like sailing," Jacquie, fierce and petite, said after we'd hugged hello. "Ninety-per-cent boredom and 10-per-cent panic."
The primary source of said panic was the prospect of a failed pump. There are five of them running 24/7, and 10 more in reserve. If one of them burned out, the water table was so high that you only had a few moments to replace it before the basement started flooding. In a worst-case scenario - say the power went out and the backup generator failed - it was anyone's guess how long before the lake knocked the house off its foundation, as happened to the next-door neighbour in 2017.
Jane and Jacquie aren't sailors, but they had a friend on board who was: Cynthia, 58 years young and brimming with emergency preparedness, had been camped here since the beginning. A connoisseur of weather charts and tidal flows and life-preserving protocols, Cynthia was the resident interpreter of flow-management decisions made by the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board, which controls the labyrinth of dams and reservoirs upstream from here. She was going through the latest forecast when I arrived.
"From Mattawa down to Lac Coulonge, levels are expected to begin rising again over the next few days," she read out. But, "below Lac Coulonge, levels are expected to remain stable or slowly decline." Then again, "With warmer temperatures, reservoirs in the Abitibi-Timiskaming area are rapidly filling with increased snowmelt runoff. In this part of the watershed, the volume of spring runoff exceeds the capacity of most reservoirs."
Jacquie absorbed the prognostication for a long moment before reaching a conclusion. "It's going up."
"Yeah," Cynthia beamed, as though looking forward to some action, "but at least I said it nicely."

It's a strange feeling, when something you've long dreaded finally arrives. I've been waiting for climate change my entire adult life. Now I'm 42, and it's here. The fires, floods and hurricanes battering North America these past few years, more fierce and frequent than ever before in recorded history, are precisely what climate science has been predicting since before I was born. Of course, the symptoms have been apparent for some time. But for those of us cocooned in cities, it's been harder to perceive. To feel. Not any more. It's no longer a question of arcane data telling us sea levels are rising by 1.5 millimetres a year, or that global temperatures have risen 0.8 to 1.2 degrees since 1850. It's the smoke in your face, the canoe floating in your driveway. Soon, it'll be the climate refugee next door.
The United Nations predicts that there will be up to 200 million such refugees by 2050. Jane and Jacquie would be the first to say that there's no comparison between the two of them and the twenty million Bangladeshis likely to be displaced this century- or closer to home, the 2,500 people of Kashechewan First Nation in North Ontario who've been forced to evacuateen masse every spring since 2012.
"The moms" have friends and family to help them, enough savings that they're not going to end up in a soup kitchen or a camp for internally displaced persons. Jacquie's son lives down the road and was here every day of the emergency. But they've been living in this home for almost a quarter-century. It has harboured their marriage, their friends, their children and their grandchildren. They never dreamed of leaving.
"I used to look out at the water and see nothing but beauty," Jacquie told me at one point during the weekend. "But now, I can't help seeing menace underneath the surface. I see what it can do."
The anxiety of what each new spring will bring now clouds the entire year. They're not getting younger. And yet, how can they leave? Where will they go? The provincial government currently offers homeowners such as them$200,000 to abandon their houses. This is no mansion - it's 1,300 square feet - but that kind of buyout represents a devastating loss.
While they weigh unsavoury options, the rest of the province, the country and the world are waking up to similar calculations. You may not live on a floodplain, or beside a flammable forest, or know any climate refugees. But your taxes are already being spent on those things. The 2017 flood cost the Quebec government $350-million; this one was worse and will cost more. Canada's federal disaster-relief fund is now paying out more than $1-billion a year, a fivefold increase from 10 years ago. These numbers barely hint at the magnitude of what's coming. Back in 2011, the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy estimated that by 2050, climate change will cost Canadians between $21-billion and $43-billion a year. Our federal government's response was to disband the organization.
Eight years on, we're at a strange juncture in Canada. Polls indicate that most of us are worried about climate change and want something to be done about it, yet over the past couple years, in province after province, we've voted in the opposite direction. The federal opposition depicts filling up your gas tank as a patriotic act. Then again, the Green Party's recent near-victory in PEI, followed by the election of a Green MP across the country in Nanaimo, offers a hopeful counternarrative.
Urgency is in the air. We've entered a brief window of opportunity in which abstract climate science is merging with lived experience, while the apocalypse of three-degree warming or worse can still be avoided. Politically, those are good conditions.
This fall, for the first time in Canadian history, climate change will be a central campaign issue in a federal election. While I'm glad to report that Jane and Jacquie are okay, and so is the house, I'm afraid theirs won't be the last climate disaster to hit Canada before October.

Full text: Arno Kopecky is the author of The Devil's Curve: A Journey into Power and Profit at the Amazon's Edge and The Oil Man and the Sea: Navigating the Northern Gateway.
T wo weeks ago, I flew across the country to see what used to be known as a natural disaster. The pretty brick bungalow in which my motherin-law, Jane, and her wife, Jacquie, expected to grow old, on the northwest tip of Montreal Island, had come under siege, and they needed help manning the barricades.
There was, and remains, a long line of belligerents pressed up against the sandbags. Most immediate of these was the Lac Des Deux Montagnes, which rose up on April 26 and breached the twometre retaining wall that normally hems in their backyard. Behind the lake, swelling its assault, is the Ottawa River; behind the river is the vast watershed of the Laurentians, caked with a long winter's record snowpack; and on top of all that fell the April rains, 150 per cent to 250 per cent above average across the region.
By the time I flew in from Vancouver on May 3, the deluge had forced 10,000 Quebeckers from their homes, along with thousands more in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick - but not the two retirees living on Boulevard Gouin Ouest.
They've been through this before. The stress of the 2017 flood shaved 15 pounds off Jacquie's spare frame and pushed Jane into retirement (a family doctor, she'd converted the basement into a clinic that succumbed to the rising groundwater). That perfect storm was described as a once-ina-century flood. Let's call this one what it is: the first climate disaster to hit Canada in 2019.
There are factors beyond climate change at play. Chief among them is our relentless expansion of urban and agricultural infrastructure. Each year, we plow and pave over more of the land's absorptive capacity, forcing ever more rain and meltwater into overburdened arteries and basins. At the same time, we keep building farther into floodplains whose exposure keeps getting worse. Just ask your local insurer, or increasingly, your local level of government - while I was at Jane and Jacquie's, it was reported that Montreal-area municipalities have new flood maps at their disposal, but are not making them publicly available at this time.
Time for some hard talk on liability.
But here's the thing about climate change: It amplifies every ecological mistake our species ever made. In this case, consider that Quebec's spring precipitation has increased by 20 per cent over the past 50 years, according to a recent federal report called Canada's Changing Climate. Under a best-case scenario of aggressive climate action, the same report forecast a further 7-per-cent increase in annual precipitation for the province by 2050.
Jane and Jacquie's home was built in 1930 as a summer cabin; it had been raised and renovated by the time Jacquie bought it in 1995.
As they are painfully aware, it sits on a mini-floodplain - spring has always summoned the prospect of a leaky basement. But it wasn't until 2017, and then again three weeks ago, that the lake leapt two metres and turned their neighbourhood into a Louisiana bayou.
You could name a dozen contributing factors for how this came to pass. But if you're looking for a single term that wraps them all together, well, there happens to be one at the ready.
It was still raining when Jane picked me up from the airport.
We drove west across a peri-urban landscape that showed no sign of distress whatsoever, until we turned a corner and the road disappeared into black water. From there, we advanced in hip waders, strolling heavily through kneedeep murk. Jane pointed out which of the houses we passed had been abandoned, which were damaged but still occupied and which remained unscathed.
These discrepancies, she noted quietly, had not done wonders for neighbourhood unity.
We reached her own home 200 metres in. Where the car should have been, a green canoe floated, tethered to the sandbag wall encircling the house. The bags weighed more than 60 pounds each, and there were about a thousand of them, and Jane and Jacquie, who are 71, had built the whole thing themselves. It took them four days. Now water lapped two-thirds of the way up, and not a drop had made it through.
Over the wall, through the front door, and suddenly I was standing inside what felt very much like an anchored ship - whichever window you looked out of, all you saw was water.
"It is a lot like sailing," Jacquie, fierce and petite, said after we'd hugged hello. "Ninety-per-cent boredom and 10-per-cent panic."
The primary source of said panic was the prospect of a failed pump. There are five of them running 24/7, and 10 more in reserve.
If one of them burned out, the water table was so high that you only had a few moments to replace it before the basement started flooding. In a worst-case scenario - say the power went out and the backup generator failed - it was anyone's guess how long before the lake knocked the house off its foundation, as happened to the next-door neighbour in 2017.
Jane and Jacquie aren't sailors, but they had a friend on board who was: Cynthia, 58 years young and brimming with emergency preparedness, had been camped here since the beginning. A connoisseur of weather charts and tidal flows and life-preserving protocols, Cynthia was the resident interpreter of flow-management decisions made by the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board, which controls the labyrinth of dams and reservoirs upstream from here. She was going through the latest forecast when I arrived.
"From Mattawa down to Lac Coulonge, levels are expected to begin rising again over the next few days," she read out. But, "below Lac Coulonge, levels are expected to remain stable or slowly decline." Then again, "With warmer temperatures, reservoirs in the Abitibi-Timiskaming area are rapidly filling with increased snowmelt runoff. In this part of the watershed, the volume of spring runoff exceeds the capacity of most reservoirs."
Jacquie absorbed the prognostication for a long moment before reaching a conclusion. "It's going up."
"Yeah," Cynthia beamed, as though looking forward to some action, "but at least I said it nicely."
It's a strange feeling, when something you've long dreaded finally arrives. I've been waiting for climate change my entire adult life. Now I'm 42, and it's here. The fires, floods and hurricanes battering North America these past few years, more fierce and frequent than ever before in recorded history, are precisely what climate science has been predicting since before I was born. Of course, the symptoms have been apparent for some time. But for those of us cocooned in cities, it's been harder to perceive. To feel. Not any more. It's no longer a question of arcane data telling us sea levels are rising by 1.5 millimetres a year, or that global temperatures have risen 0.8 to 1.2 degrees since 1850. It's the smoke in your face, the canoe floating in your driveway. Soon, it'll be the climate refugee next door.
The United Nations predicts that there will be up to 200 million such refugees by 2050. Jane and Jacquie would be the first to say that there's no comparison between the two of them and the 20 million Bangladeshis likely to be displaced this century - or closer to home, the 2,500 people of Kashechewan First Nation in Northern Ontario who've been forced to evacuate en masse every spring since 2012.
"The moms" have friends and family to help them, enough savings that they're not going to end up in a soup kitchen or a camp for internally displaced persons. Jacquie's son lives down the road and was here every day of the emergency. But they've been living in this home for almost a quarter-century. It has harboured their marriage, their friends, their children and their grandchildren.
They never dreamed of leaving.
"I used to look out at the water and see nothing but beauty," Jacquie told me at one point during the weekend. "But now, I can't help seeing menace underneath the surface. I see what it can do."
The anxiety of what each new spring will bring now clouds the entire year. They're not getting younger. And yet, how can they leave? Where will they go? The provincial government currently offers homeowners such as them $200,000 to abandon their houses. This is no mansion - it's 1,300 square feet - but that kind of buyout represents a devastating loss.
While they weigh unsavoury options, the rest of the province, the country and the world are waking up to similar calculations.
You may not live on a floodplain, or beside a flammable forest, or know any climate refugees. But your taxes are already being spent on those things. The 2017 flood cost the Quebec government $350-million; this one was worse and will cost more. Canada's federal disaster-relief fund is now paying out more than $1-billion a year, a five-fold increase from 10 years ago. These numbers barely hint at the magnitude of what's coming. Back in 2011, the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy estimated that by 2050, climate change will cost Canadians between $21-billion and $43-billion a year. Our federal government's response was to disband the organization.
Eight years on, we're at a strange juncture in Canada. Polls indicate that most of us are worried about climate change and want something to be done about it, yet over the past couple years, in province after province, we've voted in the opposite direction.
The federal opposition depicts filling up your gas tank as a patriotic act. Then again, the Green Party's recent near-victory in PEI, followed by the election of a Green MP across the country in Nanaimo, B.C., offers a hopeful counternarrative.
Urgency is in the air. We've entered a brief window of opportunity in which abstract climate science is merging with lived experience, while the apocalypse of three-degree warming or worse can still be avoided. Politically, those are good conditions.
This fall, for the first time in Canadian history, climate change will be a central campaign issue in a federal election. While I'm glad to report that Jane and Jacquie are okay, and so is the house, I'm afraid theirs won't be the last climate disaster to hit Canada before October.

Here's what you need to know about flooding in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick: Communities across Eastern Canada, including Montreal and Ottawa, have shifted to recovery mode after rivers and lakes overflowed their banks starting in mid-April

Full text: The latest
In Quebec, the official numbers provided by public security officials remained largely the same Thursday as they were Wednesday, with 7,229 homes reported flooded, 4,063 properties isolated, and some 10,895 people forced out due to flooding across the province.
In the nation's capital, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said he didn't expect a second wave of flooding for Ottawa and Gatineau. It's the second bout of major spring flooding in three years in the area, and in 2017 the worst damage was caused by a second round of floods.
Health and safety inspection teams fanned outacross flood-affected regions of New Brunswick Friday, assessing homes and businesses that are still drying out amid receding floodwaters.
Satellite imagery
The Globe and Mail obtained recent satellite imagesof extensively flooded neighbourhoods in and around Greater Montreal.
Quebec
On the ground
In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, northwest of Montreal, some of the 6,000 residents ordered to leave after a dike broke on Saturday returned to houses filled with mud-covered detritus and plates of food abandoned during rushed evacuations.
In all, more than 10,000people remained out of their homes in Quebec on Wednesday, and 7,000 residences were flooded.
Water levels in the corridor along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers between Montreal and the boundary with Ontario threatened residents all week, but appear to have stabilized for the time being.
An overview of April's weather helps explain how spring spawned a flooding disaster for several communities from Ottawa to Montreal.
A snowy winter with below-average temperatures meant about twice the normal average amount of snow was still on the ground in mid-April, according to Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
Then, temperatures began to warm, remaining above freezing day and night.
Finally, rain was falling every two or three days by mid-month. Montreal alone had 128 mm in April, while it usually gets 82 mm.
"We had ideal conditions for a catastrophe," Mr. Cantin said.
Political response
Last Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians must talk abouthow and where to rebuildafter floods, and he did not close the door on using federal dollars to help relocate communities facing the recurring threat of severe flooding.
"Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward," he said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Quebec Premier François Legault has said the government will offer homeowners $200,000 to abandon homes that flood year after year, after capping flood relief compensation at $100,000 starting this year.
New Brunswick
On the ground
Communities from Fredericton to Saint John were flooded in the second half of April, forcing nearly 1,000 people to evacuate their homesand more than 400 to stay in temporary hotel accommodations provided by the Canadian Red Cross.
Officials said about 70 per cent of the roughly 940 people seeking help from the Red Cross this year also registered for assistance a year ago.
Among 84 closed roads across the province was a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway between Oromocto and River Glade. Everyone from community volunteers to federal officials and Canadian Armed Forces pitched in to help - even federal fisheries officers were aiding evacuation efforts in Fredericton, Quispamsis and St. George.
"Minor seasonal flooding has always been a way of life in New Brunswick's southern riverside communities," The Globe and Mail's Atlantic bureau chief Jessica Leeder writes. "But when this year's flood levels began contending with the highs seen in 2018 - a flood billed then as historically destructive - many began wondering how many more years like this they can endure."
Political response
The province rolled out a disaster financial assistance program Friday, announcing that affected property owners could receive a maximum of $160,000 for structural repairs to private residences, and up to $500,000 for small businesses and non-profit organizations.
The program is not available for those with damaged cottages and recreational properties.
"Together, we made major efforts to plan for, prepare for and respond to the flood," said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. "Residents, volunteers, first responders and the military worked to protect lives and property. Despite that work there was damage."
Mr. Urquhart said the province was committed to coming up with a better long-term plan to deal with the impact of spring flooding.
Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters during a tour of affected areas that with two floods in as many years, it's clear climate change is changing flooding frequency, and his new Tory government will take this into account in future planning.
'Last year was supposed to be once in a lifetime': Quebec and New Brunswick brace for new reality of perennial floods
Ontario
On the ground
A Saturday morning report from the board that monitors levels in the Ottawa River says near Constance Bay, water levelsare at or above their 2017 levels and are forecast to rise another 47 centimetres. At a measuring spot near Parliament Hill, where paths and parking lots along the river are already underwater, the board forecasts a rise of another 75 centimetres before water levels peak on May 1.
About 400 soldiers were deployed in Ottawa to assist with flooding efforts in the city as water levels on the Ottawa River rise to dangerous levels.
Many roads in the Bracebridge area, in Ontario's cottage country, have been washed out by floodwaters as two nearby lakes are have water levels that exceed those last seen during serious flooding in 2013.
Kashechewan First Nation has been evacuated, as its more than 2,500 members have been flownto other locations across the province and its leaders continue to call for a permanent relocation.
Political response
Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he believes climate changeis among the reasons eastern Ontario homeowners are trying to save their homes from flooding for the second time in three years. Ford was in the rural west end of Ottawa Friday morning, touring flooded areas along the Ottawa River.
The office of Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson says the combination of already high water levels and further rainfall give rise to a situation that "constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm." It said the water levels pose "an ongoing threat" to property, health and safety of nearby residents.
The communities of Bracebridge and Minden HIlls have declared a state of emergency and advising residents in areas prone to flooding to relocate.
Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith was joined at a news conference Wednesday by Ford, whose family has a cottage in the area.
The long view
Believing that climate change is the lone issue at play means that we risk missing a major part of the story - and the solution,argues Les Stanfield.
When it comes to facing the risks of large-scale disasters, Wency Leung reports, many people have a hard time envisioning - let alone preparing for - worst-case scenarios.
If floods and forest fires and other calamities can forge a political consensus on the need to combat climate change, then that's progress,writes John Ibbitson.
There are more floods than ever before, and yet our behaviour toward them in the 21st century is just as irrational as that of our pagan ancestors, who considered them a punishment from a vengeful God, wrote Ian Brownin the aftermath of the floods Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Houston in 2017.
The discourse of flood recovery has to turn to getting those in the immediate flood plain permanently out of harm's way,writes Glenn McGillivray, managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss and Reduction. He is advocating for governments to buy out landowners located on floodplains.
Inadequacies in the mapping of coastal areas are hindering Canadians' efforts to protect themselves from flood disaster, The Globe's Matthew McClearn learns.
Engineers and the scientific community need to move more swiftly to design infrastructure that accounts for climate change science,according to one expert.

Full text: If home is where the heart is, thousands of hearts around Montreal and across Quebec are breaking as flood waters rise to unprecedented levels.
Rivers have spilled their banks and are now encroaching on homes in Pierrefonds, Île-Bizard and Ahuntsic, in the city of Montreal, as well as Laval, Rigaud, Lachute, Deux-Montagnes and countless other towns and villages. Homes, and everything their inhabitants hold dear, are threatened. Neighbourhoods are under siege. Basements are swamps of murky water. Yards are vast lakes. And everywhere walls of sandbags, the product of back-breaking human labour, try mightily to hold back the tide. After Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante declared a state of emergency Friday, the possibility of evacuations loom.
The worst happened in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac Saturday night when a dike was breached and water poured in, forcing residents to flee. We are at nature's mercy. Our cities, communities, villages, hamlets, neighbourhoods and rural areas, our highways, roads, bridges and dams, and, of course, people's homes, are being inundated.
Where will it end? What will be left when the waters recede? These are the questions that keep exhausted residents on the front lines up at night - and civil authorities on high alert.
Amplifying the fear, worry and helplessness is the fact many of these same folks found their homes in harm's way just two years ago. They battled the waters, salvaged what belongings they could, were left dislocated for long periods, struggled financially and toiled physically to rebuild their lives from the ground up after a so-called 100-year flood.
Now they might face the same trial all over again. The strain and worry is enough to break any spirit.
Although Pierrefonds borough Mayor Jim Beis says lessons from 2017 and quick action have protected hundreds of homes this time around, the flooding is already worse in some areas and the toll already higher than the calamity of 2017.
We are in uncharted waters.
But the really scary part is that this could be the new normal - a terrifying new reality that has long been foretold, but is now upon us. Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world; the Arctic, three times as fast. With climate change comes more extreme weather - hotter, colder, wetter and dryer at different points.
And as we experience these devastating effects today around the Island of Montreal, projections suggest things will get worse.
The Climate Atlas of Canada, created by the Prairie Climate Centre, predicts Montreal will see an increase in both winter and spring precipitation. Upstream, Ottawa - where much of the water is coming from and which is also hampered by flooding - faces wetter winters and springs, too.
Federal Public Security Minister Ralph Goodale said Friday the flooding in Eastern Canada - from the Ottawa Valley all the way to New Brunswick - is the "most obvious manifestation" of climate change. He warned it's something we're unfortunately going see more of in the coming years.
A report by the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs in 2017 noted "flooding is currently the most costly hazard in terms of urban property damage," in Canada.
It eclipses fire and theft when it comes to insurance claims, while displacing the population, imperilling critical infrastructure, interrupting business and threatening physical and mental health.
Catastrophe has come to us, rather than striking a distant location in a remote corner of the planet. We are now face to face with disaster. And we have no choice but to try to mitigate the harm, while working to adapt to a stark future. This is an all-handson-deck moment.
Montreal is taking steps to better withstand the consequences of climate change, appointing a new executive committee member and opening a new bureau charged with ecological transition and resilience. Some 330 Quebec municipalities have signed the Déclaration d'urgence climatique and must now put words into action.
Montreal city council and the agglomeration council both held extraordinary sessions in Pierrefonds on Sunday.
Right now the priority is, rightfully, emergency management. But just as crucial will be the measures we undertake in the aftermath to brace for and blunt the impact of climate change.
These include: protecting our wetlands, watersheds and forests; greening paved areas to prevent run-off and increase soil absorption; changing building codes to create structures better able to withstand rising waters; and altering zoning laws that stipulate where buildings can be constructed. Sometimes nature is itself the best defence against the ravages of nature.
Such efforts may start in municipalities, but much responsibility belongs to the provincial and federal governments. They have more power to curb the emissions that lead to these dire results.
There is much to be done. In the next hours, days and weeks, our efforts must focus on helping those in the flood zone.
We are all in this together.

Floods force conservatives to find consensus on climate

Full text: Saturday evening, a dike failed in Sainte-Marthe-surle-Lac, near Montreal, forcing an emergency evacuation.
Two years after enduring a record spring flood, Ottawa and Gatineau are living through worse, with hundreds of homes flooded or at risk. Four hundred kilometres to the west in Bracebridge, troops have arrived to assist in sandbagging and reinforcing first responders, as the Muskoka River inundates homes and cottages.
"We thought 2013 was a hundred-year event," Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith told reporters, referencing a previous flood, "and here we are six years later."
As one year of record flooding is surpassed by another, the issue becomes increasingly political.
Believe it or not, this is a good thing, because it forces conservative politicians to take global warming seriously, and to respond.
While no single event can be directly linked to climate change, "the global scientific models predict increases in extreme precipitation events and heat-related events," said Craig Stewart, vicepresident of federal affairs at the Insurance Bureau of Canada in an interview. "This is now playing out.
"There is no new normal."
Although the United States, China and India are far more responsible for climate change than Canada, that does does not relieve this country of its moral obligation to do its part. Both federal and provincial Liberals have long claimed they get this. Conservatives now say they get it, too.
Both Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently visited the flood scene in Ottawa.
While Mr. Ford is part of a coalition of conservative premiers opposed to the Liberals' carbon tax, he realizes that more than coincidence is at work with this incessant flooding.
"Something is going on," he told reporters Friday. "We have to be conscious of it."
And he vowed that Ontario would "be one of the leaders in the entire country, if not North America, in reduction of [carbon] emissions."
If floods and forest fires and other calamities can forge a political consensus on the need to combat climate change, then that's progress.
Not that Mr. Ford, Alberta premier-designate Jason Kenney and a bevy of other conservative premiers are likely to let up on their war against the Liberal carbon tax. But these floods are at least forcing them to come up with alternatives.
Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer promised on Saturday to unveil his party's plan - most likely some combination of incentives and regulations - before the House rises in June.
Virtually every economist agrees that a carbon tax is a more effective tool for combatting climate change than cumbersome regulations and incentives. But Joel Wood, an environmental economist at Thompson Rivers University, notes that carbon taxes are politically hazardous for the very same reason they are economically effective: People notice them.
If your gas bill spikes because of a carbon tax, you will probably reduce consumption, Prof. Wood said in an interview. But you won't be happy about it. "Visibility comes at a political cost."
But shouldn't these weatherrelated calamities, which point to the need for immediate action to lower carbon emissions, encourage voters to accept the carbon tax?
The research, according to Sarah Wolfe, suggests otherwise.
Prof. Wolfe, an environmental studies professor at University of Waterloo, studies the psychological impact of environmental changes. Pre-existing attitudes toward an uncertain future often dictate people's reaction to climate-change-related events, she says.
"Not everyone responds to climate awareness in a 'pro-environmental' way," Prof. Wolfe explained in an e-mail exchange.
Some people respond to floods and forest fires by pushing for more aggressive measures to reduce emissions. Others deny the connection or try to avoid thinking about it.
"Things or events that frighten us tend to reinforce our pre-existing identities," she said. In other words, how you see the world determines how you react to climate change, facts be damned.
But beyond a certain point, willful ignorance must surely give way to reality. Any climate skeptics living in the national capital have endured a freak batch of tornadoes, the longest-lasting snow pack on record and now these floods, all in the past year.
The Trudeau Liberals have always made fighting global warming a priority, which is why they imposed the tax. The Conservatives now say that fight is a priority for them as well, but a tax is the wrong approach.
That's sorta, kinda progress, no?

Trade disputes, rate hikes slow rise in farmland values

Full text: TRANSPORTATION REPORTER
Rising borrowing costs, trade disputes and falling crop prices have conspired to slow the ascent of Canadian farmland values.
The average increase in agricultural real estate was 6.6 per cent in 2018 after a rise of 8.4 per cent in 2017, according to Farm Credit Canada, the country's biggest farm lender.
J.P. Gervais, chief agricultural economist for the Crown corporation, said the Bank of Canada's lending rate increases and lower prices for canola, soybeans and other major field crops amid global trade tensions have dampened farmers' incomes and slowed the rise in land prices.
For 2019, Mr. Gervais predicts the trade disputes - the China-U.S. agriculture tariff dispute, China's ban on most Canadian canola and India's restrictions on Canada's lentils and other pulse crops - will erode farm incomes and cut in half the rise of farmland value to about 3 per cent.
Soybeans and canola prices are down by about 15 per cent in the past 12 months. Wheat has fallen by 11 per cent and corn is down by 16 per cent. A weaker Canadian dollar aids the export-focused growers, but cannot entirely shield them from the price declines.
Growers are responding by slashing the amount of acreage they seed with canola and soybeans by 6 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, a recent Statistics Canada survey shows. "In the prairies, canola can represent as much as 45 per cent of crop receipts, so this is obviously a big deal," Mr. Gervais said on a call with reporters to discuss the annual release of the land value report, which analyses sales and benchmark properties in 51 regions of the country.
The lower crop prices come as costs for everything from fuel to fertilizer and machinery are rising.
Statscan's index of farm input costs is up by 20 per cent since 2011, outpacing farmers' 17-per-cent rise in cash receipts during the same period.
Mr. Gervais said much of the rise in farmland values was driven by sharp increases in prices for lowerend acreage compared with the more productive, expensive fields.
Over all, a tight supply of high production farmland and the historically low borrowing costs cushioned the slowdown in overall land price rises, Mr. Gervais said, observing that the number of land sales decreased in 2018.
Across the country, farmland in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Quebec exceeded the national average rise in prices, while Nova Scotia posted a decline of 4.9 per cent.
Crop producers and dairy farmers drove up prices in Quebec's busy agricultural real estate market by 8.3 per cent, leading the country. Quebec farmland has risen in value every year since 1986, although growth has flattened out in the past few years. The FCC said bargain hunters in the eastern reaches of Quebec, including Gaspésie and Chaudière-Appalaches, sent prices up by double digits.
The Montérégie near Montreal is worth the most - $16,000 for one acre. B.C. land prices rose by 6.7 per cent, led by a 21.7-per-cent increase on Vancouver Island, the highest in Canada.
The fruit-growing Okanagan region boasts the country's most valuable farmland, at almost $100,000 an acre. Price increases in Alberta were stable, as a dry start to the 2018 growing season and early snow dampened demand for land among smallerand medium-sized growers.
Large producers and demand for irrigated land helped boost prices by 7.4 per cent. The southern part of Alberta saw prices rise by almost 13 per cent to an average of $6,200 an acre. Saskatchewan's farmland rose by an average of 7.4 per cent after a 10-percent climb in 2017.
Weather had a big impact on crop yields and prices, the FCC said, as dry, hot weather and smoke from the British Columbia forest fires affected growing and harvesting conditions, the FCC said. Fields in the west-central part of the province are the most valuable, worth an average of $1,985 an acre.
Manitoba growers saw their farmland values rise by 3.7 per cent last year, as a wet start to the season was followed by a drought that reduced crop yields for soybeans, hay and feed corn.
The Central Plains-Pembina region is Manitoba's most valuable land, at an average $5,000 an acre.
Farmland in the tight Ontario market rose by 3.6 per cent, driven by supply-managed growers, cash-crop producers and investors. The FCC noted demand for land from dairy farmers softened, perhaps due to milk market share lost in free-trade deals.
Ontario's southwestern farm belt is the province's most valuable, worth an average $17,500 an acre.

Josh Freed: The seven signs of spring in Montreal

Full text: I saw my first real sign of spring last week, a Montreal urban version of the first robin. It was an outdoor terrasse on Peel St. - and my heart throbbed.
Since then flocks of terrasses have arrived, a heart-warming, seat-warming sign this endless winter has finally ended.
I got a similar warm shiver when city workers tore down the hockey rinks and put up park benches, picnic tables and Bixi stations, even if many still don't have bikes.
These are sure-fire signs of Montreal spring and we need them, after a five-month winter that began with a Nov. 16 blizzard( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/first-serious-snowfall-of-the-season-slows-montreal-traffic-bus-service ) and ended with another mid-April( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ).
OK, it's probably pouring as you read this, since weather sites have all posted a scary "RAINFALL ALERT!" (Beware of falling rain!)
But our town is finally reawakening in all its glory, grit and grime. So let's celebrate the seven signs of spring:
Sign 1: Two billion tons of black ice has finally melted, revealing 200,000 tons of gravel underneath, flung down by city workers all winter. It covers our city like a layer of moon dust, fused together with five months of cigarette butts, lotto tickets and candy wrappers, 500,000 plastic bags, and 650 trillion dead leaves.
Also, a winter's worth of dog poop left by owners who should be impounded instead of their dogs.
Sign 2: The Tam Tam drummers were out at Mount Royal last Sunday after a deafening five-month silence. I've never been happier to hear them, though there were only 100 people there, drumming away in parkas and mitts.
The crowds will get bigger every week while clothing gets ever more skimpy. If we didn't have winters, it would eventually be a nudist gathering.
Sign 3: Construction's in full spring swing, with so many road-blocked streets you'd think we're trying to catch spies.
Every second street is a forest of orange detour signs. A friend sent a photo of four detour signs at a Verdun intersection, all for highway 15 - all pointing different directions.
Even my GPS is confused lately, sending me down streets saying Rue Barré, then changing routes again and again, until my screen freezes on the word "re-rerouting".
I suspect my Google Maps app is desperately consulting Waze, while my Waze consults Google. Who can fault them? In Montreal all roads now lead to ruin.
Spring is also pothole season and this year boasts a record "bump"-er crop. We've all become "road scholars", studying each pothole carefully to avoid ones that can cost you a wheel, or worse.
Last week the city reported it's already filled 55,000 potholes( https://journalmetro.com/actualites/2302316/55-000-nids-de-poule-colmates-depuis-le-debut-de-lannee/ ). Only 99,999,945,000 to go.
Sign 4: Strikers and protesters are back on the streets, whether they're Bill 21 demonstrators, taxi drivers or angry unions.
There's a reason the student protests were dubbed Maple Spring. Our protests are the year's first outdoor gathering, in a Festival of Discontent.
Sign 5: There are downsides to spring too. Since April 1, the street-sweeping machines are back. So is the post-spring rite of setting your alarm to move your car to the other side of the street, along with all your neighbours.
Then we all circle the block playing "musical cars" where winners get spots and losers traditional $52 tickets. Ooops, make that $78 since the province just shockingly boosted the price( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cost-of-parking-tickets-going-up ).
It's enough to make me drive right to Laval for a free spot, then métro home.
Sign 6: The best spring gift is the extra light as the sun now sets at 7:45 p.m., instead of four hours after I wake up. It's been brighter ever since we returned to daylight saving - but switching our clocks may soon be a spring thing of the past.
European Union countries will all stop clock-switching in 2021, though each country will vote whether to stay on permanent "summer" or "winter" time.
It can't be long before that spreads here. I pray Montrealers eventually vote for daylight-saving - not daylight-craving time.
Sign 7: I just did my annual spring tour of The Main's shops to see who'd survived, or died. I was pleased to find more survivors than usual.
My favourite ramen resto had closed, but all the hip new clothing, tattoo and coffee shops that opened in recent years are still there after this long winter. Bravo!
Several new places are opening and to my amazement, three had signs posted saying "Help Wanted."
Montreal signs like that were once rarer than construction cranes, which were rarer than whooping cranes. But now they're just another mark of spring.
Several Main merchants have put out their "illegal" plastic chairs for aging customers to sit. Soon city inspectors will be ticketing them, while merchants take in the chairs on days inspectors regularly come by - in the most idiotic rite of spring.
I say three cheers for the chairs!
Meanwhile, ignore the RAINFALL ALERT!, the dirt, potholes, detours and parking tickets and focus on the bright side.
Soon you'll be wearing sandals, lounging on terrasses and festival-hopping. It won't be long before you're complaining again - about the heat.

'The clock is ticking' and environmentalists aren't going to take it anymore

Full text: It was around Christmastime that May Chiu's climate depression really took hold.
The Montreal lawyer and mother of two was greatly alarmed by the International Panel on Climate Change report released revealing the devastating effects of global warming will be felt sooner and at a lower temperature than previously realized. Without drastic action, United Nations scientists warned, humanity faces drought, hunger, extreme weather and crop failure - within our children's lifetimes, if not our own.
"My daughter is 13. She asked me: 'Mom, tell me the truth, how much time do we have left?' What do I tell her?" Chiu said. "I started to feel like maybe I should just run up a huge debt and live hedonistically with the time I have left."
Instead, she channelled her despair into a new group joining the fight for urgent action on climate change. Extinction Rebellion just held its first public demonstrations in Montreal. On Tuesday, members hosted a teach-in at McGill College Ave. and Sherbrooke St. On Wednesday, six members chained themselves to the front doors( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/watch-extinction-rebellion-members-chain-themselves-to-premiers-montreal-office ) of Premier François Legault's office building.
Extinction Rebellion originated in the United Kingdom. It espouses non-violent direct action and civil disobedience. The same day Montrealers risked arrest outside Legault's office, protesters in Londonblocked train lines and disrupted traffic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/uk-climate-protesters-block-roads-glue-themselves-to-train/wcm/d1f062b2-68c8-49ab-b4be-4432bf58f865 ) - part of a mobilization taking place in 80 cities and 30 countries leading up the Earth Day, April 22.
Earth Day is typically a feel-good occasion where schoolchildren learn about recycling and community groups plant trees. But this year it feels decidedly sombre - and deadly serious. Since the IPCC report, the prognosis for the planet has worsened. Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world; the north, three times as fast.
Citizens around the world have started to panic as scientists warn we have maybe 12 years to turn things around. Montreal has become a hotbed of such activism, in many cases by people who weren't climate warriors before. Mobilizing, it turns out, is one way to ease their climate anxiety.
Days after the IPCC report landed, Dominic Champagne attended a gloomy dinner party that convinced him he had to do something. The Quebec theatre producer launched the Pacte pour la transition( https://www.lepacte.ca/en/the-pact/ ), a pledge for citizens to reduce their carbon footprint and a demand that government take steps on a societal level to slash emissions and end our dependency on fossil fuels.
Champagne leveraged his connections( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-a-new-social-contract-to-fight-climate-change-in-quebec ) getting Quebec celebrities to sign on and the general public took it up in great number. He also helped organize a protest that brought 50,000 Montrealers to the streets on a few day's notice. His influence earned him a meeting with a then-newly elected Legault.
The initial flurry of activity has not abated. Champagne is in demand as a speaker, touring the province to visit schools and CEGEPs on his own dime. The pact has more than 270,000 signatures.
But six months on, he feels a growing sense of futility.
"Do we have to wait until the violence of nature becomes more brutal still? How many more floods will it take? How many more forest fires? How much of our well-being has to be sacrificed before we move?" he said on the eve of Earth Day. "I don't have the answers."
Young people have been at the forefront of Montreal efforts to sound the alarm about the climate emergency, even some who aren't yet old enough to vote.
Sara Montpetit, a 17-year-old student at Robert Gravel high school, has emerged as Montreal's answer to Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen whose solitary protests and searing words have made her a symbol of her generation's hopes, fears and anger about climate change.
Inspired by Thunberg, Montpetit has been leading weekly strikesl. A few hundred students skip school every Friday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-youth-turn-panic-into-action-with-another-climate-march ) and converge on Jeanne Mance Park.
Squeezing in a telephone interview during her lunch break, Montpetit said she thinks political leaders have taken note of young Montrealers' message, but seem to treat their passion as a passing fad.
"They don't take us seriously. They think we're dreamers or we're idealists," she said. "But they're the idealists if they think we can continue the way we're going."
Though she's frequently fed up, Montpetit is buoyed by her generation's commitment to the cause, especially their efforts to convince their parents of the crisis. Her own parents will soon take their last airline trip. Montpetit already refuses to fly because of the emissions air travel generates.
"It's not really their fault. That's the system they were brought up with," she said. "This is a revolution of young people. But the only generation that can act is the one that's in charge now."
Members of Extinction Rebellion chained themselves to the doors of the building housing the premier's Montreal office on April 17.
Despite its more radical tactics, Extinction Rebellion isn't made up of typical radicals. It counts bankers and academics( https://on.ft.com/2UH9OUJ ) as adherents. Its commitment to non-violence means parents often bring their children along.
"We're really a cross-section of society. We have filmmakers, we have artists, we have teachers. I'm a lawyer," Chiu said. "We have people in their 60s. Serge, one of the guys who chained himself to Legault's door, is 82."
Chiu said Extinction Rebellion held its first meetings in Montreal in January and is ready to make its presence felt. It held workshops on civil disobedience - though only members willing to be arrested sign up for riskier operations, and held sessions on the psychological toll of climate change.
Chiu said she would ordinarily be out in the streets protesting against Bill 21( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/bill-21 ), the Quebec government's proposed ban on religious garb for some public employees, which critics have lambasted as legalized discrimination. But Chiu said she believes it's a distraction meant to divert attention from the real crisis gripping the planet.
"Climate change is already upon us," said Chiu. "The clock is ticking."
After the terrifying IPCC report, Normand Beaudet, too, heard the call to arms. He began mobilizing citizens across Quebec to get their municipalities to declare a climate emergency.
The grass-roots initiative caught on faster than expected. To date, 330 local governments -including Communauté metropolitaine de Montréal( https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1134054/declaration-urgence-climatique-cmm-valerie-plante-andre-belisle ) representing about half the population of Quebec - have signed the Déclaration universelle d'urgence climatique( https://www.groupmobilisation.com/la-duc ).
"That was the easy part," Beaudet said. "The hard part is passing to action."
Work on a toolbox for citizens to bring to their municipalities was accelerated. Last week, a list of 11 areas to act on( https://www.chantiersdeladuc.com/ ) was unveiled, like sustainable urban planning and low-emissions construction.
"We're going to have to make this transition one way or the other," Beaudet said. "The questions is, do we bring about the necessary changes ourselves or will they be forced on us?"
Back in February, Louis Couillard had tears in his eyes explaining how he came to help organize a major climate strike in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-quebec-students-poised-to-strike-over-climate-change ) as part of the collective La Planète s'invite a l'université.
The rally, held March 15, drew 150,000 students( https://montrealgazette.com/news/picketing-montreal-students-force-some-schools-to-close-ahead-of-climate-change-march ) to the streets of Montreal, not only from university and CEGEP, but from high school and primary schools. It is believed to be the largest of the strikes attended by 1.5 million young people around the world that day.
"We were really proud," said Couillard this week while studying for exams at Université de Montréal. "But it can't end there."
A meeting the students clinched with Quebec Environment Minister Benoît Charette didn't yield the results they were hoping for.
"I think part of the message was heard," Couillard said. "But the part of the message that hasn't been received is the urgency of acting."
Young people aren't giving up, though, he said. They will regroup and strategize over the summer. There is a climate demonstration set for Montreal April 27, to cap off Earth Week, and another student strike planned for Sept. 29.
"We have hope because we're taking action ourselves," Couillard said. "To anyone out there feeling that eco-anxiety, I've felt it. I know it's really easy to roll up in a little ball at home and be depressed about the future. But the moment I started feeling better was the moment I got out there and started doing something about it."

Full text: It was around Christmastime that May Chiu's climate depression really took hold.
The Montreal lawyer and mother of two was greatly alarmed by the International Panel on Climate Change report released in late 2018 revealing that the devastating effects of global warming will be felt sooner and at a lower temperature than previously realized. Without drastic action, United Nations scientists warned, humanity faces drought, hunger, extreme weather and crop failure - all within our children's lifetimes, if not our own.
"My daughter is 13. She asked me, 'Mom, tell me the truth, how much time do we have left?'What do I tell her? Do I tell her the truth and break her heart?" Chiu said. "I started to feel like maybe I should just run up a huge debt and live hedonistically with the time I have left."
Instead, she channelled her despair into a new group joining the fight for urgent action on climate change. Extinction Rebellion just held its first public demonstrations in Montreal. On Tuesday, members held a teachin at McGill College Ave. and Sherbrooke St. On Wednesday, six members chained themselves to the front doors of the building housing Premier François Legault's office.
Extinction Rebellion originated in the United Kingdom. It espouses non-violent direct action and civil disobedience. The same day Montrealers risked arrest outside Legault's office, protesters in London blocked train lines and disrupted traffic on busy thoroughfares - part of a mobilization taking place in 80 cities and 30 countries leading up the Earth Day, April 22.
Earth Day is typically a feelgood occasion where schoolchildren learn about recycling and community groups plant trees. But this year it feels decidedly sombre, and deadly serious. Since the IPCC report, the prognosis for the planet has only gotten worse. Canada, a federal report found, is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world; the north, three times as fast.
Citizens around the world have started to panic, spurred by scientists warning that we have 10 to 12 years to turn things around or face irreversible damage. Montreal has been a hotbed of such activism, in many cases by people who weren't climate warriors before. Mobilizing, it turns out, is one way to ease their climate grief.
Days after the IPCC report landed Dominic Champagne attended a gloomy dinner party with friends that catalyzed his desire to do something. The Quebec theatre producer launched the Pacte pour la transition, a pledge for citizens to reduce their carbon footprint and a demand that government take steps on a societal level to slash emissions and end our dependency on fossil fuels.
Champagne leveraged his connections getting Quebec celebrities to sign on and the general public took it up in great number. He also helped organize a hastily-convened demonstration that brought 50,000 Montrealers to the streets in November. His influence earned him a meeting with a then-newly elected Legault.
The initial flurry of activity has not abated. Champagne is in demand as a speaker, touring the province to visit schools and CEGEPs on his own dime. The pact has garnered more than 270,000 signatures.
But six months on, he feels a growing sense of futility due to the lack of government action and public apathy.
"Do we have to wait until the violence of nature becomes more brutal still? How many more floods will it take? How many more forest fires? How much of our well-being has to be sacrificed before we move?" said an exasperated Champagne in a recent interview. "What do we have to do next to convince people, hunger strikes? "I don't have the answers." Young people have been at the forefront of Montreal efforts to sound the alarm about the climate emergency, even some who aren't yet old enough to vote.
Sara Montpetit, a 17-year-old student at Robert Gravel high school, has emerged as Montreal's answer to Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen whose solitary protests and searing words have made her a symbol of her generation's hopes, fears and anger about climate change.
Inspired by Thunberg, Montpetit has been leading weekly strikes in Montreal. A few hundred students skip school every Friday and converge on Jeanne Mance Park.

"They don't take us seriously.
They think we're dreamers or we're idealists," she said. "But they're the idealists if they think we can continue the way we're going."
Though she's sometimes fed up, Montpetit is buoyed by her generation's commitment to the cause, especially their efforts to convince their parents and grandparents of the crisis. She said her own parents will soon take their last airline trip. Montpetit already refuses to fly because of the emissions air travel generates.
"It's not really their fault.
That's the system they were brought up with," she said. "This is a revolution of young people. But the only generation that can act is the one that's in charge now."

Chiu said Extinction Rebellion held its first meetings in Montreal in January and is preparing to play a more active role in the local fight against climate change. It has led workshops on civil disobedience - though only members willing to be arrested sign up for riskier operations. It holds sessions on the psychological dimensions of climate change, often called "eco grief."
As a longtime activist against racism, Chiu said she would ordinarily be out in the streets protesting against Bill 21, the Quebec government's proposed ban on religious garb for some public employees, which critics have lambasted as legalized discrimination. But Chiu said she believes it's a distraction meant to divert attention from the real crisis gripping the planet.
"Climate change is already upon us," said Chiu. "The clock is ticking."
Normand Beaudet has been involved in social causes all his life. After the terrifying IPCC report, he too, heard the call to arms. He started mobilizing citizens across Quebec to get their municipalities to declare a climate emergency.
The grassroots initiative caught on much faster than expected. To date, 330 local governments - including Communauté metropolitaine de Montréal representing about half the population of Quebec - have signed the Déclaration universelle d'urgence climatique.
"That was the easy part," Beaudet said. "The hard part is passing to action."
Work on developing a tool box for citizens to bring to their municipalities was accelerated. Last week, a list of 11 fronts in the battle was unveiled, like sustainable urban planning and zero-emissions construction.
"We're going to have to make this transition one way or the other," Beaudet said. "The questions is, do we bring about the necessary changes ourselves or will they be forced on us?" Back in February, Louis Couillard had tears in his eyes as he explained how he came to help organize a major climate strike in Montreal as part of the collective La Planète s'invite a l'université.

Cabane à sucre chalets at Sucrerie de la Montagne promise sweet dreams

Full text: I went full sugar-shack immersion on my first visit to the renowned Sucrerie de la Montagne in Rigaud and I found that cabane à sucre cuisine has evolved since my last tourtière in the countryside.
Ham, baked beans and maple syrup still are mainstays of this hospitality juggernaut, but the Sucrerie has added a soupçon of sophistication to the microcosm of maple.
I arrived on a celebratory day, so the Sucrerie's owner Pierre Faucher had uncorked a bottle of Wapiti, the new maple-infused, fortified wine made exclusively for him by Vignoble Côte de Vaudreuil.
And showing off the new dinner offering, chef Félix Le Cavalier dished out bison sausages and venison chops from La Bête Sauvage, the Sucrerie's gourmet dining room. When I departed, I purchased gifts at the General Store: the requisite jugs of maple syrup, of course, but also a flacon of maple-scented perfume, custom-blended by Parfumerie Galimard of France.
Pierre Faucher taps into a maple tree to gather the sap to be made into syrup at the Sucrerie de la Montagne.
The scene: Founded 41 years ago, the Sucrerie has grown from a single-room sugar shack to one of Quebec's largest maple operations with several dining halls and lodging.
With a staggering archive of media coverage from America to Asia, it certainly is the most recognized. And it likely is the only sugar shack that is both a Quebec National Historic Site and a signature experience of the Canadian Tourism Commission. With all this publicity, it attracts as many as 80,000 people a year.
The Sucrerie is as picturesque a country tableau as you can imagine, and it's especially magical in winter. A dozen ancestral log buildings cluster around a blazing firepit, high on a mountaintop and surrounded by a forest of majestic maples. Indoors, the scene is warm and festive, with heaps of hearty food and antique country decor.
"Our authenticity is the main attraction," said Faucher, who runs the place with his son Stefan. "We built all this by hand."
The Fauchers are tall, burly mountain men with bushy beards and ample bellies wrapped in the ceinture fléchée, the colourful woven belt of Quebec's coureurs des bois of the 1600s. Faucher père is a jovial host and an irrepressible marketing whiz who has travelled the world to show off Canadian maple magic.
La Bête Sauvage, the Sucrerie's new gourmet dining room, serves a menu of Quebec game.
New gastronomy: La Bête Sauvage is a 100-year-old dining space filed with heavy pine furniture and festooned with collectibles like snowshoes, copper carvings and oil lamps. This intimate room serves a new multi-course, prix fixe extravaganza from pea soup to sugar pie, but with new gourmet dishes in between.
"We have tamed Quebec's wild game," said Pierre Faucher. "It's our leap into fine dining, but still with the charm of our rustic setting. It's festive, not formal."
Appetizers include rabbit terrine and smoked duck, and main courses include venison, cipaille or bison sausages.
Sucrerie de la Montagne has rustic log cabins in an idyllic mountaintop domain.
Sugar shack: The traditional cabane à sucre dinner includes all-you-can-eat pea soup, baked beans, tourtière, maple-smoked ham, meatballs, soufflé-style omelettes, sausages and salt pork. It's almost impossible to save room for dessert - irresistible sugar pie or mini-crêpes with the Sucrerie's divine syrup - but it's a must.
"Our natural process using a wood fire is what gives our syrup a distinctive flavour," said Faucher.
The Sucrerie is one of about three per cent of Quebec's approximately 8,000 maple producers that use a centuries-old system of taps( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/maple-syrup-farms ), buckets and wood-fired evaporators, instead of modern vacuum pumps and plastic tubing.
The Sucrerie does a huge business with group parties, when it rocks with entertainment, including dancing to live fiddle music.
Chalets: The Sucrerie has four rustic log cabins, perfect for people who want to get away from it all. They're vintage timber and mortar buildings that Faucher salvaged and moved here. The chalets, each two storeys with single and double beds, are suitable for between two and six guests.
There are no televisions and the Wi-Fi and cell service are spotty, but the fireplace glows all night, and togetherness and tranquility are the main attractions. Couples love the claw-foot tub, aperitifs by the fireplace and dinner at La Bête Sauvage. Children get fresh air frolicking around the property and snowshoers can tackle trails through the woods.
Pierre Faucher checks the boiling sap as it is made into maple syrup at the Sucrerie de la Montagne in Rigaud in 2018.

Full text: A heavy accumulation of snow and ice caused another roof to collapse in the borough of Montreal North early Tuesday, the second incident to occur in the borough in as many days.
The latest incident, which occurred at 2 a.m., saw the roof of an industrial building on Forest St. cave in. As was the case a day earlier at an auto parts shop on Edgar St., heavy accumulation of snow and ice atop a flat roof supported by cement pillars led to the collapse, a Montreal fire department spokesperson said.
There were no injuries in either incident.
The Montreal fire department is repeating its warning to building owners to ensure the roofs of their buildings are not at risk( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-reminds-building-owners-to-clear-the-snow-from-roofs-balconies ). Telltale signs of dangerous accumulation include cracked walls, doors not fitting into their frames and warping of the ceiling.
They caution also not to put too much confidence in warmer temperatures doing the work for them, since in many cases eavestroughs and drains remain blocked with ice and debris.
The two latest incidents followed a Sunday snowfall of more than 10 centimetres over the Montreal area.

Full text: The engaging new Glen House has two personalities: romantic and laid-back, or energetic and sporty.
This mountain lodge is a woodsy and peaceful year-round getaway, surrounded by the vast wilderness of the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire.
The Glen House also is at the centre of thrilling outdoor activities, notably downhill skiing and snowboarding at Wildcat Mountain, cross-country at Great Glen Trails and adventures around the awesome massif, Mount Washington.
At nearly 2,000 metres above sea level, it is the highest peak in eastern North America and it is a draw for ice climbing, backcountry skiing and mountaineering( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-focus-fitness-paramount-for-navigating-citys-sidewalks-mountain-climber-says ), especially on legendary Tuckerman's Ravine, and unique sightseeing by car, on foot or on a tour bus, through four climates zones to the summit.
Close to nature: The hotel's panoramic windows open onto views of this phenomenon and the peak is a mesmerizing sight from sunrise to sunset, and even in the moonlight.
The Glen House property is an idyllic scene, with skiers and walkers cruising along trails, meadows and footbridges. Even in winter, the outdoor terrace, with its fire pit and lounge chairs, is popular for drinks and conversation.
"The hotel is so in sync with our exceptional environment," said April Jacobs, The Glen House sales manager. "It's truly authentic, with the murals of historic scenes, the superb views, the nature-inspired décor and our connection to outdoor life."
The new Glen House displays "nature-inspired décor and our connection to outdoor life."
The look: Three previous Glen House hotels have commanded this scenic spot since 1852, and this new version that opened in autumn 2018 invokes the timeless New England look of clapboard with white balconies and trim. It is already a contemporary country classic.
Named one of the most beautifully designed spaces in New Hampshire by Architectural Digest, the hotel's Great Room has soaring ceilings and a wall of windows opening onto Mount Washington, which is just "next door."
The Notch Grille combines a family-friendly tavern, a fireplace lounge and a dining room. It's warmly wrapped in textures and colours of the earth - vibrant reds, mossy greens and dusky browns on leather seating, kilim rugs and barn wood floors.
The 68 rooms are spacious and comfortable, with sofas, 55-inch TVs, honey-coloured furniture, good lighting, and large windows with mountain or forest views.
The Glen House also is environmentally conscious, operating a geothermal system for heating and cooling, as well as using hydro and solar power, and recycled wood for building.
Eat/drink: The Notch Grille is a hit with locals and visitors. It serves craft beer such as Autoroad Ale by Tuckerman's Brewery, and signature cocktails like the Autoroad Mule, with ginger beer, maple syrup and Glen House Vodka, a limited edition by Tamworth Distilling.
The kitchen dishes up excellent American comfort cuisine, using regional ingredients including Atlantic seafood (the seacoast is only a two-hour drive away). For indulgent breakfasts, there are buttermilk pancakes with blueberry compote, eggs Benedict or veggie-apple hash with tofu.
The lunch-to-dinner menu features crab cakes, flatbread with forest mushrooms, vegan shepherd's pie, burgers, beef bourguignon, baked haddock, lobster mac 'n' cheese and salads with steak tips.
The mountains: The Mt. Washington Summit Road Company owns Glen House, so guests enjoy discounts at the Mt. Washington Auto Road (summer) and the Mt. Washington SnowCoach. And guests also have free access to the Great Glen Trails Outdoor Centre, which has exceptional Nordic skiing on 45 kilometres of trails, plus fat-biking, snowshoeing and tubing.
For downhillers, the adventurous, edgy Wildcat Mountain is about two kilometres away and The Glen House offers lift-ticket packages to this downhill treasure. Readers of Ski Magazine rank Wildcat in the top 10 in the East for character, value and challenge, and No. 1 for scenery. "The Cat" has a 645-metre vertical drop, about the same as Tremblant, and several trails from summit to base, with a super-high-speed quad chair taking seven minutes to the top.

Canadian forests not in danger

Full text: Re: "U.S. toilet paper use wiping out our forests?" (NP Montreal, Feb. 26) On behalf of Canada's forest sector, I am responding to false statements made in the recent story on toilet paper use in the United States and the impact on Canada's forests.
The report produced by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) used words like "devastating" to describe how American toilet paper use is affecting Canada's boreal forest. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Canada plants more than 615 million trees annually and has professional foresters and scientists who manage our forests to ensure wildlife habitat, biodiversity and water protection.
This is why Canada does not have problems with deforestation and illegal logging seen in other countries. It is concerning that the NRDC suggests alternative wood fibre sources that are more carbon-intensive or sourced from countries with much lower forest management, labour and human rights standards.
Here are some important facts about Canada's forests:
Every single tree harvested in Canada is replanted, by law.
Canada has retained over 90 per cent of its original forest cover and has almost zero deforestation (0.01 per cent).
The Canadian government's State of the Forests Report (2018) confirms that the forested area under active management in Canada continues to be a carbon sink of 20 million tonnes.
The boreal is thousands of years old, but trees in the boreal only live for 100 years. By harvesting before they succumb to pests, fires or simply falling over, we realize economic and environmental benefits by replanting.
Younger forests absorb more carbon than older ones.
Canada has the most third-party certified forests in the world, meaning consumers can rest assured that products from our forests are produced from environmentally responsible and sustainable practices.
Canada's approach to forest management brings environmental, social and economic benefits to our country. We plan to keep it that way.

Full text: It took far longer than usual for Montreal to become a snow-and ice-covered wonderland, though we've certainly made up for lost time since Christmas. Still, let's spend "spring" break - March 2 to 10 - celebrating winter before it's over. Layer up, put on your warmest socks and go out and play.
SNOWSHOE AFTER DARK Les amis de la montagne promise to give up Mount Royal's secrets and beautiful views on their nighttime traditional snowshoe excursion. All that beauty and hot chocolate, too. Fridays and Saturdays at 6 p.m. $22, $17 for 12-to 15-year-olds, includes the use of snowshoes. If you have younger children or would rather have this experience during the day, Les amis offer guided snowshoe tours with a hot-chocolate break in the middle for age eight and up, every day during March break at 10:30 a.m. Registration is required. Beaver Lake Pavilion; lemontroyal. qc.ca.
DOG-DAY AFTERNOONS The dogsledding is just the beginning at Pointe-aux-Prairies nature park - or the end, depending on how you stagger your day.
If you are 15 or over, you can overnight at the park March 2, learning survival skills and a little bit about yourself and the forest. The next day - or another day - you can explore 8.4 kilometres of trails and peer into the woods to find dozens of species of birds. If you're very quiet, you might even see deer.
Crazy carpets are crazy fun behind the heritage chalet. If you forgot to bring your sled or carpet, you can rent one. Then haul yourself back up to the cabin between 1 and 4 p.m. to relax in an Adirondack chair in front of a fire. The park will even supply a cosy blanket.
The dogsledding is on March 9.
Most activities are free, but you must register for the overnight and for dogsledding at 514-280-6691. The park is vast; find the chalet at 14905 Sherbrooke St.
E. STICKY AND SLIPPY Pointe-à-Callière does not sugar-coat history, but it will coat it in maple syrup. A sugar shack set up outside the Old Montreal museum is hands-on, with games and a maple-sap-collecting challenge. There will of course be maple taffy tasting and marshmallows to roast. Tim Hortons knows a good opportunity when it sees one and will deploy its street truck to hand out free coffee, lattes and hot chocolate. 350 Place Royale; pacmusee. qc.ca.
You can then take a stroll along the water to the aerial park Voiles en voiles. Its climbing ropes and zip lines are shut down for the season, but the carousel is still spinning and the inflatables park has been turned into a snow-tubing paradise. There are also snow scooters, quadricycles and a small obstacle course. Kids can also try their hands at archery. March 4 to 10, 1 to 6 p.m.; $8.95, $29.95 per family; voilesenvoiles.com.
CAP-ST-JACQUES AFTER DARK Take a night hike at Cap-St-Jacques nature park with a naturalist to find owls and discover how trees prepare to sleep through the season, then gather around the campfire to hear stories and learn about southern Quebec wildlife - from their fur to their tracks. You can also learn how to build a shelter and light a fire on snow. Hikes are organized by the Groupe uni des éducateurs-naturalistes et professionnels en environnement.
Many of these activities require registration. Most are best for children age six and up. When there are fees, they are generally $7, or $21 for a family of two adults and three children. You must register by calling; check guepe.qc.ca for details, dates and phone numbers.
Every weekend, Bois de l'Équerre lends children snowshoes, sleds and walking sticks to explore 2.3 kilometres of groomed trails. The former piece of farmland was given over to nature in the mid-1900s and has become Laval's largest urban forest, at 225 hectares. A piece of ID and a deposit are required to borrow equipment. 49 Rang de l'Équerre, Laval; boisdelequerre.org; 450-624-9696.
A WHOLE OTHER KETTLE OF RAINBOWS All right, but you really want to stay indoors? That's OK, too. St. Patrick's Day is fast approaching and one wouldn't want to be caught off-guard.
The Musée des maîtres et artisans du Québec has it all worked out with magic kettle family workshops. The museum is in a beautiful old church in St-Laurent borough and is dedicated to Quebecers'handmade art. Non-leprechaun exhibits include Know-How, with pieces from stonecutters, watchmakers, weavers and dozens more; and From Masters'Hands, with furniture, forged objects and textiles. The kettle workshop is available to all museum visitors; supplies are provided. March 2, 3, 9, 10, 16 and 17, from 2 to 3 p.m.; $5 to $8; 615 Ste-Croix Ave.; mmaq.qc.ca.
The Montreal International Children's Film Festival runs the entire week of March break at Cinéma Beaubien, Cinéma du Parc and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. There are tons of films showing in French and English, plus activities and games throughout the week. $9 per ticket, or $80 for 10 tickets. 514-284-9388; fifem.com.
ANYTHING ELSE? The Montréal en lumière festival runs till March 3, with bright lights, games and activities downtown, and hosts Nuit Blanche overnight March 2. Nuit Blanche begins at 2 p.m. (it ends at 3 a.m.) and many child-friendly venues. See nuitblanchemtl.com.
Art Souterrain, wherein Montreal's underground city is handed over to artists, runs from March 2 to 24. See artsouterrain.com.
Montréal Joue, a games festival, runs till March 10. There are more than 300 events at libraries throughout the city, including video gaming, board games and role-playing. 514-473-1279; montrealjoue.ca. hjuhl@postmedia.com twitter.com/hjuhl

Full text: It took far longer than usual for Montreal to become a snow- and ice-covered wonderland, though we've certainly made up for lost time since Christmas. Still, let's spend "spring" break - March 2 to 10 - celebrating winter before it's over. Layer up, put on your warmest socks and go out and play.
Snowshoe after dark
Les amis de la montagne promise to give up Mount Royal's secrets and beautiful views on their nighttime traditional snowshoe excursion. All that beauty and hot chocolate, too. Fridays, Saturdays at 6 p.m. $22, $17 for 12- to 15-year-olds, includes the use of snowshoes. If you have younger children or would rather have this experience during the day, Les amis offer guided snowshoe tours with a hot-chocolate break in the middle for age eight and up, every day during March break at 10:30 a.m. Registration is required. Beaver Lake Pavilion; lemontroyal.qc.ca( http://lemontroyal.qc.ca ).
Dog-day afternoons
The dogsledding is just the beginning at Pointe-aux-Prairies nature park - or the end, depending on how you stagger your day.
If you are 15 or over, you can overnight at the park March 2, learning survival skills and a little bit about yourself and the forest. The next day - or another day - you can explore 8.4 kilometres of trails and peer into the woods to find dozens of species of birds. If you're very quiet, you might even see deer.
Crazy carpets are crazy fun behind the heritage chalet. If you forgot to bring your sled or carpet, you can rent one. Then haul yourself back up to the cabin between 1 and 4 p.m. to relax in an Adirondack chair in front of a fire. The park will even supply a cosy blanket.
The dogsledding is on March 9. Most activities are free, but you must register for the overnight and for dogsledding at 514-280-6691. The park is vast; find the chalet at 14905 Sherbrooke St. E.
Sticky and slippy
The Old Port of Montreal, from the Pointe-a-Calliere Museum, in 2016. Voiles en voiles is at bottom left.
Pointe-à-Callière does not sugar-coat history, but it will coat it in maple syrup. A sugar shack set up outside the Old Montreal museum is hands-on, with games and a maple-sap-collecting challenge. There will of course be maple taffy tasting and marshmallows to roast. Tim Hortons knows a good opportunity when it sees one and will deploy its street truck to hand out free coffee, lattes and hot chocolate. 350 Place Royale; pacmusee.qc.ca( http://pacmusee.qc.ca ).
You can then take a stroll along the water to the aerial park Voiles en voiles. Its climbing ropes and zip lines are shut down for the season, but the carousel is still spinning and the inflatables park has been turned into a snow-tubing paradise. There are also snow scooters, quadricycles and a small obstacle course. Kids can also try their hands at archery. March 4 to 10, 1 to 6 p.m.; $8.95, $29.95 per family; voilesenvoiles.com( https://www.voilesenvoiles.com/en/ ).
Cap-St-Jacques after dark
Take a night hike at Cap-St-Jacques nature park with a naturalist to find owls and discover how trees prepare to sleep through the season, then gather round the campfire to hear stories and learn about southern Quebec wildlife - from their fur to their tracks. You can also learn how to build a shelter and light a fire on snow. Hikes are organized by the Groupe uni des éducateurs-naturalistes et professionnels en environnement.
Many of these activities require registration. Most are best for children age six and up. When there are fees, they are generally $7, or $21 for a family of two adults and three children. You must register by calling; check guepe.qc.ca( http://guepe.qc.ca ) for details, dates and phone numbers.
Every weekend, Bois de l'Équerre lends children snowshoes, sleds and walking sticks to explore 2.3 kilometres of groomed trails. The former piece of farmland was given over to nature in the mid-1900s and has become Laval's largest urban forest, at 225 hectares. A piece of ID and a deposit are required to borrow equipment. 49 Rang de l'Équerre, Laval; boisdelequerre.org( http://boisdelequerre.org ); 450-624-9696.
A whole other kettle of rainbows
A rainbow pierced downtown Montreal in November 2010.
All right, but you really want to stay indoors? That's OK, too. St. Patrick's Day is fast approaching and one wouldn't want to be caught off-guard.
The Musée des maîtres et artisans du Québec has it all worked out with magic kettle family workshops. The museum is in a beautiful old church in St-Laurent borough and is dedicated to Quebecers' handmade art. Non-leprechaun exhibits include Know-How, with pieces from stonecutters, watchmakers, weavers and dozens more; and From Masters' Hands, with furniture, forged objects and textiles. The kettle workshop is available to all museum visitors; supplies are provided. March 2, 3, 9, 10, 16 and 17, from 2 to 3 p.m.; $5 to $8; 615 Ste-Croix Ave.; mmaq.qc.ca( http://mmaq.qc.ca ).
The Montreal International Children's Film Festival runs the entire week of March break at Cinéma Beaubien, Cinéma du Parc and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. There are tons of films showing in French and English, plus activities and games throughout the week. $9 per ticket, or $80 for 10 tickets. 514-284-9388; fifem.com( https://fifem.com/en/ ).
Anything else?
The Montréal en lumière festival opens Feb. 21 and runs till March 3, with bright lights, games and activities downtown, and hosts Nuit blanche overnight March 2. Nuit blanche begins at 2 p.m. (it ends at 3 a.m.) and many child-friendly venues are throwing open their doors, like the Phi Centre and McCord Museum. Check the events section on the Nuit blanche Facebook page( http://facebook.com/nuitblancheamontreal ) for details.
Art Souterrain, wherein Montreal's underground city is handed over to artists, runs from March 2 to 24. See artsouterrain.com( https://www.artsouterrain.com/en/home/ ).
Montréal Joue, a games festival, runs till March 10. There are more than 300 events at libraries throughout the city, including video gaming, board games and role-playing. 514-473-1279; montrealjoue.ca( http://www.montrealjoue.ca/ ).

Utter Calmness on top of the world; North of Tremblant, 'the woods are wilder, the snowfall is more pure and it's quieter'

Full text: Imagine a backcountry getaway, just you and Mother Nature. If that sounds like a match made in heaven, Les Toits du Monde in the Upper Laurentians would be your paradise.
Les Toits du Monde (roofs of the world) offers glamping par excellence, a beautiful mix of creativity and the great outdoors. You'll bed down in magical huts like the Hobbit House, an authentic Mongolian yurt or the Enchanted Treehouse, and relax in a snowy, secluded landscape of maples, birches and firs.
"We're 60 kilometres north of Tremblant and the environment truly is different," said Sylvain Neuenschwander, who operates Les Toits du Monde with his wife, Dior Fall. "The woods are wilder, the snowfall is more pure and it's quieter and less commercial. Utterly tranquil, in fact."
Fall, originally from Senegal, and Neuenschwander, from France, are computer engineers who met when they were students in Europe. Both yearned for a back-to-nature lifestyle and they fulfilled their dream to the max in Quebec, developing a rustic vacation domain outside the town of Nominingue.
The huts are tiny, eco-conscious architectural wonders.
The couple hired a master carpenter to help with construction and an engineer for the structural plans, but otherwise designed and crafted their huts and furniture by themselves, by hand.
"The lodges each give off a special energy," said Neuenschwander. "They're flights of fantasy that transport visitors to dreams of adventure, discovery and sharing. We put in a lot of love and time and we used wood from our forest and natural materials like straw for insulation." The scene: Guests check in at a welcome pavilion housed in a prospectors'tent, and that's as far as cars go at this pristine site.
Les Toits du Monde is a bring-your-own-almost-everything place - food, bedding and camping accessories - so be prepared to haul your baggage by sledge between 300 and 900 metres from the parking lot to the accommodation.
The site supplies mattresses, pillows, cooking utensils, drinking water, firewood for heating and propane for cooking. If you want to cook on an open fire, there are logs for sale.
To take your adventure up a notch and polish your outdoor skills, Neuenschwander offers a two-hour forest survival course ($40, $30, $25 p.p., for two, three, four or more people). The lodging: There are five unusual lodgings of different styles and comfort levels for two to four people. They're scattered in the woods, far enough apart that guests do not see their neighbours and hear only trees rustling and the birds singing. The boréale chickadee will peck seeds from your hand.
The Enchanted Treehouse, the Perched Treehouse and the Hobbit House have the most comforts, including indoor bathrooms, showers, solar panels for battery-powered lighting and substantial insulation for warmth. They all have a fairy-tale quality. To reach the Enchanted Treehouse, guests negotiate a hanging footbridge tucked up in the treetops. Inside there are sloped ceilings and asymmetrical walls so everything is kind of crooked and fun.
The earthy Hobbit House has a roof of sod, straw insulation and round windows that recall Lord of the Rings. The interior tree trunks, wood-carved kitchen worktop and round pine table are singular examples of organic, artisan design. Kids love the Hobbit's bunk beds.
The Native American Tipi and the Mongolian Yurt are the most primitive choices, with propane stoves for cooking, outhouses and LED lanterns. The wood stoves used for heat need to be stoked every few hours, all night.
The yurt was imported from Mongolia, and its brightly coloured furniture and decorations are exactly as they would be on the steppes of East Asia. The yurt is so authentic, it is wrapped in woollen felt for insulation, and horsehair and leather knots hold it together. What to do: Les Toits has little communal space, except for two benches in the pavilion where you can log onto Wi-Fi. There is a playground with picnic tables.
Most guests want to cocoon in their wooded hideaways, but there is one snowshoe trail on site that climbs through the forest to a towering cliff and then down to Nominingue Lake. Other activities - dogsledding, skating, cross-country skiing, fat-biking, more snowshoeing and (in summer) river tubing and canoeing - are available within a 10-to 20-minute drive.

Nominingue is about two hours north of Montreal, or about 45 minutes north of downtown Tremblant (formerly Saint-Jovite).

Ottawa sets new rules for drone usage, including mandatory registration and training

Full text: The federal government is imposing a series of new restrictions on the use of drones, requiring operators to be at least 14 years old and calling on all owners to register their recreational and commercial devices with Transport Canada, federal and industry officials said.
The new, more stringent rules, covering drones that weigh less than 25 kilograms, will be unveiled on Wednesday. They will also include an obligation for drone users to undergo online training and to inscribe a federal registration number on their devices, the officials said.
The announcement will come after a series of drone sightings led to runway closings and hundreds of cancelled flights at Gatwick and Heathrow airports in Britain in recent weeks. Airport authorities fear that drones could damage a plane in flight or cause a deadly crash after being sucked into a plane's engine.
The officials said the new rules for drone use in Canada will include restrictions on their use within nine kilometres of airports. The three officials were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the new rules before they were formally announced in the Canada Gazette.
One of the biggest associations of drone operators in the country, Unmanned Systems Canada (USC), has been working with the government to develop the new rules for nearly a decade.
"The industry has been waiting for this a long time," said USC chair Mark Aruja. "It's going to be good for business, good for investors and, in this case, it's going to be really good for safe operations."
Police forces and government agencies such as forestry services regularly use thousands of drones to help them conduct law-enforcement operations or to monitor forest fires. On the business side, energy companies use drones to inspect pipelines while farmers use them to monitor livestock.
Mr. Aruja said that professional operators of drones will easily adapt to the new regulations. He predicted the government will face a bigger challenge in ensuring that recreational users comply with the new rules and understand how to apply them in practice.
Transport Minister Marc Garneau will announce the new rules in Montreal on Wednesday.
He started imposing temporary measures two years ago to address a growing number of reported drone incidents across the country.
At the time, there had already been concerns over cases in which people flew drones over forest fires in British Columbia, forcing the grounding of water bombers. In other cases, seaplane and helicopter operations in Vancouver's Coal Harbour were halted because of drones flying overhead.
"The government certainly doesn't want to restrict drones so much that we hinder innovation because it's so important to our economy and standard of living," Mr. Garneau said in 2017. "But, like any new technology, drones must be used with care. And we cannot wait until something bad happens before we act."

Turning asbestos mining residue into cash; Proponent calls it a triple-green project but many are wary about health issues

Full text: A plan to extract magnesium - from the mountains of asbestos-laden mining residues in the Eastern Townships - is being hailed as a modern-day miracle, with governments already investing more than $40 million in public funds into one company's project.
But miracles involving asbestos have turned into public health catastrophes in the past, and so public health authorities once again are pleading for caution.
More than 130 years of open-pit mining in Quebec's asbestos regions has left behind an estimated 800 million tonnes of residue; sandy debris piled into grey mounds and mountains in and around former mining towns such as Asbestos and Thetford Mines.
A Quebec-based company called Alliance Magnesium Inc. (AMI) claims it has developed a groundbreaking technology to transform those mountains into two valuable materials: magnesium, a lightweight metal, and amorphous silica, which can be used to strengthen concrete. The process also destroys forever the deadly asbestos fibres contained in the debris.
The project will be a major economic boon for the Eastern Townships and a triple win for the environment, AMI president and founder Joël Fournier says.
"We are green, green, green," Fournier told the Montreal Gazette in a recent interview. "We are green because we are remediating a mine site, the process is green because we use hydroelectricity, and we produce a metal that reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
That metal, magnesium, is 33 per cent lighter than aluminum and 70 per cent lighter than steel, so carmakers, for example, are keen to get their hands on it as they face strict new fuel efficiency targets. Magnesium currently sells for about US$4,000 a tonne.
Fournier says his company already has buyers for the 12,000 tonnes of magnesium ingots it hopes to produce annually over the next five years, when his commercial plant is up and running.
At its technical demonstration plant on the site of the former Noranda magnesium smelter in Danville, AMI already has been producing about two ingots of magnesium a day for the past year. AMI owns and plans to use about 100,000 tonnes of asbestos tailings from the defunct Jeffrey Mine in neighbouring Asbestos.
Before AMI can begin commercial operations, an environmental certificate from Quebec's environment ministry will be required and the project eventually might be subjected to public hearings by the province's environmental watchdog, the BAPE, a spokesperson for Quebec Environment Minister MarieChantal Chassé told the Gazette.
But both the federal and provincial governments have already invested heavily. Quebec has provided a $17.5-million loan and has taken out an equity interest of $13.4 million, while the federal government announced a $12-million investment this fall through Sustainable Development Technology Canada.
The plant is projected to employ about 70 workers in its first commercial phase starting in 2020, and if all goes according to plan, production will ramp up to 50,000 tonnes a year by 2022 or 2023, employing about 350 workers.
Fournier, who holds a PhD in electrochemistry from Université de Sherbrooke and a post-doctoral degree from the INRS Energy and Materials Institute, developed the magnesium extraction process, which he describes as virtually waste-free.
"We take the mining residue, which is like a sand ... with a backhoe and we bring it to our plant, which is very close to the deposit (tailings), maybe 200 metres away. We put the sand in acid, which dissolves the magnesium to make magnesium chloride. The asbestos fibres are also dissolved, losing their structure."
The magnesium chloride is then dried into a salt, which is introduced into an electrolytic cell, from which liquid magnesium is produced. This hot liquid is then moulded into ingots.
What remains, Fournier said, is mostly amorphous silica, a sandlike material that can be sold to concrete makers to produce a stronger concrete. The only other leftovers from the process are iron oxide and cobalt, and the company is researching uses for these.
"We are experimenting and it seems to be very promising," he said. "We can expect that maybe in 50 years from now, or 100, these (asbestos) deposits will have disappeared completely. That's wonderful and after that we will be able to plant trees and create a forest. Why not? It's the best way to do it. Transform a liability into an asset."
Asbestos, once touted as a miracle fibre because of its strength and fire-resistance, was the economic lifeblood of Quebec's asbestos regions for decades, until the world slowly came to accept scientific findings that breathing asbestos fibres causes fatal diseases such as asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer.
Last fall, Canada finally joined the ranks of more than 50 countries that have banned asbestos. Federal regulations banning the import, sale and use of asbestos and products containing asbestos came into effect on Dec. 30.
But AMI and a handful of other companies active in the former mining region, managed to persuade the federal government to exempt the use of mining residues from those regulations.
In granting the exemption, the government ignored objections from non-governmental and labour organizations, as well as a formal notice of objection signed by the regional directors of all 18 public health regions of Quebec.
"These residues can contain up to 40 per cent asbestos fibres," the position paper by the public health leaders said. "The federal regulation that aims to protect the Canadian population against the health effects that asbestos can cause cannot ignore the important source of contamination that mining residues constitute."
They wanted the government to use its new regulations to make it illegal to increase the level of asbestos fibres above current levels in ambient air. They also wanted the law to require proper barricades around the tailings to limit public access, and to create a board of review to manage the risks associated with the use of mining residues.
The government chose to do none of the above.
"I am ... satisfied that these proposed regulations, along with existing provincial controls, will address the health risks associated with asbestos mining residues," federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna wrote in a letter to the public health directors.
While workers are required to wear protective gear as soon as any level of asbestos is detected on a work site, the public is unprotected, said Dr. Philippe Lessard, regional director of public health for the Chaudière-Appalaches region.
"The risk I see ... is that as soon as we start to manipulate and disturb these residues, we are sending these (asbestos) fibres into the air, and they will circulate with the wind and settle everywhere, near the homes and the population," Lessard told the Gazette.
Studies already have shown that ambient levels of asbestos fibres are higher in communities that have asbestos tailings than elsewhere, he said, and that asbestos-related disease is more prevalent.
He wants the government to hold public hearings on the magnesium projects, where public health officials can explain the dangers, so that people can make informed decisions.
But AMI's Fournier said his company has been perfectly open and transparent, answering questions from the public at two recent meetings organized by the town of Asbestos and attended by about 200 people.
He also said the asbestos residues contain only about one per cent "free asbestos fibres." not up to 40 per cent asbestos as the public health position paper states.
"People who said that are insulting the intelligence of people who extracted asbestos. They didn't leave behind 40 per cent asbestos. They were not idiots. They didn't even have that much in the mother rock. It's impossible."
He added that his company is monitoring ambient air, and will co-operate with any remedial measures the government approval process requires. mlalonde@postmedia.com

Full text: David Phillips isn't pulling any punches: "The weather's gotten weird and wild and wacky and variable. The climate has changed."
The senior climate scientist for Environment Canada revealed his top 10 weather stories for 2018, and Quebec was affected by more than half of them, from a cruel winter to windstorms to a deadly heat wave to tornadoes to a spring and fall that were missing in action.
"It was almost a smorgasbord of everything that could go wrong," Phillips said. "I don't think there was anything missing."
He named smoke as Canada's top weather story this year. A cold spring delayed the start of fire season. But once it warmed up, it didn't take long for sparks to strike( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/forest-fires-a-primer-on-what-not-to-do-on-your-vacation ).
There were more than 250,000 lightning strikes in southern British Columbia between April and August. On one day alone there were 20,000. The resulting huge wildfires thickened skies from coast to coast with smoke that could be detected as far away as Europe.
While factors including forestry practices and urban spread influence the effects of wildfires, Phillips said it comes down to weather.
"This is too dry, too hot, for too long."
Speaking of hot, Canada took full part in a global heat wave that involved four continents. It was Phillips's No. 2 story.
"It's a big country, Canada, and you don't often see people experiencing the same weather from Vancouver Island to Bonavista (in Newfoundland), but this year we saw that with record temperatures."
In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ). July 1 in Ottawa set records for heat and humidity and the conditions cut Canada Day attendance to 6,000 from an expected 20,000. Moose Jaw, Sask., reached 42.3 C one day in August.
But it wasn't all smoke and heat. Phillips said the No. 3 story was the disappearance of spring and fall, "the almost non-existence of the transition seasons."
A long, cold spring kept frost in the ground as deep as two metres in some places, which meant a late start to the crop year for farmers. Then, with the fields ready in August and a nice start to the harvest, unprecedented snow crushed hopes. More than $4 billion worth of crop was flattened under record snowfall.
Where else did Quebec measure up? It's No. 4 on the list with a devastating May windstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/strong-winds-could-cause-damage-friday-environment-canada-warns ) that saw hundreds of thousands of people left without power here and in Ontario. Winds gusted up to 94 kilometres per hour and knocked down trees and Hydro poles.
At No. 5, a twisters ripped through the Gatineau and Ottawa regions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-homes-damaged-in-dunrobin-possible-tornado/wcm/2678a04d-42c2-4405-89d2-6612b0477aec ), flattening homes and causing millions of dollars of damage.
"You could hear things ripping. The wind was just amazingly strong," said a Gatineau resident( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evacuations-in-gatineau-following-severe-weather-and-tornado-watch ). "It was intimidating and scary."
We also made the list at Nos. 9 and 10 - cold, long winter, and the cruellest April - the cruellest( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/fish-and-birds-die-in-magog-pet-shop-because-of-low-temperatures ) we've seen in 71 years.
Like most climatologists, Phillips is circumspect about blaming any one weather event on climate change, but he did say that despite a long, colder-than-normal winter, Canada was again slightly warmer than usual - the 22nd year in a row of above-normal temperatures.
"Scientists have kind of shown the fact that these things are directly related to human activity," he said.
Phillips has been drawing up Top 10 weather lists for 23 years. Some years, he confesses, there wasn't much to talk about.
"There weren't a lot of things happening back then. Summers were hot, winters were cold. In 23 years, it has changed," he said.
A man and woman embrace as they survey the damage to a home in Gatineau Sept. 23, 2018. Houses and Apartment buildings had roofs torn off and windows blown out and automobiles were damaged after a tornado caused extensive damage.
The top 10 weather events for 2018
1. Smoky skies: Driven by hot, dry conditions, the number of fires was higher than last year and the area burned was double the 25-year averages. Smoke from wildfires in British Columbia and down the Pacific Coast to California darkened skies and soured air for more than 10 million Canadians.
2. Canada and the global heat wave: It was hot from coast to coast. Canada Day in Ottawa was the second-warmest in more than 130 years. Three Saskatchewan cities broke all-time records with temperatures into the 40s C. In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes.
3. Spring and fall disappear: The coldest April on record slammed into the hottest-ever May. A few months later, the Prairie harvest ground to a halt when 30 centimetres of snow fell in some areas in September and October.
4. Billion-dollar windstorm: Hundreds of thousands in Quebec and Ontario were left without power in May as 120-km/h winds snapped power poles, damaged homes and hurled tree branches into vehicles like armour-piercing spears. The clean-up tab is estimated at more than $1 billion.
5. Ottawa tornadoes: A series of tornadoes tore up the boundary region between Ontario and Quebec on Sept. 21. One of them was the most powerful recorded anywhere in North America last summer. Insurance costs are expected to be about $307 million.
6. British Columbia floods: A snowpack nearly twice the norm, a wet spring and high late-spring temperatures produced flooding in several river valleys in southern B.C. Almost 5,000 people were forced from their homes by river levels not seen in 50 years.
7. Fast flooding in New Brunswick: Floods on the Saint John River are an old story, but even old-timers were surprised by the speed of the water in 2018. Deep snow, heavy rains and sudden heat created the largest, most damaging flood in modern New Brunswick history down river of Fredericton in April and May. The Reversing Falls stopped reversing.
8. Toronto's tiny, perfect storm: On Aug. 7, a compact storm dumped 58 millimetres of rain downtown and 72 millimetres on Toronto Island, while the suburbs and the airport got almost nothing. Two men nearly drowned in an underground parking elevator and Blue Jays baseball fans got rained on despite the closed roof at Rogers Centre.
9. Cold start, long winter: Six months of it. Albertans faced wind-chill cold of -45 C on New Year's Eve. In early January, Toronto was colder than Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T.
10. The cruellest month: Nationally, it was the coldest April in 16 years and in 71 years if you lived through it in Ontario and Quebec. In those provinces the misery was compounded with up to 12 centimetres of freezing rain, snow and ice pellets. Windows on Parliament Hill were smashed. The CN Tower was closed after Rogers Centre was bombed by ice falling from the tower.

B.C.'s new climate plan encourages shift to electric: NDP to increase carbon tax, add incentives to ease move to more ecofriendly economy

Full text: British Columbia's new climate action plan proposes sweeping changes that will touch every part of the economy from home heating to heavy transportation, using the province's abundant supply of clean hydro-electric power to help shift individuals and industry off their reliance on the fossil fuels that currently make up two-thirds of B.C.'s energy consumption.
Details of the rebates and tax credits aimed at spurring the change will not be released until budget day in February, but Premier John Horgan says his province is now back on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with Canada's international commitments on climate.
"The challenges of climate change are clearly global, but the impacts are being felt here," Mr.Horgan said, pointing to the province's recent record-breaking forest fires and to communities battling both floods and drought.
A decade after B.C. rolled out North America's first broadbased carbon tax, the NDP government has committed to a string of increases to the levy. The strategy announced on Wednesday supplements that tax policy with incentives designed to accelerate a shift to a low-carbon economy.
The plan aims to cut almost 19 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually from transportation, industry and buildings by the year 2030. The rising carbon tax will be used in part to help B.C. industries become global leaders in lowcarbon energy and commodities.
The building code will be revised to ensure new energy-efficient designs. Infrastructure to support zero-emission vehicles will be expanded. And new power transmission lines will offer heavy polluters the opportunity to convert to cleaner energy for production.
That still leaves the province looking for another six million tonnes of GHGs to cut in order to meet its 2030 targets; a second phase of the plan will be rolled out over the next two years.
Even with the construction of the massive Site C dam under way, the shift to electricity to power cars, homes and industry means B.C. will need additional sources of clean power.
Mr. Horgan promised the plan will be affordable for families, and that the province's climate action tax credits for low-income families will be expanded over time to take the sting out of the planned increases to the B.C. carbon tax.
The provincial budget will include a major expansion of incentives designed to encourage homeowners to swap out fossilfuel heating sources for electric heat pumps, and to improve conservation by replacing poorly sealed windows, for example, with more energy-efficient models.
Industry will be offered a chance to reclaim their carbon taxes if they can meet or beat world standards for low carbon emissions within each sector, which would allow B.C. to brand its exports - from forestry and energy to concrete and minerals - with an ecofriendly label.
Mr. Horgan will arrive in Montreal on Friday at the First Ministers' meeting ready to defend his new climate action plan. He is one of a shrinking number of premiers still working with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put a price on carbon pollution.
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have aligned against the broad-based federal carbon tax, while Alberta has frozen plans because of the lack of progress on new oil pipeline capacity.
Mr. Horgan said he has already heard some push-back during a conference call with the other premiers on Monday. "There wasn't a resounding amount of enthusiasm for carbon pricing, which is something we believe is foundational to a successful plan, so we'll see how provinces like Ontario and Saskatchewan respond to that," he said.
"I think B.C. has a solid plan; it's great to see them being so ambitious," federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said in an interview.
She noted the province has the fastest growing clean-technology sector. Ms. McKenna said there are plenty of opportunities for federal backing through its infrastructure bank and other funding mechanisms to support the industrial electrification that the plan proposes.
In B.C., the climate plan was met with applause by both the environmental movement and the business community.
"By leveraging our low-carbon assets, including renewable hydroelectricity, British Columbia can play an out-sized role in reducing global climate impacts in high-emission jurisdictions, while building a competitive and innovative economy for British Columbians and reducing emissions here at home," Greg D'Avignon, president of the Business Council of B.C., said in a statement.
"British Columbians should be excited," said Clean Energy Canada's Merran Smith, who served as co-chair of the advisory board that helped draft the plan. "Electric cars, more efficient homes: Don't think of these as green alternatives - think of them as upgrades. The B.C. government is helping British Columbians transition to better versions of the same thing with a smaller carbon footprint - not to mention a lower monthly energy bill."

Full text: The time has come to start thinking of the Christmas tree.
As someone who has used an artificial tree for years, I am considering a real tree this year. I think there is something authentic in style and scent that intrigues me this holiday season, and I am finally willing to give the real thing a try.
What I have enjoyed about artificial trees (I like to call them everlastings) is the guarantee of a tree that was the right height, and the convenience of having all the lights attached. What I didn't like is the lack of real-tree smell and the storage of the tree/hockey bag throughout the year. So, with saw in hand and a sturdy tree stand, I'm all set to tackle a new tradition. Whether you drive to the nearest tree-cutting farm or the local home decor centre, there's bound to be a tree that sings Oh, Tannenbaum to you this holiday season.
Here are my tips for deciding between the two. There's no wrong answer if you choose what's right for you.
The real thing
Is there anything more festive than a real Christmas tree with its fresh scent? These pros and cons will help you decide if a real tree is right for your home.
PROS: Many real trees are grown near the market they are sold in, and so support the local economy. If well cared for, the scent a real tree brings inside the home (and the tree itself) can last throughout the holiday season. You can choose a tree that's a different species, height and scent each year, which is good for people like me who like change (a lot).
CONS: The cost of a real tree can vary, ranging from about $40 to $100 per year. That's my coffee allowance for a month so I'm gonna have to adjust to stay on budget. Getting a real tree home and setting it up can be a pain for car-free types like me; that's where a handy friend with a vehicle comes into play. There's the maintenance of watering, cleaning up falling needles and disposal; that's where that handy friend is invited over for holiday drinks.
A small tree (real or artificial) can have bigger presence when elevated on a table or stand.
Everlasting love
An artificial tree offers a holiday convenience at this hectic time of year and can be displayed for much longer throughout the season (some people like to leave it up for a month or two). Artificial trees have advantages and disadvantages you should consider before choosing this option.
PROS: Your investment can last for many years, averaging $20 to $40 per year over 10 years. They are a great option for families that like to have two trees in the house (the artificial one allows you a second, less expensive, low-maintenance option that you can decorate in a new theme every year). Most everlastings are fire retardant, do not drop needles, are easy to erect and need no maintenance once decorated. Many come pre-lit with a variety of LED light options that allow you to change the colours, and offer blinking and fade options depending on the mood you want to achieve.
CONS: Artificial trees are mainly made of synthetics that are not great for the environment. They take up storage space year round and limit your options of tree style from year to year. They also lack that real tree scent; but you can make up for this by using an essential oil diffuser and a pine or other evergreen essential oil for a genuine Christmas tree scent that lasts through the season without fading.
TIP: Put the diffuser near the front door to greet guests with the scents of the season, and then another diffuser near the artificial tree.

Designer tips for your tree
- Height
Your tree should reach six inches from the ceiling. If opting for something shorter, then the tree should be two-thirds of the height of the room. Considering a small (five feet or shorter) tree? Place it on a short table or box to elevate it and make it give it more presence.
- Lights and ornaments
How much is too much - or too little? Follow these guidelines. Lights: For each foot of height, use around 100 lights. Ornaments: You need 25 to 50 ornaments per foot. The trend is to find either very large opaque coloured lights for a classic vintage 1960s look or tiny micro lights in warm white for a starry sky sparkly effect.
- The "Trim" Tree
For a visually airier, lighter more whimsical tree (à la Charlie Brown), use a small hacksaw to trim every second row of branches off a real tree. The sparser effect shows off your the ornaments as they dangle with space around them. Use the tree cuttings to make wreaths and garlands (and spread the fresh scent elsewhere in the house).
Do you have a decor dilemma or want to give feedback? You can contact Karl Lohnes on Facebook or Instagram at Karl Lohnes Designer, or via email at klohnesdecor@sympatico.ca( mailto:klohnesdecor@sympatico.ca ).

Full text: It's here. The ugly W. Winter. And for a change-up it has made a grand entrance rolling out its ceremonious carpet of snow halfway into November.
Looking out my window on a world of white lawn, trees, and porch, I have three thoughts in sequence: 1 - I hate to say it, but it looks kind of pretty (Okay, I'm over it.) 2 - I want to get out a box of Crayola and colour in the parts. 3 - We always complain about the weather we live in no matter where. (I will now back up my statement.)
When I used to work as an engineer, I entertained clients who visited from the deep south. One time, I rented a van to escort six guys who wanted to see Montreal. (One of them asked me if Canada was part of the United States but that's a whole other topic.) Anyway, that day we had a pretty good snow fall. My takeaway from the tour guiding was this: They were enthralled by the snow; some had never seen any before. Imagine my thoughts while they were raving about how awesome it all looked. (You like it so much, take it all home with you.)
Like some Canadians, I do not ski, ice fish, skidoo, snowshoe, build igloos or trap winter fox. So I don't like winter. But the said southerners loved it because they don't live with it.
I have a friend who moved here from Monterey, Mexico (headquarters of the cartel) and she notes her favourite season is the Montreal winter because it is not a Mexican one - same as Mexican summer, only more rain and gunfire.
Now, you might say a Californian would swear by his climate but they have brush fires instead of snow. (Which would you prefer given only two choices? Don't run off and buy a fire extinguisher too quickly.) My wife and I long ago considered moving to Kelowna on the Left Coast. Granted, it was the poisonous snakes in the lakes and the grizzlies in the forest that turned us off well before we observed that the surrounding area looks like a Hades cook-out practically every year. (Where was I? Oh yeah . . .)
We always dislike a particular season we have to live through. For Canadians, it's winter. For a southerner it's a blistering summer. For someone on the West Coast, it's a dry spell so precarious a spark can set the whole state on fire.
Side bar: It was Charles Dudley Warner who made the famous remark, Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it. This was falsely attributed to Mark Twain - his friend.
If snow came but for a few days and you could run out and frolic and then have it all warm back up to 20 degrees C (Canadian) I am sure we would all be like little children in a mud hole. But like an unwelcome guest who doesn't clean up after themselves, it is a pox to the average Canuck. (Even BC has a winter condition called perpetual rain whereby your porch is lusher than your lawn because of the green algai.)
My father always said that it doesn't matter where you live, whatever you gain in one respect you lose in another. Nice to live on the water until the flood line gets to your basement. Nice to live in San Diego at exactly 20 degrees C all year until the mother of all earthquakes turns you into Atlantis.
So, as I stare out on a lawn that makes me start to hum a Christmas tune, I do want to say this on behalf of all (like-minded only) fellow human beings out here: I hate winter. I hate snow. And if the Inuit have 50 names for snow, I have one: #%^* (Notice the snowflake at the end?)

Full text: I woke up at 4:05 a.m. the other night and had an urgent anxious thought, typical of that hour.
Had I checked my Guardian newspaper subscription lately? It'd been about a year since I took a cheap intro offer of $40 and if I missed the expiry date it could rise to $80.
That soon reminded me I hadn't checked my landline phone bill recently, which could go up without notice, too.
That soon got my brain feverishly thinking: why do I need a landline anyway? Maybe I should cancel it, since everyone calls my cellphone?
But then again, I thought: what if there's an earthquake, or a forest fire, and the power goes out, so there's no way to contact anyone except by landline?
Or what if there's a nuclear war and - ohmigod, Trump is in charge of the button!
That's when I opened my eyes to check the clock again: 4:27 a.m. ... Aaaagh! Time to get out of bed and STOP THINKING.
These are the kind of spiralling thoughts I get when I'm sleepless in Montreal in the dead of night. I fret about endless small things that never cross my mind during the day, and my brain lights up like a pinball machine.
Did I lock the front door? Did I park the car on the right side? ... Did I remember to bring the car home? ... Hmm, what's that pimple on my arm, or is it a bump? God, it's a tumour!
In the late-night hours my brain is taken over by my low-IQ alter ego, Sludge the night fill-in. He can spend half an hour just wondering if it's garbage night.
But how can I shut him up? As any sleep hygienist will say, you've got to stop thinking by distracting your mind. But how?
I count sheep, running backwards. Or I count the number of passing cars. I've spent 30 minutes counting rotations of the overhead fan.
Sleepless friends also send me the hottest "deep sleep" meditation-style tapes. They feature sounds of waves, wind and wombs, while a guy with a hypnotic voice commands me to:
"Breathe i-i-n-n deeply ... through your nose, then o-o-ut through your mouth. With every breath your cares and worries drift away. ...
"Your mind is very quiet... nothing matters. Nothing matters ... nothing matters."
Easy for him to say. He's not worrying that he left his credit card in the gas pump.
I visualize scenes to make me drowsy too: I mentally bike up Mount Royal, recalling my last trip there: cycling past the monument, then the graceful big tree, then the gentle bend in the road, the park bench, the squirrels gathering nuts ... I'm getting sleepy now ... sleeeeepy ...
But hmmm, where are the mountain's usual drug pushers who haven't been there since the government took over their job? I wonder where they've gone? How they make a living? ... If they have famil- ... Oh geez, I'm waking up now. And did I remember to buy milk?
Some sleepless friends have their own late-night tricks. One listens to comedians on his headphones and swears laughing puts him right back to sleep. Others leave their bedrooms for an hour to do work, or just re-arrange the furniture. Again.
Donald Trump sends out 4:30 a.m. tweets when he can't sleep, which keeps the whole world awake the next night.
My best remedy is reading, but not page-turners. I need something interesting enough to read, but too dense to keep me awake. I have many Great Boring Books by my bedside. May I recommend:
"Finnegan's Wake," a James Joyce sleep classic with no obvious plot, just a stream-of-conscious, dream-like flow of words that perchance may make you dream.
Also excellent is The Oxford Dictionary, a slow read with no story at all, almost as though the author just threw a bunch of random words together in alphabetic order.
You'll learn some new words and along the way you may gradually enter a period of hebetude, somnolence, torpidity, insensibility and slumber.
Remember: the worst thing to do is look at the clock, which only makes you think: "Ohmigod, I've been up 47 minutes, I'll never get enough sleep" - which just gives you another thing to worry about.
The best thing to do is throw in the towel, give up on sleep entirely and lie in bed daydreaming till morning.
Next thing you know you'll be sleeping.

A shocking look at humanity's footprint: From Kenya to Carrara's quarries, the Anthropocene project documents the increasing impact our species is having on Earth

Full text: Like some eerie sculpture, a domeshaped pile of elephant tusks glimmers in a darkened gallery. It's a non-existent thing, the virtual recreation of a huge cache of contraband ivory burned to ashes two years ago.
Poaching is pushing the African elephant to the brink, yet another example of our species' pervasive impact on the planet. The indelible and spreading mark of human activity is the meaning of the term Anthropocene and the theme of a four-year collaboration between award-winning landscape photographer Edward Burtynsky and the documentary filmmakers Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier. Following on their environmental films Manufactured Landscapes and Watermark, the Anthropocene project includes not only a new documentary but also two museum exhibitions and an art book.
To produce it, the trio visited every continent except Antarctica, stopping in 20 different countries. One of those countries was Kenya, where in 2016 their cameras recorded an unusual event: the burning of 100 tonnes of elephant tusks and rhino horns by government officials. Determined to save these species by demonstrating to poachers that the ivory and horn is worthless unless attached to a living animal, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta set light to the largest pile.
The day before the President's pile was burnt, the artists shot 2,500 still images to eventually reproduce it as a three-dimensional augmented-reality experience for visitors on the other side of the world. Speaking to media at the Art Gallery of Ontario last week, Mr. de Pencier recalled the wonderful moment when the tusks sprang back to life in a postproduction studio: "It's the most breathtaking thing," he said - before adding some mixed emotions.
"But it's freighted with the complexity of poaching, the income disparity ... the desperation ... and just the majesty of these incredible beasts. Thousands and thousands of them died to make these piles."
The image of the raging fire that consumed the tusks opens the film Anthropocene: The Human Epoch while visitors to the comprehensive Anthropocene exhibitions at either the AGO or Ottawa's National Gallery of Canada can "see" the President's pile by using an augmented-reality app on their phones. In truth, the cinematic version proves more immersive than the still-cumbersome miracles of AR, but the tension between these impressive sights and the massacre that brought them into being crackles in either medium. It is the same contradiction that has always animated Mr. Burtynsky's large-scale photographs of massive industrial landscapes; those images of open mines, irrigated fields and tailing ponds that can look so fiercely beautiful as they document human ravishment.
It was a decade ago that Mr. Burtynsky first encountered a new term for that environmental impact. Scientists are working to get official recognition that the Earth has left the Holocene and now entered a new geological age, the Anthropocene, a period in which humanity is the most significant force shaping the planet. From the fallout of nuclear testing in the 1950s to the microplastics in today's oceans, there is no place left untouched by human activity. After Mr. Burtynsky and the filmmakers finished Watermark in 2013, it was Ms. Baichwal who suggested their next job was to "evangelize" the term Anthropocene.
That evangelization is not didactic, but it is shocking. The film, narrated by the Swedish actor Alicia Vikander, explains the extent of human impact and the work of the Anthropocene scientists. It takes the viewer from a vast mine in Germany that is continually bulldozing adjacent villages to a 12-hectare Kenyan landfill where locals pick through plastics looking for recyclables. Sometimes the film is chilling: A historic church explodes to make way for the German coal mine. Sometimes it is beautiful: Illuminating a Russian potash mine, the filmmakers discover spectacular red-andgrey striped rock fashioned into pleasing rondels by the pattern of the drilling.
And often, Anthropocene is well aware of that paradox. In the famous quarries at Carrara in Italy, workers can now hack out giant blocks of marble at a faster rate than any previous generation. Sculptors in a workshop are shown painstakingly fashioning it into sculptures, including reproductions of Michelangelo's David.
These conundrums - and all the rich details of the project's startling imagery - can be explored further in the exhibitions. At the AGO, curator Sophie Hackett has mounted a dense
and busy installation that combines Mr. Burtynsky's still photos with Ms. Baichwal and Mr. de Pencier's video footage to create four categories of work: large-scale photographs; short films showing on screens hanging alongside the photos; four giant photographic murals with film "extensions," or brief videos amplifying the subjects; and last, three augmentedreality sculptures, including the pile of tusks.
(The Ottawa exhibition is similar and includes the AR pieces, but features a different selection of photographs.)
Contemplating the impressive mural of Carrara, you can take out your phone (or borrow a gallery tablet) and watch the moving camera slowly pull out to show more and more of the setting, or follow brief scenes of the actual quarrying and the sculpture workshop. Text panels will tell you that yes, Carrara's famous marble is running out.
The exhibition can provide more information than the film, through texts and because the visitor has the time and space to dwell with the imagery. Still, it can be hard to achieve any quiet contemplation of Mr. Burtynsky's mighty photos - and there are some fabulous examples here, including a phosphor tailing pond that could be a picture of a tiny puddle of paint so detailed is its swirling surface. Surrounded by other visitors, loaded with information and bombarded with moving images, the gallerygoer may long for some equivalent of Ms. Vikander's firm but gentle voice navigating the story.
That story is filled with startling examples of human ingenuity in the midst of exploitation, revealing the many ironies of the Anthropocene. Take the photograph of the concrete tetrapods used to create the seawalls that now protect 60 per cent of the Chinese coastline - they are a sensible solution to rising water but as technofossils, human objects that cannot decay, they also represent a prime example of the Anthropocene. Similarly, the films include a ride through the 57-kilometre Gotthard railand busy installation tha tynsky's still photos with M de Pencier's video footage gories of work: large-scale films showing on screens the photos; four giant p with film "extensions," or ing the subjects; and last reality sculptures, includi (The Ottawa exhibition is the AR pieces, but features of photographs.)

It's a grotesque example of anthroturbation, or tunnelling, that displaced a mind-blowing 28 million tonnes of soil and rock - but it also saves fuel, replacing road traffic with rail.
The answers to environmental degradation are not easy: A mural of sprawling Lagos illustrates the growth of the Nigerian city from 1.4 million in the 1970s to 20 million today.
Those people have got to eat. And yet, as Mr. Burtynsky makes a first foray into satellite imagery - he already relies heavily on drones - the picture of perfect green circles created by pivot irrigation in the middle of a Saudi desert is shocking in the scope of agricultural intervention it reveals.
The message comes home outside the main exhibition in the AGO's Galleria Italia where some fiddling with the AR app should conjure up Big Lonely Doug, a 1,000-year-old, 66metre-high Douglas fir tree that is the lone survivor of logging in an area near Port Renfrew, B.C. Less than 10 per cent of old growth forest remains on Vancouver Island. But, before you tut-tut and move on, be aware that the lovely Galleria Italia in which the virtual tree is standing is clad in Douglas fir, as are the sweeping staircases at the AGO.
The difficulties of the Anthropocene are all around us; Mr. Burtynsky, Ms. Baichwal and Mr. de Pencier will make you stop, look and think.
The exhibition Anthropocene continues at the Art Gallery of Ontario to Jan. 6, and at the National Gallery of Canada to Feb. 24.
The film Anthropocene: The Human Epoch opens Friday in Toronto, Oct. 5 in Vancouver, Oct. 19 in Montreal and through the fall in other cities.
As well as the AGO's bilingual exhibition catalogue, the project includes Anthropocene, a 224-page hardcover book of Mr. Burtynksy's photos with essays by the three artists and poems by Margaret Atwood, to be published this fall.

Full text: AT A GLANCE Richard Reed Parry performs Thursday at 9 p.m. at Le Ministère, 4521 St-Laurent Blvd., with Jesse Mac Cormack, as part of the POP Montreal festival. Tickets cost $17 ($20 at the door), available at popmontreal.com. POP Montreal continues through Sunday.
I had an hour to kill before interviewing Richard Reed Parry a couple weeks back, so I headed to Jeanne-Mance Park, where I sat on a bench and took in the gently sweeping sounds of the Arcade Fire member's second solo album, Quiet River of Dust, Vol. 1.
Let me first say, this never happens. Sad but true, I don't spend my days wandering city parks listening to music. And yet, to borrow a line Parry used a few times during our talk, "it's not a coincidence."
The singer-songwriter/multiinstrumentalist's new album is all about getting back to nature, with song titles including Gentle Pulsing Dust, Sai No Kawara (River of Death), On the Ground and Song of Wood.
After posing for Montreal Gazette photographer John Mahoney in his "Quiet"-emblazoned sweatshirt under one of Jeanne-Mance Park's regal trees, Parry explained the lush and rather trippy album art, in which he had a big hand.
"I wanted it to be this kind of green world," he said.
The front cover features a surreal image of a mountain, river and sunrise/sunset with blurry figures in motion, while the fold-out insert shows snapshots encased in globes, against a mossy backdrop.
"I wanted a natural environment, mixed with a Blade Runner kind of world," Parry continued. "I had this idea of memory spheres and contained worlds inside of that. These are family photos, basically - of these outdoor medieval theatre productions my dad used to do; this is a Scottish forest I went to; and that's me in a lake in Vermont ..."
Released last Friday, just before the first day of fall, Quiet River of Dust, Vol. 1 is the first of a twoalbum set, with the second due at the start of spring. It also marks Parry's arrival as a solo artist.
While the musician is a big part of Arcade Fire - his engaging stage presence, striking six-footplus frame and red hair making him one of the band's most recognizable figures - he has mostly kept a low profile outside of the group.
His off-Arcade Fire project Bell Orchestre allowed him to again operate as part of a collective, while his orchestra-assisted 2014 solo debut Music for Heart and Breath was a classically inspired album that came off like an evocative aside. This is different; the new album finds Parry singing, and playing, front and centre.
It took a while to get him there, plus a lot of encouragement from the National's Aaron Dessner, whom he describes as the album's "unofficial silent producer." Dessner and his bandmate/brother Bryce appear on the album, as do Parry's partner Laurel Sprengelmeyer, a.k.a. Little Scream, and Andrew Barr of the Barr Brothers, among others.
Though essentially folky, the song cycle is uplifted by fleeting moments of Arcade Fire-esque grandeur, others of ethereal beauty, and a general sense of ownership.
"I was trying to channel the ancestors and summon the spirits of the past, which is something we also try to do in the Arcade Fire world," Parry said. "It's not coincidental."
Parry's past is marked by fond memories of his theatre-professor father, who died when Parry was 17 ("this is sort of the album I didn't have the tools to make at the time"), and his dad's band the Friends of Fiddler's Green (whose members appear on the new album); his music-educator mom; and the regular musical gatherings he would find himself in the midst of while growing up, singing along to folksongs that inhabit his DNA.
"I'll still take trips to Toronto to go to family friends'parties just so I can get my sing on," he said.
Quiet River of Dust, Vol. 1 is equal parts tribute to that lost world of his youth and liberating emergence of an artist who has long folded himself into the galvanizing group dynamic of the world-famous band that brought him here.
"It's mildly nerve-racking," Parry said. "It really feels exposed, in a way, but I feel completely authentic about the music.
"I don't feel like I'm trying to sell some far-fetched idea, and I don't expect to be on commercial radio. I think the songs are totally accessible and beautiful to anyone who listens, but I definitely have no interest in trying to go for the centre of the mainstream, because that's not a place I pay attention to or aspire to be.
"So that just makes you wonder: who's going to find this music, and who is this music going to find? Where is it going to take me? "I have played huge rock fests and massive arenas. I don't need more of that; I already do plenty with Arcade Fire.
"I want this to be a new journey, and to try and do things and make decisions that will take it to places that feel interesting and beautiful, take it where it wants to be heard." tdunlevy@postmedia.com twitter.com/TChaDunlevy

Pointe-Claire to discuss Pioneer demolition plans; Residents to weigh in on fate of building slated to be knocked down for condos

Full text: The fate of the Pioneer bar in Pointe-Claire could be decided Wednesday night when city council convenes to hear an appeal of the demolition committee's decision to raze the 117-year-old building.
Another large turnout is expected for the 7 p.m. public meeting at the Holiday Inn and Suites Hotel in Pointe-Claire where arguments for and against the Pioneer's fate will be heard.
At stake is the Pointe-Claire Village's history and it's future, according to demolition critics who accuse Mayor John Belvedere of forsaking the city's built heritage to pave the way for luxury condos that would drastically alter the character of a village that predates Canadian federation.
But for others, the Pioneer has become a public eyesore in the heart of the village. The building, the city argues, bears little heritage value or physical resemblance to the original Hotel Charlebois (later the Pointe-Claire Hotel). Although Belvedere said he wasn't a "condo guy" during last year's municipal election, he has embraced the Lakeshore Rd. condo project as a means to revitalizing the village's commercial sector.
The demolition committee approved the Pioneer's demolition at an Aug. 9 meeting. However, the committee rejected the reutilization plan/condo project based on concerns about parking issues related to the city's decision to sell an adjacent parking lot to the condo developer for $730,000.
The city cannot issue a demolition permit to the developer until a replacement project for the site has been approved.
Belvedere said both the demolition of the Pioneer and the reutilization project have been appealed. He said parking lot concerns will be addressed at Wednesday's meeting, but said the city remains on board with the condo project.
"The developer didn't have to come back with a different plan; he had to come with basically a plan as to how he'd manage the site during construction," he said. "And we had to come back with a plan to compensate for the parking we'd lose."
As for the turnout expected for Wednesday's meeting, the mayor said, "The people who are against it will come out and people who are for it won't."
Emotions ran high at a 6.5-hour meeting Aug. 9, especially after the demolition committee, comprised of councillors Paul Bissonnette, Eric Stork and Brent Cowan, announced it stood by a recent architectural assessment of the Pioneer (paid for by the developer) which concluded the building should be torn down because it had lost much of its heritage value since its construction in 1901.
Andrew Swidzinski, a vice-president of the Société pour le Sauvegarde du Patrimoine de Pointe-Claire, also caused a stir when he presented the committee with an independent evaluation of the parking lot that appraised its value at $1,150,000, more than $400,000 above what the city agreed to sell it for.
After, Claude Arsenault, former head of the SSPPC, accused the city of holding a "fire sale" of municipal property.
"Why would the city sell a key parking lot on Lakeshore Rd. to a developer for such a low price, so he can build a condo that no one in the village wants?" Arsenault posited.
But Belvedere has steadfastly maintained the condo project falls within the guidelines set out in the city's Village Code. Belvedere has also pointed out no one offered to buy the Pioneer before the condo developer moved in.
But a local buyer, Paul Parfett, emerged to say he would buy the now-shuttered Pioneer and restore it to its former glory if the present deal with Montreal developer Greg Koegl falls through.
Tim Thomas, owner of an antique shop on Cartier Ave., said there is much more at stake than saving an old bar that served as a watering hole for generations of West Islanders.
He said the construction of a "monster " condo project will signal an end of the village's unique history and charm.
"It will mark the beginning of the end for the village as we know it."
Michel Forest, head of the SSP-PC, issued a statement last week in which he sharply criticized the demolition committee's decision.
"Taking into account that more than 400 people were not able to influence the vote of the demolition committee last August, the SSPPC is asking the question: how many citizens votes will be needed to finally hear their request (to save) a heritage building and preserve the spirit and soul of our village?" Forest said the will of the people should prevail, especially when an overwhelming number of citizens oppose the condo project.
The Fédération Histoire Québec (FHQ), an umbrella group of 275 heritage, historical and genealogical organizations representing 55,000 members across the province, recently wrote to the city, asking it to halt its demolition plan.
"The meeting of Aug. 9th, which gave rise to a strong citizen participation, leads us to ask ourselves: Who owns the city: the promoters, the municipal council or the citizens?" wrote Clément Locat, head of heritage for the FHQ. Jmeagher@postmedia.com

"The meeting of Aug. 9th, which gave rise to a strong citizen participation, leads us to ask ourselves: Who owns the city: the promoters, the municipal council or the citizens?" wrote Clément Locat, head of heritage for the FHQ.

Montreal police looking for clues after gunfire in Point-St-Charles( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-looking-for-clues-after-shoot-out-in-pointe-st-charles )
Police responding to 911 calls about gunfire in Point-St-Charles found plenty of spent shell casings but little in the way of information. Officers arrived at the corner of Châteauguay and Charlevoix Sts. and found spent shell casings on the street and several bullet holes in the facade of a nearby residence. Police said the occupants of the building were not co-operating with investigators. A canine unit was deployed to find more clues to determine what sparked the incident.
British Columbia wildfire season ranked second-worst in province's history( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/celebrating-sir-wilfrid-laurier/british-columbia-wildfire-season-ranked-second-worst-in-provinces-history/wcm/1b627dd0-01a2-49e4-9e5c-c2acb56df7c1 )
A year after the single worst season for wildfires in British Columbia's history, government statistics indicate the 2018 wildfire season has already reached the second-worst mark, burning 945 square kilometres of land so far. Speaking from the Provincial Wildfire Coordination Centre in Kamloops, B.C., the province's chief fire information officer explained how the two seasons have been very different so far. In 2017, he said, the most troublesome fires all started in a three-day period in early July, burning for months and merging with other fires. While fires merging is a common phenomenon, he said the sheer volume of blazes ignited in those three days created weeks-long battles for firefighters. In contrast, 2018 has seen almost 600 more fires than 2017, but most were more manageable due to a wet spring.
NAFTA breakthrough appears imminent after year of fractious talks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/into-the-final-hours-nafta-breakthrough-appears-imminent-after-years-of-fractious-talks/wcm/2c7385ee-12da-4e78-9b3f-834465358f6d )
The United States and Mexico are close to resolving their NAFTA differences and may wrap up as soon as Monday, creating an opening for Canada to rejoin talks between countries that trade more than a trillion dollars annually. As has been the case over a year of intense and sometimes fractious negotiations to update the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement, it's not the end of the road. But optimism is running high of salvaging the pact that President Donald Trump has threatened to scrap. Significant breakthroughs between Mexico and the United States came during the past several days on automobiles and energy, according to three people familiar with the process who asked not to be named discussing private talks.

Police arriving at the scene of a shoot-out that erupted early Monday in Point St-Charles found plenty of spent shell casings but little in the way of information, even from the occupants of a building hit by gunfire. Officers arrived at the corner of Châteauguay and Charlevoix Sts. soon after receiving several 911 calls reporting gunfire at the site.

Josh Freed: Quebec's political discourse isn't perfect, but it could be much worse

Full text: I was asking visiting friends from England about Brexit and they looked at me glumly, as if I was trying to poison them.
They said they can't talk about it anymore, since the topic divides families, neighbours and friends and leaves everyone exhausted, or depressed.
In the U.S., it's a similar situation as the Great Trump Divide makes political dinner talk treacherous and explosive.
In long-boring Ontario it's hard to discuss provincial politics, now that Premier Doug Ford has divided Toronto's suburbs from the city and many families down the middle.
Out West you can't talk pipelines, which divide Alberta from B.C., motorists from environmentalists and oil workers from everyone else. In fact, you can barely breathe because of the forest fires( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/b-c-wildfires-2018-prime-minister-visits-wildfire-crews-as-hundreds-of-blazes-burn/wcm/72e228e4-2653-48c7-b833-8f7761a7c798 ).
It's all a sign of our increasingly divided era where CNNers live in one bubble, Fox News viewers live in another and me often trumps we.
In Europe, there are seething tensions over immigration in Italy, Hungary, Germany, France and elsewhere, as a Pandora's box creaks open.
Yet amidst all this there's one small place where it's easy to breathe and speak your mind - Quebec, a near-political Shangri-la for our times.
For a change, we have no great society-shredding battles - just small ones over hijab-wearing( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/hijabs-back-in-quebec-spotlight-as-veiled-muslim-woman-prepares-to-seek-election/wcm/20c5b203-2073-483a-8332-5a4a077c7eec ), or the closing of a Robert Lepage play( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepages-controversial-play-about-indigenous-people-kanata-has-been-cancelled ).
Sure, some anglos have continuing disputes with Bill 101 and Bonjour-Hi - and everyone complains about our Barrette Medicare Diet. But in Montreal our only truly harrowing existential question is:
Which way do I go to avoid construction traffic?
Overall, we have no huge societal divides, no obvious white rage movement, or large scale hate groups.
The Parti Québécois, long the Great Divider, is practically turning comic - offering self-deprecating election slogans that make fun of their plunging poll numbers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/parti-quebecois-tries-self-deprecating-humour-in-new-ad-campaign ).
They include: "The Party Québécois. Seriously."
Also: "What's the difference between a péquiste and a dentist? There aren't any! Both are struggling, but working for your well-being."
For neverendum decades we Quebecers were the problem child of the Western world, watching our parents slug it out for custody, as the world shrugged.
Anglos wondered whether to Leave or Remain, while francos couldn't talk to their families across the referendum gulf. Yet now, in this crazily hot, eerie summer we are a society at peace.
Yes, we face a provincial election, but without the country-shattering stakes of the past, unless you suffer from permanent electoral anxiety.
Premier Couillard shouldn't be as unpopular as he seems, given Quebec's booming economy and low unemployment, but his political health was badly damaged by his health minister.
Also, the Liberals have been in power for most of 15 years and that does beg some thought, now that "sovereignty" is an endangered word and the neverendum has come to an endum.
CAQ leader François Legault seems a serious, seasoned politician far from The Trump-Ford mould.
But Legault does make minorities nervous by harping about hijabs and reducing immigration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-liberals-caq-spar-over-ethnic-nationalism ) in an aging province that needs immigrant workers. In a society where we seem to be getting along better than anywhere, why provoke tensions?
Meanwhile our Canadian PM, Teflon Trudeau, may not be his philosopher-king father, but in a world of angry, populist leaders and a U.S. president storming his way through strippers, Trudeau seems a decent enough guy.
Two separate groups of friends just returned from the U.S. describing similar experiences. Americans inundated them with envious compliments about Canada - including some Trump-weary Republicans.
Trudeau's star is also rising due to Trump's trade war, Maxime Bernier's bombast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/newsalert-bernier-declares-hes-leaving-federal-conservative-party-2/wcm/62893ded-4e51-48c7-9159-378964b4e655 ) and Saudi Arabia's assault on our pipsqueak protest in favour of women's rights.
And while "Quebec values" talk can be aggravating, so far it's just talk. Look at Denmark, where immigrant kids are being forcibly separated from their families for 25 hours a week, from age 1 - to learn "Danish values" in daycare( https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/30/593979013/in-denmark-s-plan-to-rid-country-of-ghettos-some-immigrants-hear-go-home ).
Or Italy, which is blocking boatloads of desperate refugees( https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/deadly-consequences-more-than-600-drown-in-four-weeks-since-italy-ban-on-migrant-ships/wcm/6c8424ee-18a7-42d4-9d2f-89b109496291 ), or Hungary( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/hungary-aid-groups-ask-government-to-drop-anti-migrant-bill/wcm/db8994e1-65bb-4a8e-a08d-eeb8c1b11714 ) and the Philippines( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/duterte-withdrawing-philippines-from-intl-criminal-court/wcm/87a9703b-d066-4f01-a408-2e7e070bdb86 ) - fast becoming nasty nations. Or poor decimated Venezuela( https://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/they-ran-out-of-money-venezuela-launches-one-of-the-greatest-currency-devaluations-in-history/wcm/34a022cb-c27c-4bef-9911-11fcb2a78ede ).
It's too soon to know where Quebec voters will land after Couillard's 39-day Long Campaign March. Polls say we will likely elect Premier Legault but that's what they said about supposed Prime Minister Mulcair and supposed President Hillary.
For the moment, try to appreciate that you live in one of the least divided, least angry, most trouble-free spots on Earth.
You can curse the construction traffic till 2021, and you probably will for much longer. You can complain about the steaming summer, if you're willing to spend all winter cursing the cold - then curse the remedy, too.
But according to Environment Canada we're due for four more summers as hot as this one.
You can fume about our closed Mount Royal road and the shuttered Jeanne-Mance Park's North baseball field, as I do - but in the end we are living in an enviable moment and a relatively kind and gentle society.
The problem kid is now the model one and the model kids have big problems.
Vive le Québec équil-libre!

For neverendum decades we Quebecers were the problem child of the Western world, watching our parents slug it out for custody, as the world shrugged.
Anglos wondered whether to Leave or Remain, while francos couldn't talk to their families across the referendum gulf. Yet now, in this crazily hot, eerie summer we are a society at peace.
Yes, we face a provincial election, but without the countryshattering stakes of the past, unless you suffer from permanent electoral anxiety.
Premier Couillard shouldn't be as unpopular as he seems, given Quebec's booming economy and low unemployment, but his political health was badly damaged by his health minister.
Also, the Liberals have been in power for most of 15 years and that does beg some thought, now that "sovereignty" is an endangered word and the neverendum has come to an endum.
CAQ Leader François Legault seems a serious, seasoned politician far from The Trump-Ford mould.
But Legault does make minorities nervous by harping about hijabs and reducing immigration in an aging province that needs immigrant workers. In a society where we seem to be getting along better than anywhere, why provoke tensions? Meanwhile our Canadian PM, Teflon Trudeau, may not be his philosopher-king father, but in a world of angry, populist leaders and a U.S. president storming his way through strippers, Trudeau seems a decent enough guy.
Two separate groups of friends just returned from the U.S. describing similar experiences. Americans inundated them with envious compliments about Canada - including some Trump-weary Republicans.
Trudeau's star is also rising due to Trump's trade war, Maxime Bernier's bombast and Saudi Arabia's assault on our pipsqueak protest in favour of women's rights.
And while "Quebec values" talk can be aggravating, so far it's just talk.
Look at Denmark, where immigrant kids are being forcibly separated from their families for 25 hours a week, from age 1 - to learn "Danish values" in daycare.
Or Italy, which is blocking boatloads of desperate refugees, or Hungary and the Philippines - fast becoming nasty nations. Or poor decimated Venezuela.
It's too soon to know where Quebec voters will land after Couillard's 39-day Long Campaign March.
Polls say we will likely elect Premier Legault but that's what they said about supposed Prime Minister Mulcair and supposed President Hillary.
For the moment, try to appreciate that you live in one of the least divided, least angry, most trouble-free spots on Earth.
You can curse the construction traffic till 2021, and you probably will for much longer.
You can complain about the steaming summer, if you're willing to spend all winter cursing the cold - then curse the remedy, too.
But according to Environment Canada we're due for four more summers as hot as this one.
You can fume about our closed Mount Royal road and the shuttered Jeanne-Mance Park's North baseball field, as I do - but in the end we are living in an enviable moment and a relatively kind and gentle society.
The problem kid is now the model one and the model kids have big problems.
Vive le Québec équil-libre!

Full text: PART ONE OF A FOUR-PART SERIES
Mount Royal is more than Beaver Lake, the chalet lookout and the Camillien-Houde belvedere. And it's best enjoyed on foot.
So I set off to hike the mountain, walking four distinct routes that took me through lush forests, along steep escarpments and to quiet corners so far from Montreal traffic, noise and crowds that I could have been in the backwoods.
Along the way, I took in impressive vistas from some of Montreal's highest points, and learned about the millennia-long history of human use of Montreal's three-peaked crown jewel. Some unexpected vestiges of bygone eras were discovered along the way.
The walks, offering a mix of lengths and difficulty levels, will take you to the summits in Montreal, Outremont and Westmount and along the eastern, western, northern and southern flanks.
Interactive maps are available for each walk on the Montreal Gazette website. The city of Montreal gives away detailed paper maps of Mount Royal's trails and attractions( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/BUREAU_MTROYAL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/carte_mont_royal_fr.PDF ); the map is available on the mountain at Beaver Lake, Smith House and the chalet at the Kondiaronk Lookout.
***
Two stone pillars mark the entrance to Tiohtià:ke Otsira'kéhne, a new city park.
The city of Montreal doesn't seem to want you to find the Outremont Summit( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5161978,-73.5900805,1062a,35y,239.35h,64.15t/data=!3m1!1e3 ) or the park around it. No signs greet visitors, the official Mount Royal tourist map is elusive and entrances are not easily accessed via public transit.
Pity, because the city spent a lot of money creating a new park around Mount Royal's second-highest peak, rehabilitating an area with a rich history ravaged over decades by the dumping of excavation material.
Montrealers would enjoy this green sanctum on Mount Royal's north flank if they knew it existed.
For years, locals, Université de Montréal students and others in the know have enjoyed strolling through the old-growth forest and taking in the fine views and sunsets here.
I set out to explore the history and terrain of this concealed corner of the mountain, which over the years has been known as the Colline d'Outremont and Mount Murray( https://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/arrond_out_fr/media/documents/volume2_etude_bisson.pdf ). The park stretches over 23 hectares from Côte-des-Neiges to Outremont, just north of the two cemeteries on the mountain.
***
The park's Outremont-side entrance is on a quiet residential stretch of Mont-Royal Blvd.( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5113896,-73.6051917,3a,75y,180.88h,85.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sEgGBkznsWJta_jWrjlQKmg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 )
You'd be forgiven if you mistook it for an entrance to the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges. On either side of the path entrance, stone pillars bear the cemetery's green logo.
The only hint it's a Montreal park is on a temporary city sign, held down by cinder blocks, about the emerald ash borer. It mentions Tiohtià:ke Otsira'kéhne, but doesn't explain that this is the Mohawk name of the lush public park in front of you.
Tall trees and a carpet of green underbrush welcome those who venture in. About a hundred metres up the wide sun-speckled gravel path, you'll find the first clue that this place is part of Mount Royal.
A bronze 3D map of the mountain sits on a granite base, a "you are here" arrow pointing out the zig-zag path you're about to walk, with three Montreal symbols helping visitors situate themselves - the iconic Université de Montréal tower is near the end of this path, and beyond it St. Joseph's Oratory. Over on the side is the cross atop Mount Royal.
The map doesn't spell out the location of the Outremont peak but fortunately, we know where we're going.
A bronze 3D map includes a symbolic depiction of the iconic cross atop Mount Royal.
***
Known as the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Woods( http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/bs1763371 ), this part of the park was purchased by Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in 1878 to give visitors from the east easier access to the graveyard.
It was ravaged in the mid-1970s by the dumping of earth excavated during métro construction( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/BUREAU_MTROYAL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/20130923_ENSEMBLE%20DU%20CHEMIN%20DE%20CEINTURE_FINAL_SECUR.PDF ). Critics say mountain bikers continue to cause damage here, ripping through the woods at high speeds.
The cemetery floated the idea of d( http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/pdf/PD01/rapport_cimetiere_ndn.pdf )eveloping the area for mausoleums with parking( http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/pdf/PD01/rapport_cimetiere_ndn.pdf ).
Then, 10 years ago, the city signed a long-term lease with the cemetery( https://www.newswire.ca/fr/news-releases/la-ville-de-montreal-et-ses-partenaires-feront-du-troisieme-sommet-du-montroyal-un-parc-public-538577071.html ). Under the 50-year deal, the city can use the path through the woods leading to the Outremont Summit as part of the park.
The city reforested parts of the mountain, upgraded paths and, as part of last year's 375th anniversary, installed the relief map, as well as controversial granite stumps.
Sheer rock wall to admire along the way.
A year ago( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-names-outremont-peak-for-mohawk-nation ), Montreal named the area Parc Tiohtià:ke Otsira'kéhne (pronounced jojagay ochira'gaynay) in recognition of Indigenous groups that used the mountain long before French settlers arrived. In Mohawk, the words mean "around the fire, on the island where the group separates," the city says( https://www.facebook.com/mtlville/photos/saviez-vous-que-le-mont/1542240992467351/ ).
"The park has a charm all its own," says Jean-Michel Villanove, who gives walking tours of Mount Royal's three summits for Les amis de la montagne. "It has great open spaces and the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Woods features a long, serpentine path in a beautiful forest."
***
Wildflowers thrive amid the towering maple and oak trees.
This is the ideal spot for what the Japanese call a "forest bath" - a contemplative walk through the woods.
The serpentine path, cut into a steep slope, is lined with towering maple and oak trees and the occasional poplar. Hikers can admire rock walls and steep embankments as they make their way up the 900 metres to the summit.
You won't come across many other humans on the path - maybe a jogger or two or a solitary dog walker. You'll hear birdsong, and the occasional rustling in the undergrowth will remind you critters are around.
Watch for signs of wildlife all around.
There are no benches but you can rest on a log or one of the granite stumps along the trail.
No bikes are allowed on this part of the ring road but cyclists have left their marks nonetheless. Some use rutted trails along parts of the main path.
Others go even more rogue.
On one of my walks, I came across a two-wheeled daredevil. Wearing what looked like a motorcycle helmet, he slowly walked his all-terrain bike up the path, then zoomed down through the forest, cutting a swath perpendicular to the path.
***
An ideal spot for what the Japanese call a "forest bath" - a contemplative walk through the woods.
The prize at the top: a stone lookout( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5073042,-73.6039395,135a,35y,292.88h,62.31t/data=!3m1!1e3 ) with a unique view of northwestern Montreal.
This part of the park belongs to the Université de Montréal. Like the cemetery, 10 years ago it signed a deal allowing the city to rehabilitate the land and use it as a park.
The U de M sports stadium sits down below, the Sanctuaire du Mont-Royal condo complex recognizable as you look out at the sprawling city. On a clear day, you can also make out Lac des Deux Montagnes and the Laurentians in the distance.
The prize at Outremont Summit: a view of northwestern Montreal. Rest on the granite stumps installed to mark Montreal's 375th anniversary last year.
When you're taking in the view, look right to see an odd sight in the foreground: a tall, rusting tower topped by metal wheels fastened to a crossarm.
It looks almost like something from a ski hill and that's what it is. It's one of the last vestiges of the era when this and other parts( http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/scripts/large.php?Lang=2&accessnumber=VIEW-3741&idImage=161496 )of Mount Royal were used for downhill skiing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-non-profit-looking-to-reintroduce-downhill-skiing-to-mount-royal ).
In 1944, the U de M( http://www.iforum.umontreal.ca/Forum/2006-2007/20070129/saviez_1.html ) removed raspberry bushes and cut down about 100 trees to create a ski hill( http://www.memorablemontreal.com/document/image/original/HM_ARC_002378-001.jpg ), building a T-bar( https://www.remontees-mecaniques.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=20751 ) lift to take skiers up( http://www.diplomes.umontreal.ca/association/activites.html#1944 ). The price: 25 cents on weekdays, 50 cents on weekends.
A ski lift and ski jump on Mount Royal, near the Université de Montréal in
Côte-des-Neiges on Feb. 9, 1972. The skiing came to an end in the late 1970s.
The skiing came to an end in the late 1970s( http://www.memorablemontreal.com/accessibleQA/en/histoire.php?quartier=6 ) and starting in the 1990s, trees were planted on the steep slope. A well-trodden dirt path( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5092629,-73.6117132,121a,35y,113.72h,41.88t/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) indicates hikers still use the hill despite the no-trespassing sign at the bottom.
There - on Vincent-D'Indy Ave., just up from the Édouard-Montpetit métro station - a second ski-lift tower sits rusting, a steel cable on the ground next to it.
On the summit, if you walk beyond the lookout, the path becomes narrower and you're heading downhill, toward the Côte-des-Neiges entrance to the park.
But there's more to see before you leave.
First, there's another stone lookout( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5072071,-73.6069714,112a,35y,293.37h,66.7t/data=!3m1!1e3 ) built on what remains of a ski jump( http://www.diplomes.umontreal.ca/association/activites.html#1968 ) that was also part of the U de M winter complex. The trees have not been trimmed so the view is not great but it's a nice shady area for a rest.
On one of my visits, one man was sitting under a tree doing a crossword as his small dogs scampered about, while a second visitor sat on a nearby boulder playing a mandolin.
A rusting tower with wheels fastened to a crossarm: one of the last vestiges of the era when Mount Royal was used for downhill skiing.
Another clearing is coming up but first, you walk through a forest where the city has built a wooden bridge that runs over a seasonal stream and acts as a viewing platform for nature lovers.
The clearing you come upon next is yet another stone belvedere. Again, the city hasn't maintained the trees so the lookout was not one when I last went by in June.
I found evidence some park visitors use this area for drinking and illicit fires, presumably at night: empty beer bottles and two small makeshift firepits full of bits of burnt wood and paper.
This grassy open area( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5038367,-73.6136877,207a,35y,35.04h,64.52t/data=!3m1!1e3 ) was once an unsightly mountain wasteland visible from kilometres away. The U de M used it as a dumping ground for earth excavated as it expanded the adjacent campus, then as a place to dispose of snow, store machinery and park vehicles.
Keep walking down and you'll reach an asphalt path that leads you past U de M pavilions. Soon, you will see the iconic U de M tower and will reach the Côte-des-Neiges entrance to the park.
Like the one on the Outremont side, there's no indication this is an entry point to a city park. The only sign: no cycling.
A shady, paved pedestrian path - part of the city's Mount Royal car-free ring road - will take you along the perimeter of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/45.5032731,-73.6120556/45.4968389,-73.6176073/@45.4973781,-73.6202355,1441m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2 ) to Decelles Ave.
Too bad few Montrealers know the path offers public access to a little-explored side of the mountain.
IF YOU GO
Difficulty level: Medium
Starts: Outremont side entrance, Mont-Royal Blvd.
Ends: Decelles Ave., near the entrance on the Côte-des-Neiges side.
Distance: 2.5 kilometres
Estimated time: 1 hour
Accessibility: Steep slopes would make it difficult to use a stroller here.
Transit: The 51 and 129( http://beta.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/local ) buses run along Côte-Ste-Catherine Rd., near the Outremont entrance. The 11, 435, 165, 166 and 711( http://beta.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/local ) buses stop at or near Queen-Mary and Côte-des-Neiges Rds., on the Côte-des-Neiges side. The Côte-des-Neiges métro station also serves this area.
Cycling: Bikes are not allowed.
Parking: Available on residential streets near the Outremont entrance.
Map: https://goo.gl/9y4S6X( https://goo.gl/9y4S6X )
The city of Montreal has been creating a car-free ring road around Mount Royal for several years.
A ring road encircles the mountain
The Outremont Summit is part of Mount Royal's Chemin de ceinture( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/siteofficieldumontroyal/sites/ville.montreal.qc.ca.siteofficieldumontroyal/files/carte_mont-roayal_rv.pdf ), a 10-kilometre, mostly car-free ring road( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/CONSEIL_PATRIMOINE_MTL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/A08-SC-04.PDF ) around the mountain, much of which is open to both pedestrians and cyclists.
An extension of Olmsted Rd. in Mount Royal Park, it has been discussed for decades and has gradually grown since work began in 2007.
On the east side, it runs north through Outremont along Mont-Royal Blvd. to the entrance to the Outremont Summit park on Mount Royal's north side. Pedestrians can continue through the park and over the summit but cyclists are expected to take bike paths around the Université de Montréal to reach the west side.
On the west side, the ring road runs along Côte-des-Neiges Rd. and Decelles Ave., where a fence along the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery was moved away from the street to allow for a broad bike and pedestrian path.
Two sections of the ring road remain to be built.
One is a section between Beaver Lake and Côte-des-Neiges Rd. that is to be added when the city redesigns the Côte-des-Neiges/Remembrance Rd.( https://www.google.com/maps/place/C%C3%B4te-des-Neiges+Rd+%26+Remembrance+Rd,+Westmount,+QC/@45.4948178,-73.6134665,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91a1c6513a5e7:0x3c2547d1c82815f2!8m2!3d45.4948178!4d-73.6047064 ) interchange. The other would require a pedestrian/bike bridge to be built over Camillien-Houde Way, linking Olmsted Rd.( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5142937,-73.5925715,17z ) and the Outremont Woods.

I set out to explore the history and terrain of this concealed corner of the mountain, which over the years has been known as the Colline d'Outremont and Mount Murray. The park stretches over 23 hectares from Côte-des-Neiges to Outremont, just north of the two cemeteries on the mountain.

There - on Vincent-D'Indy Ave., just up from the Édouard-Montpetit métro station - a second ski-lift tower sits rusting, a steel cable on the ground next to it.
On the summit, if you walk beyond the lookout, the path becomes narrower and you're heading downhill, toward the Côte-des-Neiges entrance to the park.
But there's more to see before you leave.
First, there's another stone lookout built on what remains of a ski jump that was also part of the U de M winter complex. The trees have not been trimmed so the view is not great but it's a nice shady area for a rest.
On one of my visits, one man was sitting under a tree doing a crossword as his small dogs scampered about, while a second visitor sat on a nearby boulder playing a mandolin.
Another clearing is coming up but first, you walk through a forest where the city has built a wooden bridge that runs over a seasonal stream and acts as a viewing platform for nature lovers.
The clearing you come upon next is yet another stone belvedere. Again, the city hasn't maintained the trees so the lookout was not one when I last went by in June.
I found evidence some park visitors use this area for drinking and illicit fires, presumably at night: empty beer bottles and two small makeshift firepits full of bits of burnt wood and paper.
This grassy open area was once an unsightly mountain wasteland visible from kilometres away. The U de M used it as a dumping ground for earth excavated as it expanded the adjacent campus, then as a place to dispose of snow, store machinery and park vehicles.
Keep walking down and you'll reach an asphalt path that leads you past U de M pavilions. Soon, you will see the iconic U de M tower and will reach the Côte-des-Neiges entrance to the park.
Like the one on the Outremont side, there's no indication this is an entry point to a city park. The only sign: no cycling.
A shady, paved pedestrian path - part of the city's Mount Royal carfree ring road - will take you along the perimeter of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery to Decelles Ave.
Too bad few Montrealers know the path offers public access to a little-explored side of the mountain. ariga@postmedia.com twitter.com/andyriga

Lepage's kanata cancelled; Co-producers withdraw financial support from controversial performance

Full text: For Robert Lepage, the unrivalled superstar of Quebec theatre, this has been a summer to forget. Accustomed to international acclaim, Lepage has spent the past month under fire for two productions that address the oppression of African-Americans and Indigenous people, respectively, with few or no actors from those groups.
On Thursday, Lepage's production company Ex Machina announced that Kanata, a play examining relations between whites and Indigenous people but with no Indigenous cast members, has been cancelled.
The Ex Machina statement said unnamed coproducers withdrew their financial support for the play - more than two years in the making and set to open in Paris in December - as a result of "the infinitely complex and often aggressive controversy surrounding the show."
The announcement follows the cancellation earlier this month of Lepage's SLAV, a musical at the Montreal International Jazz Festival based on slave songs with a white star and a predominantly white cast.
The back-to-back cancellations have brought the debate over cultural appropriation to Quebec with a vengeance. As he did when SLAV was met with protests from Quebec artists of colour, Lepage has expressed bewilderment over the negative reaction to Kanata from Indigenous groups.
"I really did not expect to face such anger," he told Radio-Canada last Saturday in his only interview on the controversy. He likened the reaction to an out-of-control forest fire.
For Margo Kane, artistic managing director of Vancouver's Full Circle First Nations theatre company, it is a fire that Lepage lit.
She was invited to advise Lepage when he and the French theatre company set to perform Kanata visited Vancouver on a 2016 research trip.
She said she advised Lepage to shelve the project after sitting in as the Kanata team interviewed people familiar with the city's Downtown Eastside, an Indigenous woman in recovery who had been living on the streets and a former police officer.
"I basically said, 'Don't do it,'" Kane said in an interview Thursday.
"I said, 'No, it's coming through your eyes.
Where are the Indigenous voices and perspectives in this piece? We are really tired of people telling our story for us.'"I just could feel that there was no real listening, no real understanding. They had made up their mind and that was that."
Today, Lepage is paying the price. Kane's voice was not the only one warning Lepage that the project was problematic. The French cultural website Arrêt sur images reported Thursday that the production was refused funding by the Canada Council for the Arts in 2016. An Ex Machina spokesman told Radio-Canada that the Council had sought more information about Indigenous people consulted during the play's creation.
Kane is at least the fourth Indigenous artist consulted by Lepage to distance herself from Kanata. She took offence when her name was invoked last week as evidence Lepage and the French theatre company had consulted First Nations members.
"You're just using our names to put a stamp on it that you did your due diligence," she said. "They didn't do their due diligence."
The debate over Kanata came to a head on July 14 when a group of Indigenous artists from Quebec signed an open letter in Montreal's Le Devoir accusing Lepage and Ariane Mnouchkine of Paris's Théâtre du Soleil of rendering Indigenous people invisible.
Lepage met with his critics last week, but he refused to budge on their request for Indigenous participation in the play, arguing that the production is too far along. "We are unable to change, and that bothers them," he told Radio-Canada.
The signatories of the July 14 letter issued a short statement Thursday saying they were saddened that Lepage had cancelled Kanata. "In no way did we believe that this conclusion was a solution to the lack of collaboration observed," they wrote.
Some here are portraying the cancellation as an assault on artistic freedom. Parti Québécois leader Jean-François Lisée urged the provincial Liberal government to step in with funding to save the show.
"This setback for artistic freedom is intolerable," he said on Twitter, blaming "pressure from censors" and the "moral weakness of coproducers" for the cancellation.
Quebec Culture Minister Marie Montpetit called the cancellation unfortunate. "Nobody wins, neither the creators, the First Nations nor the public. ... It's a missed opportunity to discover the work of a great Quebec creator and also a missed opportunity to talk about Indigenous culture," she said in a statement.
"Beyond this troubling situation, sooner or later we will need to try to understand - calmly and together - what cultural appropriation and the right to free artistic expression fundamentally are," the Ex Machina statement said.

City's heartbroken Greek community fundraising for victims of wildfires

Full text: Montreal's Greek community is reeling from news that wildfires in Greece have taken at least 79 lives outside the nation's capital.
"It's devastating to think that so many people are losing their lives and their loved ones in this fire," said Andy Crilis, vice president of the Hellenic Community of Greater Montreal.
"And then you think of the people who don't know if their loved ones are OK or not. It breaks your heart."
Crilis said he hasn't heard of any Montrealers stuck in the fires raging in the seaside villages of Rafina, Mati and areas outside Athens. There are no reports of Canadian casualties in the fires.
"With our community being as big as it is, there are probably people in Montreal with family that's affected by this," said Crilis. "But it's all so fresh, we're only now beginning to realize the magnitude of it."
Joanna Chery, who owns Phyllo Bar Mélina on Parc Ave., got married near the port of Rafina last weekend. According to one of her employees, she made it out of the area before it was engulfed in flames.
"Our friends and family are safe but hundreds of people are not," she wrote in a post on Facebook.
"Our deepest condolences go to the people of Mati, Rafina and Kineta whose lives were lost in this senseless tragedy."
Meanwhile, in Montreal, Crilis says a dozen volunteers are working the phones to collect donations for the victims of Greece's wildfires.
"They're calling family, friends, business owners," said Crilis. "We're a tight-knit community and we come together in times like these."
The connection between Montreal's 85,000-strong Greek community and their homeland is hard to describe, according to Crilis.
His family came to Montreal from southern Greece in the 1960s. They couldn't speak French or English but both got work as labourers and managed to give their children a better life.
Despite their success in the new country, they instilled a sense of pride of their Greek heritage in their children and grandchildren - who all speak Greek fluently.
"We go back and visit family as often as we can," Crilis said. "We're very connected to our roots just like everyone in the community."
The community will likely organize a fundraising event in the coming weeks. In the meantime, Crilis is asking people who want to donate to call 514-738-2421.
Donors can also visit hcgm.org of the HCGM Facebook page for more information on how to help fundraising efforts.

'Stand our ground'; AS deadline looms to dismantle protest camp, occupants have no plans to move

Full text: One morning earlier this week, opponents of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion huddled in a circle at their makeshift camp - a growing shantytown of plywood, tarps, tents, campers and protest signs - to plan their response to a 72-hour eviction notice they had just been given by the City of Burnaby.
Though occupants of Camp Cloud wouldn't let outsiders listen in on their deliberations, one thing was clear: they had no intention of leaving by the deadline of 6 a.m. Saturday morning, insisting their campsite, which started as a single trailer late last year, is a vital "visual and spiritual expression" of their opposition to the pipeline, which to them represents corporate greed and the threat of environmental degradation.
"What are we going to do on Saturday? We're going to stand our ground," said camp matriarch Kwitsel Tatel, sitting on a tattered couch with an unobstructed view of the trucks rumbling in and out of the gates to Kinder Morgan's sprawling tank farm across the street. Nearby, smoke wafted from a sacred fire that burns around the clock at the heart of the campsite.
In a press release Friday afternoon, camp occupants said they were willing to work with the city to make modifications to their structures, but that they needed more than 72 hours to do so. Burnaby city manager Lambert Chu said in an email officials agreed to a meeting - which will take place Monday, protesters say - but still expected Camp Cloud to comply with the order. As the deadline loomed and anticipation grew, city officials declined to telegraph what enforcement actions they were prepared to take in response to the promised act of defiance. But it is clear they were facing increasing pressure from some nearby residents who said they were fed up with the growing "eyesore" that is the camp.
The city is in a bind: it has actually been a vocal opponent to the pipeline project, which would expand delivery of oil sands bitumen from Alberta to B.C.'s Lower Mainland, raising concerns about increasing oil tanker traffic. But officials said while they support the right to protest, they can no longer stand by as occupants of Camp Cloud - whose numbers hover around 15 to 20 on any given day - flout city bylaws.
Of major concern, said Chu, is the open fire; the smallest spark could ignite the area, which is surrounded by dense forest and large storage tanks labelled "flammable."
In addition, protesters in recent weeks have constructed a two-storey carver's cabin, installed a makeshift shower and put up several tents alongside the road without permits. Chu said the city made multiple attempts - in person and in writing - to work with the protesters to comply with bylaws but to no avail.
"Sometimes the dialogue and conversations were very short," he said.
The eviction notice - delivered early Wednesday morning by city officials with backup from eight RCMP officers - warns protesters that if they do not remove all camp structures and vehicles by Saturday morning "the City of Burnaby will take action to enforce compliance (including removing the camp)."
But the protesters, who say they belong to the Coast Salish and other Indigenous groups, insist they are being good stewards - the fire is "lovingly watched over," Tatel said - and say the city's attempts at consultation were inadequate.
"I've never had a decent, mutual-respecting relationship discussion with the City of Burnaby," Tatel said. "While they say they've tried to talk to us, they were coming to give orders."
In recent weeks, protesters - upset with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement that the federal government would buy the Trans Mountain pipeline project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion because it was in the "national interest" - have attempted to draw attention to the controversial project in other ways.
Several of them rappelled down the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge in Vancouver in an effort to block oil tanker traffic from passing through. In Montreal, Greenpeace members climbed the Olympic Stadium tower and unfurled a banner that said "Stop Pipelines: Don't Dirty Our Money."
But it is here - at the entrance to the Kinder Morgan tank farm on Burnaby Mountain - and at the nearby Westridge Marine terminal where the main protests and blockades have taken place.
Since a court-ordered injunction took effect earlier this year, preventing protesters from coming within five metres of Trans Mountain sites, 211 people have been arrested for violating that order, police say.
However, during the National Post's visit to Camp Cloud this week, the scene was much more placid. When the occupants weren't strategizing, they were sleeping, or lounging near the fire surrounded by banners that read "F--the injunction" and "Hemp lands, not tar sands."
Periodically, the protesters will post "surveillance" videos on Facebook showing large machinery being moved in to the Kinder Morgan site. According to the camp's website, visitors can expect nothing but "friendly faces."
"Note we ARE a drug and alcohol free space but many people on site do openly medicate with marijuana," the website adds.
Tatel insists the campsite is doing important work raising awareness of the threat the Trans Mountain project poses to water resources.
"This is not about Indians versus whites anymore. This is about people versus corporations over water," she said.
"We're waking up and waking up those (people) busy spending money in malls to no end thinking that's their comfort. If they had no water, they'd realize, oh, that's where I need to protect my comfort," she said.
One camp occupant, who identified himself as Black Wolf, said he quit his job in landscaping and construction to attend the camp full time.
"We're not protesters. We're protecting the water. We're protecting it for everyone," he said. "One accident in that water is it - you can't fix it. You can't clean it up."
There's been speculation in recent days among some residents about whether the upcoming municipal elections in October may have driven Burnaby Mayor Derek Corrigan to issue the eviction notice.
Whatever the reason, some area residents said Camp Cloud occupants had worn out their welcome and were overjoyed to hear the city had decided - finally - to take action.
Darlene Johnston, who presented city council in May with a petition containing close to 200 signatures, said residents were growing frustrated with the frequent police presence and were concerned that the camp - located next to the curve of a narrow road - posed a traffic hazard, as well as a health hazard from the smoke.
"We've had enough," she said, sitting at her dining table, which she had covered with all the complaint letters she's sent to government officials.
"They're not proving anything by living on the side of the road. ... It's a gong show."
She said the day after the council meeting, some of the protesters knocked on her door. Ostensibly, it was to invite her family to the camp, but Johnston said she took it as an intimidation tactic.
A neighbour who signed the petition, and also got a visit from the protesters, said she has since installed video surveillance cameras outside her home and no longer feels comfortable driving past the camp.
"People are entitled to protest but they shouldn't be moving in," she said.
Not all residents feel this way.
In a recent letter to the editor published in Burnaby Now, area resident Janis Rutherford wrote, "I and many others I've spoken to respect and admire the dedication of the protesters."
Tsleil-Waututh Nation member Will George, who is behind another protest camp and cedar Watch House not far from Camp Cloud, said this week his camp - which is backed by various environmental groups including Greenpeace - shares Camp Cloud's goals, but it has strived to carry out its activities in compliance with local bylaws.
"Now that the government has chosen to purchase the pipeline makes this a very critical moment," he wrote in a statement. "There may be one camp coming down. However, this movement will continue to grow."
But Camp Cloud occupants say their site won't come down without a fight. On Friday morning, they posted a Facebook message acknowledging they "don't quite know what will happen" but nevertheless invited people to join them for an "all night party (and/or sleepover)."

Full text: Seven years ago, Paul Hennessey was a Vancouver paramedic. Although he was adept at responding to emergency health issues, he was also immensely curious about effective, day-to-day habits to promote general well-being - the kind of practice that might, in the long run, prevent crisis calls to the ER. So he took a leave from his job and spent months visiting spas, meditation centres and relaxation retreats around the world.
He soaked sore muscles in the thermal baths at Vals, Switzerland, designed by world-renowned architect Peter Zumthor.
"It has a room called the singing room," Hennessey says, "where the sound of the water dances through the space. It's very ethereal."
He inhaled the minerals of a salt-lined cave in Germany - "The salt has therapeutic properties.
It's good for inflammation and helps with breathing," he says.
In addition to boosting his mental and physical health, the trip inspired an idea. Hennessey decided to find a way to recreate in people's homes the tranquil vibes of the remote, pampering places he had visited.
Four years ago, he launched a Vancouver business called Circle Wellness Studios and designed a prefab, backyard relaxation room - part sauna, part yoga den, part meditation space - called the WelPod. It incorporates many of the features of his favourite retreats. The interiors have radiant floor heating and are lined with thermal-trapping, Himalayan crystal salts (styled after the German cave). Korean-style charcoal filters help purify the air. And there's an option to have the exterior clad in a Japanese-style, fire-singed wood that is UV, insect and fire resistant.
Starting at around $50,000, the WelPod is undeniably a luxury product. But, increasingly, homeowners around the world are willing to pay premiums of 10 to 15 per cent to incorporate health and wellness design features into their homes, according to a 2018 report from non-profit, Floridabased research group the Global Wellness Institute.
One such homeowner is John Livingston, a businessman based in Tofino, B.C. He purchased a WelPod for himself and his wife, Heather, after his doctor told him he needed to de-stress. "We absolutely love [it]," he says. "It's the perfect place to do yoga, meditate, or just plain relax."
And the trend goes well beyond at-home saunas. Whole, health-focused houses, buildings and neighbourhoods - ones that promote active living, green architecture and a strong connection to nature - are becoming increasingly common. There is even a building certification called WELL, established in 2014, that sets comprehensive standards for interior designers and architects who want to promote good living. It is administered by the same certification body as the environmentally focused LEED certification and encourages features such as built-in fitness facilities, access to lots of natural light and access to healthy foods.
In some ways, this is not new.
Globally, each year, we collectively pay out a staggering US$3.7-trillion for our physical and mental betterment, which, perhaps tellingly, is more than three times as much as we spend on pharmaceuticals, according to market-research firm Evaluate Pharma.
Traditionally, that outlay has been focused on just about everything - organic foods, day trips to the spa, exercise gear - aside from the design of our buildings. But the money we spend on healthy homes and other buildings has grown at a robust 6.4 per cent a year since 2015, and is expected to grow a further 6 per cent a year between now and 2022, to more than US$180-billion, from US$134billion currently.
More and more consumers are looking for wellness not only close to home, but within their homes. Canada is among the top 10 countries in terms of total spend (currently US$2.4-billion) for wellness-based real estate and design.
Montreal architecture studio Naturehumaine, for example, recently designed a house for a fitness-obsessed family, where gymnastics rings and a chin-up bar hang over what would otherwise be the dining room (it's right next to the kitchen). And a house designed by Vancouver architect Scott Posno could easily be mistaken for a contemporary Scandinavian spa, with its own minimalist, perfectly square Zen garden that can accommodate yoga or meditation. "I try to avoid visual noise," Posno says. "All the things that can be distracting and that don't do anything for you."
There are also neighbourhood developments such as Carraig Ridge outside Calgary. As it gets built over 10 to 15 years, it will limit its carbon footprint by restricting the size of the 44 houses (each of which is designed by a top international architect and costs a couple of million or more) to between 750 and 2,000 square feet.
Much of the forest-like surroundings will be preserved in perpetuity as parkland, allowing for walks through nature, not suburbia.
"Formerly, you would typically see this mainly in the traditional spa environment," says Jennifer Findlay, founder of Core Essence, a Toronto-based consulting firm that focuses on wellness and design. "But now we're seeing this cross over into the residential world, where people want to integrate wellness into their daily life, and not save it for a yearly trip abroad, their anniversary or the odd spa weekend."
That integration doesn't always have to involve a major renovation or a new build, though.
According to interior designer Kathryn Findlay, Core Essence's design director (and Jennifer's sister), there are a few key areas that can be focused on to improve at-home wellness, including lighting, acoustics, thermal comfort and air quality. Many of those can be addressed using "small hacks and daily practices," she says, and many are quite inexpensive.
"Lighting, both artificial and natural, is probably the biggest when it comes to design and the environment," she says, pointing out that the light pollution in our cities often makes it difficult to sleep, which in turn impacts our mental and physical health. Kathryn recommends starting by using simple dimmer switches or layered window treatments (blackout blinds alongside sheers) to modulate light throughout the day - increasing it in the morning when waking up is key, decreasing it at night when rest is important. Whether at home or at the office, a variety of lighting options - desk, overhead and floor lamps, say - is a good way to provide choice throughout the day, while "horrible fluorescent lighting" should be avoided at all costs, according to Findlay.
Likewise, other uninvasive changes include adding house plants to improve indoor air quality, using more soft surfaces such as rugs and upholstered furniture in a space to reduce echoing noises (the kind that often ricochet through downtown, concrete condos and, similar to light pollution, make it hard for people to sleep) and, where possible, having individual thermostats in each room so that one part of the house isn't freezing while another is blistering hot.
"We spend upwards of 90 per cent of our time indoors," Findlay says. "Our spaces should provide us comfort and well-being."
The quest for comfort and well-being is something Hennessey has continued fervently, seven years after his initial world tour. He continues to travel regularly in search of new ideas. He particularly loves Japan, where last year he found inspiration for a new product - a red cedar bathtub - that he unveiled at the end of June at Vancouver's Luxury & Design Home Show.
The Japanese have long used wood for their bathtubs, particularly ones made from woods such as cedar that inherently have antimicrobial and aromatherapy properties. Hennessey's version can either go in a traditional indoor bathroom or, as in Japan, sit on a back deck, al fresco. "Outdoor bathing is the best," he says.
It's a new concept to Canada, perhaps, but maybe it's something we can relax into.

Full text: A Quebec organization has issued a warning to hikers and campers that the dangers of sparking forest fires over the weekend is pegged at "very high, if not extreme, levels" in most of the province.
Most forest fires are caused by human carelessness, and the beginning of two weeks of summer construction holidays means it will be high season for unwanted fires, said Melanie Morin of the Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU).
The construction holidays are coinciding with beautiful, warm weather and no rain in most of Quebec for the next four or five days, she explained.
"We're asking people for cooperation, we want them to be careful," Morin said.
The association's recommendations for those venturing out into nature:
- Don't smoke in the forest.
- Don't burn waste.
- Avoid lighting fireworks near wooded areas.
- Use marked trails for ATV rides.
- Use outdoor fireplaces equipped with fire arrestors.
The Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks has banned open fires in or near the forest due to the conditions. The ban comes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. and applies to parts of the regions of Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Mauricie, Capitale-Nationale, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Outaouais, Laurentides, Lanaudière and Chaudière-Appalaches. Information on the exact areas covered by the ban can be found on SOPFEU's website.( http://sopfeu.qc.ca/restrictions/interdiction-de-faire-des-feux-a-ciel-ouvert-en-foret-ou-a-proximite/ )
For several weeks, SOPFEU teams in Canada and the United States have mobilized to control fires caused by lightning in the province. Since the beginning of the season, 427 fires have burned 28,404 hectares of forest. By comparison, the average during the same date over the last decade is 301 fires in ??33,958 hectares.

These Maine Resorts Offer The Best Of Two Worlds; Hidden Pond and Sandy Pines reflect state's 'beauty, charm and sense of community'

Full text: It's summer in Goose Rocks Beach, Maine, and a sojourn is proposed in glorious, pastoral lodging. Designer decor, family ambience, a chance to reconnect with nature - I'm in.
But here's the hard part. Two outstanding establishments, two kilometres apart, fit the description. Their roots are the same, but they're totally different.
Hidden Pond is a luxurious resort village of private cottages with gourmet dining at Earth, restorative treatments at the Tree Spa and two heated swimming pools, one reserved for adults. You are immersed in nature in the most refined and cosseting way imaginable.
At the new Sandy Pines Campground, options range from RV sites to the truly fabulous Glamping Tents. You are immersed in nature, with a sense of light adventure plus resort-style, kidfriendly activities.
"We want to reflect Maine's beauty, charm and sense of community, especially for families," said Tim Harrington, co-developer with Debra Lennon of the two remarkable resorts. "Hidden Pond and Sandy Pines each express those ideas in their own way." Hidden Pond: This top-rated luxury resort flourishes amid luxuriant landscaping and heavy forests. It's so authentic that all the buildings are tucked into thickets of natural foliage and wild rose bushes, there is no asphalt and the lampposts are tree trunks.
Hidden Pond is a first-class getaway cleverly designed to look like a posh summer camp, with elements of both. The wonderful, woodsy resort was conceived so that children could play and roam freely while grown-ups indulge in a cushy, blissed-out vacation.
Outdoors, you can enjoy your suite's open-air showers, lounge on your screened porch or tootle along walking paths. There are bikes and s'mores at the fire pit for families, plus more sophisticated happenings: yoga by the pool, massages at Tree Spa, art classes and garden tours.
Indoors, guests are spoiled with gorgeous country-chic decor and fine hotel amenities like Frette linens. Families favour the 16 cottages, twobedroom hideaways with full kitchens and a kid-friendly pool. Couples are in heaven in the 20 bungalows, which are secluded, romantic, king-sized suites with fireplaces and access to the tranquil, heated, adults-only pool.
Hidden Pond's restaurant Earth brings the outdoors inside, to a spectacular barn with rustic-chic decor, a towering wall of liquor and an open kitchen. Earth serves modern American cuisine, with such comfort-inspired delicacies as lobster pizza and lobster mac 'n'cheese, plus lots more Maine seafood, braised lamb, short ribs, porterhouse steaks, black cod and organic veggies from Hidden Pond's own garden. Sandy Pines: Sandy Pines Campground, one mile from pristine Goose Rocks Beach on the Atlantic Ocean, is home to 300 individual lodgings of all styles: traditional tents, RV sites, plus three distinctive types of glamping: Hideaway Hut A-frames, Camp Carriages on wheels and the truly fabulous safari-style tents. Each cluster of lodging has its own bathhouse, for showers, sinks and loos, so it's a short walk to indoor plumbing.
That's part of all camping, but Sandy Pines is camping with a difference. True, you're in the woods, and but you can spend hot summer days in the heated saltwater pool. And Sandy Pines has a back-to-your-childhood vibe with retro features like the Icicle Tricycle, s'mores at sunset and the Kids'Kamp where youngsters can craft dream catchers or a teepee. Everyone gets together at Thursday movie nights, Saturday night Burger Bashes and Sunday bingo games and ice cream buffet.
I opted for one of 16 ultra-luxe glamping tents and I was wowed. These spacious safari-style tents are equipped with Wi-Fi, remotecontrol lighting, king-size beds, air-conditioning, mini-fridges and outlets for mobile devices. They're as attractively decorated as a deluxe hotel room, with kilim rugs, chandeliers, and antique dressers and desks. Here's an appealing option: Parents can take a full-sized glamping tent and tuck two kids into an adjacent child-size tent. That means privacy for the adults and independence and lots of giggles for the youngsters.
Many campers cook "in," but Sandy Pines'General Store stocks baked goods and graband-go salads and sandwiches. You can also order a lobster dinner - freshly steamed, with all the trimmings. To celebrate the fall equinox, Sandy Pines will present the Great Maine Camp Out, Sept. 22, with an astronomy class, campfire cooking and fireside storytelling. rochelle@rochellelash.com twitter.com/rochellelash

Full text: Just hours after the Kanesatake youth centre burned to the ground Sunday, Grand Chief Serge Simon vowed to rebuild a bigger, better facility in its place.
The fire started sometime after 11 p.m. Sunday. Simon said his wife roused him from bed late that evening in a panic.
"She said 'The youth centre is on fire, the youth centre is on fire!' So I threw on some shorts and ran out the door," said Simon, the grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake.
"I could see the flames from my house. ... When I got within a few hundred feet of the building, I could barely stand the heat."
There is no fire department and there are no fire hydrants on the Mohawk territory, which depends on a volunteer service from Oka and nearby farming communities.
By the time firefighters arrived on the scene, the building was completely ablaze, according to Oka mayor Pascal Quevillon.
"It was an electrical fire, there's no reason to suspect arson," Quevillon told the Montreal Gazette.
Had they found evidence of arson, the Oka fire department would have handed the investigation off to the Sûreté du Québec.
News of the blaze spread quickly over social media Sunday night.
"I really hope this was not deliberately set," wrote Kanesatake resident Cheryl McDonald. "The youth centre was one of the few safe places for the kids to all come together. May this tragedy be the bang that wakes up and unites Kanesatake."
Simon said someone tried to set fire to the youth centre four years ago. There have been high-profile cases of arson on the Mohawk territory in recent years.
Vandals set fire to the abandoned police station in 2015, and someone burned down an administrative building next to the local gym two years prior to that.
When reached for comment early Monday, Simon said he was "99 per cent sure" someone set the youth centre on fire.
Perhaps the most infamous local arson dates back to 2004, when then-Grand Chief James Gabriel brought in 50 outside police officers to seize the local peacekeeper station. Gabriel said he was attempting to root out local corruption and raid local cannabis farms.
In the end, a small but militant resistance formed around the peacekeeper station - trapping Gabriel and the officers inside. During the ensuing standoff, a handful of local men set fire to Gabriel's house.
The Kanesatake youth centre is next to a field that sprawls into the nearby pine forest.
Local kids used the youth centre as a meeting point, a place to hang out, skateboard and play video games. Aside from a federally-funded after school program and the youth centre, there are almost no local activities for Mohawk teenagers.
Funding for the Shakotihenté:se after school program - designed to keep kids from joining gangs - expires in September.
"These kids have so much potential, but if they're not given the chance to go out and learn things and be in a safe space, they won't get very far," said Sandra Harding, who helps run the program.
The building that houses the youth centre is insured, and Simon said the Mohawk council will erect a "bigger, better and more secure" one in its place.
"We're going to look and see if we can get in-kind contributions from the provincial or federal government," Simon said. "We may as well take this as a chance to rebuild something our youth can be proud of."

Full text: The Kanesatake youth centre burned to the ground Sunday in what Grand Chief Serge Simon said is likely a case of arson.
Simon said his wife roused him from bed late that evening in a panic.
"She said 'The youth centre is on fire, the youth centre is on fire!' So I threw on some shorts and ran out the door," said Simon, the grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake.
"I could see the flames from my house. ... When I got within a few hundred feet of the building, I could barely stand the heat."
There is no fire department and there are no fire hydrants on the Mohawk territory, which depends on a volunteer service from neighbouring Oka.
News of the blaze spread quickly over social media Sunday night.
"I really hope this was not deliberately set," wrote Kanesatake resident Cheryl McDonald. "The youth centre was one of the few safe places for the kids to all come together. May this tragedy be the bang that wakes up and unites Kanesatake."
Sources told the Montreal Gazette two all-terrain vehicles were seen in the area around the time of the fire. The youth centre is next to a field that sprawls into the nearby pine forest.
The Sûreté du Québec hasn't opened an investigation into the fire, and the Oka fire department could not immediately be reached for comment.
Simon said someone tried to set fire to the youth centre four years ago, and he's "99 per cent sure" this was a case of arson. There have been several high-profile cases of arson on the Mohawk territory in recent years.
Vandals set fire to the abandoned police station in 2015, and someone burned down an administrative building next to the local gym two years prior to that.
The most infamous local arson dates back to 2004, when then-Grand Chief James Gabriel brought in 50 outside police officers to seize the local peacekeeper station. Gabriel said he was attempting to root out local corruption and raid local cannabis farms.
In the end, a small but militant resistance formed around the peacekeeper station - trapping Gabriel and the officers inside. During the ensuing standoff, a handful of local men set fire to Gabriel's house.
The Kanesatake youth centre is next to a field that sprawls into the nearby pine forest.
In the case of the youth centre, there's no clear evidence yet that an arson has been committed.
However, the building is insured, and Simon said the Mohawk council will erect a "bigger, better and more secure" one in its place.
"We're going to look and see if we can get in-kind contributions from the provincial or federal government," Simon said. "We may as well take this as a chance to rebuild something our youth can be proud of."

Full text: Cottage-goers are able to enjoy campfires over the long weekend as the Quebec Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks has lifted their open-air fire ban for the south of the province.
The ministry said the decision was made to end the ban in the Outaouais, Laurentian, Lanaudière and parts of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue regions after preventative measures and increased rainfall has reduced risks of wildfires.
The ban, which had been in effect since Tuesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bonfire-ban-covers-vast-areas-of-quebec-including-cottage-country ), still covers northern parts of the province, including the Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Mauricie, Abitibi and Vallée-de-l'Or areas.

Full text: Research* has shown the time it takes for a parent's hair to catch fire is directly related to the length of time one's child tells knock-knock jokes in the car. That time is approximately one hour.
Each of these weekend getaways is within a two-hour radius of Montreal. You're on your own for the second hour.
Parc Omega is a safari-style wildlife park that features Canadian animals, mostly from Quebec, like these grey wolves. It is in Montebello. Photo courtesy of Parc Omega
Montebello
"Are you going to Omega?" the Bonichoix cashier asked a tourist who'd picked up five pounds of carrots. When she got an affirmative answer from the tourist - me, that is - she shook her head: "You're going to need more carrots."
We call Parc Omega( http://parcomega.ca/en/ ) the human zoo, because people are caged in their vehicles while the locals wander along the paths, poking their noses in for a quick inspection - and a carrot - before moving on to the next human enclosure. The locals are 15 species of Canadian animals: elk, boar, bison, wolves (those last don't poke their noses into your car, thank heavens) and others.
Most of the animals roam freely and have the option to melt into the forest when they've had enough human contact or if, like the bison, they just can't rouse themselves to care enough. Predators like grey and Arctic wolves, bears and foxes are behind fences. There is a farm a short hay ride away and two playgrounds for children to run off steam after all that time in the car. (399 Route 323 North, Montebello, 819-423-5487, parcomega.ca( http://parcomega.ca/ )
While you're in Montebello, pop in to one of the friendliest tourist info centres in Quebec( https://www.tourismeoutaouais.com/en/services_en/montebello-train-station/ ) for a map and briefing about the town. The centre is in an old train station smack in the middle of the village, so everything you need is within a 15-minute walk. If you're not spending the night at Château Montebello( http://www.fairmont.com/montebello/ ), at least stop by to walk around and through the world's largest log cabin. Then fill up at Snack et Délices Montebello,( https://www.facebook.com/snackdelicesmontebello/ ) which serves fast-food favourites with a twist: everything is made with local ingredients, including exquisite local cheeses.
At the edge of downtown is the Bonichoix grocery store. And whatever you think, you're going to need more carrots.
Visitors can tour the old Capelton Mine in North Hatley. Photo courtesy of Capelton Mine
Coaticook
There are so many things to do in the Coaticook area, you should save it for a long weekend (but if you do, book your room well in advance).
Capelton Mine - a cool choice for a hot day - was struck by prospectors looking for gold who found copper instead. The discovery was made smack in the middle of the U.S. Civil War, when the mineral was highly sought after. It closed in 1907 as other industries made headway in the region and lay dormant till the mid-1990s, when underground tours were organized by an enterprising local family. (5800 Capelton Rd., North Hatley, 888-346-9545, capelton.ca( http://capelton.ca ). Tours begin June 23. $8-$46.)
Afraid of dark, enclosed spaces? Maybe heights are more your thing: Parc de la Gorge on the banks of Coaticook River has the longest suspension footbridge in North America, at 169 metres - that's almost a soccer field and a half. It's among 20 kilometres of trails in the park, which also offers treasure hunts and Foresta Lumina, an after-dark chance to be in the woods when the fairies come out to lead visitors with thousands of lights through the garden of wishes. (135 Michaud St. 888-524-6743, gorgedecoaticook.qc.ca( http://gorgedecoaticook.qc.ca ). $2-$16; reservations are a must for Foresta Lumina.)
Le Salon d'Antan is a unique, old-style gaming parlour where larger games like Hopping Fleas and the Triangle were designed and built by local artisans. The salon attempts to please every game style, from luck to speed to family to skill. (115 Wellington Rd. 819-578-0805, salondantan.com( http://salondantan.com ). $6-$8.)

Prehistoric World features 50 life-size dinosaurs made with reinforced concrete "so it's sturdy enough for children to hug them," according to the owner. Photo by Hayley Juhl
Morrisburg, ON
For an all-day adventure, head to Upper Canada Village, an 1860s immersive experience that's a must-visit, especially for parents of a certain age who loved Little House on the Prairie. (13740 County Road 2, 800-437-2233, uppercanadavillage.com( http://uppercanadavillage.com ). $13-$20, 4 and under free)
Not historic enough for you? We have just the thing.
Prehistoric World is an experience 37 years - give or take a few million - in the making.
The owner greets guests with "Welcome to my backyard" and offers the use of bug spray to people who forgot their own. There are 50 life-size dinosaurs in Serge and Paul Dupuis's backyard. Each was built with reinforced concrete, even though "it's terrible to sculpt with." It took the brothers two years to build the brontosaurus. Although they stopped advertising some time ago, "people keep on coming."
There are picnic spots among the dinosaurs, and the one-kilometre walking trail takes an hour or two, depending on how excited your kids are to come face-to-toe with a T-Rex at last. (5446 Upper Canada Rd., 613-543-2503. Adults $10, children $6. Cash only.)
Very few good adventures happen on the 401, so take Old Highway 2 home. Along the way are chip stands and garage sales, and Cooper Marsh Conservation Area is more than worth your time - it's a great halfway spot for a breather and to look for wildlife like frogs and chipmunks or even a loon. (County Road 2, Summerstown, ON, 613-938-3611, rrca.on.ca( http://rrca.on.ca/page.php?id=7 ). Free, but donations welcome at the interpretation centre.)
The Forges du Saint-Maurice National Historic site is built on the remains of the first iron industry of Canada. Photo courtesy of Parks Canada
Shawinigan
If you spend your days reminding yourself to keep your feet on the ground, it might be time to let loose. Do it with your feet a dozen feet in the air at d'Arbre en Arbre. You are secured with safety ropes for 84 obstacle challenges like "suspended bridges, paths, cargo nets, Tarzan vines and a 106-metre-long zip line." (l'Île Melville Park. 866-536-7155, arbreenarbre.com( http://arbreenarbre.com ). $11.45-$30.45.)
Right across the street is Cité de l'énergie, where the theme is global energy. You can get right into it with 20 interactive stations, plus La Planète Énergie. There's a Hydro-Québec observation tower with a panoramic elevator, and a pontoon crossing, and tons of other activities. Cirque Éloize is there till Aug. 18 with Nezha, l'enfant pirate. (1000 Melville Ave. 866-900-2483, citedelenergie.com( http://citedelenergie.com ). $10-$25 for the science centre and historical tour, more for separate activities.)
My family are suckers for provincial and federal parks, so the Forges du Saint-Maurice is high on our list of must-sees. Built on the bones of the first ironworks in Canada, there's a creepy Fontaine du Diable, which comes with its own ghost story, a 3D multimedia show and many more activities. Parks Canada sites are free for people 17 and under for all of 2018. (10000 boulevard des Forges Blvd., Trois-Rivières, 888-773-8888, pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/qc/saintmaurice( http://pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/qc/saintmaurice ). $3.90.)
Rock of Ages owns and operates several granite quarries in the U.S. and Canada. Photo courtesy of Rock of Ages
Montpelier, Vt.
According to New England Today, Montpelier is the only state capital without a McDonald's. And that's fine, because you didn't come here for that. You probably came for the farmers' market and indie shops. Or maybe you came for all the free stuff, but we'll get to that later, for on your way home.
We have a hundred Rock of Ages puns in a drawer at the office, but we know you're very busy and we don't want to take that for granite.
The quarry offers tours of the spectacular 180-metre-deep Smith Quarry, but also a chance to watch artisans navigate the old and new worlds with diamond-tipped saws and precision grinders used side-by-each with hand tools used "in much the same way as Michelangelo did centuries ago." And how boss is this: there's a granite bowling-lane prototype on their grounds. You play with a rubber bowling ball - it turns out regulation balls eventually break when they're used on a granite lane, which is why the idea never took off. (558 Graniteville Rd., Graniteville, Vt. 866-748-6877, rockofages.com( http://rockofages.com ). Free, but guided tours are US$2.50-$5.)
On your way home from Montpelier, stay off the main highway to sample some of the region's best products. You can spend half a day tasting to determine exactly what you want to bring home( https://travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada ).
Chocolate: Lake Champlain Chocolates store and café. 2653 Waterbury Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center, Vt., 802-241-4150, lakechamplainchocolates.com( http://lakechamplainchocolates.com ). You can detour to their Burlington location for free self-guided and factory tours.
Cheese: Cabot Farmers' Store. 2657 Waterbury-Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center. 802-244-6334, cabotcheese.coop( http://cabotcheese.coop ).
Cider and doughnuts: Cold Hollow Cider Mill. 3600 Waterbury-Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center. 800-3-APPLES (800-327-7537), coldhollow.com( http://coldhollow.com ).
Whiskey and more: Smugglers' Notch Distillery. 276 Main St., Jeffersonville, Vt., 802-309-3077, smugglersnotchdistillery.com( http://smugglersnotchdistillery.com ).
No matter how much planning you do via newspaper stories and scouring the internet, it's in your best interest to call first to make sure the information you have is accurate. Tourist info kiosks are truly your best friend. The staff are always friendly and generally they're local - no one knows their town or region better.
* The research cited above on knock-knock jokes is unscientific and was carried out in the car of a Montreal Gazette staffer. Here's one for the road:
Knock, knock!
Who's there?
Alpaca.
Alpaca who?
Alpaca the suitcase, you load the car!

How to throw a picnic on the fly
From late April till late October, there is a plastic box that lives in the "wayback" of our little SUV. In it is everything we need for a spontaneous picnic - just add food.
Start with a good quality plastic container with a lid that closes tightly. Here are the items we keep in the Picnic Go Box for our family of four. Everything is sturdy and reusable.
Four plates with rims so food is less likely to slip off into the grass.
Four cups.
Three thick plastic mugs for coffee.
Good quality plastic cutlery.
A tablecloth or thin blanket for the grass.
Instant coffee.
Our favourite spices (salt, Montreal steak, lemon pepper, peppercorns).
Napkins.
Small cutting board, knife and vegetable peeler.
Corkscrew.
A small reusable bag for dirty dishes, for easy transportation into the house and back to the car.
You can set up a separate go bag to keep in the fridge with things like condiments and salad dressing that won't keep in the car for months.
Make a Picnic Go Box that can live in your car from spring to fall.

Weekend Getaways Even The Kids Will Enjoy; Outdoor fun not far from Montreal has a mix of wild animals, undergound adventure, a garden of wishes and, of course, some dinosaurs

Full text: Research has shown the time it takes for a parent's hair to catch fire is directly related to the length of time one's child tells knockknock jokes in the car. That time is approximately one hour.
Each of these weekend getaways is within a two-hour radius of Montreal. You're on your own for the second hour.
MONTEBELLO
"Are you going to Omega?" the Bonichoix cashier asked a tourist who'd picked up five pounds of carrots.
When she got an affirmative answer from the tourist - me, that is - she shook her head: "You're going to need more carrots."
We call Parc Omega the human zoo because people are caged in their vehicles while the locals wander along the paths, poking their noses in for a quick inspection - and a carrot - before moving on to the next human enclosure. The locals are 15 species of Canadian animals: elk, boar, bison, wolves (those last don't poke their noses into your car, thank heavens) and others.
Most of the animals roam freely and have the option to melt into the forest when they've had enough human contact or if, like the bison, they just can't rouse themselves to care enough. Predators like grey and Arctic wolves, bears and foxes are behind fences. There is a farm a short hay ride away and two playgrounds for children to run off steam after all that time in the car. (399 Route 323 North, Montebello, 819-423-5487, parcomega.ca.)
While you're in Montebello, pop in to one of the friendliest tourist info centres in Quebec for a map and briefing about the town. The centre is in an old train station smack in the middle of the village, so everything you need is within a 15-minute walk. If you're not spending the night at Château Montebello, at least stop by to walk around and through the world's largest log cabin. Then fill up at Snack et Délices Montebello, which serves fast-food favourites with a twist: everything is made with local ingredients, including exquisite local cheeses.
At the edge of downtown is the Bonichoix grocery store. And whatever you think, you're going to need more carrots.
COATICOOK
There are so many things to do in the Coaticook area, you should save it for a long weekend (but if you do, book your room well in advance).
Capelton Mine - a cool choice for a hot day - was struck by prospectors looking for gold who found copper instead. The discovery was made smack in the middle of the U.S. Civil War, when the mineral was highly sought after. It closed in 1907 as other industries made headway in the region, and it lay dormant till the mid-1990s, when underground tours were organized by an enterprising local family. (5800 Capelton Rd., North Hatley, 888-346-9545, capelton.ca. Tours begin June 23. $8-$46.)
Afraid of dark, enclosed spaces? Maybe heights are more your thing: Parc de la Gorge, on the banks of Coaticook River has the longest suspension footbridge in North America, at 169 metres - that's almost a soccer field and a half. It's among 20 kilometres of trails in the park, which also offers treasure hunts and Foresta Lumina, an after-dark chance to be in the woods when the fairies come out to lead visitors with thousands of lights through the garden of wishes. (135 Michaud St. 888-524-6743, gorgedecoaticook. qc.ca. $2-$16; reservations are a must for Foresta Lumina.)
Le Salon d'Antan is a unique, old-style gaming parlour where larger games like Hopping Fleas and the Triangle were designed and built by local artisans. The salon attempts to please every game style, from luck to speed to family to skill. (115 Wellington Rd. 819-578-0805, salondantan.com. $6-$8.)
MORRISBURG, ON
For an all-day adventure, head to Upper Canada Village, an 1860s immersive experience that's a must-visit, especially for parents of a certain age who loved Little House on the Prairie. (13740 County Road 2, 800-437-2233, uppercanadavillage.com.
$13-$20, ages four and under free.)
Not historic enough for you? We have just the thing.
Prehistoric World is an experience 37 years - give or take a few million - in the making.
The owner greets guests with "Welcome to my backyard" and offers the use of bug spray to people who forgot their own. There are 50 life-size dinosaurs in Serge and Paul Dupuis's backyard. Each was built with reinforced concrete, even though "it's terrible to sculpt with." It took the brothers two years to build the brontosaurus. Although they stopped advertising some time ago, "people keep on coming."
There are picnic spots among the dinosaurs, and the one-kilometre walking trail takes an hour or two, depending on how excited your kids are to come face-to-toe with a T-Rex at last. (5446 Upper Canada Rd., 613-543-2503. Adults $10, children $6. Cash only.)
Very few good adventures happen on the 401, so take Old Highway 2 home. Along the way are chip stands and garage sales, and Cooper Marsh Conservation Area is more than worth your time - it's a great halfway spot for a breather and to look for wildlife like frogs and chipmunks or even a loon. (County Road 2, Summerstown, ON, 613-938-3611, rrca.on.ca. Free, but donations welcome at the interpretation centre.)
SHAWINIGAN
If you spend your days reminding yourself to keep your feet on the ground, it might be time to let loose. Do it with your feet a dozen feet in the air at d'Arbre en Arbre. You are secured with safety ropes for 84 obstacle challenges like "suspended bridges, paths, cargo nets, Tarzan vines and a 106-metre-long zip line." (l'Île Melville Park. 866-536-7155, arbreenarbre. com. $11.45-$30.45.)
Right across the street is Cité de l'énergie, where the theme is global energy. You can get right into it with 20 interactive stations, plus La Planète Énergie. There's a Hydro-Québec observation tower with a panoramic elevator, and a pontoon crossing, and tons of other activities. Cirque Éloize is there till Aug. 18 with Nezha, l'enfant pirate. (1000 Melville Ave. 866-900-2483, citedelenergie.com. $10-$25 for the science centre and historical tour, more for separate activities.)
My family are suckers for provincial and federal parks, so the Forges du Saint-Maurice is high on our list of must-sees. Built on the bones of the first ironworks in Canada, there's a creepy Fontaine du Diable, which comes with its own ghost story, a 3D multimedia show and many more activities. Parks Canada sites are free for people 17 and under for all of 2018. (10000 boulevard des Forges Blvd., Trois-Rivières, 888-773-8888, pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/qc/saintmaurice. $3.90.)
MONTPELIER, VT.
According to New England Today, Montpelier is the only state capital without a McDonald's. And that's fine, because you didn't come here for that. You probably came for the farmers'market and indie shops. Or maybe you came for all the free stuff, but we'll get to that later, for on your way home.
We have a hundred Rock of Ages puns in a drawer at the office, but we know you're very busy and we don't want to take that for granite.
The quarry offers tours of the spectacular 180-metre-deep Smith Quarry, but also a chance to watch artisans navigate the old and new worlds with diamondtipped saws and precision grinders used side-by-each with hand tools used "in much the same way as Michelangelo did centuries ago." And how boss is this: there's a granite bowling-lane prototype on their grounds. You play with a rubber bowling ball - it turns out regulation balls eventually break when they're used on a granite lane, which is why the idea never took off. (558 Graniteville Rd., Graniteville, Vt. 866-748-6877, rockofages.com. Free, but guided tours are US$2.50-$5.)
On your way home from Montpelier, stay off the main highway to sample some of the region's best products. You can spend half a day tasting to determine exactly what you want to bring home.
Chocolate: Lake Champlain Chocolates store and café. (2653 Waterbury Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center, Vt., 802-241-4150, lakechamplainchocolates.com.) You can detour to their Burlington location for free self-guided and factory tours.
Cheese: Cabot Farmers' Store.
(2657 Waterbury-Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center. 802-244-6334, cabotcheese.coop.)
Cider and doughnuts: Cold Hollow Cider Mill. (3600 Waterbury-Stowe Rd., Waterbury Center. 800-3-APPLES (800-327-7537), coldhollow.com.) Whiskey and more: Smugglers'Notch Distillery. (276 Main St., Jeffersonville, Vt., 802-309-3077, smugglersnotchdistillery.com.)
No matter how much planning you do via newspaper stories and scouring the internet, it's in your best interest to call first to make sure the information you have is accurate. Tourist info kiosks are truly your best friend. The staff are always friendly, and generally they're local - no one knows their town or region better. * The research cited above on knockknock jokes is unscientific and was carried out in the car of a Montreal Gazette staffer. Here's one for the road: Knock, knock! Who's there? Alpaca. Alpaca who? Alpaca the suitcase, you load the car! hjuhl@postmedia.com twitter.com/hjuhl
THROWING A PICNIC ON THE FLY
From late April till late October, there is a plastic box that lives in the "wayback" of our little SUV. In it is everything we need for a spontaneous picnic - just add food.
Start with a good quality plastic container with a lid that closes tightly.
Here are the items we keep in the Picnic Go Box for our family of four. Everything is sturdy and reusable.
Four plates with rims so food is less likely to slip off into the grass. Four cups. Three thick plastic mugs for coffee. Good-quality plastic cutlery. A tablecloth or thin blanket for the grass. Instant coffee. Our favourite spices (salt, Montreal steak, lemon pepper, peppercorns). Napkins. Small cutting board, knife and vegetable peeler. Corkscrew. A small reusable bag for dirty dishes, for easy transportation into the house and back to the car.
You can set up a separate go bag to keep in the fridge with things like condiments and salad dressing that won't keep in the car for months.

PETER D. COOK January 12, 1939 May 30, 2018
A fighter to the end, Peter passed peacefully in his sleep on May 30, 2018 at home with his loving wife, Barbara at his side. Predeceased by his father, Gunnard, and mother, Ellen (nee Kelly). Loving father to his two sons, Geoffrey and Brent and his daughter, Tara (Darin). Cherished Grandpa and Tickle-Monster of Madison, Emily, Samantha and Zoe.
Peter was born in Winnipeg in 1939 and lived in Montreal and Toronto for the majority of his adult life. He obtained his BSc at the University of Manitoba and then became a certified Chartered Accountant while working at KPMG. After an exciting career with Air Canada and other large corporations, Peter freed the entrepreneur from within and founded several small businesses, including the "Raquetterie" and "Montreal Homeowners Association" in Montreal and, most notably, "Seniors for Seniors" in 1985 and "Seniors for Business" after moving to Toronto. Peter lectured and taught at various colleges and universities, including McGill, U of T and Centennial College and was a published author on the subject of entrepreneurship, "Start Your Own Business, the Canadian Entrepreneurs Guide". He also made many TV, Radio and print media appearances on a variety of business topics and social issues.
He appeared before the Senate of Canada in 2012 to bring the many difficulties experienced by far too many senior citizens in Canada to national attention and was presented the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal for community service for his efforts.
Possessing an unrivalled dry wit and work ethic, Peter loved life and had a tremendous sense of adventure. He and Barbara enjoyed many "once in a lifetime trips" which included Africa, Costa Rica, India, Thailand and China among many others. Peter was a member of the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club for close to 40 years where he played tennis and squash. He also played Golf at the Thornhill Golf and Country Club, a sport he picked up in his 50's and, like most things, became quite good at it. He cherished all of his friends from childhood onwards.
We have lost a true original.
Please raise a glass of Scotch in his memory. J&B will be fine.
A celebration of his life will be held at a later date.
TIMOTHY COUGHLAN January 14, 1926 June 7, 2018
Father Tim was born and raised in the village of Hastings beside the Trent River and was ordained as a priest at The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains, Peterborough on May 19, 1951. Then, at the age of 25, Fr. Tim began his service as a parish priest at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Bracebridge, and in his vocation, served in many parishes in the Peterborough diocese.
He played a significant role in the formation of faith of many children and youth in the Catholic school system. He was a loved priest and pastor by the many congregations that he served, and his quick wit and sense of humour were enjoyed by all. He was appointed parish priest of St.
Michael's, Cobourg in 1970. In 1972, he was granted a year's sabbatical and he joined his friends Christine and David Stewart, who were working as volunteers at an orphans' village in Honduras.
Shortly after their return to Cobourg in 1973, Tim, Christine and David founded the Help Honduras Foundation. It was later renamed Horizons of Friendship after programs had expanded to neighboring countries.
Visitation at the Cathedral of St. Peter-In-Chains from 5-8 p.m. on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Prayers for the Office of the Dead at 7 p.m. on Sunday. Celebration of life Mass will be held at the Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains, 411 Reid St, Peterborough on Monday, June 11, 2018 at 11 a.m.

BRUCE COULTER 1927 - 2018
Bruce Coulter, 90 of Lennoxville Quebec, passed June 5, 2018.
Born November 19, 1927 in Toronto, Ontario to Ernest and Ruby Coulter. Beloved husband to Joyce (Brown) who has been by his side since they were married 64 years ago. Survived by his four children Susan (Bob), Butch (Vessela), Doug (Charlotte), and John (Natalie). Remembered as a loving grandfather by David, Erin (Kris), Quincy, Casey, Evan, Gordon, Amber, Nora, and greatgrandfather to Everly.
Bruce was an amazing man who lived a charmed life that touched many. He was a gentleman, accomplished athlete, teacher, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and mentor to thousands of students. His most important accomplishments include: two-way player for the Montreal Alouettes (1948-57), head Coach of McGill University's football team (1958-61), Bishop's University's head football coach and athletics director (1962-1990), and inductee into the CFL hall of Fame with the class of 1997.
His Coaching record at Bishop's speaks for itself standing at 13780-2, CIAUs most successful coach upon retirement. Apart from the accolades, it was his commitment to his family, players, students and university life that exemplifies his legacy.
In 1991 the Bishop's University football stadium was renamed Coulter field in his honour and in 1995 the Vanier Cup established an award in his name to be given to the most outstanding defensive/ offensive player. Lover of music, especially blues, an accomplished ornithologist, and pretty good dancer, all will have their own unique memory of Bruce; however, his greatest legacy will be his commitment to his family and friends. A hero, icon, and legend he will be deeply missed and always remembered.
In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be given to the Coulter Fund (in support of Bishop's Gaiters athletics) - Bishop's University, 2600 College St., Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, J1M 1Z7 or the MAB-Mackay Rehabilitation Centre (www.mabmackay.ca) would be appreciated. A celebration of Bruce's life will be held at Bishop's University on Friday, August 24, more details will follow.
DOROTHY PHILIPPA DALY
Dorothy Philippa Daly, RN, (born September 28, 1944) died unexpectedly on Thursday, May 31, 2018. She was predeceased by her parents, Prof. Philip B.

MAXIME VOISARD DUCHARME
It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Maxime Voisard Ducharme ("Popa Max"), who peacefully passed away at home on June 3, 2018, at 87 years of age. Max was a beloved father to his two children, Jason Ducharme and Roxane Graham; proud grandfather of Darcy, Gavin, Rachael, Michael and Sarah; and great-grandfather to Venice and Vienna.
Max was born in Sudbury in 1931 and moved to Toronto to pursue his love of design. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art in 1958, earning an Eaton design scholarship. He joined Phillips Electronics in 1959 and quickly assumed the role of Chief of Design. In 1960 Max designed the "Bean Radio" which was a commercial success, it won international awards, and was one of the last Canadian-designed and manufactured transistor radios.
It is difficult to describe the type of man that Max was - he was one of a kind. He was someone to count on, and he showed us all how to love, laugh, innovate, be entrepreneurial, survive in the woods, and never conform to popular wisdoms. He would lecture anyone who'd listen about design, while at the same time teaching about love and respect. He was an accomplished musician; playing the piano, guitar, autoharp, clarinet, tambourine, harmonica, kazoo and vocals - often all at the same time. He had many lifelong friends. He was truly an example of how to live life to its fullest.
In accordance with Max's wishes, a private family interment will take place in Sudbury at a later date. Max will be lovingly remembered and deeply missed.
We love you Max.

EMMI HARBECKE
Grief is just love that doesn't know where to go. On June 3, 2018 the best "NANA" ever to Jessica, Joshua, Skylar, Jacob, and Brooklyn passed away peacefully.
She is survived by her loving husband of 61 years, Lothar (Lou) Harbecke; her daughters, Diane Harbecke-Rushton and Connie Kennedy; and her son-in-law, Jeff Rushton (who was more like a son to her); and predeceased by her four sisters. She is also survived by relatives in Germany.
Emmi met Lothar, the love of her life, at the local swim club in Germany. After they married they took their long journey across the sea, by boat, to Canada ultimately settling in Woodstock, Ontario.
Emmi loved spending time with her family and her many close friends. We will remember her for her ability to be our weather network. She would always call us to warn us about the coming weather. She cared about those she loved worrying for the entire family even if there was nothing to worry about.
Her number one passion was seeing her grandchildren.
FaceTiming with them, following them on Facebook.cooking or baking their favourites (dumplings.sauerbraten.
bundt cake.butter creme torte.just to name a few cooking highlights). She enjoyed her many summers at Wakomata Lake where she cottaged for over 35 years. Emmi was always dressed for a magazine cover no matter where she was going or who she was visiting.
A time to celebrate Emmi's life will take place at South Gate Centre in Woodstock at a later date to be announced. Cremation has taken place. Interment will take place at the Hillview Cemetery Columbarium.
As an expression to celebrate Emmi's life, a donation to Coast to Coast Against Cancer (www.ctcacf.org) would be her chosen charity. All proceeds going to children with cancer, a foundation she truly loved and supported. Donation may also be arranged through the Brock and Visser Funeral Home, Woodstock, ON, 519-5390004. Personal condolences at www.brockandvisser.com.

VIVIAN JANES (Nee Hassa l l ) July 24, 1924 May 31, 2018
Peacefully, at Bridgepoint Hospital in Toronto, following complications during her enthusiastic and determined rehabilitation from a fall in early April.
Vivian was married for 61 years to Hugh, the love of her life, who passed away in 2007. Together they enjoyed a well-travelled life as he followed his Royal Canadian Air Force career, living for many years in Ottawa but also Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire, UK, Winnipeg and North Bay, later retiring to their cottage on Lake Waseosa near Huntsville.
A much loved mom and Nana, she will be greatly missed by sons, Douglas and Robert; grandchildren, Daniela (Matt), Matthew (Yara), Andrea (Rob), and Adam (Kristen); greatgrandchildren, Ella, William, Adam, and Alice; sister, Carol (Doug); numerous nieces and nephews; and many friends.
She was predeceased by sisters, Mildred and Joan; daughters-inlaw, Ineke and Judith; and greatgranddaughter, Elyssa.
A kind, humorous, and capable woman, Viv was always brimming with style and grace. She was equally confident enjoying the moment whether hosting an event at the Officers' Mess or a dinner party, supervising staff at the Federal Taxation Centre, teaching grandchildren to cook, swim or drive, walking the beaches of Florida, Portugal or Cuba or the streets of Vienna (her favourite city in Europe), or finding the perfect gift. She approached all things in life with openness and joy.
The family would like to thank the staff at the Amica Balmoral retirement residence where she lived for the past four years and continued to share her zest for life. We wish to extend a special thank you to Vivian's physicians at St. Michael's Hospital, Dr. William Sullivan and Dr. Beth Abramson, for their exceptional and compassionate care.
A Celebration of Life will be held at the Humphrey Funeral Home A.W. Miles - Newbigging Chapel, 1403 Bayview Avenue (south of Davisville Avenue) on Friday, June 15th, at 11:00 a.m. At Vivian's request, bright colours are encouraged.

MICHAEL ARTHUR JORDAN August 1951 - May 2018
With profound sadness, we share the passing of Michael Arthur Jordan on May 3, 2018 in Vancouver. Michael was a devoted family man, loyal friend, outdoor enthusiast, and dedicated environmental engineer. Known for his personable nature, sharp intellect, and unique sense of humour, he was a genuine character who tackled everything in life with drive and determination. He was an avid commuting cyclist, a keen outrigger and marathon canoeist, and a skilled home renovator.
Michael held a special spot in his heart for BC's Peace River country where he was raised. After graduating from the University of British Columbia with a BSc in Bio-Resource Engineering, he made Vancouver his home and worked with BC Hydro and the Greater Vancouver Regional District before joining the forest industry. In his 29 years with Canfor, Michael's efforts had wide reaching impacts. From developing and implementing Environment Management Systems for Canfor's sawmills to his extensive work with provincial and federal governments to develop effective, yet practical, environmental and energy policies and regulations, Michael's presence made a positive difference. Michael was a trusted mentor to people within Canfor, industry, and government, sharing his knowledge with many over the years.
He will be forever missed by his wife, Ann; children, Robbie and Rennie; parents, Bob and Bunty; brothers, Peter and Paul (Anna); extended family, many friends, and colleagues. We are grateful to those at the BC Cancer Agency and Vancouver General Hospital for their exceptional care. If desired, memorial donations may be made to the BC Cancer Foundation.

Peacefully, with his family by his side, on Wednesday, June 6, 2018, at Chartwell Brant Centre Long Term Residence, Burlington, at the age of 79. Beloved husband of Beverley for 58 years. Cherished father of Tobin (Anne) and Laurie (John Pierre Taraso). Adored grandfather of Meghan, Iain, Scott, Courtney (Benoit), Dylan, Ashley, Heather, Laura and great-grandfather of Samuel.
Kerry was born in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, and he started his lengthy career in newspapers as a sports reporter at the Northern Daily News in the community.
Stops would be made at several other newspapers as he eventually climbed the ranks to executive vice-president and chief operating officer (North America) of Thomson Newspapers Corp.
A long-time passion of Kerry was painting and after being sidetracked by the newspaper business for 35 years, he retired and started his own studio, largely focusing on landscapes from Ontario's Northland.
While the newspaper business had brought Kerry to the Toronto area, his heart had remained firmly tied to the North. He visited the Temagami area annually and called the region "almost never pretty but always beautiful."
He painted at his Mississauga-based art studio for 20 years and his work is hanging in homes and businesses in Canada and other countries, including the U.S. and Australia.
Kerry valued time with his family as it brought him lots of joy and entertainment. He was regularly seen at hockey rinks, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, dance recitals and music concerts.

GLEN ALEXANDER PATTERSON September 23, 1921 May 15, 2018
Glen Alexander Patterson, 96, died May 15th with family at his side. He is survived by his sister, Jean Edwards, of Toronto; son, Dennis, (Evelyn) Bruce, George, Jessica and Alexander; son Bruce, (Ilse) Kate, Rose, Lena; and daughter, Sheila, (Brian) Lewis, Isobel, Sally; and 5 great-grandchildren.
His was a life well lived.
He was born in Calgary to a musical and gardening family. It was on a boys band trip to play at the Haywood Bandstand in the West End that Glen first laid eyes on Vancouver. It was love at first sight, and his passion for it never diminished. He graduated in Commerce from U of A and then served with the Royal Canadian Air Force training pilots in the Commonwealth Air Training Plan.
After the war, he and his high school sweetheart, Isobel Farr, eloped to Vancouver. When Glen got a job in the Kananaskis, lodging was scarce so they took over an abandoned prospector's cabin and while Glen cruised timber, Isobel fended off the bears. What bliss! Back to Vancouver, Isobel worked to support Glen when he took a second degree in Forestry graduating from UBC in 1947. Jobs were scarce then and they were thrilled when Glen was hired by Canadian Forest Products in the Nimpkish Valley on Vancouver Island as a fire warden and later as a forester.
Living in isolation in remote Woss Camp, they raised 3 children.
Home was an un-insulated, wood stove heated bunkhouse, sensibly sited on gravel.
Ever the gardener, Glen packed swamp soil on his back to establish a garden that was their pride and joy. His work talents were recognized and he was promoted to management at Grande Prairie, Alberta and in the last years of his career to his beloved Vancouver as VP Canfor.
His retirement was not retiring.
He threw himself at exotic travel often in the pursuit of rare plants.
He created two outstanding gardens, one at Pilot House Rd.
in West Vancouver and his piece de resistance in Coal Harbour, a celebrated rooftop garden that defied gardening norms. Glen had a zeal for life and his enthusiasm was unmeasured. If you asked after Glen, his reply would invariably be "Never better".
Among his many passions; nature, travel, rare plants, the mountains, politics, the Internet, photography, fitness, investing, conifers, his Iphone, pussycats, collecting Indigenous West Coast Art, and his grandchildren. He adored his final home at Tapestry, UBC. He is remembered for his courage and his steadfast commitment to his independence (how about 5 times per week personal training sessions until right before his death!).
His curiosity and intellect were prodigious and his many informed opinions were staunchly defended. He was serially social, though his black cloud was the tragic loss of Isobel in 1971.
Our Dad, Brother, Grandpa, GreatGrandpa, Father-in-law, Friend, Go well to the Great Beyond.
DEANNA ELIZABETH PERSCHBACHER (nee Wood) October 17, 1940 - June 6, 2018
Deanna, of Mississauga, born in Stratford, Ontario, passed away peacefully with her family by her side. Loving wife of Marvin for 55 years. Devoted mother to Kristina and Susanne and son-in-law, Mark. Cherished grandmother to Joakim, Xavier, Anya, and Daphne. Survived by brother, Doug; and predeceased by sister, Gloria; and brother, Gordon.
Deanna graduated from the University of Guelph with her Honours degree in Home Economics. Later, she pursued continued studies at the University of Toronto Mississauga to teach French. She was a dedicated and enthusiastic teacher who inspired students with creative and imaginative programming.
Four years teaching at the Canadian Airforce Base in Zweibrucken, Germany with Marvin fostered innumerable travel adventures and longterm friendships. During her retirement she travelled extensively with Marvin and pursued many interests including bridge, golf, art and gardening. She will be missed by the many friends with whom she shared these passions.
Deanna was an inspiration. As a mother and grandmother she was committed to creating fun, enrichment and tradition. She was a gracious and welcoming presence to everyone she met and loved entertaining friends and family. She added beauty and balance with her personal touch.
We will miss her strength and grace.

PHYLLIS IRENE PHELAN (nee Britten) January 22, 1922, Toronto June 3, 2018, Vancouver
It is with great sadness we announce the passing of our mother, Phyllis Phelan, at the age of 96. She was a warm, smart, loving, and entirely selfless woman. She came of age during World War II and married Claude (d. 2005), an exploration mining engineer. They travelled the world together, expanding their horizons, living in Western Canada, the U.S., the West Indies, South America, North Africa, Ethiopia and Switzerland.
She was adventurous, refined and glamorous but always guided by her strong personal priorities of kindness and respect for others.
Regardless of where she lived she bravely stood up for the underdog by volunteering in the community, from founding a school in Cochabamba, Bolivia to distributing food from the tarmac in Addis Abba, Ethiopia.
Phyllis loved reading, crossword puzzles and history. With no time for pretense or ego, Phyllis could be counted on to give expert, practical advice in any situation (often with humour, and whether solicited or not). She was insightful, kind and accepting of others from all walks of life and made special connections with doctors, nurses, and caregivers in her later years.
Mummy was a role model to all of us left behind and will be so missed by her three daughters, who hope to become an extension of her grace and generosity: Nancy (Jim Shea), Deborah (Charles Stoody) and Kerry (Louis O'Dea); her grandchildren, James, Kelley (d. 2015) and Connor Shea, Kathleen (Mike Wylie), Marianne and Alison Stoody (Fajer Abu Zayed), Ellen, Ciara, Molly and James O'Dea; and three greatgranddaughters, Madeline, Amelia, and Summer. She is also survived by sister, Lorraine Potter, Toronto; and sister-in-law, Patricia Rudd, Toronto.
Despite the painful loss she leaves in her wake precious memories of a life well lived and her rich legacy will endure. She taught us all how to live and even how to die.
We are grateful for the care, love and support from the Kiwanis Manor staff and residents. Her passing was gratefully supervised with comfort and care by Dr.
Sugar and the Home Care Nurses of West Vancouver.
A private memorial will be held for family.

DIANA FRANCIS MARY WATSON October 25, 1931 May 25, 2018
Diana Francis Mary (Foote) Watson, 86, passed away suddenly at her home, surrounded by the garden and woods she loved, on May 25, 2018.
Mary was born in Markham, Ontario, to Ann (Bradley) and Samuel Foote, and grew up along the banks of the Don River. An active girl who loved exploring the outdoors, she often returned home with twigs and leaves tangled in her curls to the chagrin of her mother, who was trying to raise a lady. Mary became an accomplished artist, skilled at drawing and painting. Her images of flowers, woodlands and animals were beautifully rendered in water-colour, pastels and pencil. She later earned two degrees in Art and Art History from York University.
During her years working at Connaught labs in Toronto, and later through personal studies of her favourite hummingbird moths and ornithology, she always pushed her intellectual and artistic boundaries.
Mary and Ted Watson married in 1957 in Penetanguishene. The couple embarked on life travelling aboard their boat named "The Seven Bones" through the Trent Severn waterways and Georgian Bay. Following the birth of their sons, they decided to settle in King Township, on the property that became known as "Hemlock Hill." This was the home where Mary raised her sons, established extensive perennial gardens, entertained, and became a dear friend to many who surrounded her. She was truly a lady.
She will be greatly missed by her sister, Joyce (Foote) Fearnside; her sons, James (Marilyn) Watson and Ian (Michelle) Watson; her grandchildren, Bethany, Laura, Jordan, Samantha, Max, and Simone; her nieces, Susan Scholefield (Fearnside), Beth Hayes (Fearnside), and Melanie Foote; and her longtime friend and neighbour, Elaine. Mary was predeceased by her brother, Samuel Beverly Foote; husband, George Edward (Ted) Watson; and nephew, Mark Foote.
A gathering to celebrate Mary's life will be held on Sunday, June 10th, from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. at her home. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson Canada would be greatly appreciated.
CHRISTOPHER G. C. WILSON
Died May 28, 2018 at Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, NY after a short illness. He was born in Ottawa in 1949 and grew up in Montreal and Ottawa. He attended Glendon College and Ryerson University where he graduated with a degree in Photographic Arts majoring in Film. He was a man of dedication and compassion who used his creative talents and communication skills for the betterment of the ill and disadvantaged. At a young age, he led a battle between low income tenants and their landlord which led to the formation of one of the first non-profit housing co-ops in Toronto. He went on to produce award-winning documentaries and worked as an Assistant Director for TV and feature films. He returned to the issue of affordable housing as a co-op housing developer, and then headed the drive to create the Toronto Islands Residential Trust, becoming its first Manager.
He led national government relations campaigns for the Cooperative Housing Federation of Canada. His advocacy firm Civica Inc. served many health charities and co-operatives. He was a member of the multistakeholder committee whose groundbreaking achievement was the creation of Canada's Air Quality Management System. Christopher was a humanitarian who gave voluntary time to Project Life War Orphans Program and to the Global Nuclear Awareness Program. In his professional and humanitarian work, he had the knack for persuading those with opposing views to find what they had in common. He was a humble and caring friend within his family and community.
He was predeceased by his parents, W.A. and Marion Wilson of Ottawa. He is survived by his wife, Deborah Wilson; son, Samuel; sisters, Diana, Alexandra (Paul-Andre Baril), Frederica; brother, Mark; Deborah's mother, Mary Wolfe; her sisters, Ruth and Naomi; brother, Lewis; as well as nine nieces and nephews.

Full text: Quebec's ministry of forests, wildlife and parks has issued a ban on open-air fires( http://sopfeu.qc.ca/restrictions/interdiction-de-faire-des-feux-a-ciel-ouvert-en-foret-ou-a-proximite/ ) in or near the province's woodlands effective 8 a.m. May 17.
The directive is based on prevailing weather conditions and is in effect until further notice.
The ban is aimed specifically at heavily wooded regions, including Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the Outaouais and the Laurentiens, but also extends to Laval and Montreal and the Montérégie.
The ministry notes that as of Wednesday afternoon, there were four forest fires burning in Quebec and that 94 have been recorded since the start of the year.
The average number of fires recorded as of this date over the past 10 years is 125.

Environmental groups to push agenda during Quebec election campaign

Author: Scott, Marian

Full text: A coalition of 11 leading environmental organizations vowed Sunday to hold politicians' feet to the fire during the Quebec election campaign on issues from climate change to protection of forests, agricultural land and waterways.
"It's the first time we've done this collectively," said Steven Guilbeault, co-founder of the environmental organization Équiterre.
"By working together, we've covered a wide array of issues," Guilbeault said in an interview after a press conference by the coalition, which also includes the David Suzuki Foundation, WWF-Canada, Vivre en Ville, Greenpeace Canada, Nature Québec, SNAP Que?bec, Vélo Québec, Trajectoire, the Regroupement national des conseils régionaux de l'environnement du Québec and the Regroupement Vigilance Hydrocarbures Québec.
The coalition will press all parties in the Oct. 1 election to set bold environmental targets in the coming months. Its campaign( https://www.vireauvert.org/nos23demandes ), titled "Vire au vert" (Go green), consists of 23 demands. They include:
Prohibit increases in fossil fuel production
Promote energy-efficient buildings and use of electric vehicles
Implement a stormwater management policy and flood-prevention plans
Reduce GHG emissions in transportation by 50 per cent by 2030
Adopt a moratorium on rezoning agricultural land
Promote active and collective transportation
Tax sales of high fuel-consumption vehicles
Reduce pesticide use and encourage organic farming
Increase marine-protected areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and protect biodiversity and endangered species
Preserve mature forests
Guilbeault said 250,000 Quebecers support environmental groups and their votes could make a difference in some 23 ridings across the province.
The environmental crisis - from extreme weather events to the destruction of natural environments and loss of species - makes it urgent to act, he said.
"The situation is getting worse, not better. We need to act more decisively than we have before," he said.
Studies show that politicians usually respect about 70 to 75 per cent of the promises they make, so it's important to get candidates to commit to sustainable policies, he said.
The movement is non-partisan and does not support any particular parties or candidates, he said.

Try Some Authentic Huron Hospitality

Author: Lash, Rochelle

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/try-some-authentic-huron-hospitality/docview/2034959548/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: "Our philosophy is to share the best of what we have," says Konrad Sioui, Great Chief of the Huron-Wendat Nation, a community that operates an outstanding tourism domain and has also inspired independent ventures.
Here is a peek at two getaways: Hébergement aux Cinq Sens is a rustic yurt camp where lovers of the outdoors can enjoy basic First Nations experiences. It's set in the splendid Mégantic region of the Eastern Townships, which is rich in lakes, mountains and forests.
In contrast, the outstanding Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations is a chic fusion of contemporary design and cuisine with sophisticated installations that represent Aboriginal culture and history. It's in Wendake, 17 kilometres north of Quebec City. Rustic adventure: Paule Rochette is a Huron-Wendat woman who wants to share her First Nations culture in a wild and natural setting.
She operates Hébergement aux Cinq Sens (Lodging of the Five Senses), a cluster of yurts on the outskirts of Piopolis, a village near Lac Mégantic in the far reaches of the Eastern Townships.
The property is a place for relaxing and getting in touch with the earth, water and sky. Especially the sky. Cinq Sens is situated along the Summit Drive of the International Dark Sky Reserve, a tourist route with high-elevation lookouts and astronomy vantage points far from the lights of the city.
Set among maples and pines, Cinq Sens has hammocks strung up beside a stream, campfires flickering at night and a wellness area that incorporates an outdoor hot tub and an infrared sauna. The site has its own walking trails, and guests can enjoy the beach on Lac Mégantic one kilometre away.
Rochette has placed different objects in each yurt to fire up the five senses: a Star Wheel for sky-gazing (seeing), native tea (taste), essential oils for massage (touch), burning sage or scented candles (smell) and musical instruments (hearing).
This year she has added activities steeped in Aboriginal lore such as guided hikes to discover flora and a sojourn in sweat lodge, for cleansing both the body and spirit. On some evenings, a local animator chats about astronomy, drumming or native legends.
Cinq Sens offers a continental breakfast ($7.50, or free if you are on a package) that you can prepare in your own yurt. It's usually a ready-to-cook pancake mix with local organic maple syrup, fruit and coffee. And for lunch and dinner, you can cook in or walk to the Auberge au Soleil Levant in Piopolis.
Off-site, guests at Cinq Sens have 10-per-cent discounts for horseback riding at Centre Équestre le Vent du Sud and also at the top-drawer astronomy centre, Astrolab du parc national du Mont-Mégantic, Posh digs: The Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations in Wendake is a resort that celebrates Huron traditions in design, cuisine and culture with sophisticated, contemporary style.
The deluxe 55-room hotel is at the centre of a Huron territory that reflects tourism then and now. The guest rooms have sleek and modern lines, as well as today's trappings such as flat-screen TVs and soaking bathtubs, but they're also cleverly decorated with fur skins, log furniture and First Nations artifacts. The newest amenities are an indoor pool and a fitness centre.
La Traite, a gourmet restaurant, serves breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner dishes that incorporate local and Indigenous ingredients. Some of the don't-miss dishes are wild mushrooms with bannock croutons, stuffed pheasant, duck tartare, trout with Labrador tea froth, smoked black cod in a balsam fir nest, braised lamb and rack of venison in birch syrup.
Wendake's Aboriginal attractions include the fascinating Musée Huron-Wendat Museum of artifacts; a long house that is a replica of the dwelling that First Nations used for 1,000 years (you can sleep overnight here, if you want to); and a shop selling crafts made of beads, feathers and stone. You also can join several events, including the annual Wendake Pow-Wow, this year on June 29-July 1.
The Nations Spa also blends old and new, with Nordic baths linked by heated sidewalks and massage therapy.

Full text: In a broad sense, glamping has simply come to represent an experience with nature that doesn't mean sacrificing comfort. But to find out whether your experience qualifies, you can ask yourself some specific questions. Is there a chandelier hanging in your tent? You're probably glamping. Do you have a butler who brings s'mores containing single-origin chocolate to your glass-ceiling geodesic dome? Definitely glamping. Have you woken up in a panic because everything around you is mysteriously damp, you seem to have an aggressively friendly bug in your sleeping bag, and there's an alarming howling that, oh my god, is it getting closer? Probably regular old camping.
And who wants that?
Glamping now encompasses a range of options, from supreme luxury to rustic charm. Some purveyors offer down-filled duvets, on-site organic farms, plunge pools, crystal stemware and guided stargazing or wildlife-spotting excursions. Accommodation categories include pods, ice hotels, barns, farmhouses, cabins, wilderness lodges, Airstreams and more. As a testament to how strong the trend is, the first Global Glamping Summit was held in Colorado this month.
It's a trend that is especially popular with families, says John Romfo, chief operating officer of Glamping.com. "Kids love to sing and roast marshmallows and the parents love that they're having a glass of wine with a butler to prepare everything." It also suits millennials who are perennially in search of more immersive, experiential, atypical and highly documentable travel. "What's cooler than a picture of you soaking in your woodfired cedar hot tub high in a treehouse?" he asks.
Even conventional hotels are getting into the glamping action, developing one-of-akind outdoor accommodation experiences that help them stand out, says Ruben Martinez, co-founder of GlampingHub.com. The Four Seasons Beverly Wiltshire (fourseasons.com/beverlywilshire), for example, offers "A night with the stars" in a pristine rooftop tent decked out with a queen-size bed, antique furniture and fur rugs.
Ready to pack up the champagne and try glamping for yourself? Here is a small sampling of options.
TENTS
In New York, the new Collective Governors Island promises luxury tents, culinary classes, wellness sessions and morning yoga in a parklike, car-free environment just a short ferry ride from Manhattan.
Rates start at US$150 a night. collectiveretreats.com In Maine, Sandy Pines Camping offers new 430-square-feet "glamp tents" with air conditioning and fire pits, as well as smaller tents with twin beds for the kids. Each tent comes with a theme, such as "Nautical Nights" or "Boho Luxury Nest," and the campground has a saltwater pool and hosts lobster dinners. Rates start at US$174 a night. Kennebunkport, Me.; sandypinescamping.com
ECO-POD
If you believe the best thing about nature is Old World grape production, then Les Bulles de Bordeaux might be the perfect fit. Near the vineyards of Saint Emilion, and between pine and oak forests, these mostly clear eco-pods offer en-suite Jacuzzis and a distinctively Frenchcountry style. Rates start at 195 ($304) a night. Salleboeuf; lesbullesdebordeaux.fr
YURTS
An idyllic hideaway on Vancouver Island founded by First Nations people, Wya Point offers camping grounds, a lodge and oceanfront yurts. In-between whale watching and surfing lessons, guests can retire to well-appointed accommodations complete with wraparound cedar decks and spectacular views.
Rates start at $115 a night. Ucluelet, B.C.; wyapoint.com In southern Utah, Escalante offers a series of large but cozy yurts (some loft-style), some of which include full kitchens, flat-screen televisions and spacious bathrooms. Nestled in 20 acres of private property, the yurts offer an excellent springboard to explore the desert, with hiking and horseback riding just beyond the front door. Rates start at US$245 a night. Escalante, Utah; escalanteyurts.com HOBBIT HUT In the Eastern Townships of Quebec, just an hour from Montreal, Entre Cimes et Racimes added a "hobbit hut" to its roster of 11 eco-lodges. "Le Hobbit," inspired by the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, has a green roof, wood-burning stove and access to whimsical activities such as mushroom foraging and maze solving.
Rates start at $150 a night. Bolton-Est, Que; entrecimesetracines.com
DOMES
The adults-only Ridgeback Lodge in New Brunswick offers fully equipped "stargazer domes" that include a queen-size bed, sitting area and private deck - with the option to add a wood-fired hot tub perfect for soaking in the middle of the forest. Rates start at $175 a night. Kingston, N.B.; ridgebacklodge.com Borealis Basecamp promises an aurora-viewing dome in the middle of an off-the-grid Alaskan Boreal forest. Visitors can lie in bed under the covers and watch through a glass roof as the Northern Lights leap across the sky. A separate large yurt is used for communal dining and passing the time with board games. Rates start at US$389 a night. Fairbanks; borealisbasecamp.net
TREE HOUSES
A new offering in the heart of Ontario's Upper Migratory Bird Sanctuary, the Robin's Roost Treehouse is a singular opportunity to commune with winged creatures. In addition to a large deck with space for al fresco dining, this rustic tree house can sleep six people and includes a private beach, canoe, outdoor shower, birding book and binoculars. Rates start at $301 a night. Morrisburg, Ont.; stlawrenceparks.com/bird-sanctuary If you're less into birding and more into sun salutations and smallbatch mezcal, try the stylish but minimalist tree houses at Acre Baja in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico. Treehouses are constructed with tree branches and decorated by local artisan goods, and the surrounding property includes a pool, organic gardens and a menagerie of animals (including a donkey named "Burrito.") Rates start at US$275 a night. San José del Cabo; acrebaja.com

Full text: KiNipi Spa Nordique & Hébergement, on the outskirts of Trois-Rivières, is inviting you to spend a few days, not simply a few hours.
The attractive Scandinavianstyle getaway has evolved into a mini-resort of wellness with the opening of 24 deluxe suites, in addition to its indoor-outdoor spa, gourmet bistro and conference rooms designed for blissedout meetings.
The main building is a striking example of rustic-contemporary architecture, with a soaring cathedral ceiling, stairways of glass and walls of stone and timber. The wow factor here is the splendid setting in the rugged area of Mauricie. The property is surrounded by the region's famous forests of towering pines and firs, so serenity rules, both at the spa and in the spanking new guest suites. KiNipi has comfort, nature and beauty all around.
Trois-Rivières, halfway between Montreal and Quebec City, and seven kilometres from KiNipi, is a worthy destination on its own or a great stopover if you're driving to the capital.
Founded in 1634, Trois-Rivières is the province's second oldest city, with history reflected through the Musée québécois de culture populaire and the Old Prison, which offers tours guided by a former inmate. There also is a scenic bustle of summer activity along the Parc Portuaire, a promenade overlooking the St. Lawrence River that includes views of ocean-going ships, leisure sailboats and working tugs.
Lodging: KiNipi's new suites are minimalist, modern and equipped with the best. The attractive contemporary decor has a nature motif, with glass balconies looking out onto the forest, and lots of ultra-modern lighting. The kitchens sport stainless steel appliances, pod coffee makers and juicers, and the sharp bathrooms cosy up with heated towel racks.
The living room is all about open space and air, and the bedroom has a glass wall so you can gaze at the trees and sky. Spa life: KiNipi is an Algonquin word loosely meaning "your water," so the spa experience features hot whirlpools, cold basins and therapeutic soaks under waterfalls, all connected by heated stone pathways. You can tiptoe around fire pits and lounge on a deck with hammocks.
From there, spa-goers head indoors to the eucalyptus steam room, the dry sauna and the relaxation lounges. The ideal system is to do the circuit three times over two to three hours, with the hot and cold thermotherapy boosting circulation and easing tense muscles.
Spa treatments include exfoliation, massages for moms-to-be, facials for men and collagen masks. Dining in: The suites have full kitchens, but this spa resort also serves top-drawer cuisine at its bistro, KiNipi à la Bouche. Most people are wrapped and hooded in white terry spa robes, so it definitely is informal, as well as bright and cheerful. The menu is ambitious, with large portions of gourmet food, as well as fancy pizza and burgers, all available for either lunch or dinner. Starters might be cheese fondue with fennel, salmon tartare, duck pâté or a specialty, wild mushrooms with shrimp. Main courses include pasta with duck confit, bison steak, seafood cassoulet and an interesting chili-curry of chickpeas and potatoes. Dining out: One gastronomic must-stop in Trois-Rivières is Poivre Noir, a chic, contemporary restaurant on the Port Portuaire, with glorious views of the St. Lawrence and a popular terrace in summer. Chef-owner José-Pierre Durand studied in France after learning the basics at l'Institut de Tourisme et d'Hôtellerie du Québec (ITHQ) in Montreal. Poivre Noir's food is outstanding, original and market-fresh, so the offerings change weekly. A recent haute cuisine dinner menu featured oysters and a tiny Quebec sea urchin blended with cream and "caviar" of herring. The small-tomedium-sized plates of mostly Quebec delicacies included: beef from Wagyu Québec near Drummondville, scallops and lobster from Îles de la Madeleine, milk-fed baby pork from Ferme Gaspor in St-Jérôme and foie gras from Montérégie.
The presentations are a big part of such distinctive dishes as bison tartare, which comes with a tiny glass vial of tomato oil. And creativity bubbles in fusions like shrimp with piri-piri and "black yogurt" with squid ink.

Builders grapple with timber frame: Montreal project will be world's largest condo with a wood skeleton instead of the standard steel or concrete

Full text: Montreal's trendy Griffintown neighbourhood has experienced a flurry of new condominium construction over the past few years.
Amid all those developments there is a new kid on the block: the eight-storey Arbora condominium-apartment complex.
While on the outside appearing not much different from its neighbours, Arbora on closer inspection turns out to be quite special. The three buildings making up the complex are built with wood skeletons instead of the standard steel or concrete.
Arbora's promoters say the 366,000-square-foot development - made of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and clad in brick, steel-aluminum and fibre-cement - is the world's largest residential project using a mass-timber structure.
It's just the latest iteration in the increasingly popular use - at least in North America (Europe is well ahead of us in this department) - of wood as an ecofriendly, resilient replacement for the ubiquitous steel and concrete in constructing large buildings.
Canada can now also boast that it is home to the world's tallest wooden tower: Brock Commons, an 18-storey student residence on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver.
Many other institutional, commercial and residential projects using wood are sprouting up across the United States and Canada.
Developers, engineers, designers and architects who are flocking to wood say it not only contributes to a major reduction in the carbon footprint, but also makes for a highly fire-resistant, light-but-sturdy and easy-to-install structural material.
The novelty and new construction techniques that come with it, however, can result in a set of challenges all their own.
"The innovation involved in construction brought about a certain level of complexity," said Marc-André Roy, president of Montreal-based developer Sotramont, one of four partners behind Arbora.
"I'm proud of [Arbora] but it was a lot, a lot, a lot of work," he said.
Case in point: The effort involved dealing with suppliers who were not 100-per-cent up to speed on CLT's characteristics.
Manufacturers of a special sealant to cover the holes in the CLT panels for cables to pass through had a bit of a learning curve at first trying to come up with the best solution for an effective product, Mr. Roy said.
And firemen from all over the city were keen on finding out more about CLT's properties and knowing why it should not be viewed as the fire-safety hazard they imagined, Mr. Roy said.
Even the insurance people considered it prudent to send over their engineering inspectors for some up-close, on-site risk assessment, he said.
In the end, everyone was reassured and even - in many cases - impressed, Mr. Roy said. "The firemen who came to us at first with skepticism and lots of questions ended up being quite taken with the product."
CLT is an engineered wood product - also known as mass timber - made of several layers of lumber that are stacked one on top of the other, each oriented at right angles to one another and bonded together under intense pressure using a non-toxic, environmentally friendly adhesive.
CLT is often sourced from sustainably managed forests; much of it comes from black spruce.
A key factor in its desirability as an ecologically smart product is the fact that it sequesters rather than emits carbon dioxide.
Proponents say engineered wood products also consume far less energy in the manufacturing process than do steel and concrete.
They are also lighter, with potential savings in a building's foundation costs.
And they allow for a high degree of prefabrication, also potentially lowering costs. Arbora's supplier - Quebec-based Nordic Structures - shipped the components to the site from its plant in Chibougamau, Que., in the form of prefabricated wood cut to the required dimensions, with openings for doors and windows, using computerized numerical control precision machinery.
"It's like snapping Lego blocks into place," said André Huot, head of business development at Nordic.
Nordic spokesman Frédéric Verreault says a Nordic-led project that was completed last year - the 13-storey Origine residential wood tower near Quebec City - was a big plus in helping spread the good word about how safe and reliable mass timber can be.
"It proved to be very useful right at the moment when we started work on Arbora," he said.
Rigorous fire-safety demonstrations over the past few years have convincingly shown that a CLT building would meet and even surpass code-compliance standards, he said, citing a 2014 test at the National Research Council's large-scale fire-test facility in Mississippi Mills, Ont. A high-intensity blaze was set in a mock-up apartment next door to a full-scale three-storey stair/elevator shaft made of CLT. There were no temperature or smokedensity increases and no smoke leaked into the shaft, according to reports of the test sponsored by Quebec's ministry of forests.
CLT has also passed other tests with flying colours; for example, when exposed to fire even for extended periods of time, the outer layer of a CLT beam or post chars and forms a kind of protective layer around the core, allowing it to retain its load-bearing capacity.
The 435-unit Arbora complex - located, appropriately enough, on the site of a former lumber yard - is going up in three phases, said Annie Lemieux, president of real estate developer LSR GesDev, one of the partners in the Griffintown project.
As construction got under way, interest in the venture grew, she said.
"There was a lot of external interest from people who wanted to see the techniques used and the product. It really radiated outwards."
Arbora's other two partners are Aldo Bensadoun, founder of Montreal-based footwear retail giant Aldo Group Inc. and Toronto-based real estate investment firm Carttera.
The promoters say LEED Platinum certification is pending.
Arbora's condos, townhouses and apartments have exposed wood posts and beams, adding a touch of warmth to the interior design.
The complex includes retail space on the ground floor of one of the three buildings. Among the amenities are a community wine cellar, outdoor swimming pool, gym with a sauna, a space for bike repair and maintenance, electric-vehicle charging stations, bicycle parking and access to car sharing.
Mr. Roy says Arbora is an excellent fit for the hip, eco-sensitive Griffintown neighbourhood, squeezed in between Lachine Canal and the downtown; the former working-class Irish enclave is now home not only to dozens of condo projects but also art galleries, boutiques, brew pubs and restaurants. "In Griffintown, people are more open to innovation," Mr. Roy said.

Full text: Arbora will be world's largest condo with a skeleton of wood instead of the standard steel or concrete
?
Montreal's trendy Griffintown neighbourhood has experienced a flurry of new condominium construction over the past few years.
Amid all those developments there is a new kid on the block: the eight-storey Arbora condominium-apartment complex. While on the outside appearing not much different from its neighbours, Arbora on closer inspection turns out to be quite special. The three buildings making up the complex are built with wood skeletons instead of the standard steel or concrete.
Arbora's promoters say the 366,000-square-foot development - made of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and clad in brick, steel-aluminum and fibre-cement - is the world's largest residential project using a mass-timber structure.
It's just the latest iteration in the increasingly popular use - at least in North America (Europe is well ahead of us in this department) - of wood as an eco-friendly, resilient replacement for the ubiquitous steel and concrete in constructing large buildings.
Canada can now also boast that it is home to the world's tallest wooden tower: Brock Commons, an 18-storey student residence on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver.
Many other institutional, commercial and residential projects using wood are sprouting up across the United States and Canada.
Developers, engineers, designers and architects who are flocking to wood say it not only contributes to a major reduction in the carbon footprint, but also makes for a highly fire-resistant, light-but-sturdy and easy-to-install structural material.
The novelty and new construction techniques that come with it, however, can result in a set of challenges all their own.
"The innovation involved in construction brought about a certain level of complexity," said Marc-André Roy, president of Montreal-based developer Sotramont, one of four partners behind Arbora.
"I'm proud of [Arbora] but it was a lot, a lot, a lot of work," he said.
Case in point: The effort involved dealing with suppliers who were not 100-per-cent up to speed on CLT's characteristics. Manufacturers of a special sealant to cover the holes in the CLT panels for cables to pass through had a bit of a learning curve at first trying to come up with the best solution for an effective product, Mr. Roy said.
And firemen from all over the city were keen on finding out more about CLT's properties and knowing why it should not be viewed as the fire-safety hazard they imagined, Mr. Roy said.
Even the insurance people considered it prudent to send over their engineering inspectors for some up-close, on-site risk assessment, he said.
In the end, everyone was reassured and even - in many cases - impressed, Mr. Roy said. "The firemen who came to us at first with skepticism and lots of questions ended up being quite taken with the product."
CLT is an engineered wood product - also known as mass timber - made of several layers of lumber that are stacked one on top of the other, each oriented at right angles to one another and bonded together under intense pressure using a non-toxic, environmentally friendly adhesive.
CLT is often sourced from sustainably managed forests; much of it comes from black spruce.
A key factor in its desirability as an ecologically smart product is the fact that it sequesters rather than emits carbon dioxide. Proponents say engineered wood products also consume far less energy in the manufacturing process than do steel and concrete.
They are also lighter, with potential savings in a building's foundation costs.
And they allow for a high degree of prefabrication, also potentially lowering costs. Arbora's supplier - Quebec-based Nordic Structures - shipped the components to the site from its plant in Chibougamau, Que in the form of prefabricated wood cut to the required dimensions, with openings for doors and windows, using computerized numerical control precision machinery.
"It's like snapping Lego blocks into place," said André Huot, head of business development at Nordic.
Nordic spokesman Frédéric Verreault says a Nordic-led project that was completed last year - the 13-storey Origine residential wood tower near Quebec City - was a big plus in helping spread the good word about how safe and reliable mass timber can be. "It proved to be very useful right at the moment when we started work on Arbora," he said.
Rigorous fire-safety demonstrations over the past few years have convincingly shown that a CLT building would meet and even surpass code-compliance standards, he said, citing a 2014 test at the National Research Council's large-scale fire-test facility in Mississippi Mills, Ont. A high-intensity blaze was set in a mock-up apartment next door to a full-scale three-storey stair/elevator shaft made of CLT. There were no temperature or smoke-density increases and no smoke leaked into the shaft, according to reports of the test sponsored by Quebec's ministry of forests.
CLT has also passed other tests with flying colours; for example, when exposed to fire even for extended periods of time, the outer layer of a CLT beam or post chars and forms a kind of protective layer around the core, allowing it to retain its load-bearing capacity.
The 435-unit Arbora complex - located, appropriately enough, on the site of a former lumber yard - is going up in three phases, said Annie Lemieux, president of real estate developer LSR GesDev, one of the partners in the Griffintown project.
As construction got underway, interest in the venture grew, she said.
"There was a lot of external interest from people who wanted to see the techniques used and the product. It really radiated outwards."
Arbora's other two partners are Aldo Bensadoun, founder of Montreal-based footwear retail giant Aldo Group Inc. and Toronto-based real estate investment firm Carttera.
The promoters say LEED Platinum certification is pending.
Arbora's condos, townhouses and apartments have exposed wood posts and beams, adding a touch of warmth to the interior design.
The complex includes retail space on the ground floor of one of the three buildings. Among the amenities are a community wine cellar, outdoor swimming pool, gym with a sauna, a space for bike repair and maintenance, electric-vehicle charging stations, bicycle parking and access to carsharing.
Mr. Roy says Arbora is an excellent fit for the hip, eco-sensitive Griffintown neighbourhood, squeezed in between Lachine Canal and the downtown; the former working-class Irish enclave is now home not only to dozens of condo projects but also art galleries, boutiques, brew pubs and restaurants. "In Griffintown, people are more open to innovation," Mr. Roy said.

Domtar led us down the garden path

Full text: Easy come, easy go.
That's what Montrealers can take away from the sale of the verdant and vibrant Jardin Domtar to a developer who plans to put up a 36-storey condo tower next to the western entrance to the Place des Arts métro station.
The Jardin Domtar was, until recently, a welcome gift to Montreal from the pulp and paper company headquartered next door. The land has housed a colourful playground for the children attending the Centre de la petite enfance Origami on the ground floor of the Maison Domtar, as well as a tranquil and treed oasis that won landscape design awards.
This was private land given over for public use - a widely appreciated gesture of largesse celebrated in the garden's name. Domtar acquired the site, a former parking lot, from the city in 2000, a sale that came with a condition to transform at least part of the area into green space. And for 18 years, Domtar didn't disappoint.
Jardin Domtar was a concrete sign of the company's commitment to environmental sustainability and community improvement, which it so readily touts on its website.
But that's all over now.
Apparently, the concept of big companies "giving back" comes with an unspecified expiry date, and the public shouldn't count on contributions to the common good lasting forever.
Domtar recently sold the property to Groupe Canvar for a reported $14 million. The developer plans to construct a hotel/condo project on the site between President Kennedy Ave. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., just west of Bleury St. in the booming Quartier des spectacles.
The question that emerges from this sad affair is: Why? Why would Domtar take back the beautiful gift it bestowed on Montrealers? Is it struggling for survival and being forced to auction off its assets in a fire sale? A look at the company's financial statements suggest this is hardly the case.
The maker of "products that people rely on every day" reported a loss of $212 million for 2017, compared to a $128-million profit the year before. But sales of paper, diapers and raw pulp, among myriad other products, were $5.16 billion for fiscal 2017 - yes, billion with ab - up slightly over the previous year.
Its debt is being paid down slowly. Domtar announced a 4.8 per cent increase in the dividend it pays to shareholders in the last quarter - also not something a company usually does if it's in trouble.
Commenting on the full-year results, Domtar president and chief executive officer John D. Williams certainly didn't sound worried about the company's fortunes.
"We generated nearly $450 million of operating cash flow and continued our solid track record of rewarding shareholders with a high payout ratio while maintaining financial flexibility," he said. "Looking ahead, we remain focused on maximizing long-term profitability and value creation."
So, what's a one-time injection of $14 million to Domtar's bottom line and future prospects? Other than temporarily pleasing shareholders, who generally tend to approve of such sales, the transaction accomplishes very little.
But for a company that seems to pride itself on its social responsibility, this transaction may be counterproductive.
Domtar has donated to local hospitals, including the McGill University Health Centre. Its website highlights efforts to promote literacy and help save the bald eagle population. "Healthy forests are in Domtar's best interests," the company proclaims. "This means that typically for every tree harvested, several more are replanted or naturally regenerated." Yet Domtar can't find it in its heart to preserve a handful of thriving mature trees in its own backyard.
How genuine are these efforts to do good if they can be reneged? Or is it little more than PR in the first place? The public has every right to be skeptical.
The new Projet Montréal administration seems to have thrown up its hands, saying Jardin Domtar is private property, the zoning allows for this, and it would be too expensive to buy or expropriate the land.
Domtar may be perfectly within its rights to sell this property, but that doesn't make it right.
In fact, the move lacks any shred of social acceptability - something Canvar should also consider.
Canvar has been building condo projects big and small in Montreal for 40 years. But odds are it has never constructed anything on a site as beloved as the Jardin Domtar.
Marc Varadi, of Canvar, who took the time to respond to questions about the project when Domtar didn't, acknowledges the strong public reaction.
"Although we are sympathetic to those who are expressing their views, we have collaborated with all of the stakeholders, including the municipal administration," he said.
Canvar is pledging to preserve a portion of the green space, but could not say how much of the current footprint will be left. Varadi also noted: "If the city were to find another place to relocate les Jardins Domtar, we would be happy to make a financial contribution to it."
Transforming a small parking lot into green space between President Kennedy and de Maisonneuve to the east of Bleury, may eventually be held out as a peace offering to a disillusioned public. Whatever gets created, though, will have to be rechristened something other than Jardin Domtar 2.
For it will lie in the shadow of what might once have been an emblem of Domtar's generosity, but instead became a monument to its greed. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: After nearly three decades of remaining silent about it, Cheryl Mc-Donald started telling the painful story of her sister Carleen's disappearance and death - first at a vigil, then at gatherings and to the media.
As the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls opened its Montreal hearings Monday, McDonald knew it was important to tell it once more. While doing so, she shared a picture she hadn't before.
In the photo, taken a few years ago on a hot summer day, McDonald is lying on the ground in her backyard, the cool grass almost taking over her face.
She recalled lying there and thinking: "Why did Carleen, 25, sneak out in the middle of the night on Sept. 4, 1988? Why was her body found by a deer hunter seven weeks later in the forest? "Why did she leave us all, leave her children?" McDonald, a Mohawk woman from Akwesasne, asked during her testimony. "Why did she leave my parents?" McDonald described her sister as a "rambunctious little spirit," a defiant child who wasn't afraid to roughhouse. A tomboy, she would cut the hair off McDonald's dolls. Later, she would try to spike her hair like Rod Stewart. At 16, she fell in love and was pregnant. A tumultuous and abusive relationship followed.
For 27 years of "constant churning" in her mind, McDonald had gone back and forth on what she thinks happened to Carleen, shifting between her death being a suicide and thinking someone took her out to the woods.
Eventually, she settled on the former, and she understood that summer day she needed to start focusing on her own healing in order to find peace.
Testifying at the inquiry, she said Monday, is part of that ongoing process. Already with three grandchildren and expecting a fourth this summer, she said she believes "a lot can change for the good" over several generations.
"And I really believe one day all of this will be worth it," she said, of speaking up about Carleen. "No one person can change this. It's us standing together as men and women (that will)."
But though McDonald says she has found peace, questions linger. They intensify every time she hears another family's painful story of Indigenous women and girls reported missing or found murdered.
Did the police do enough? When the family was finally brought to where Carleen's body was found, McDonald said, parts of her remains were still there on a blanket beneath the trees. McDonald watched a family member dig a hole and use a pitchfork to pick up the blanket and bury it.
"They left the crime scene like that," she said through tears, shaking her head. "It still haunts me."
The national inquiry was launched in September 2016. More than 70 people are expected to testify at this week's hearings in Montreal.
After McDonald's testimony Monday, members of the Blackned family were sworn in.
Rose-Ann Blackned, a Cree woman who lived in Val-d'Or, was 24 when she was found beaten and frozen to death on Nov. 16, 1991. A mother of two, she had been reported missing nine days before.
Her son Silas, 5 at the time, said he has few memories of his mother. But he remembers her making him wear a full suit for church, even if he was the only kid to do so.
He remembers breaking her cigarettes around the house because he didn't want her smoking. And mostly, how he kept thinking of her after she died, wanting to show her when he received good grades or caught a big fish.
The inquiry gives the family hope, Silas said, but he wonders what comes next.
In 2017, provincial police announced they were reopening the investigation into Blackned's death, but only a few months later, the Crown prosecutor's office informed the family there wasn't enough evidence to lay charges.
"They told us there's nothing more we can do as a family. Do you know how much that hurts?" asked her sister, Mary-Ann Blackned, through heavy tears.
Hunched over in her seat during difficult testimony, Mary-Ann said she has lost faith in the police and the justice system, but hasn't lost hope that she'll one day get the closure she seeks.
"That's all I ever wanted for my sister, justice," she said. "And every woman that went missing and murdered, they all deserve justice, too. So that the families can have peace."
Before the hearings began Monday, commissioner Michèle Audette had reminded people of how painful some of the families'testimony will be.
"For most of them, it's going to be the first time that they share their truth," Audette said.
In the conference room, tissue boxes bookended each row of seats, accompanied by brown paper bags. People were encouraged to place their tear-soaked tissues in them - they'll be collected at the end of the week, kept safe, and burned and prayed for in a sacred fire this spring. jfeith@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jessefeith

As the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls opened its Montreal hearings Monday, McDonald knew it was important to tell it once more. While doing so, she shared a picture she hadn't before.
In the photo, taken a few years ago on a hot summer day, McDonald is lying on the ground in her backyard, the cool grass almost taking over her face.
She recalled lying there and thinking: "Why did Carleen, 25, sneak out in the middle of the night on Sept. 4, 1988? Why was her body found by a deer hunter seven weeks later in the forest?
"Why did she leave us all, leave her children?" McDonald, a Mohawk woman from Akwesasne, asked during her testimony. "Why did she leave my parents?"
McDonald described her sister as a "rambunctious little spirit," a defiant child who wasn't afraid to roughhouse. A tomboy, she would cut the hair off McDonald's dolls. Later, she would try to spike her hair like Rod Stewart. At 16, she fell in love and was pregnant. A tumultuous and abusive relationship followed.
For 27 years of "constant churning" in her mind, McDonald had gone back and forth on what she thinks happened to Carleen, shifting between her death being a suicide and thinking someone took her out to the woods.
Eventually, she settled on the former, and she understood that summer day she needed to start focusing on her own healing in order to find peace.
Testifying at the inquiry, she said Monday, is part of that ongoing process. Already with three grandchildren and expecting a fourth this summer, she said she believes "a lot can change for the good" over several generations.
"And I really believe one day all of this will be worth it," she said, of speaking up about Carleen. "No one person can change this. It's us standing together as men and women (that will)."
But though McDonald says she has found peace, questions linger. They intensify every time she hears another family's painful story of Indigenous women and girls reported missing or found murdered.
Did the police do enough? When the family was finally brought to where Carleen's body was found, McDonald said, parts of her remains were still there on a blanket beneath the trees. McDonald watched a family member dig a hole and use a pitchfork to pick up the blanket and bury it.
"They left the crime scene like that," she said through tears, shaking her head. "It still haunts me."
The national inquiry was launched in September 2016. More than 70 people are expected to testify at this week's hearings in Montreal.
After McDonald's testimony Monday, members of the Blackned family were sworn in.
Rose-Ann Blackned, a Cree woman who lived in Val-d'Or, was 24 when she was found beaten and frozen to death on Nov. 16, 1991. A mother of two, she had been reported missing nine days before.
Her son Silas, 5 at the time, said he has few memories of his mother. But he remembers her making him wear a full suit for church, even if he was the only kid to do so.
He remembers breaking her cigarettes around the house because he didn't want her smoking. And mostly, how he kept thinking of her after she died, wanting to show her when he received good grades or caught a big fish.
The inquiry gives the family hope, Silas said, but he wonders what comes next.
In 2017, provincial police announced they were reopening the investigation into Blackned's death, but only a few months later, the Crown prosecutor's office informed the family there wasn't enough evidence to lay charges.
"They told us there's nothing more we can do as a family. Do you know how much that hurts?" asked her sister, Mary-Ann Blackned, through heavy tears.
Hunched over in her seat during difficult testimony, Mary-Ann said she has lost faith in the police and the justice system, but hasn't lost hope that she'll one day get the closure she seeks.
"That's all I ever wanted for my sister, justice," she said. "And every woman that went missing and murdered, they all deserve justice, too. So that the families can have peace."
Before the hearings began Monday, commissioner Michèle Audette had reminded people of how painful some of the families' testimony will be.
"For most of them, it's going to be the first time that they share their truth," Audette said.
In the conference room, tissue boxes bookended each row of seats, accompanied by brown paper bags. People were encouraged to place their tear-soaked tissues in them - they'll be collected at the end of the week, kept safe, and burned and prayed for in a sacred fire this spring.

Fights over vehicles on Montreal's Mount Royal are nothing new

Abstract: Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates. Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks. The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station.

Full text: Nothing arouses Montrealers' indignation quite like debates over their beloved mountain.
Nothing, that is, except debates over their beloved cars.
Put the two together and you have a nearly 26,000-name petition( https://www.change.org/p/val%C3%A9rie-plante-non-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ), a 7,000-name counter-petition( https://www.change.org/p/oui-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ) and a whole lot of grumbling against Mayor Valérie Plante's fourth-month-old administration.
Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring.
Will the shutdown split the mountain in two, as opponents claim?
Or is it the road itself, opened in 1958, that divides the mountain, creating danger and pollution for walkers and cyclists, as supporters say?
It all depends on how you look at transportation on Mount Royal - a topic that has been polarizing citizens since the horse-and-buggy era.

McCord Museum.
While most Montrealers would agree that the mountain is the city's most priceless treasure, they have a long history of arguing over how to get there. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates.
And somehow, those disputes always seem to ignite underlying tensions - whether it's between rich and poor, west and east, French and English, cyclists and drivers, or urbanites and suburbanites.
"The tone is so strident," says Daniel Chartier, a landscape architect who retired from the city of Montreal in 2014, after 37 years.
"People have stopped listening to each other, even though there are many things they can agree on. I read the comments on social media, and people are saying stupid things," said Chartier, who was responsible for Mount Royal from 1991 to 2014.
"What worries me is that people will say: 'No, no, no, we want things to stay the same. But they need to change," he said.
The death of 18-year-old cyclist Clément Ouimet, who was hit by a car on Camillien-Houde Way last October, spurred calls to make the mountain safer for bikes and pedestrians.
Numerous studies, including a report by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in 2008, have called for the drastic reduction or elimination of cars on Mount Royal.
New York City recently permanently banned cars in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, after a pilot project over the summer, following years of partial bans.
"Restoring Prospect Park as a car-free oasis will improve the lives of the millions who use this park today and of generations to come," New York mayor Bill de Blasio said in October.
But the consensus reached in Brooklyn seems to elude Montreal.
The guiding principle in decisions on the park should be "the quality of the experience" for park-goers, said Chartier, an expert on Frederick Law Olmsted - who designed both Mount Royal and Prospect Parks.
Considered the father of American landscape architecture, Olmsted designed many urban parks across North America, including New York's Central Park and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, mostly working with a senior partner, Calvert Vaux.

Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks.
Olmsted said footpaths and roads should be screened from each other by shrubbery, to preserve the sense of being surrounded by nature.
"It's not a wild nature. It's a nature that's been beautified by human hands, but subtly," Chartier said.
For the first half-century of the Mount Royal Park's existence, Montrealers wrangled over whether streetcars should be allowed to intrude on what Olmsted called the "poetic charm" of the mountain.
East-end politicians said the lack of public transit excluded the working masses, who couldn't afford to hire a horse-drawn cab - the main means of transportation in the park.
But self-appointed defenders like the Parks' Protective Association (later the Montreal Parks and Playgrounds Association), opposed streetcars, saying they would disfigure the mountain and lead to other forms of commercialization. Streetcars won out when tracks were laid from Côte des Neiges Rd. in 1924 and from Park Ave. in 1930.
The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station. Most of those projects were never built.
"There is plenty of natural beauty in the Laurentians. We don't need it in the centre of a big city," Paul Lambert, a prominent architect and member of Drapeau's Civic Action League, said in 1960.

Cars were finally allowed on the mountain in 1958, when the city built Camillien-Houde Way along the former streetcar route, blasting the former tunnel to create an open-air drive.
Gazette reader Mrs. H. Wyatt Johnston was among those who protested in a letter to the editor( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Fr8DH2VBP9sC&dat=19581013&printsec=frontpage&hl=en ) against "the idea of injecting this horror into Montreal's last refuge."
Despite the bitter battles over Mount Royal, the good news is that the park is still intact, with many of the original features Olmsted designed, Chartier said.
"The lesson of history, I would say, is that people say the mountain has been incredibly attacked. But it's not true. If you look at the size of Mount Royal Park today, it's actually larger than Olmsted's project," he said.

Timeline of different modes of transportation on Mount Royal
1845: On Jan. 11, 1845, 11 prominent businessmen with villas on Mount Royal petition unsuccessfully for a boulevard on the mountain, near present-day Pine Ave. They present a second petition in 1851. But the proposal is dropped, except in Westmount, where The Boulevard is built in 1880.
1852: Mount Royal Cemetery, a scenic nature park for the dead, opens on the Outremont side of the mountain. Taking a carriage drive out to the rural cemetery, just over three kilometres from the city, becomes a popular activity for tourists. The creation of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery follows three years later.
1862: On Nov. 10, Major Alexander Stevenson orders his militia to drag four cannons up to the summit of Mount Royal to fire a salute for the 21st birthday of the Prince of Wales.
Stevenson, an alderman, has been lobbying the city to turn the mountain into a park, but critics say the land is too steep. So Stevenson orders his troops up the hill to prove that it is accessible. The next year, he repeats the feat.
1863: The city sets up a subcommittee on the proposed park.
1864: A report on the proposed park is submitted to city council.
1869: The city borrows $350,000 to acquire land for the park.
1872: On March 2, citizens hold an "indignation meeting" after a landowner cuts timber on 40 to 50 acres of the mountain. The controversy spurs backers of the park to redouble their efforts.
1876: Mount Royal Park opens. But critics complain that without some form of public transportation, it is not accessible to the working masses.
1885: Construction of a funicular (incline railway) from Park Ave. to the summit. "A very great convenience has been provided for the class of Montrealers to whom cheap pleasures are a necessity," says the reform-minded Montreal Herald.
1895: A proposal by the Montreal Street Railway for a streetcar on the mountain begins 35 years of controversy. The next year, the tram company withdraws the proposal in response to public criticism.
1911-1918: The Canadian Northern Railway tunnels under Mount Royal. Even though promoters launch a real-estate venture, the Town of Mount Royal, to offset the costs of the project, the tunnel pushes the railway into insolvency.
Funicular on Mount Royal Park. It once cost a nickel to ride to the top of the funicular, which was declared unsafe in 1918.
1918: The funicular is discontinued because of safety concerns.
1924: Streetcars go into service on the mountain after tracks are laid from Côte-des-Neiges Rd. to the Smith House via Remembrance Rd. (then called Shakespeare Rd.).
1930: Streetcar service from the Park Ave. side begins, following construction of a tunnel in the steep terrain.
Streetcar emerges from tunnel on Mount Royal in 1933.
1958: Cars are finally allowed on the mountain with the construction of the Camillien-Houde Parkway, designed by American landscape architects Clarke & Rapuano. The new road follows the former streetcar tracks.
The same year, the city inaugurates The Tempest, a miniature train on rubber wheels operating on weekends during the summer between Beaver Lake and the Chalet. It runs until the 1980s.
1961: The Park/Pine interchange is inaugurated.

Abstract: Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates. Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks. The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station.

Full text: Nothing arouses Montrealers' indignation quite like debates over their beloved mountain.
Nothing, that is, except debates over their beloved cars.
Put the two together and you have a nearly 26,000-name petition( https://www.change.org/p/val%C3%A9rie-plante-non-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ), a 7,000-name counter-petition( https://www.change.org/p/oui-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ) and a whole lot of grumbling against Mayor Valérie Plante's fourth-month-old administration.
Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring.
Will the shutdown split the mountain in two, as opponents claim?
Or is it the road itself, opened in 1958, that divides the mountain, creating danger and pollution for walkers and cyclists, as supporters say?
It all depends on how you look at transportation on Mount Royal - a topic that has been polarizing citizens since the horse-and-buggy era.

While most Montrealers would agree that the mountain is the city's most priceless treasure, they have a long history of arguing over how to get there. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates.
And somehow, those disputes always seem to ignite underlying tensions - whether it's between rich and poor, west and east, French and English, cyclists and drivers, or urbanites and suburbanites.
"The tone is so strident," says Daniel Chartier, a landscape architect who retired from the city of Montreal in 2014, after 37 years.
"People have stopped listening to each other, even though there are many things they can agree on. I read the comments on social media, and people are saying stupid things," said Chartier, who was responsible for Mount Royal from 1991 to 2014.
"What worries me is that people will say: 'No, no, no, we want things to stay the same. But they need to change," he said.
The death of 18-year-old cyclist Clément Ouimet, who was hit by a car on Camillien-Houde Way last October, spurred calls to make the mountain safer for bikes and pedestrians.
Numerous studies, including a report by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in 2008, have called for the drastic reduction or elimination of cars on Mount Royal.
New York City recently permanently banned cars in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, after a pilot project over the summer, following years of partial bans.
"Restoring Prospect Park as a car-free oasis will improve the lives of the millions who use this park today and of generations to come," New York mayor Bill de Blasio said in October.
But the consensus reached in Brooklyn seems to elude Montreal.
The guiding principle in decisions on the park should be "the quality of the experience" for park-goers, said Chartier, an expert on Frederick Law Olmsted - who designed both Mount Royal and Prospect Parks.
Considered the father of American landscape architecture, Olmsted designed many urban parks across North America, including New York's Central Park and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, mostly working with a senior partner, Calvert Vaux.

Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks.
Olmsted said footpaths and roads should be screened from each other by shrubbery, to preserve the sense of being surrounded by nature.
"It's not a wild nature. It's a nature that's been beautified by human hands, but subtly," Chartier said.
For the first half-century of the Mount Royal Park's existence, Montrealers wrangled over whether streetcars should be allowed to intrude on what Olmsted called the "poetic charm" of the mountain.
East-end politicians said the lack of public transit excluded the working masses, who couldn't afford to hire a horse-drawn cab - the main means of transportation in the park.
But self-appointed defenders like the Parks' Protective Association (later the Montreal Parks and Playgrounds Association), opposed streetcars, saying they would disfigure the mountain and lead to other forms of commercialization. Streetcars won out when tracks were laid from Côte des Neiges Rd. in 1924 and from Park Ave. in 1930.
The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station. Most of those projects were never built.
"There is plenty of natural beauty in the Laurentians. We don't need it in the centre of a big city," Paul Lambert, a prominent architect and member of Drapeau's Civic Action League, said in 1960.

Cars were finally allowed on the mountain in 1958, when the city built Camillien-Houde Way along the former streetcar route, blasting the former tunnel to create an open-air drive.
Gazette reader Mrs. H. Wyatt Johnston was among those who protested in a letter to the editor( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Fr8DH2VBP9sC&dat=19581013&printsec=frontpage&hl=en ) against "the idea of injecting this horror into Montreal's last refuge."
Despite the bitter battles over Mount Royal, the good news is that the park is still intact, with many of the original features Olmsted designed, Chartier said.
"The lesson of history, I would say, is that people say the mountain has been incredibly attacked. But it's not true. If you look at the size of Mount Royal Park today, it's actually larger than Olmsted's project," he said.
Timeline of different modes of transportation on Mount Royal
1845: On Jan. 11, 1845, 11 prominent businessmen with villas on Mount Royal petition unsuccessfully for a boulevard on the mountain, near present-day Pine Ave. They present a second petition in 1851. But the proposal is dropped, except in Westmount, where The Boulevard is built in 1880.
1852: Mount Royal Cemetery, a scenic nature park for the dead, opens on the Outremont side of the mountain. Taking a carriage drive out to the rural cemetery, just over three kilometres from the city, becomes a popular activity for tourists. The creation of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery follows three years later.
1862: On Nov. 10, Major Alexander Stevenson orders his militia to drag four cannons up to the summit of Mount Royal to fire a salute for the 21st birthday of the Prince of Wales.
Stevenson, an alderman, has been lobbying the city to turn the mountain into a park, but critics say the land is too steep. So Stevenson orders his troops up the hill to prove that it is accessible. The next year, he repeats the feat.
1863: The city sets up a subcommittee on the proposed park.
1864: A report on the proposed park is submitted to city council.
1869: The city borrows $350,000 to acquire land for the park.
1872: On March 2, citizens hold an "indignation meeting" after a landowner cuts timber on 40 to 50 acres of the mountain. The controversy spurs backers of the park to redouble their efforts.
1876: Mount Royal Park opens. But critics complain that without some form of public transportation, it is not accessible to the working masses.
1885: Construction of a funicular (incline railway) from Park Ave. to the summit. "A very great convenience has been provided for the class of Montrealers to whom cheap pleasures are a necessity," says the reform-minded Montreal Herald.
1895: A proposal by the Montreal Street Railway for a streetcar on the mountain begins 35 years of controversy. The next year, the tram company withdraws the proposal in response to public criticism.
1911-1918: The Canadian Northern Railway tunnels under Mount Royal. Even though promoters launch a real-estate venture, the Town of Mount Royal, to offset the costs of the project, the tunnel pushes the railway into insolvency.
Funicular on Mount Royal Park. It once cost a nickel to ride to the top of the funicular, which was declared unsafe in 1918.
1918: The funicular is discontinued because of safety concerns.
1924: Streetcars go into service on the mountain after tracks are laid from Côte-des-Neiges Rd. to the Smith House via Remembrance Rd. (then called Shakespeare Rd.).
1930: Streetcar service from the Park Ave. side begins, following construction of a tunnel in the steep terrain.
Streetcar emerges from tunnel on Mount Royal in 1933.
1958: Cars are finally allowed on the mountain with the construction of the Camillien-Houde Parkway, designed by American landscape architects Clarke & Rapuano. The new road follows the former streetcar tracks.
The same year, the city inaugurates The Tempest, a miniature train on rubber wheels operating on weekends during the summer between Beaver Lake and the Chalet. It runs until the 1980s.
1961: The Park/Pine interchange is inaugurated.
1990: A plan to eliminate car traffic on Mount Royal is withdrawn amid controversy, after a front-page article in the Montreal Gazette.
2005: After decades of pressure from community groups, the Park/Pine interchange is demolished.
2008: The Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) recommends traffic-calming measures on Camillien-Houde as "the first step in a strategy aiming to completely eliminate through-traffic on Mount Royal."

Abstract: Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring.

Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks. The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station.

Full text: Nothing arouses Montrealers' indignation quite like debates over their beloved mountain.
Nothing, that is, except debates over their beloved cars.
Put the two together and you have a nearly 26,000-name petition( https://www.change.org/p/val%C3%A9rie-plante-non-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ), a 7,000-name counter-petition( https://www.change.org/p/oui-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ) and a whole lot of grumbling against Mayor Valérie Plante's fourth-month-old administration.
Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring.
Will the shutdown split the mountain in two, as opponents claim?
Or is it the road itself, opened in 1958, that divides the mountain, creating danger and pollution for walkers and cyclists, as supporters say?
It all depends on how you look at transportation on Mount Royal - a topic that has been polarizing citizens since the horse-and-buggy era.

McCord Museum.
While most Montrealers would agree that the mountain is the city's most priceless treasure, they have a long history of arguing over how to get there. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates.
And somehow, those disputes always seem to ignite underlying tensions - whether it's between rich and poor, west and east, French and English, cyclists and drivers, or urbanites and suburbanites.
"The tone is so strident," says Daniel Chartier, a landscape architect who retired from the city of Montreal in 2014, after 37 years.
"People have stopped listening to each other, even though there are many things they can agree on. I read the comments on social media, and people are saying stupid things," said Chartier, who was responsible for Mount Royal from 1991 to 2014.
"What worries me is that people will say: 'No, no, no, we want things to stay the same. But they need to change," he said.
The death of 18-year-old cyclist Clément Ouimet, who was hit by a car on Camillien-Houde Way last October, spurred calls to make the mountain safer for bikes and pedestrians.
Numerous studies, including a report by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in 2008, have called for the drastic reduction or elimination of cars on Mount Royal.
New York City recently permanently banned cars in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, after a pilot project over the summer, following years of partial bans.
"Restoring Prospect Park as a car-free oasis will improve the lives of the millions who use this park today and of generations to come," New York mayor Bill de Blasio said in October.
But the consensus reached in Brooklyn seems to elude Montreal.
The guiding principle in decisions on the park should be "the quality of the experience" for park-goers, said Chartier, an expert on Frederick Law Olmsted - who designed both Mount Royal and Prospect Parks.
Considered the father of American landscape architecture, Olmsted designed many urban parks across North America, including New York's Central Park and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, mostly working with a senior partner, Calvert Vaux.

Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks.
Olmsted said footpaths and roads should be screened from each other by shrubbery, to preserve the sense of being surrounded by nature.
"It's not a wild nature. It's a nature that's been beautified by human hands, but subtly," Chartier said.
For the first half-century of the Mount Royal Park's existence, Montrealers wrangled over whether streetcars should be allowed to intrude on what Olmsted called the "poetic charm" of the mountain.
East-end politicians said the lack of public transit excluded the working masses, who couldn't afford to hire a horse-drawn cab - the main means of transportation in the park.
But self-appointed defenders like the Parks' Protective Association (later the Montreal Parks and Playgrounds Association), opposed streetcars, saying they would disfigure the mountain and lead to other forms of commercialization. Streetcars won out when tracks were laid from Côte des Neiges Rd. in 1924 and from Park Ave. in 1930.
The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station. Most of those projects were never built.
"There is plenty of natural beauty in the Laurentians. We don't need it in the centre of a big city," Paul Lambert, a prominent architect and member of Drapeau's Civic Action League, said in 1960.

Cars were finally allowed on the mountain in 1958, when the city built Camillien-Houde Way along the former streetcar route, blasting the former tunnel to create an open-air drive.
Gazette reader Mrs. H. Wyatt Johnston was among those who protested in a letter to the editor( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Fr8DH2VBP9sC&dat=19581013&printsec=frontpage&hl=en ) against "the idea of injecting this horror into Montreal's last refuge."
Despite the bitter battles over Mount Royal, the good news is that the park is still intact, with many of the original features Olmsted designed, Chartier said.
"The lesson of history, I would say, is that people say the mountain has been incredibly attacked. But it's not true. If you look at the size of Mount Royal Park today, it's actually larger than Olmsted's project," he said.
Timeline of different modes of transportation on Mount Royal
1845: On Jan. 11, 1845, 11 prominent businessmen with villas on Mount Royal petition unsuccessfully for a boulevard on the mountain, near present-day Pine Ave. They present a second petition in 1851. But the proposal is dropped, except in Westmount, where The Boulevard is built in 1880.
1852: Mount Royal Cemetery, a scenic nature park for the dead, opens on the Outremont side of the mountain. Taking a carriage drive out to the rural cemetery, just over three kilometres from the city, becomes a popular activity for tourists. The creation of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery follows three years later.
1862: On Nov. 10, Major Alexander Stevenson orders his militia to drag four cannons up to the summit of Mount Royal to fire a salute for the 21st birthday of the Prince of Wales.
Stevenson, an alderman, has been lobbying the city to turn the mountain into a park, but critics say the land is too steep. So Stevenson orders his troops up the hill to prove that it is accessible. The next year, he repeats the feat.
1863: The city sets up a subcommittee on the proposed park.
1864: A report on the proposed park is submitted to city council.
1869: The city borrows $350,000 to acquire land for the park.
1872: On March 2, citizens hold an "indignation meeting" after a landowner cuts timber on 40 to 50 acres of the mountain. The controversy spurs backers of the park to redouble their efforts.
1876: Mount Royal Park opens. But critics complain that without some form of public transportation, it is not accessible to the working masses.
1885: Construction of a funicular (incline railway) from Park Ave. to the summit. "A very great convenience has been provided for the class of Montrealers to whom cheap pleasures are a necessity," says the reform-minded Montreal Herald.
1895: A proposal by the Montreal Street Railway for a streetcar on the mountain begins 35 years of controversy. The next year, the tram company withdraws the proposal in response to public criticism.
1911-1918: The Canadian Northern Railway tunnels under Mount Royal. Even though promoters launch a real-estate venture, the Town of Mount Royal, to offset the costs of the project, the tunnel pushes the railway into insolvency.
Funicular on Mount Royal Park. It once cost a nickel to ride to the top of the funicular, which was declared unsafe in 1918.
1918: The funicular is discontinued because of safety concerns.
1924: Streetcars go into service on the mountain after tracks are laid from Côte-des-Neiges Rd. to the Smith House via Remembrance Rd. (then called Shakespeare Rd.).
1930: Streetcar service from the Park Ave. side begins, following construction of a tunnel in the steep terrain.
Streetcar emerges from tunnel on Mount Royal in 1933.
1958: Cars are finally allowed on the mountain with the construction of the Camillien-Houde Parkway, designed by American landscape architects Clarke & Rapuano. The new road follows the former streetcar tracks.
The same year, the city inaugurates The Tempest, a miniature train on rubber wheels operating on weekends during the summer between Beaver Lake and the Chalet. It runs until the 1980s.
1961: The Park/Pine interchange is inaugurated.
1990: A plan to eliminate car traffic on Mount Royal is withdrawn amid controversy, after a front-page article in the Montreal Gazette.
2005: After decades of pressure from community groups, the Park/Pine interchange is demolished.
2008: The Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) recommends traffic-calming measures on Camillien-Houde as "the first step in a strategy aiming to completely eliminate through-traffic on Mount Royal."
It also recommends the city hold a pilot project to eliminate through-traffic on the mountain.

The Right Chemistry: Chaga claims aren't backed by evidence

Author: Austin, Edie

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/right-chemistry-chaga-claims-arent-backed/docview/2000111936/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Folklore speaks of Chaga mushrooms treating virtually every known ailment, ranging from intestinal worms and heart disease to diabetes and cancer. Largely ignored by the western world for hundreds of years, the tale continues, Chaga is now being recognized for its energy boosting, immune-system improving, stress reducing, detoxifying and anti-cancer properties. Laboratory studies have also shown that Chaga, like any other plant material, contains an array of triterpenes, sterols, beta glucans, flavonoids, melanins, polyphenols, saponins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and fibre.

Full text: If you wanted to find some "Chaga," you would tromp through a forest looking for a birch tree with an unusual growth on its trunk. Although it is classified as a mushroom, Chaga doesn't look like one. Instead of having gills, this mushroom is permeated with numerous pores. Under pressure it crumbles readily, revealing a brownish inside with cream coloured veins.
Why would anyone seek out such an ugly parasite that grows from a wound on the bark of a birch tree? Probably because of stories that circulate about the mushroom being prized by natives of northern Asia, Europe and America for its medicinal powers. Folklore speaks of Chaga mushrooms treating virtually every known ailment, ranging from intestinal worms and heart disease to diabetes and cancer. They have been alluringly referred to as "Nature's Silver Bullet" and "A Gift from God." Largely ignored by the western world for hundreds of years, the tale continues, Chaga is now being recognized for its energy boosting, immune-system improving, stress reducing, detoxifying and anti-cancer properties.
And where are these revelations to be found? Mostly on websites that sell an array of Chaga pills and extracts.
The marketing of Chaga follows a popular formula. An obscure natural substance that virtually nobody has heard about is touted as a non-toxic answer to our health problems. On what basis? There are the usual personal testimonials, there's reference to historical use as well as to studies that have shown some sort of biological activity in some sort of laboratory or rodent study. Of course, many mushrooms contain compounds that have biological activity, not necessarily desirable. Amanita muscaria, for example, is highly toxic and psilocybe mushrooms can cause hallucinations. But it certainly is possible that some fungi contain pharmacologically useful compounds. It may even be that Chaga does. But before swallowing the idea that swallowing Chaga pills or extracts or teas is a good thing to do, we had better look at the evidence.
Anecdotes about arthritis improving after drinking Chaga tea, or eczema resolving, or sleep improving, or blood pressure dropping, do not amount to scientific evidence. So what kind of scientific evidence exists? One study that is commonly quoted reported the effect of a Chaga mushroom extract on human white blood cells exposed to the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide in the laboratory. The cells treated with the extract showed a 40-per-cent reduction in DNA damage. This is often described as "promising anti-cancer activity." That's a big stretch. The reduction in DNA damage is an interesting observation, but is essentially meaningless. Such effects can be seen with virtually any fruit or vegetable extract that contains antioxidants. It doesn't translate to anything meaningful in terms of ingestion of any Chaga preparation.
Laboratory studies have also shown that Chaga, like any other plant material, contains an array of triterpenes, sterols, beta glucans, flavonoids, melanins, polyphenols, saponins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and fibre. In some context, all of these have biological activity and with clever writing and selective reporting can be made to look like miraculous ingredients. For example, one bit of supporting evidence offered for the use of Chaga extracts is that during an influenza epidemic a century ago, while the white population was dropping like flies, physicians noted that the Native American population was virtually unaffected. "After close inspection, these physicians attributed the herbs that the Indians were ingesting to their heightened immunity." First, there is no evidence that Indigenous people were specially protected, and even if they were, it cannot be concluded that it was because of any natural products they were taking, and there is certainly no evidence that they were indulging in any Chaga.
The bottom line is that there is no compelling evidence that ingesting any form of Chaga is beneficial. There are no placebo-controlled randomized trials of Chaga pills or extracts. Pills are available, but as with any such product, there is no standardization, there is no way to tell what the pills really contain. As far as Chaga teas go, there are numerous recipes that undoubtedly result in different compositions of the final product. It is certainly possible that future research will show that some standardized preparation of Chaga, or a specific dose of a compound found in Chaga, has a therapeutic effect. But so far nothing like that has been shown.
The only truly documented evidence I've been able to come up with refers to the combustibility of the fungus. Chaga is sometimes justifiably referred to as a "tinder fungus" because its porous nature gives it a very large surface area and makes it very easy to light. It seems to be just the right substance with which to start a fire. A useful thing to know for people interested in wilderness survival. Unfortunately, its use in disease survival is a different matter.

Full text: Scores of Montreal firefighters were called in late Sunday and early Monday to battle a pair of fires that broke out in the city's north end.
The first blaze broke out at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday in an automobile repair shop and is being treated as a case of arson.
A witness told police that a car rammed the front of the shop, located on Forest St. in the industrial sector of the borough of Montreal North, prior to the fire. While the flames spread to two adjacent buildings, there were no injuries reported and no evacuations were required.
The second fire occurred at about 2:30 a.m. in a commercial building on Crémazie Blvd. E. near Lajeunesse St. in the city's Villeray district. No injuries were reported.
The cause of the second blaze has yet to be determined. Firefighters remained on the scene Monday morning, and Crémazie Blvd. is closed in both directions between Lajeunesse and St-Hubert Sts. until this afternoon.

Full text: Scores of Montreal firefighters were called in late Sunday and early Monday to battle a pair of fires that broke out in the city's north end.
The first blaze broke out at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday in an automobile repair shop and is being treated as a case of arson.
A witness told police that a car rammed the front of the shop, located on Forest St. in the industrial sector of the borough of Montreal North, prior to the fire. While the flames spread to two adjacent buildings, there were no injuries reported and no evacuations were required.
The second fire occurred at about 2:30 a.m. in a commercial building on Crémazie Blvd. E. near Lajeunesse St. in the city's Villeray district. No injuries were reported.
The cause of the second blaze has yet to be determined. Firefighters remained on the scene Monday morning, and westbound Crémazie Blvd. is closed in both directions between St. Denis and Christophe-Colomb Ave. until this afternoon.

Full text: It's the eternal holiday parenting quandary: What level of exhaustion will you attain to keep your children from boredom? Fret not - there are hundreds of things to do during the Christmas break. Pick five or six, and school will be back in session before you know it. And who knows? You might just have a good time while you're doing it, Hayley Juhl writes.
PLAY
This is your last chance to use your free Parks Canada pass. (Don't worry if you forgot to get a physical pass. You'll be allowed into the park for free.) Do some snow tagging on snowshoes at La Mauricie National Park, or take advantage of their 80 kilometres of ski trails. (There are heated shelters every five kilometres.) It's free to get into the park for the rest of 2017, but there are fees to rent equipment like snowshoes or fat bikes, and there's a cost if you decide to do something crazy - crazy fun - like winter camping in an o-tent-ik, a sturdy canvas-sided cabin that can be rented year-round. La Mauricie is 190 kilometres north of Montreal.
Snow tag is on Saturdays by reservation only at 819-538-3232.
Closer to home, Sir George-Etienne Cartier National Historic Site (458 Notre-Dame St. E.) has a Victorian Christmas exhibition.
It comes with a small extra charge: $3.90 per person age six and up, or $9.80 for a family.
Along part of the Lachine Canal National Historic Site (Atwater Ave. and St-Ambroise St.), check out the Christmas Village until Sunday and from Dec. 15 to 17.
Want the Parks Canada experience without having to leave the neighbourhood? Sign your children up for Club Parka, which features tons of prompts for winter fun, like creating toilet-paper binoculars, folding origami birds and making campfire muffins baked in oranges.
Information on La Mauricie, the national historic sites and all things Parks Canada can be found at pc.gc.ca. While the free passes celebrating Canada's 150th birthday expire Dec. 31, parks will offer free admission to those 17 and under starting Jan. 1.
Laval's Marche de Noel runs to Sunday, with 60 artisans, plus activities for the younger set - calash rides, a visit with Santa, makeup and storytelling. There's an igloo to warm up in, and a few favourites for sale: coffee, pea soup and mulled wine. It's at the Centre de la nature, 901 Parc Ave. See laval.ca.
Noel dans le parc runs till Dec. 25 in three parks: Place Emilie-Gamelin, Compagnons de St-Laurent and Lahaie. You can buy a Christmas tree, compare your wool coat with that of a sheep, roast marshmallows over a bonfire or watch Carnaval Abraxas perform circus arts. Check noeldansleparc. com for times and more activities. CHILL The winter break is all about soul food, whether or not your family celebrates a religious holiday. Take it to the next level by dropping the kids off at the grocery store. No, wait, we're not suggesting they stock up for the week - you'll end up with nothing but ketchup and Kraft Dinner (or maybe that's just my house). Provigo offers a host of cooking classes for children or grown-ups, with recipes ranging from full meals to Hanukkah sweets to party food. The cost ranges from $10 to $35. Visit pccookingschool.ca.
You absolutely cannot go wrong with the ballet. If you're worried you'll be bored, think of it as a lovely place to nap with some fabulous background music. At $44 to $149 a pop, The Nutcracker could be the most expensive nap you'll ever take. (We jest - you won't be bored.) It runs from Dec. 14 to 30 at Place des Arts (placedesarts.com).
Or you can see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Nutcracker on the big screen at several movie theatres on Dec. 10. Check cineplex.com for details.
Is panto more your speed? Camelot - complete with three Merlins - plays at Hudson Village Theatre from Dec. 15 to Jan. 7.
Tickets cost $22. For details, visit villagetheatre.ca.
Then it's time for a walk through the ugliest forest you've ever seen. It's actually quite lovely, but Village du Vilain Sapin has embraced last year's much-maligned city tree, installing its ugly little sister on Prince Arthur St. At the foot of the tree is a giant mistletoe and a selfie stick, to immortalize a traditional holiday kiss in view of the ugly tree. Continues to Dec. 23. See facebook.com/villageduvilainsapin. MUSEUMS
Pointe-a-Calliere is calling all armchair managers to Passion: Hockey, celebrating Montreal's bright hockey history (shhh, stop weeping) until March 11. $7 to $17.39 at 350 Place Royale. Visit pacmusee.qc.ca.
Exporail's Railway Christmas runs till Jan. 7 and costs $10 to $20. 110 St-Pierre St., St-Constant. Visit exporail.org.
The Stewart Museum is awash in Santas, and also features the elegant miniature Szalasi Castle, till Jan. 7. Free for age 12 and under, $5 for everyone else, at 20 Tour-del'Isle Rd. See stewart-museum.org.
Step through the looking glass to the Canadian Centre for Architecture's Mirror exhibit, until Jan. 14. Free for students and children, and all on Thursdays, otherwise $7 to $10. 1920 Baile St. Visit cca.qc.ca.
Chateau Ramezay offers baking workshops, the chance to hang stockings and dress up for a selfie as a settler or fur trader. Kids under four get in for free, $5.75 to $11 for everyone else. At 280 Notre-Dame St. E. Visit chateauramezay.qc.ca.
LIGHTS Sometimes it feels like we're fighting the dark from one time change to the next, when what we should be doing is embracing it. The longest night of the year is Dec. 21, and if you're staying awake to celebrate, we have a few ideas to keep you going till the sun's return.
Go to this guy's house: Sami Hajjar has decorated his home with more than 100,000 lights, up from a measly 15,000 last year. The theme is Frozen, and his house at 9035 Jean-Bourdon Ave. comes alive at the top of the hour from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. every day until Jan. 5. See facebook.com/events/341001539681664.
The Ursids meteor shower will be just getting underway - it peaks Dec. 23. Get away from the city lights and huddle up to watch for up to 10 meteors an hour. Keep your eyes somewhere above the Big Dipper, as that's where they originate. The Ursids is a small shower, so if you're looking for something more dramatic, set yourself up overnight Dec. 13 and 14 for the Geminid meteor shower. National Geographic says there will be 60 to 120 shooting stars an hour at peak times - since the moon sets at midnight, those peak times fall in the pre-dawn hours. For a tour of the skies with an expert, join the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada for a public talk with Kevin Kemball at 8 p.m. Dec. 13 before settling in to make wishes on falling stars with other sky fans. Free, 150 des Pins Rd., Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue. Visit rascmontreal.org.
If you want your stars close enough to touch (a dangerous thought), Space for Life's Planetarium is open every day but Mondays. There are two shows to choose from and a host of otherworldly exhibits. Plus, you're right next door to the Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Biodome. Tickets to the Planetarium cost $8 to $20.25. 4801 Pierre-De Coubertin Ave. Visit espacepourlavie.ca.
Enough with stars coming down - here are some going up. The Fire on Ice fireworks display at the Old Port is at 8 p.m. Dec. 16, 23, 30 and Jan. 6. While you're in the Old Port, it will be impossible to miss the Merry Montreal festivities, including live music, activities for children (many of them free), zip lining and skating. It culminates in a New Year's Eve party with more live music, the illumination of the Jacques Cartier Bridge and - you know what we love, Montreal - midnight fireworks.
RELAX Tuckered out yet? This will make you feel better. From our archives, this is a recipe for Truly Decadent Hot Chocolate, from Newsday's Erica Marcus, published in 1999. Serves: 4 to 6
8 oz (250 g) high-quality semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
1/2 cup (125 mL) water
1/4 cup (50 mL) light or dark corn syrup
1/4 cup (50 mL) sugar
2 tbsp (30 mL) butter, softened
6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 L) milk (or half-and-half or cream) 1 Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine water, corn syrup and sugar. Bring just to a boil and pour immediately over the chocolate. Whisk until chocolate is melted and completely integrated, then whisk in butter. (At this point, the mixture can be refrigerated for up to a month.) 2 Place mixture and milk in heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly until very hot, but not boiling. If desired, top with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder. Serve.
For an individual 10-ounce (300 mL) serving, use 2 heaping tbsp (40 mL) of the chocolate base, or to taste. hjuhl@postmedia.com twitter.com/hjuhl

Full text: The Best Canadian Fiction and Poetry of 2017
Transit, by Rachel Cusk (HarperCollins) - In this follow-up to her Scotiabank Giller Prize-shortlisted novel Outline, a woman and her two sons move to London after the end of her marriage. Transit, too, was a finalist for this year's Giller. As reviewer Pasha Malla notes, it's a novel "that should resonate with anyone ... and a story we should all be able to recognize as our own."
The Lonely Hearts Hotel, by Heather O'Neill (HarperCollins) - A love story, between two talented but starcrossed orphans, set in the seedy underbelly of Montreal in the early 20th century. Once again, says reviewer Jack Kirchoff, O'Neill's "narrative [is] wrapped in her eloquent, elevated prose, with her trademark gift for inspired, unusual but totally apt metaphors and similes." The novel proves, he writes, that she's "just getting better and better."
Son of a Trickster, by Eden Robinson (Knopf Canada) - In the first part of a proposed trilogy - and a finalist for the Giller Prize - a young man learns of his unusual parentage. Nathan Whitlock calls it "a black comedy about the irredeemably messed-up life of a teenager in small-town British Columbia."
American War, by Omar El Akkad (McClelland & Stewart) - This debut novel, which was a finalist for the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, presents a nightmarish vision of a fractured America, a century from now, and the ways in which violence changes a person. Lawrence Hill calls it "astounding, gripping and eerily believable."
Lost in September, by Kathleen Winter (Knopf Canada) - A traumatized soldier, who may or may not be General James Wolfe, wanders the streets of present-day Montreal in a novel reviewer Spencer Gordon calls "a touching portrait of a broken man, as well as a considerable addition to the literature of war, of trauma and recovery."
We'll All Be Burnt in Our Beds Some Night, by Joel Thomas Hynes (HarperCollins) - The winner of this year's Governor-General's Literary Award for English-language fiction, in which an ex-con embarks on a cross-country road trip with his girlfriend's ashes, is "a potent and precise manual of how human disasters are made," Alix Hawley says.
"Hynes's gift is in serving up the pieces of the story to fall as they will, leaving you to assemble the smash.
This Accident of Being Lost, by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (House of Anansi) - This collection of songs, stories and poems was a finalist for the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and established Simpson as one of the country's most important new Indigenous voices.
"Her writing educates the reader even as it admits to not having all the answers," Phoebe Wang says. "I welcomed having my assumptions about urban Indigenous people upended, and this is accomplished with the nourishing humour, wisdom and poetic, loose-limbed lines that have been sewn through the stories."
Next Year, For Sure by Zoey Leigh Peterson (Doubleday Canada) - This Giller Prize-longlisted debut, in which a couple explores polyamory, "is a thoughtful, warm meditation on what it means to love, querying our widespread cultural reluctance to expand our definitions beyond traditional narratives and typical pairings," Stacey May Fowles writes.
Bellevue Square, by Michael Redhill (Doubleday Canada) - In the winner of this year's Giller Prize, a woman becomes obsessed with her (possible) doppelganger. "In its taut span of 262 pages, Bellevue Square features several narrative and tonal hairpin turns," José Teodoro writes. "With each of these, our admiration for Redhill's storytelling dexterity burgeons ..." Brother, by David Chariandy (McClelland & Stewart) - This powerful portrait of two brothers growing up in Scarborough in the early 1990s won the the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize. Writes Hannah Sung: "Brother is filled with moments of swagger and bravery, of recklessness and love that sparks against the dull pain of tragedy, which is foretold in elegiac descriptions of the landscape."
The Corpses of the Future, by Lynn Crosbie (House of Anansi) - The risk-taking poet's latest collection, born out of her father's battle with dementia, "is both unswerving in honesty and high in impact," Canisia Lubrin writes. "This 140-page grief-song makes for a most dangerous and essential reading experience."
The Sun and Her Flowers, by Rupi Kaur (Simon & Schuster) - The young writer's first collection, Milk and Honey, catapulted her to global fame; her second collection has been glued to the bestsellers lists since it was published this fall.
"Once again," Mark Medley writes in a profile of Kaur, "her poems explore issues of love, and trauma, and family, and gender, and finding a place in the world."
Bad Endings, by Carleigh Baker (Anvil Press) - This debut collection of stories was a finalist for the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, and winner of the City of Vancouver Book Award. Says Jade Colbert: "Baker, who is Cree-Métis/Icelandic and was raised on Sto:lo territory, writes about the West Coast as an informed guest, a keen observer of contradiction and its implications."
So Much Love, by Rebecca Rosenblum (McClelland & Stewart) - This debut novel focuses on a twentysomething woman's kidnapping and the possibly linked disappearance of a young man, and its effect on the small town where they live. The novel, Marsha Lederman writes, "approaches its subject and tells its characters' stories with so much heart and sharp efficiency that you can sit down with it for a day and feel a shift in the way you look at life. You will not want to put it down."
Minds of Winter, by Ed O'Loughlin (House of Anansi) - A historical epic about the Franklin expedition, among other threads, that skips around the globe, as well as through the decades, was a finalist for this year's Giller Prize. It's a "hugely ambitious novel," Ken McGoogan writes, and O'Loughlin "displays a prodigious imagination in creating, from scratch, one stand-alone scene after another."
My Ariel, by Sina Queyras (Coach House Books) - A meditation on the life and legacy of Sylvia Plath through a "repurposing" of her bestloved work. Writes Phoebe Wang: "Few poets are better equipped than Queyras to plunge into the examination of the figure of Plath as a prototype for female genius. With honesty, humour and passionate attention, she lays bare the gendered conventions that circumscribed Plath's life and how they are still, in new guises, determining her own life as well as that of her female students."
In the Cage, by Kevin Hardcastle (Biblioasis) - A retired mixed-martial artist tries to provide a good life for his wife and young daughter in Hardcastle's debut novel. Writes J.R.
McConvey: "Whether you like a fight or not, chances are, something in this novel will move you. In the Cage is a fierce, beautiful book."
Demi-Gods, by Eliza Robertson (Hamish Hamilton) - This lyrical debut novel explores the troubling and sexually charged relationship, over the years, between two sisters and their step-brothers. Writes Alix Hawley: "[Robertson] juxtaposes grime and glory, from dirty underwear to ocean phosphorescence, to beautifully disturbing effect. Set in the 1950s and 60s, Demi-Gods is atmospheric without historical overload."
Scarborough, by Catherine Hernandez (Arsenal Pulp Press) - An "ambitious collection of intertwined stories" that "tries, valiantly, to render unseen people, finally, seen," according to Hannah Sung, Hernandez brings the Toronto suburb to life by a chorus of diverse voices. A finalist for this year's Toronto Book Award.
The Original Face, by Guillaume Morissette (Esplanade Books) - A "cash-strapped 29-year-old internet artist" is at the heart of Morissette's second novel. Says Jade Colbert: "What makes Morissette's novel different is how Daniel's online life is the content of his real life, not its opposite, and how Morissette conveys this as worthy of the novel's attention, without gimmicks. It's also very, very funny."
The Shoe on the Roof, by Will Ferguson (Simon & Schuster) - A grad student seeks to "cure" three selfdescribed Messiahs in Ferguson's first novel since winning the Giller Prize. Writes Alix Hawley: "Ferguson certainly has a broad comic streak ... but here, the author's true interest is in going into the dark, interrogating the nature of mind, faith, love and reality, and taking the novel down a philosophical road."
Admission Requirements, by Phoebe Wang (McClelland & Stewart) - An assured debut book of poetry, reviewer Stevie Howell calls the collection "a lyrical meditation on identity, migration, family and community" that "announces Wang's incomparable voice and vision, as she proceeds to break new ground on every page."
Fugue States, by Pasha Malla (Knopf Canada) - A tale of two childhood friends who (separately) journey to Kashmir. Writes David B. Hobbs: "What starts as a critique of Canadian culture through the lens of a second-generation family becomes a funny, brutal and strange commentary on the relationship between power and storytelling."
Little Sister, by Barbara Gowdy (HarperCollins) - The owner of a Toronto cinema strangely and inexplicably begins to enter the body of another woman in Gowdy's first novel in a decade. "It is fun and funny and can frequently startle you, breaking your heart with the lovingly observed minutia of everyday experience," José Teodoro says. "Its confluence of the uncanny and the ordinary, of mischief and profundity, at times recalls the books of Haruki Murakami or the films of Woody Allen, but Gowdy's use of quirk as an entrée into psychological depth is most closely akin to the stories of Lorrie Moore. Little Sister is all depth and grace and yet never more than a sentence away from a playful nudge in the ribs."
The Dark and Other Love Stories, by Deborah Willis (Hamish Hamilton) - Reviewer Steven W. Beattie positively compared this second collection of stories to the work of Alice Munro: "Willis's adeptness at modulating the tone and mood of her story owes much to Munro, as does the irony in her collection's title: The Dark is explicitly identified as a love story, although like the 10 pieces that accompany it, the version of love on offer is perilous and liable to shatter at any moment.
Nor is it confined to the arena of romance, although a number of stories do address that aspect of the subject."
The Best Canadian Non-Fiction of 2017
Black Edge: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall Street, by Sheelah Kolhatkar (Random House) - The New Yorker staff writer's exploration of Wall Street trader Steven A. Cohen and the 2008 financial meltdown. "Thrillerish in its construction, terse in its prose, the book is grounded by brilliant reporting and enlivened by Kolhatkar's storytelling nous," Richard Poplak writes.
The Last Word: Reviving the Dying Art of Eulogy, by Julia Cooper (Coach House Books) - This study of how we grieve, born out of her mother's death when the author was just 19, is a "whip-smart rumination on death," reviewer Isabel B.
Slone says. "It feels cathartic to read a book that goes deep on a subject that most people are either too awkward or too polite to broach in pleasant company."
Juliet's Answer: One Man's Search for Love and the Elusive Cure for Heartbreak, by Glenn Dixon (Simon & Schuster) - A memoir of moving to Verona to respond to letters sent to Shakespeare's Juliet. "Dixon has gracefully entered into the tradition of travel writing meets memoir (think Eat, Pray, Love,) and despite his driving belief that he knows so little about the subject, he writes about love with admirable generosity, sensitivity and insight," Stacey May Fowles writes.
The Reconciliation Manifesto: Recovering the Land, Rebuilding the Economy, by Arthur Manuel and Grand Chief Ronald Derrickson (Lorimer) - The late Indigenous activist and leader provides a vital blueprint, which reviewer Carleigh Baker calls "one of the most important texts on truth and reconciliation ever written. The Reconciliation Manifesto is a cogent step-by-step look at how Canada's colonial past created our present situation, and provides decolonizing strategies for the future."
The Reconciliation Manifesto: Recovering the Land, Rebuilding the Economy, by James Maskalyk (Doubleday Canada) - The Toronto doctor's latest memoir, and the winner of this year's Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Non-Fiction, is a book that "captures the viscera, real and symbolic, of the ER - its sights, sounds, smells, pulse - without romanticizing the work," André Picard writes.
Baseball Life Advice: Loving the Game That Saved Me, by Stacey May Fowles (McClelland & Stewart) - A collection of essays celebrating the sport of summer. "Like so many baseball writers, Fowles is at her strongest when she's at her most personal and granular," Eric Andrew-Gee writes. "At its best, it's a catalogue of feeling, from enthusiasm and anger to anxiety and heartache - which is to say it's a book about love."
Arrival: The Story of CanLit, by Nick Mount (House of Anansi) - An in-depth study of Canadian literature through the writers who cemented its reputation. "Mount writes accessible biographies of the major players in this developing universe," David Staines says. "There are many details in the lives one knows, many details one does not know and his enterprise is a kaleidoscope of fascinating people who shaped our country's growth into a literature respected around the world."
Too Much and Not the Mood, by Durga Chew-Bose (HarperCollins) - A sharp collection of essays from an essential new voice. Writes Stacey May Fowles: "The reader knows immediately that this collection is the product of an observant and inventive mind, someone with a knack for breaking down big ideas and expanding on minor details in a way that makes them meaningful - even revelatory."
The Whisky King: The Remarkable True Story of Canada's Most Infamous Bootlegger and the Undercover Mountie on his Trail, by Trevor Cole (HarperCollins) - Rollicking historical true crime from an awardwinning novelist. Says Taras Grescoe: "The Whisky King has got it all: poison hooch in blind pigs, liquor orgies with double-crossing dames, shootouts in chicken coops. This is superb non-fiction, by a writer at the top of his game."
The Hand-Over: How Bigwigs and Bureaucrats Transferred Canada's Best Publisher and the Best Part of Our Literary Heritage to a Foreign Multinational, by Elaine Dewar (Biblioasis) - How did the famed Canadian publishing house McClelland & Stewart wind up controlled by a German conglomerate? Roy MacSkimming writes that Dewar has "written a case study in public-interest journalism, showing how to break a story open by refusing to be cowed by power and refusing to take no for an answer."
I Hear She's A Real Bitch, by Jen Agg (Doubleday Canada) - The Toronto restaurateur's first book is part memoir, part manifesto, but a must-read. "If a generation of cooks followed Kitchen Confidential into the industry on the promised glory of good times and hard living," Chantal Braganza writes, "for largely different reasons - because restaurant ownership is so desperately lacking in diversity, and because kitchen culture could sure use a change - with hope, I Hear She's a Real Bitch will do the same."
Birds Art Life, by Kyo Maclear (Doubleday Canada) - The novelist and picture-book author offers an introspective memoir of birding and the artistic life. The book, Stacey May Fowles says, "finds beauty and enjoyment in unlikely places, and contentment in the smallest things - from the flight of a bird to the love of a parent to the sweetness of a song." Curry: Eating, Reading, and Race, by Naben Ruthnum (Coach House Books) - An exploration of food, ethnicity and fiction. "Ruthnum marries his sarcastic wit with fascinating history and prescient observations about pop-culture representations of Indian-ness," writes Manisha Aggarwal-Schifellite, who adds that the "book is an engaging and entertaining examination of fiction and his voice is a welcome addition to the discussion. He doesn't boast to have all the answers, but he has a few solutions."
Out Standing in the Field: A Memoir by Canada's First Female Infantry Officer, by Sandra Perron (Cormorant Books) - A "revealing and moving memoir" by Canada's first female combat soldier. Says Matti Friedman: "Perron writes like a combat soldier - factual, direct and close to the ground, a style that is effective in getting her experience across without artifice."
Run, Hide, Repeat: A Memoir of a Fugitive Childhood, by Pauline Dakin (Viking) - You think your childhood was weird? Dakin, a longtime CBC reporter, has you beat.
Jade Colbert calls it "a well-paced and engrossing memoir" that "describes the isolating effects of a childhood on the run and a young adulthood spent constantly looking over her shoulder."
One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter, by Scaachi Koul (Doubleday Canada) - A hilarious, acerbic and surprisingly emotional collection of essays that tackles everything from sexism to self-care. "She weaves stories, which through their cultural uniqueness and specificity, become universal and applicable to all," Zarqa Nawaz writes.
Hoover: An Extraordinary Life in Extraordinary Times, by Kenneth Whyte (Knopf) - The Herbert Hoover story is a distinctly American tale: persistence, ambition, grand plans played out over five continents and marked by three economic crises. "Whyte serves as a learned but inviting tour guide to this extraordinary life," reviewer David Shribman writes, "bringing a fresh eye and fresh perspective to an engineer who balked at social engineering, a man of great repute until he defeated Al Smith for president and then watched his reputation be dissipated and then destroyed."
Game Change: The Life and Death of Steve Montador, and the Future of Hockey, by Ken Dryden (Signal) - A deep piece of investigative journalism that chronicles the emotional rise and quick demise of one of hockey's many tragic figures. Here, reviewer Brett Popplewell writes, is Dryden, one of hockey's most celebrated goalies, "reclaiming his place among this country's deepest sports writers." To Dryden, he adds, "Montador's story is the story of modern hockey. That of a grinder who sacrificed everything for the game."
The Unfinished Dollhouse: A Memoir of Gender and Identity, by Michelle Alfano (Cormorant Books) - The author shares the bitingly personal, viscerally honest story of dealing with her child's transition. Reviewer Michael Coren says "it must have been a supremely difficult book to write, because she is a participant rather than a spectator, and as the mother of a girl is involved at the most intimate level with every aspect of Frankie finding resolution as a man. ... At its core is the timeless message of absolute and unconditional love."
Gutenberg's Fingerprint: Paper, Pixels and the Lasting Impression of Books, by Merilyn Simonds (ECW) - Gutenberg's Fingerprint does for our books what Margaret Visser's Much Depends on Dinner did for the food on our plates, reviewer Michael Harris writes: "Each ingredient is revealed in all its complicated glory, with sections on paper, type, ink, presses and finished books." Ultimately, he says, "Simonds's work is less a celebration of bookmaking and more a celebration of the base human instinct for storytelling, for the sacredness of expression in whatever form.
Sean Rogers's Favourite Comics and Graphic Novels of 2017 Everything is Flammable, by Gabrielle Bell (Uncivilized Books) - When her mother's house burns down in the wilderness of northern California, Bell travels cross-country to help get her back on her feet.
Prodding at sore memories and quizzing misfit neighbours, Bell finds ample fuel for her intimate, scrupulous diary comics.
Hostage, by Guy Delisle, translated by Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) - In detailing a Médecins sans frontières staffer's captivity in the Caucasus, Delisle dwells expansively on what keeps us human, even in the most straitened of circumstances. This claustrophobic portrayal of a man confined to a room for months on end is also, paradoxically, a riveting action comic.
My Favorite Thing is Monsters, by Emil Ferris (Fantagraphics) - Ferris's remarkable debut is many things - a detective yarn, a Holocaust survivor's tale, a coming-out story - but most obviously, it's a treat for the eyes. With her resonant pastiches of monster movies and modernist masters, the artist joins the first rank of cartoonists.
Pretending is Lying, by Dominique Goblet, translated by Sophie Yanow (New York Review Comics) - Goblet's expressionist reflections on fraught relationships - with her aloof partner and alcoholic father, especially - look tattered by life, distorted by volatile emotions and hazy recollections. Released in French a decade ago, Goblet's groundbreaking work still feels raw and new.
Songy of Paradise, by Gary Panter (Fantagraphics) - The punk art pioneer follows up his versions of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory by adapting John Milton's Paradise Regained, irreverently replacing the Son of God with a truculent bumpkin. Every oversized page is a marvel, fervent and visionary and bitterly funny.
Jade Colbert's Favourite Canadian Small-Press Books of 2017
Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death, and Hard Truths in a Northern City, by Tanya Talaga (House of Anansi) - The funding gap between Indigenous and Canadian children is the federal government's responsibility. Talaga's book is about how this gap kills Indigenous kids.
Though set in Thunder Bay, it's a national story and a national disgrace. Canadians need to listen.
Dr. Bethune's Children, by Xue Yiwei, translated by Darryl Sterk (Linda Leith Publishing) - An unsuccessful attempt at an "authentic" biography of Canadian physician Norman Bethune leaves a Chinese writer (who, like the author, lives in Montreal) musing on the lost children of the Cultural Revolution. A Canadian novel on a shared Canadian-Chinese legacy.
The Clothesline Swing, by Ahmad Danny Ramadan (Nightwood Editions) - Scheherazade keeping Death at bay, an old man feeds stories to his dying lover nearly four decades after they fled Syria in 2012.
A love letter to storytelling and to gay Damascus, Ramadan's novel is a moving portrait of life in exile.
Sputnik's Children, by Terri Favro (ECW) - Favro channels childhood anxieties about the threat of nuclear attack into this novel about a possible alternative Cold War. Influenced heavily by a comic-book aesthetic, beneath the taut, fun storyline of Sputnik's Children is sharp social commentary.
The Bone Mother, by David Demchuk (ChiZine) - There are fabulous beings and then there are monsters.
The horror in Demchuk's novel (the first horror book nominated for the Giller) is that the monsters of the Second World War come to presentday Canada. "Some stories need to be told time and again."
Jade Colbert's Favourite Debuts of 2017
Ghachar Ghochar, by Vivek Shanbhag, translated by Srinath Perur (Penguin) - A deceptively simple story about a man from Bangalore, India, whose family sponges off an uncle's spice business that turns out to have been ghachar ghochar ("irredeemably tangled") in something much darker all along. The startling English-language debut of Kannada writer Shanbhag.
Things We Lost in the Fire, by Mariana Enriquez, translated by Megan McDowell (Hogarth) - One of two high-profile English debuts by female Argentinian writers in 2017 (the other, another McDowell translation, Fever Dream), Enriquez's gothic collection disinters skeletons from Argentina's Dirty War, but most haunting of all is the country's present.
Kintu, by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Transit Books) - A curse unleashed in 1750 comes down on members of a Ganda clan, forcing a scattered family to come together and allowing author Makumbi an excellent premise for a novel addressing the workings of history in multifaceted modern Uganda.
The Accusation: Forbidden Stories from Inside North Korea, by Bandi, translated by Deborah Smith (House of Anansi) - J'accuse! Billed as the first work of fiction by someone still living in North Korea (under a penname meaning "firefly"), Bandi's collection set during the Arduous March of the early 1990s is understated, detail-rich, full of pathos and incredibly brave.
Dead Reckoning: How I Came to Meet the Man Who Murdered My Father, by Carys Cragg (Arsenal Pulp Press) - Twenty years after her father's death, Cragg opened contact with his murderer, seeking answers only he could provide. Cragg's search for truth opens important questions on victim's rights, the nature of justice and how to repair harm.
Margaret Cannon's Favourite Crime Fiction of 2017
The Thirst, by Jo Nesbo (Random House Canada) - Harry Hole has left the force, determined to lead a quiet life and please his lover. But then a case comes that only Norway's lone serial killer specialist can solve. Two completely disparate women have been murdered and the only clue is that they were both registered on Tinder. Great gumshoe novel and one of Nesbo's best ever.
Glass Houses, by Louise Penny (Minotaur Books) - A shadowy figure appears on the square in Three Pines. Everyone sees it, but no one speaks. What they all sense is a deep feeling of dread. When a dead body appears, no one is surprised. Penny's best book so far.
The Child Finder, by Rene Denfeld (HarperCollins) - A child is lost.
After three years, and an exhaustive police search, her parents are desperate for an answer. Dead or alive, they want to know what happened.
They call in Naomi, a child finder, who represents their last chance.
This is a great debut by a brilliant new talent.
The Midnight Sun, by Cecilia Ekback (HarperCollins) - Ekback made a spectacular debut with Wolf Winter, a novel of suspense set in the north of Sweden in 1850. The Midnight Sun takes us back to the same hamlet where the mountains seem fraught with dread and death is always just an accident away. The sequel is almost (but not quite) better than its predecessor.
The Borrowed, by Chan Ho-kei, translated by Jeremy Tiang (House of Anansi) - A series of six novellas, each featuring a case for Kwan Chun-dok, "the Eye of Heaven" who can solve a case while he's in a coma. The novellas cover a 50-year career in reverse order staring in 2013. The ratiocination is great but along the way we get some insight into the culture and history of Hong Kong. There are touches of Sherlock Holmes and the legendary Chinese detective Judge Dee, but it's really Hong Kong that's the star.
Shannon Ozirny's Favourite Young Adult Books of 2017 The Marrow Thieves, by Cherie Dimaline (Dancing Cat Books) - Every year there is a genius book that no one sees coming. In 2017, it was The Marrow Thieves. Winner of the Governor-General's Literary Award and the Kirkus Prize, this wrenching and gutsy apocalypse story from an Indigenous perspective is a legitimate gamechanger.
That Inevitable Victorian Thing, by E.K. Johnston (Dutton Books for Young Readers) - Johnston is a literary chameleon and staggeringly versatile. This year she took on an alternate history that plunges present-day Muskoka into the Victorian era, while still incorporating some breathtaking modern twists.
Undefeated: Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian School Football Team, by Steve Sheinkin (Roaring Brook Press) - A master of finding unbelievable stories in the heart of forgotten histories, Sheinkin tells the true story of Jim Thorpe, one of the world's greatest and unknown athletes. You won't be able to stop talking about this book.
The Agony of Bun O'Keefe, by Heather Smith (Penguin Teen) - The nostalgia you feel when reading this novel about a Nova Scotia girl who finds herself homeless feels like the piercing first notes of those 1980s Hinterland Who's Who animal commercials. Painful, gorgeous and deeply Canadian.
The Hate U Give, by Angie Thomas (Balzer + Bray) - Thomas's debut shattered the YA ceiling and was the book everyone had to read this year - with good reason. Rooted in racism and tragedy, it's also a touching, hilarious story of family.
Worth the hype, and then some.
Marissa Stapley's Favourite Commercial Fiction of 2017
We All Love the Beautiful Girls, by Joanne Proulx (Viking) - This is the book I'm recommending to everyone this year - especially friends in book clubs. Beautiful, searing and relevant - shatteringly so, more so every day - this novel explores the unravelling of a marriage when tragedy strikes. But it's about more than marriage, more than this family alone. It's also about the dangers of toxic masculinity, the power imbalance between the sexes and why doing something about these things matters.
Hum If You Don't Know the Words, by Bianca Marais (G.P. Putnam's Sons) - Written with grace and compassion by a debut Canadian novelist, this book was comforting and enlightening at the same time. It's set in South Africa during apartheid and shines a light on the often vicious unrest of the 1976 Soweto uprisings while offering a balm in the form of a tender relationship formed out of necessity and heartache between a British child and her Xhosa caregiver.
All Grown Up, by Jami Attenberg (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) - Attenberg is an understated master and this was one of the most authentic works I read all year, a perfect book about an imperfect character navigating her late 30s with none of the things she thought she'd have - husband, house, glittering career as an artist - when she was perhaps not naive but at least more optimistic. And yet, there is hope in this often dark novel that feels like being told everything, absolutely everything, about a stranger - and knowing you understand her completely as she walks away.
This Is How It Always Is, by Laurie Frankel (Flatiron Books) - This novel about a transgender girl growing up in a rowdy family of boys is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the agony and beauty of being this child - or of being her parents. (As for those who don't want to understand? Try to convince just one of those people to read this and you'll have made the world a better place.) And although this is a novel with a message, it's not heavy-handed. It reads like a family caper - think The Royal Tenenbaums or Commonwealth - and is truly unforgettable for both its plot and its compassion for its subjects.
The Orphan's Tale, by Pam Jenoff (Mira) - Set in German-occupied Netherlands during the Second World War, this book begins when 17-year-old Noa, heartbroken after being forced to give up her child, finds a railway car filled with orphaned Jewish infants.
Her impulsive decision to take one of the babies sets the story in motion. She must flee and ends up joining a travelling circus, which is the perfect backdrop for this evocative story about the power of love.
Anna Fitzpatrick's Favourite Picture Books of 2017
How To Make Friends with a Ghost, by Rebecca Green (Tundra Books) - More adorable than spooky, more funny than creepy, this picture book written as a howto guide will appeal to sensitive and introverted children who can still appreciate a few good grossout jokes.
Yak and Dove, by Kyo Maclear and Esme Shapiro (Tundra Books) - Whimsical watercolours accompany this trio of tales about two creatures who are so different they can only be best friends. The sheer attention paid to world-building and background characters makes one hope this book is just the first in a new series.
Seamus's Short Story, by Heather Hartt-Sussman and Milan Pavlovic (Groundwood Books) - Hartt-Sussman takes an imaginative and lighthearted approach to this story about self-expression and gender identity, in which frustrated Seamus starts dressing up in his mother's high heels in order to experience life as a taller person.
Olivia the Spy, by Ian Falconer (Atheneum/Caitlyn Dlouhy Books) - Olivia the pig is back and as plucky and self-assured as ever. Although she is typically one to stand out, here she is on a mission to blend in. The results, which include disguising herself as a Rothko and crashing the ballet, are pure Olivia.
The Gold Leaf, by Kirsten Hall and Matthew Forsythe (Enchanted Lion Books) - Delicate and intricate illustrations - including actual gold leafing technique - bring to life this simple story about animals in the forest learning about the futility in trying to own a piece of nature.
The Best International Fiction of 2017
The End of Eddy, by Édouard Louis, translated by Michael Lucey (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) - A different side of France is shown in a story of brutality and violence, of small minds and profound sexism and homophobia. Reviewer Bert Archer calls it "the ground-level story of a new subversive force in the West, born of an abandoned working class, that's fuelling a whole new kind of revolution." Ultimately, "Louis doesn't dwell too much on the abstract. His France is a brutal France, and one that takes pleasure in its brutality." Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders (Random House) The Man Booker Prize winner, Saunders's first novel is an imaginative work about a haunted Abraham Lincoln and a singular piece of American storytelling. "Saunders's brilliance," reviewer John Semley says, "emerges in his understanding that it is not just our status as walking, talking, thinking, bleeding human beings that unites us, but our sorrow." He adds that "Saunders offers the faint, phantasmal hope that a nation long dead may somehow redeem itself; that America may yet howl back triumphantly, from somewhere beyond the grave."
The Redemption of Galen Pike, by Carys Davies (Biblioasis) - The Welsh writer's latest short-story collection tends toward elliptical titles: Jubilee, Myth, Bonnet, Precious, Creed. "She forces her reader to pay close attention and frequently to fill in the blanks in stories that often circle around their central subject," reviewer Steven W. Beattie writes. "This requires a deft hand and superb control, and Davies evinces both; the stories in The Redemption of Galen Pike are tiny marvels of technique and language."
Forest Dark, by Nicole Krauss (HarperCollins) - A suspenseful novel that explores the lives of an American writer and a missing lawyer. Of Nicole Krauss's first novel since her 2010 National Book Award finalist Great House, reviewer José Teodoro says he "felt grateful" for a non-linear journey "through insightful and sometimes moving meditations on marriage and its myriad pitfalls, through the pleasures of secrets, hoaxes and multiverses and the perils of the solipsism that accompany such pondering."
Manhattan Beach, by Jennifer Egan (Scribner) - The Pulitzer Prize-winning author tackles the well-worn themes of precarious familial bonds, secrets and lies, love and lust, abandonment and individualism. "What is revelatory," reviewer Stacey May Fowles writes, "is how beautifully drawn, vivid and moving this familiar setup is when crafted by Egan's skilled hand. Although the basic structure and setting is perhaps standard, her talent renders it anew - making Manhattan Beach a sparkling, lush epic of a novel."
Homesick for Another World, by Ottessa Moshfegh (Penguin Press) - Unflinching, brutally honest stories that are the chilling opposite of the author's comforting previous effort.
"Homesick for Another World tends to subvert likeability at every turn, populated as it is by characters who are rash, desperate, ill-advised and self-destructive," reviewer Pasha Malla writes. "Readers will feel implicated in their foibles, often painfully. But these unflinching, brutally honest stories accomplish what fiction is meant to do." The Golden House, by Salman Rushdie (Knopf Canada) - His new urgent novel is the story of Nero Golden, a business mogul of dubious character who flees his unnamed hometown, along with his three sons, after the tragic death of his wife. "On the one hand, I was trying to write a big social novel," Rushdie told Mark Medley in an interview. "But I was also trying to write right up against the present moment. And that's a risky thing, I think, to do - for anybody - if you want to write a book that endures." Exit West, by Mohsin Hamid (Riverhead) - The Man Booker finalist is a quietly exquisite novel about a couple fleeing their wartorn country for a better life.
Reviewer Omar El Akkad calls it "a masterpiece of humanity and restraint." He adds that "the novel's core is something more fundamental than the whims of politics - an exploration of human needs so universal, they elevate Exit West from a product of our time to something timeless." 4 3 2 1, by Paul Auster (McClelland & Stewart) - Almost four novels in one about four different Archie Fergusons and their splintered destinies. Reviewer José Teodoro finds the Man Booker shortlisted work "pretty long-winded, indulging in lists and quasi-Knausgaardian minutia and occasionally working in March of Time-like chronicles of sweeping historic events." But readers should carry on. "The investment pays off. And I suspect it only pays off as well as it does in part because of the book's sprawl" The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, by Arundhati Roy (Hamish Hamilton) - Roy's new novel 20 years after winning the Booker Prize explores the harrowing and complicated aspects of love. Reviewer Durga Chew-Bose says that "to read Roy is to build a sense of wonder, incrementally. To ask questions not of what we we're seeing of late, but what we've been staring at the whole time." She also recommends becoming more familiar with Roy.
"It's vital to have at least some sense of her non-fiction; in other words, the past two decades of Roy's work."
The Best International Non-Fiction of 2017
Age of Anger: A History to the Present, by Pankaj Mishra (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) - A history of our present world gone mad, with the author tasking himself with theorizing the source of that rage below the peaks of Trump and Brexit. "Mishra is hardly the first to identify anger as the spirit of the times," reviewer Michael Lapointe writes, "but his book is distinguished by its dogged pursuit of that spirit into its modern origins." Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body, by Roxane Gay (Harper) - A profoundly honest account of what it's like to be a woman of size. Reviewer Carly Lewis calls Hunger "one of the most honest texts ever published by a woman in a body of size." She adds that "claiming the space in which to write fiercely about her body, when so few narratives in pop culture's body-acceptance arena are genuine - earned - is powerful." Between Them: Remembering My Parents, by Richard Ford (HarperCollins) - A collection of two essays on family written 30 years apart, the first focused more on his father, the second on his mother.
Ford calls it "an act of love," reviewer Emily Donaldson writes.
"That said, any notion of it as nonliterary endeavour is undermined by Ford's characteristically elegant prose, his unassuming but sweetly profound phraseology." World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, by Franklin Foer (Penguin Press) - An exploration of the dangers of tech monopolies and the grim future of intellectual life in an online world. "Foer is smart and trenchant when he attacks," reviewer Michael Harris writes. His solutions are urgent. "The alternative, argues Foer, is an Orwellian morass controlled by a handful of thought authorities." What Happened, by Hillary Rodham Clinton (Simon & Schuster) - The candidate offers her take on the events that led to the most consequential political upset in recent American history.
Reviewer Rachel Giese found that her postmortem "doesn't offer new revelations or theories, but it's still worthwhile." Because "with her guard now down, Clinton is fierce and few are spared." American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road, by Nick Bilton (Portfolio) - A gripping account of the rise and fall of the internet's most notorious black market. Reviewer Richard Poplak called it an "astonishingly wellresearched narrative" and said that Bilton's book "will surely emerge as the definitive account of the Silk Road saga."
The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit, by Michael Finkel (Knopf) - A stunning account of one man's obsessive withdrawal from society. "Finkel finds a way, in a brief 190 pages, to bring us well beyond the mere facts of the case," reviewer Michael Harris writes. It is, ultimately, "a meditation on the pains of social obligation and the longing toward retreat that resides in us all."
Killers of the Flowers Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, by David Grann (Doubleday) - An exhaustive investigation into the 1920s conspiracy to wipe out the Osage tribe in oil-rich northern Oklahoma. Reviewer Dean Jobb describes Grann as "obsessed with finding any cold-case evidence that could still be gleaned from yellowing documents and fading memories." The result is a masterful tale that "ensures these brutal crimes will never again be forgotten."
The River of Consciousness, by Oliver Sacks (Knopf Canada) - In this posthumous collection of essay, Sacks revisits a variety of old ideas, from Charles Darwin's underappreciated writings on botany to the contrast between Borgesian and Humean models of time. Reviewer José Teodoro finds the through-line between essays, discovering that "the sole unifying theme is Sacks's unmistakable voice and dizzying array of interests. Which is precisely what imbues this book with such wonder."
Afterglow: A Dog Memoir, by Eileen Myles (Grove Press) - A meditation on the life and death of the author's beloved Rosie the pit bull. "It is not pleasant to visualize how a sweet pit bull named Rosie withered," reviewer Carly Lewis writes, "but it is in this portrayal of decline that the love story gains muscle."

Full text: A large section of land collapsed on Sunday a few metres from a singlefamily home on the banks of the Richelieu River in the Monteregie region.
The house was vacant when the landslide occurred on Sunday morning in St-Roch-de-Richelieu, about 50 kilometres northeast of Montreal, so there were no injuries and no buildings were swept away.
But because of the size of the land that collapsed and the risk that the house could be swept away if another landslide occurs, civilprotection and fire prevention authorities from the Quebec Public Safety Department recommended to local authorities on Sunday that the two residents not be allowed to go back home.
The house was four metres from the hole on Monday morning, and land continued to slide into the Richelieu River, according to Jean-Sebastien Forest, the regional director of Securite civile et de la Securite incendie pour la Monteregie-L'Estrie. Neighbouring homes are not threatened, he added.
Firefighters and engineers working for the Quebec government were working to empty the threatened home on Monday. The case will be submitted for financial aid, but it was unknown if there will be an attempt to save the building or whether it can be done safely.
Heavy precipitation could have contributed to the landslide, Forest said.

Full text: Is this the end of the Great Canadian winter? A new report says that even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, all of Canada is projected to get warmer by the end of the century, while the number of 30C plus days per year are predicted to "explode" under the current global warming trajectory.
The report by climatologists at the University of Winnipeg-based Prairie Climate Centre looks at how temperature and precipitation are likely to change under two hypothetical warming scenarios: a "low-carbon" one that assumes emissions will slow, and a high-carbon scenario that assumes the opposite - "that humanity will continue to emit more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere well into the future."
"It is of course urgently necessary that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the most dire climate-change consequences, but we must also accept the reality that at least some climate-change impacts are all but guaranteed," writes climate-change researcher Ryan Smith.
How much warmer and wetter will our future climate be? According to a series of maps produced by the Prairie centre climatologists: Under a high-carbon scenario, in some months the Arctic is projected to warm by more than 12 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Sea ice and snow reflect unwanted solar energy back into space. Without it, the open ocean would absorb sunlight, speeding the rate of global warming. The months of December and January are projected to warm faster than the month of June.
Warmer winters might sound marvellous, but they make it easier for agricultural and forest pests to survive winter. Cold winters are also vital for winter roads relied upon by "tens of thousands of Canadians," including First Nations. Southern Canada is expected to get wetter through the spring, fall and winter - increasing the risks of the kind of flooding that soaked swaths of Ontario and Quebec this year - but much drier in summer, increasing drought and wildfire risks.
The modelling was based on two 30-year future periods - 2021 to 2050, and 2051 to 2080, using 12 different climate models. The researchers used an average of the models.
Overall, the globe is projected to warm by two to three degrees Celsius by 2051 to 2080, compared to 12 degrees or more for some places in the Canadian High Arctic, assuming the highcarbon future we're trending towards, Smith said in an email.
Toronto's summers are projected to warm by four degrees Celsius by 2051 to 2080 in a high-carbon scenario; in comparison, its winters are projected to warm five degrees Celsius. Churchill summers will warm by 3.5 degrees Celsius; its winters by nine degrees.
While Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal are warming at a slower rate (at least compared to the Canadian Arctic), the warming is still "dramatic and worrisome," Smith said. "Even a few degrees of average temperature change can lead to a drastic climate change."
For example, Toronto currently averages 12 days per year that reach or exceed 30C. By 2051-2080, under the high-carbon modelling, that number is projected to rise to 55.
"Sometimes the 'average mean temperature change'can be very misleading, especially when we talk of only a few degrees of change," Smith said. "The reality is that small changes in the mean add up to big changes in the extremes."
Why is winter changing, and projected to change more? There's an energy deficit during winter, Smith explained. Longer nights and shorter days mean energy is being lost to space. Greenhouse gases stop this escaping heat.
"More simply: we cool off at night, and nights are longer in the winter, and greenhouse gases prevent the planet from cooling off," Smith said.
The less snow the less reflective the surface. "As soon as you get the snow cover gone, boom, it warms up really quickly, because the sun gets absorbed by the ground," said Danny Blair, a University of Winnipeg professor of geography and director of science at the Prairie Climate Centre. "Winter, in our future, is going to be very different from the past," he said. Winters will get not just warmer, but wetter.
The researchers were also struck by the projected average drying and warming in the summer months across the Prairies and into Alberta and B.C., with 20-per-cent drops in precipitation in some regions. "That spells trouble," said Blair. Drought and forest fires "are even more so going to be a problem in our future."
Under the high-carbon, far future scenario, the number of hot days "is just going to explode. It's scary," Blair said.
Near the end of the century, summers in southern Ontario will have, on average, more than 80 days of 30C plus - the climate of Nebraska or northern Texas.

Full text: Around 7:30 p.m. on July 6, 2013, Surete du Quebec crime-scene investigator Steven Montembeault boarded a helicopter from a dock in Lac-Megantic, hovered above the town's namesake lake and flew toward its downtown core.
Onboard with a pilot, co-pilot and another police officer, Montembeault was in charge of capturing the area from above with a hand-held camera. He flew over rows of houses, passing fields and forests below. Mountains could be seen in the distance.
As he turned his camera toward downtown Lac-Megantic, it captured a different view: large plumes of dark smoke extending upward, with northeast winds blowing them sideways.
A large smouldering crater could be seen. The land around it was scorched and blackened. Zooming in, Montembeault could see firefighters still hosing down active flames. A dozen punctured and stained tank cars were piled up nearby.
Visible through the smoke was what looked like a large grid burnt into the soil.
"I believe that was the Dollarama," Montembeault told jurors watching the 14-minute video at the Sherbrooke courthouse on Monday, giving them a sense of the explosion's scale and extent of its material damage.
Montembeault, now retired, was testifying during the first day of the trial of the three railway employees charged in the 2013 train derailment. The runaway train barrelled into Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people and destroying its downtown core.
Flanked by their defence teams, train driver Thomas Harding, 56, traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, and manager of train operations Jean Demaitre, 53, stood one after the other Monday to enter not-guilty pleas to the one charge they face: criminal negligence causing the death of 47 people.
Family members of the victims and people who survived the night in Lac-Megantic were in attendance, attentive and taking notes.
Quebec Superior Court Justice Gaetan Dumas reminded jurors that the trial is not a "royal commission." Nor is it the trial of the railway company, Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway. The company will stand trial at a later date.
It is the trial of three men, Dumas said, instructing jurors to consider each accused's own conduct.
Prosecutor Veronique Beauchamp then outlined the Crown's case against the three men - if it weren't for their negligent actions and omissions, she said, the 47 victims would not have died.
For Demaitre, the supervisor on duty that night, the Crown intends to prove he was informed of mechanical issues on the lead locomotive on July 5, 2013, but failed to do anything about it.
Later that night, the train, carrying tanks filled with crude oil, was parked 10 kilometres uphill from Lac-Megantic in neighbouring Nantes when a fire started in one of the locomotives.
Informed of the situation, Beauchamp said, Demaitre decided to send a single track-maintenance employee to look into it.
After learning the fire was extinguished, Demaitre never verified if someone had gone to check if the train had been properly secured for the rest of the night, she added.
"On the contrary," Beauchamp said, Demaitre told a colleague he was looking for a place in his home where he didn't have reception on his cellphone.
As for Harding, the Crown said the jury will be presented with regulations and expertise showing he applied a "clearly insufficient" number of handbrakes on the train before leaving it in Nantes for the night and taking a taxi to a Lac-Megantic hotel.
"A simple test as called for by the applicable rules would have allowed him to notice the insufficiency and correct it," Beauchamp said.
Labrie, for his part, never asked Harding if he had applied enough handbrakes, the Crown said, even though he was the rail traffic conductor on duty that night and spoke to him before the derailment.
"Unfortunately, this question came too late," Beauchamp told jurors. Roughly an hour after Harding reached his hotel, the train started rolling downhill toward Lac-Megantic.
The trial is expected to last three months. Besides the 36 Crown witnesses - a mix of police officers, civilians and one railway expert - the jury will also hear extensive recordings of the railway company's internal communication system from the night of the derailment.
Those recordings will include a conversation between Labrie and Harding following the derailment.
"You should note Richard Labrie's silence," Beauchamp said, "when Thomas Harding indicates that he applied seven brakes on five locomotives, one remote-control car, and 73 train cars weighing 10,287 tonnes and left at the top of a slope." jfeith@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jessefeith

Full text: The weather tomorrow will be cloudy, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, or variably cloudy.
It could also be cloudy with scattered showers, light showers, thundershowers or a chance of showers.
It might be clear with a 40 per cent possibility of precipitation, or partly clear, or cloudy with sunny periods, sunny with rainy patches, or increasingly overcast with light, drizzling rain turning to heavy fog, and the possibility of a violent thunderstorm ... followed by flash flooding, a summer frost warning, a solar eclipse, a meteor shower and a monsoon microburst mini-tsunami that damages 10,000 trees.
Welcome to Montreal 2017, a schizophrenic summer when the daily weather forecast usually shows a picture of the sun ... hidden by a dark cloud, a lightning bolt, a fog patch and a plague of locusts.
Not to mention a burst of orange, warning of a possible Trump outburst.
Environment Canada has dubbed this summer "The Big Wet" for Eastern Canada, so I called my wonderful old pal there, senior climatologist David Phillips to find out why.
Phillips generously spent some hours crunching Montreal numbers for me and discovered that our weather has been even worse than we thought. For instance: ?? He says 2017 has been the second rainiest year - and the third rainiest summer - since they started keeping Montreal weather records back in 1871. ?? From the beginning of May to last Wednesday we had 59 days with rain and 17 additional overcast days with a "trace" of rain. ?? Overall, three out of four summer days were officially "wet," with gloomy forecasts that probably made you cancel your beach plans and stay home to study your radar app.
"Hey honey! I think I see a nice, fluffy, white cloud out here between this cumulonimbus lenticular low-altitude rain front and that Stradivarius cirrus nearus microburst tornado.
"We may have 13 minutes of sun coming. Let's go slip in one hole of golf."
It's not just the wet days affecting us, says Phillips, it's the absence of dry ones. Last year we had an 11-day stretch of gorgeous sunny days and five other stretches of five sunny days each.
This year? The longest Montreal spell without rain was one four-day stretch in July ... and we called that "summer."
Finally, the temperature's only broke 30 degrees on three days, compared to last summer's 18. No, you didn't dream it; only two weekends all summer have been rain-free.
Despite the bad weather we did our best to find our inner summer. We jogged and cycled in the rain, swam in icy lakes and got soaked at the St-Laurent Street Fair, which was three parts water and one part festival.
We rushed out between storms to seize seven sunny minutes on a terrasse, clutching our own umbrella under the restaurant's sun umbrella.
We spent more time talking about the weather than enjoying it, which makes sense. When I spent a year in Los Angeles, no one ever talked about the weather. That's because a typical L.A. forecast sounds like this: "Tomorrow's forecast will be extremely sunny with exceptionally blue skies, just like yesterday and tomorrow ... And that was today's weather! "Now let's go to a special halfhour edition of the Forest Fire Report."
Instead of constantly talking weather, Los Angelenos spend that extra time doing other things, like writing TV shows, making movies and creating Hollywood.
Yet it's not just the weather getting under our skin. It's us. This summer has created more and more weather-obsessed fanatics. They spend their days huddled over their screens, comparing 17 different weather sites. They study the dew point, wind speed and humidex index, along with the P.O.P., the S.O.B. and the W.E.T.
They have the vocabulary of meteorologists and are often weather-chondriacs who fear stepping out of the house if there's one cloud in the sky. Conversations with them can be dangerous.
You: "Looks like rain, eh?" Them: "Actually, my Stormchaser radar app shows rain in 37.3 minutes, but clearing briefly after 14.3 minutes for some possible alto-cumulus calm. However, there's a bombogenesis front forming with possible mesocylconic, wreckhouse winds showing a helicity factor of 14,000 hPa and a .000056 per cent chance of a microburst EF2 tornado.
"In fact, I'm seeing a severe gust of derecho wind approaching in 33 seconds. I think we'd better head to the basement."
In fairness, Canada is the home of weather extremes so it's easy to become addicted to the forecast. According to one U.S. study of 160 countries, weather takes up 229 per cent more space in Canadian media than elsewhere on the planet.
Our biggest competition comes from Australia, where people now spend far more time on internet weather sites than on porn sites. I know, I know, I'm guilty of weather porn addiction myself in this column, so I'm going to stop right now and not say another word ... until tomorrow. Have a cold and rainy week, and remember: August showers bring September thundershowers. Joshfreed49@gmail.com

How harsh has this summer's weather been so far? A coast-to-coast climate checkup

Full text: Environment Canada's David Phillips explains the factors behind this summer's weather, and what to expect for the rest of the season
n Ottawa, people are saying it's the summer that sun forgot. In Manitoba, Winnipeggers can crow about an almost perfect summer. In British Columbia, fires have dominated discussion while fog, ice and decent weather for a change has people gabbing in Atlantic Canada.
With records being broken across the country, how can Canadians not be talking about the weather?
Environment Canada climatologist Dave Phillips says the weather patterns in Canada this summer have been anything but ordinary. The extreme conditions, so different for so many compared to last summer, are part of a new reality he says is becoming increasingly hard to ignore.
From record rains and swollen lakes in central Canada, to scorching heat and a parched land in the Prairies and western regions, Mr. Phillips says what is happening this summer is indicative of the effects of climate change that Canadians should now expect. This summer, it's being further influenced by a hung and static jet stream sitting high in the Arctic and over the Great Lakes.
"When you see more wild swings, more see-sawing, when you go from droughts to floods [without] something in between, that to me is the mark of climate change, something we're seeing now, " he said.
BRITISH COLUMBIA
The burning forests in British Columbia
The focus in British Columbia has been the raging forest-fire situation this summer. To date, the BC Wildfire Service says 490,000 hectares of earth has been scorched, an area three-quarters the size of Prince Edward Island, which makes 2017 already the third-worst forest-fire season in the province's history. The worst was in the late 1950s, when more than 800,000 hectares burned.
So what role has this year's weather played in creating this disaster? Mr. Phillips says heavy rain this spring that flooded rivers and yards from the Okanagan and Lower Mainland then northward led to a burst of growth for grasses.
Combine that with the lush vegetation with the scorching, dry, windy and lightning situation that the region experienced in early summer. Emergency Info BC started issuing evacuation orders at the beginning of July and it was near this time the weather set the stage for the perfect conditions to accelerate the fast-moving fires that are still roaring across parts of the province.
"It was that one day, I believe it was Friday [July 7] where you had that lightning, lots of dry lands and winds on top of it," Mr. Phillips said. "At first, it was just a few fires and then all hell broke loose and it became a real disaster."
Mr. Phillips added further caution, saying August is normally the driest month for B.C. and that since summer started, just 3.4 millimetres of rain fell in the Kamloops region (the average is 45.1 mm). There have also been more than 30 days on which the thermometer peaked at, or over, 30 degrees.
PRAIRIES
An arid Alberta while parts of the Prairies are parched
The worst of the heat, though, has been in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
In Medicine Hat, 22 days in July were hotter than 30 degrees. Across the border in Regina and Moose Jaw, both southern Saskatchewan cities are contending with record dryness. In Moose Jaw, it has been the driest July on record since the 1930s, with just 4.3 mm of rain falling. Regina picked up just 1.8 mm of rain in July and recorded the hottest day in 28 years on Sunday, with a temperature of 38 degrees.
While it's dry in southern Saskatchewan, the northern half of the province has been soaked. La Ronge and Meadow Lake received about 210 mm of rain during the same time that the capital was cracking from lack of precipitation. A year earlier, La Ronge and area only recorded about 70 mm of rain in July, a third of what they received this year.
And while half of Saskatchewan is soaked and the other half parched, its neighbour Manitoba is in line to claim perhaps the best Canadian summer of 2017. In both June and July, the average temperature was about 23 degrees with nearly 50 days of sunshine.
For better or for worse, blame the jet stream, Mr. Phillips says.
"Saskatchewan has been like Canada, too wet and too dry. It comes down to the jet stream, the river of air that controls the flow of air and delivers weather systems," Mr. Phillips said.
"Typically it hangs out in the northern Prairies, the North West Territories north of Hudson Bay, but this year the jet stream is hanging out further north in the west and farther south in the east," he added.
Such northerly and southerly arcs in the jet stream has meant an area of high pressure over western Canada, while parking low-pressure systems over parts of Ontario and Quebec.
"That low was like a traffic jam of storms, they would come in and rain on Parliament Hill and move away and another would come in and another," he said. "It was almost as if what we were seeing is too much weather in the east and not enough in the west. We like balance, and we didn't get the balance and it led to the extremes."
MURAT YÜKSELIR/THE GLOBE AND MAIL
ONTARIO AND QUEBEC
The ordinary but water-heavy summer in Ontario and Quebec
A number of factors including heavy winter snow and spring runoff made for the perfect primer to fill the Great Lakes to record levels this season, flooding campsites, eroding shorelines and changing summer plans on both sides of the border. Lake Ontario reached a level of 75.88 metres above sea level on May 29, an all-time high. According to Mr. Phillips, a stalled jet stream over southern Ontario meant even more rain to overwhelm an already swollen Lake Ontario. It also led to a series of weather systems bringing more grey skies, precipitation and cooler temperatures to Toronto this summer compared to last. From June 20 to July 31, Toronto hit 30 degrees just seven times, compared with 24 days in 2016. By the end of July, 386 mm of rain had fallen over the CN Tower this summer, compared to 133 mm during the same period in 2016.
"Last year, people in Eastern Canada were convinced that climate change had arrived because of the intensity of summer. What climate modellers had said would arrive in 2050 or 2060 seemed to arrive in 2016. People were thinking ‘wow it arrived earlier,' and then, this year, they are asking ‘whatever happened to climate change or global warming?" Mr. Phillips said, adding that the extreme swings from year to year are exactly the hallmark Canadians should consider as an indicator of climate change.
In Ottawa, summer has been described as a "soaker." Last month was the second wettest ever in records dating back to the 1800s, with 249.8 mm of rain (the record of 250.2 mm was set in 1899). From April to the end of July, 704.2 mm of rain drenched Canada's capital, more precipitation in four months than normally falls in a year, Mr. Philips said, adding that the Ottawa region saw just 57 mm of rain in July of last year. Heavy rain and high river levels in early May led to some 4,000 homes and business in southern Quebec being flooded, with several areas declaring states of emergency. By the end of July, Montreal had received 540.8 mm of rain, and not a single day above 30 degrees.
"Still," Mr. Phillips said, "Montreal or Toronto can't hold a candle to the kind of bummer summer seen in Ottawa."
ATLANTIC CANADA
From fire in the west to fog and ice on the Atlantic
For New Brunswick, especially Saint John, the spectacle has been fog. Environment Canada recorded 27 days of fog or mist so far this summer, with 159 hours of thick fog recorded from June 17 to the end of July.
On Prince Edward Island, a dry June and July may be setting the stage for an even drier August. Summerside recorded 69 mm of rain in June, about two-thirds what normally falls. By the end of July, less than half of the average 74 mm had fallen. That said, across the Northumberland Strait, parts of Nova Scotia have been drenched in rain. Sydney, on Cape Breton Island, recorded 255.3 mm of rain in May, making it the wettest start to a summer since about 1870.
Parts of Newfoundland and Labrador are enjoying a mild, mostly sunny summer, which is welcomed by residents who usually count on being smothered in fog and take summer one day at a time so as to not be too disappointed if a cold, rainy season sets in.
"You know Newfoundland is having a good summer when residents in St. John's are actually happy to see rain on a weekend to help with their yards and flowers," Mr. Phillips said.
THE NORTH
Summer snow and the long days of Canada's far North
Despite the variability in the provinces, the average temperatures in Canada's northern three territorial capitals actually haven't varied much for the month of July over the past 40 years. Take, for instance, Iqaluit. According to Environment Canada, the average temperature in July was 11.6 degrees, compared with 9.8 in 2007; 12.4 in 1997; 12.0 in 1987; and 11.7 in 1977.
Further east on Baffin Island, areas around Clyde River actually picked up a few centimetres of snow in the first half of July. Mr. Phillips says summer snow also fell in James Bay, on the shores of northern Ontario and Quebec, as well as in parts of northern Labrador. And while summer snow isn't out of the realm of possibility for some northern regions, it still comes as a surprise to people in the areas where it happens.
In Whitehorse, the average temperature for July was 19.4 degrees, compared with an average temperature of 21.5 in 2007; 21.1 in 1997; 21.3 in 1987; and 19.6 in 1977. And in Yellowknife, the average July temperature was 26.1, compared with 22.9 in 2007; 22.6 in 1997; 20.3 in 1987; and 21.2 in 1977.
With this mind, during the first week of August, Whitehorse and Yellowknife looked and felt more like a summer in Toronto. Residents in the the capitals of Yukon and the Northwest Territories basked in a week of straight sun and daytime highs that hit 25.
WHAT NEXT?
The rest (the other 50 days) of summer
As for what to expect the rest of summer, Mr. Phillips says much the same. According to Environment Canada, all three territories as well as the area over Hudson Bay and Baffin Island have a 60 per cent to 100 per cent chance of being warmer than normal for the rest of August and into September.
A warmer than normal August is also expected for PEI, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as the Prairies and British Columbia. A cooler-than-average second half of summer is in the forecast for parts of Labrador, while southern Quebec and Ontario can expect August to keep being damp.
"Taking a look at what's coming in August," Mr. Phillips said. "It is more of what we call ‘weather persistence,' what you see is what you are going to get."

Full text: OK, so the setting isn't exactly Sherwood Forest and the protagonists aren't Robin Hood, Little John and Maid Marian. Nor are the antagonists the cursed Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John.
The setting is a massive space - where, in lieu of forest green, white predominates - in the heart of St-Henri, and it's hard to tell the protagonists from the antagonists because they are all sporting protective face masks. But the weapon of choice is one favoured by Robin - a bow, albeit with foam-tipped arrows being slung.
The activity is called Dodge-Bow, an amalgam of archery, dodge ball and paintball - although not nearly as messy or as painful as the latter events.
There are no good or bad folk - either robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, or vice versa. There are two teams of 10 who fling arrows at one another, all the while trying to avoid being struck by taking cover behind large foam cushions. The only hitch here is that if opponents catch the arrows, they are not eliminated from the contest, but rather emerge victorious.
DodgeBow not only offers another method to deal with pent-up urban stress and angst, it also provides a rare opportunity to shoot at your friends, coworkers and even bosses without facing any incrimination.
Scott McDonach, one of the four enterprising 20-somethings from Montreal behind Dodge-Bow, calls the activity teambuilding. To that end, numerous local companies have shown up at the venue to release both arrows and anxiety.
"There are no harsh feelings, either, after the game is complete," McDonach says. "Where else could an employee go and target his boss with arrows - and not get arrested? Or deal with a colleague who has been difficult with you? It's most therapeutic."
McDonach can speak firsthand about that kind of interaction. An engineer by trade, he is, by day, involved in the construction of the new Champlain Bridge - which, with deadlines and costs factored in, can lead to all kinds of mental strain. So he had his work gang do DodgeBow bonding.
"It really did the trick, too," he says.
DodgeBow has drawn all sorts of participants, men and women, from CEGEP leagues to corporate events to birthday, bachelor and, yes, bachelorette parties. There are even special bows for kids.
Although some of the regulars have become quite advanced - to the point that they are more skilled than the owners - a knowledge of archery is not necessary for newcomers. Before the teams head on to the court, they are given a 10-minute instructional course by animators on the dos and don'ts. One of the don'ts is no deliberate head shots - regardless of the facial protection.
"Of course, the most important rule is that if a participant finds an arrow without a foamed tip, they are not to fire them," McDonach says. "But this has never happened, and we don't expect it ever will. We just throw that in for comic relief."
The games last 50 minutes at a cost of $24.95 per participant or $375 for a 20-person group session.
McDonach and his partners have trademarked DodgeBow and are in the process of selling franchises for the brand across the land.
There are a variety of games, and the team left with the most players is generally declared the winner. Because of the lightness of the arrows and the mask protection, McDonach reports there have been no serious injuries - just a few minor cuts - since the inception of Dodge-Bow two years ago. Also, it helps that booze is verboten on the premises.
There have been similar game concepts in Australia and Toronto, but McDonach and his partners tweaked the formula in coming up with their unique version.
"It's a really good cardio workout as well as a nerve reliever," McDonach says. "We also feel that it's a lot more accessible than paintball."
Not to mention that it saves on the laundry costs of the latter.
In what should come as no surprise, McDonach notes that the women often rule in this sport in mixed groups.
"The women are a lot more nimble and they are quicker," McDonach says. "It's not just a question of aiming and shooting accuracy - it's also about being able to avoid being shot at the same time. It's also about strategy on one level, and the women score very well on that front, too."
True to form, DodgeBow animator Anouk Dugas, an aspiring actress, proves to be nimble, quick and most strategic in a pickup contest that has left her alone on one side of the court. Against all odds, she successfully takes on and beats the three remaining guys on the other side.
"I'm the newest here, and I've only been doing this a few months. The guys are really good, too," says Dugas, 21. "I can't really say that I'm much of an athlete. I'm not much of a good archer, either. I guess I just lucked out here."
Don't think so. The evidence is compelling.
"Perhaps women have an advantage because they are better at dodging in general," Dugas quips. "Maybe being an actress also helps, because that is rather competitive and involves a lot of interactive social strategy."
Adam Martelli, another of the DodgeBow owners, is one of the three guys Dugas took down.
"Give her full marks, but the bottom line, win or lose, is that we're all de-stressed at the end of the game," says Martelli, an engineer with a major Montreal construction company by day.
"When it comes down to it, we're all big kids at heart here. And because we're engineers, maybe a little bit geeky, too."

Full text: Being in the presence of trees, which is known as "forest bathing" in Japan and Korea, is part of the national health programs in both countries and has been since the early 1980s. That's because nature appreciation - or simply being around trees, plants and flowers - is scientifically shown to relieve stress and strengthen the immune system thanks to the various oils, known as phytoncide, that are released by them.
Sophie Robitaille is a landscape architect and one of the founders - along with Robert Curtis - of Robitaille.Curtis, an awardwinning architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, and interior design firm based in Montreal and Burlington, Vt.
She's also a big believer in tree bathing, especially for city dwellers.
I recently had the opportunity to pick her fertile brain about urban gardening. Here's what she had to say. What can condo dwellers do to make the most of their space for urban gardening? You can really make the most of whatever space you have, if you're into it. You can use pots and vines and make things grow on the railings of your balcony or fire escape. You can grow things from seed and experience the cycle and progression of the seasons, like a sunflower. It's a great educational opportunity, especially for kids.
Making a place that's comfortable to sit and spend time in, on the porch or balcony, and choosing plants that are adapted to the environment are important, but I think it's very personal, too. If you want the garden to provide colour, and you're not interested in the seasonal progression, I would suggest using annual plants. Perennial plants are meant to be in the ground and become increasingly beautiful with age, over the years.
Annual plants are less expensive, and intended for a more seasonal application. What are the must-haves for a functioning urban garden? The biggest mistake people make is using pots that are too small: plants need water and they need soil, so you can't plant them in tiny pots. You need a pot that has enough volume because the bottom line is, the soil is what's supporting those plants; the bigger it is, the more moisture it will hold and the less hot and stressed the plant will be.
You also need to be aware of how engaged you want to be, and how much time you want to spend gardening. You need to know how ambitious you are. If you just want the garden for beauty, which is also very important, just choose lower maintenance plants. How do you make an urban garden beautiful year-round?
Having a place to sit or lounge is great, but I think most of our clients just stare out the window and look at the birds that fly by, and the rustling leaves. It's very meditative and relaxing for them. In the winter, it becomes more of a scene to look out at, which is fun. Decorations for pots and planters are nice during the winter, as are branches and pine needles. You can have flowers in the summer and plants in the fall. When those start to decline, you can have branches in the winter.
What kinds of plants, flowers and vegetables are ideal for urban gardens? It's really about preference, and the exposure you have.
Those plants that eat bugs are neat, though in my personal mosquito experience, I'm not sure how great they are at taking care of mosquitoes. Aroma is a great idea, so plants and flowers that you can cut and put in vases are such a pleasure.
I think movement in plants is nice, too - like tall grasses that move in the wind. The built environment is very hard, and it doesn't move much; the difference with plants is that they move in the wind, and they're alive.
They also attract butterflies and bees - which there's a lot of fear around - but I think it's so great when we attract them. How can you transform a balcony in the city into a green oasis? Vines have quite an oasis effect, especially when they take over and aren't contained. Big plants with big pots as well as little trees or mini trees that you can keep indoors in the winter, because they're a bit more expensive.
I have friends who've had lime bushes and bougainvillea on their balconies. Introducing lots of colour creates more of an oasis, because it feels more tropical, free and loose.
Urban gardens also benefit a lot from lighting, like candles, because it brings the garden to light at the time of day when most of us are home, and enjoying it.
We always introduce a bit of lighting in all our projects, and our clients love the day they finally get light. What can people who don't have any outdoor space do to get their daily dose of nature? People who don't have any outdoor space can get a community plot, but that's a big-time investment.
In Paris, no one has balconies, and there are rules about what you can put on them, so people go to the park for picnics, and they go to the market.
They use the urban amenities that are available to them, and it leads to a wonderful communal experience where you can also find solitude.
We have great parks in Montreal; all the great cities have great parks.
All the better for tree bathing.

Experts say flooding due to climate change; 'We've changed chemistry of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases'

Full text: Some may blame the gods, Hydro-Quebec or their own bad luck, but climate change scientists say the heavy rains and terrible flooding plaguing Quebec this spring are almost certainly caused by global warming.
"There is a very clear picture emerging that we've changed the chemistry of the atmosphere with our greenhouse gases and we are really seeing the consequences now," Paul Beckwith, a climate systems scientist who teaches at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview Tuesday.
Record amounts of rain this spring in Quebec and Ontario have meant the soil is saturated and can't absorb any more water. The run-off adds to the water levels in already bloated rivers and streams. Lake Ontario has now hit its highest recorded level since 1880, when record-keeping began. The St. Lawrence River is about 1.2 metres higher than it normally is this time of year.
Beckwith said the connections to climate change "are very clear." First, the jet streams - those meandering air currents in the Earth's atmosphere that flow west to east - are much wavier than they used to be. They are not moving as fast as they used to so they get stuck in position. And there is more water vapour in the atmosphere because it's warmer and that water vapour rises and releases energy that fuels storms. Ocean temperatures are warmer, due to global warming, so there is a lot more evaporation and moist air coming onto the continent through the oceans.
"The net result of these jet streams behaving differently is that the occurrence of extreme weather events increases," he said.
"I'm talking about torrential rain causing flooding or droughts. The duration of storms increases because these storms get stuck over a region and don't move out quickly, depositing all their water. And the intensity of storms are increasing because you have all that energy released from the extra water vapour in the atmosphere as it condenses into clouds."
And though some weather forecasters are announcing clearer skies in the next week, Beckwith said he is not so optimistic.
"We are still in this type of pattern so I don't see how people can say we are out of the woods. There are still huge amounts of water in the Ottawa River watershed, which is a vast watershed."
Because of the very high water levels on Lake Ontario, regulators plan to let more water through the dam at Cornwall soon, which will affect the already-swollen St. Lawrence. Beckwith noted that every centimetre Lake Ontario goes down pushes the St. Lawrence levels up 11 centimetres.
The Montreal region is susceptible to flooding because of its geographical position, immediately below the confluence of the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River. The region has seen flooding before. In 1974 for example, floods hit several hundred Quebec municipalities and more than 1,600 homes and cottages were flooded, and about 7,000 people evacuated, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.
But Steven Guilbeault, author of two books on climate change and an environmental activist who has focused on the issue since the early '90s, said scientists have been telling the world for a long time that extreme weather events would increase.
"We've known for 20 or 25 years that this was happening," he told The Gazette. "What (scientists) got wrong was how fast. Twentyfive years ago we thought these things would start happening in 2040 or 2050. Very few scientists thought it would be happening so quickly. So what science is telling us is that the climate is much more sensitive to temperature increases than it was believed just two decades ago, 15 years ago, even 10 years ago.
"The number of natural catastrophes from forest fires to droughts, have basically increased by a factor of four since the 1970s. So we can't say that the (specific) flooding events we're seeing is a result of climate change, but we can say that because of climate change these types of episodes and catastrophes are becoming more and more frequent."
He said all the hardship that people in Montreal, Ottawa and other parts of North America are experiencing due to flooding may finally hammer home the urgency to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.
"When we look at polling or focus groups that are being done on the issue of climate change, we are seeing that natural catastrophes, especially when they hit closer to home, will get people's attention."
He said people in Quebec should focus on what they can do in their personal lives to reduce fossil fuel use, particularly when it comes to transportation. But more important is letting elected officials know that reversing climate change should be a priority on the municipal, provincial and federal levels. mlalonde@postmedia.com

MAY
Feast Tofino, Tofino, B.C.
With just 1,800 year-round residents, the tiny town of Tofino on the west coast of Vancouver Island isn't big enough to have traffic lights. Yet it's becoming known for its extraordinary food culture that draws inspiration from the ocean and old-growth forests of surrounding Clayoquot Sound.
Every spring, a strong community of chefs, growers, brewers, butchers, foragers and fishermen gets together to celebrate, with 2 1/2 weeks of demos, tastings, collaboration dinners and kitchen takeovers at Feast Tofino. Locals and visitors alike come here to fish, forage and cook on the beach. Canadian chefs like Lora Kirk, Nicole Gomes, Anita Lo showed up to last year's Feast, as did Amanda Cohen of Dirt Candy in New York.
This year, Vancouver is sending chefs Lee Cooper from L'Abattoir, Stefan Hartmann from the Bauhaus, and Joel Watanabe from Bao Bei and Kissa Tanto. They'll be eating, teaching and collaborating on boat-to-table menus with Tofinian chefs including Lisa Ahier of SoBo, Nick Nutting of Wolf in the Fog, Warren Barr of the Pointe Restaurant in the Wickaninnish Inn and Ian Riddick of Long Beach Lodge.
The Boat to Tailgate Party is the family-friendly anchor event, raising money for local salmon research while offering an opportunity to catch your own food along with local chefs and fishing guides. The Dirty Gourmet invites guests to camp overnight at Mussel Beach in the Barkley Sound and combines adventure biking with a gourmet lunch in the backcountry. And on Victoria Day weekend, the party wraps up with the Tofino Dock Festival, an afternoon of tasting and hobnobbing in the inner harbour on Tofino's working 4th Street dock. $20 to $120. May 5 to 22. feasttofino.com
Spot Prawn Festival, Vancouver. The day's celebrations, including a big boil and demos by chefs, kicks off spot prawn season. Bring cash to buy the sweet shellfish straight off the dock, which will be available for about six to eight weeks. $17.50 (includes snack of 3 spot prawns), all proceeds go to Chef's Table Society of British Columbia. https://spotprawnfestival.com/
Great Okanagan Beer Festival, Kelowna, B.C. Showcasing about 40 Canadian brewers (focusing on B.C. craft beer makers), this three-day festival fills the afternoon with waterside concerts and hot dogs (vegetarian and gluten-free options available). Smoking (including vapesters) limited to designated areas. $45 (includes 3 beer tokens). https://gibbonswhistler.com/festivals-events/great-okanagan-beer-festival/
Carnival Cocktails for Cancer, Calgary. Join chefs and bartenders from 23 celebrated restaurants (including Model Milk, Pigeon Hole and Anejo) as they create old-timey carnival-themed food and cocktails to commemorate a member of their community and raise money for cancer research. Straw boater hats, handlebar mustaches and period costumes are not required, but encouraged. $150, proceeds go to Canadian Cancer Society. http://www.carnivalcocktails.ca/

JUNE
Mondial de la Bière, Montreal
One of the largest beer festivals in the world, the Mondial de la Bière expects 160,000 attendees over five days for its 24th celebration. In total, 586 products will be available to try, including 282 beers making a debut.
Montréal's beer festival is known for promoting Québécois products, but equally for internationalism. There are at least nine countries represented in brews, an international panel of judges for competitive events, and experts from all over participating in the educational lineup.
The festival weekend is the culmination of a city-wide Brewing Week starting June 12. A collection of restaurants will create beer-centric dishes as part of Sorties Flaveurs; for the Off Mondial program, 16 bars and artisanal breweries will host special releases - think small batch offerings and brewhouse collaborations.
Besides sipping, the festival offers live music, food exhibitors and a robust schedule of workshops plus small-group guided tours of breweries throughout the city. If last year is any indication, there will also be some last-minute surprises - think trivia nights and crowd-judged head-to-head cooking competitions.
For the first time, ticket packages will be available for the weekend: one attractive new offering is the one-day Privilege Lunch ticket, which gets you in 30 minutes before general admission, and also snags you a tote bag with gear, and food and drink credits.
Tastings $2 to $8; VIP packages $90 or $135. Privilege Lunch ticket $25. June 14 to 18. http://festivalmondialbiere.qc.ca/en/festivals/mondial_de_la_biere_montreal_2017/ -
Kampai Toronto Festival of Sake, Toronto. Expand your sake palate with samples of 150 sakes from over 50 breweries. Plus there will be izakaya food, torched sushi and dishes from restaurants like Miku and Zakkushi. $30 to $110. June 1. http://www.sakeinstituteofontario.com/events/kampai-toronto/
Taste of the Caribbean, Montreal. Jerk chicken and rum from Barbados and Grenada, steel drum music and calypso singers, a costumed parade, all outside in the June sun. Admission is free, rum and food packages $30 to $90. June 21 to 25. http://totc.ca/fr/accueil
Porkapalooza BBQ Festival, Edmonton. A weekend of barbecue, with a chicken, ribs and brisket competition certified by the Kansas City Barbecue Society. Free. June 10 and 11. http://porkapalooza.ca/
Pig and Pinot, Calgary. A luxurious celebration of Alberta pork and wine, with proceeds going to Meals on Wheels. $130. June 15. . https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/7th-annual-pig-pinot-festival-tickets-32003574553?aff=erelexpmlt
YVR Food Fest, Vancouver. Four days of programming over the Canada Day weekend, including a speaking series, Monday brunch, Canada Day Cookout, and a Street Food Showdown featuring over 80 food carts, restaurants, breweries and wineries. And yes, there will be a bike valet. June 29 to July 3. $10 to $60, free for children under 12. http://www.yvrfoodfest.com/
JULY
Halal Food Fest, Mississaga, Ont.
A lot of food festivals don't survive early success. The first Halal Food Festival in 2013 was expected to draw 5,000 guests and 30,000 people showed up. Not surprising, given that the Muslim population in the Toronto area is about half a million. But that kind of overwhelming turnout can create a long-lined, food-shortage experience that turns people off. The good news is, organizers have solved a lot of those early problems.
"We've made a lot of adjustments over the five years to grow," says organizer Salima Jivraj. "The flow is very important." Families form the core audience for the event, and she's figured out how to customize the space for them, with details like 20-feet-wide aisles (the standard is 10) a nursing area and lots of seating. "We've increased our kids area by 50 per cent this year, double what it was last year."
As it's grown, the festival has expanded beyond a homogeneously Muslim audience. Sponsorship comes from big brands like Redpath Sugar (the company avoids the common use of bone char in its refining process). All food is halal, of course, with signage clearly identifying which meats are hand- or machine-slaughtered.
In addition to corporations like Maple Leaf, which caters to the growth market with their Mina Halal imprint, expect a slew of Toronto food businesses - Daddy's Halal Ribs, the Holy Grill and Bombay Street Food - testing out new food ideas on the audience, as well as gluten-free baking demos, mocktail demos and a cake decorating contest. $5, free for children under 10 and adults over 64.

The Gathering, Burlington, Nfld.
A tiny town in northern Newfoundland comes alive for a weekend every summer to celebrate "Fire, Food and Music" at this five-year-old festival. The party began as a small celebration of the first vegetable harvest from a community greenhouse and has grown into an outdoor get-together of chefs and performers from all over Eastern Canada.
Musicians play from morning to midnight, gourmet meals and cookouts are all prepared outdoors, over open fire, and the mood is laid-back. Burlington is the hometown of comedian and festival founder Shaun Majumder, and naturally the comedy show is a big draw. "We want to share the culture of Newfoundland and Labrador in our little way," says executive director Rudy Norman.
The majority of the events happen on what Norman calls "the gathering grounds," packed with stages, chefs, food stands, bonfires, and amenities. A weekend pass grants access to set up a tent and relax in a vast nearby field.
Perennially popular (and ticketed separately from weekend passes) is the "brook picnic," an outdoor afternoon feast, prepared this year by chef Jeremy Charles of Raymonds. This year's musical lineup includes Joel and Bill Plaskett, and Repartee.
Unlike at many other food or music festivals, no alcohol is sold or served at the Gathering. People are encouraged to come and experience the tastes, sights and sounds "completely lucid, and walk away feeling good about it," says Norman (though having a drink on the campgrounds is permitted). $25 to $225. Aug. 24 to 26. https://thegatheringburlington.com/
Session Muskoka, Bracebridge, Ont. Outdoor concerts buoyed by Ontario craft beers, ice cream, pizza, vegan and gluten-free options, plus beer athletics, which test drinkers' mental, physical and verbal skills under the influence. $30 (includes 5 beer tokens). Aug. 5. www.sessionmuskoka.ca/beer.html

SEPTEMBER
Freak'n Farmer Adventure Obstacle Race, Oliver, B.C.
Diving into cold, murky water underneath thick wooden logs and carrying 20-pound pails full of dirt aren't what most people expect from a visit to a winery. But those are just a couple of the challenges to conquer at this wild annual event at Covert Farms, a winery and organic produce supplier with breathtakingly beautiful views of the South Okanagan.
At the height of summer, this family-run business is vibrant and lush, with rows upon rows of big, leafy vines boasting clusters of juicy grapes, fields of fresh strawberries, brassicas and lettuces. When late September rolls around and the fields have been mostly harvested, Hoodoo Adventures begins its work on the farm's grounds, bringing in huge utility vehicles to help construct all sorts of obstacles, from simple stacks of hay bails to crawl through to big, buoyant blocks floating in a manmade lake.
On race day, younger ones compete early on in the morning (kids can race on specialized tracks separated by age group). Later on, more serious racers can choose to tackle five, 10 or 20-kilometre tracks around the winery and farm grounds, rife with physical tasks like stacking wine barrels, flipping tractor wheels and even collecting 15-pound zucchinis.
It sounds daunting, but participants are encouraged to not take themselves too seriously and just have some fun. Less seasoned athletes will find the five or 10 kilometre tracks manageable, as there are plenty of moments to catch your breath while waiting in line to complete the more complex roadblocks you'll encounter. Costumes are encouraged, so you'll likely end up jogging by someone dressed up in a cow suit or similar style of hilarious onesie.
Once the hard part is done, everyone celebrates with plenty of delicious food, like charcuterie boards brimming with locally cured meats, braised pork, roast corn, Covert Farms' wine (of course) and craft cider courtesy of Howling Moon which operates just down the road. Up to $145. Sept. 23.
Roots, Rants and Roars, Elliston, Nfld. Celebrate the Atlantic's most prized resource at Friday night's cod wars, when local chefs battling for the titles of king and queen of cod. On Saturday, the festival orchestrates a 5-km trail for guests to hike, with food stations along the way: this is the best event for young children, as that night's feast is known to go well past midnight. $90 per event. Elliston Municipal Park on Maberly Rd. Sept. 15 and 16. https://www.rootsrantsandroars.ca/
Canada's Largest Ribfest, Burlington, Ont. There are many ways to establish this festival's status as Canada's largest celebration of ribs - attendance, ribs sold, teams competition, money raised for charity - but none better than its title. To maximize rib consumption, camping is available in nearby Bronte Creek Provincial Park. Free. Sept. 1 to 4. http://www.canadaslargestribfest.com/
Niagara Grape and Wine Festival, St. Catharines, Ont. Three weekends of celebration centre around the Ontario's grape region harvest. Montebello Park will host concerts, seminars, interactive cooking demos for children, samples from 30 local wine producers and a dozen food vendors. Food and drink tokens $3.50, Winery tour pass $40. Sept. 9 to 10, 15 to 17, 22 to 24. http://www.niagarawinefestival.com/wine-festival
The Chosen Food, Vancouver. One of a series of dinners hosted by The Jewish Museum & Archives of B.C. introducing diners to cuisines from international areas of Jewish diaspora. This edition combines Rosh Hashana (Hebrew new year) with a Syrian feast. $40. Sept. 17. https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-chosen-food-rosh-hashanah-in-aleppo-a-syrian-jewish-new-year-tickets-32699664577
The Halifax Oyster Festival, Halifax. There's no greater celebration of seasonal, local food than eating a fresh, raw, ungarnished oyster. The start of Nova Scotia's season commences with this shucking competition and all you can slurp oyster bonanza. $52.05 (children under 12 are free) for a three-hour session. Sept. 29 and 30. http://oysterfest.ca/

Full text: With the major fire that devastated the forests around Fort McMurray a year ago still fresh in our memory, Quebec researchers warn that our province is not immune to such a cataclysmic event.
It's a risk that will have an increased impact on the amount of wood available for logging.
With global warming, drought in Quebec will increase in the next few years as well as forest fires, professor and researcher Yves Bergeron said Wednesday.
Bergeron is affiliated with the Department of Biological Sciences at l'Universite du Quebec a Montreal, the Universite du Quebec en Abitibi-Temiscamingue Forest Research Institute, and is also Canada Research Chair in Ecology and Sustainable Forest Management. Bergeron presented research results in the wake of the Centre d'etude de la Foret seminar this week, and at the Ouranos research consortium on regional climatology and climate change adaptation.
An increase in the number of forest fires in Quebec would be a disaster from an economic point of view, said Bergeron.
A total of 10 to 20 per cent of the lumber available for cutting in the province burns before being collected, he said. "It's worrying now."
The proportion is likely to increase if nothing is done. The target of one per cent cutting comes from the natural regeneration time of the forest. Bergeron points out that there are fewer fires now than before. The climate may have warmed, but rainfall has also increased, says Bergeron.
This will not always be the case: according to the simulations carried out, precipitation will not increase sufficiently to compensate for the warming. This will create a dry climate, much more sensitive to forest fires.
"The fires will become more and more severe," Bergeron said.
In the worst-case scenario, Quebec will be at a level in 2100 where there will be one per cent cutting and one per cent of trees that will be destroyed by forest fires. Presse Canadienne

Full text: Before we get started, there are a couple of things you should know. I don't like camping. And I had a cold.
Yet when I got all choked up during our first 10 minutes at La Mauricie National Park, it wasn't for the reason you (or my family) might have thought. Standing on the welcome centre's deck with wood smoke heavy in the air, looking down on chalky trails emerging from shadowed woods backdropped by low mountains thick with evergreens, I was filled with the sort of patriotism propagandists can only dream of sowing. I am Canadian. And that's how I was going to get through the weekend.
Wewife Melani, daughter Jilly and Iwere taking our 2017 Parks Canada pass for its first spin, just two hours north of Montreal.
Those of you still looking for a last-minute March Break jaunt with the family can take inspiration from our outing. As part of Canada's 150th birthday celebration, the federal government has made access to Parks Canada sites accessible to all Canadians by giving away Discovery passes. They can be ordered online or picked up at any national park, historic site or marine conservation area. You only need one pass per vehicle (so get one for the family), and it covers entry to the site, but not camping, activities or outside fees like parking or equipment rental.
We've had our pass since before 2017 started and it was burning a hole in our glove compartment. We decided to try winter camping during that golden pre-spring time when you can play in the snow but it's warm enough to have your coat's zipper open, but because I hate camping, setting up a tent in the woods and full-on roughing it wasn't an option.
"This isn't like camping," I said joyfully when we arrived at lucky camp site No. 13. "This is like a thing that I enjoy."
"This isn't like camping," said 5-year-old Beaver Scout Jilly, less joyfully. "With camping you need a real tent, not a thing like this."
"A thing like this" is a tentshaped, canvas cabin called an oTENTik. It has a wood floor and room for six people to sleep on real mattresses, plus a fully equipped cupboard across from a heavy, family-style dining table.
There were 13 oTENTiks in our campground, yet they were far enough from each other, and surrounded by enough thick old trees, that we could pretend we were deep in the wildernessexcept with actual beds and a wood stove and an iron fire pit just outside.
About 200 metres away was a common building with tables and hot plates and hot running water, and more importantly, the bathrooms. It was a short, pleasant walk that ended in what doubled as a pretty good sledding hill.
There were fox tracks right outside our tent, but other than one bold chipmunk, we didn't see any wildlife during our whirlwind, 24-hour stay.
The warm winter air was so heavy, sound didn't travel. We heard neither neighbour nor bird, but only the sounds we made, like sniffling or the crinkling of newsprint for kindlingor, "Stop dancing around the fireplace! Dance outside instead!" Though we're not a family that cross-country skis or snowshoes or winter-cyclesall activities that are offered at La Mauriciewe do love a good hike.
Many of the trails at the park are closed for the winter, so it wasn't possible to check out the waterfalls or cliffs, but we did a tour of a well-maintained trail that was accessed from our campground. Trail No. 1 wound through woods backdropped by brown and gold mountains, with inclines gentle enough to heave a sled laden with child and lunch, yet steep enough to send the same child and lunch barrelling down through the trees, screaming gleefully (which could be why we didn't see any wildlife).
We stopped at a trail way station, where Melani started a fire in the wood stove while I unboxed leftovers from a Montreal BBQ joint we'd been to the night before. We shared marshmallows with a couple visiting from France whose young sons were nearing the end of their patience. They would be the only other people, aside from the astonishingly cheery Parks Canada staff, whom we would talk to during our stay.
La Mauricie was opened as a national park in 1970, protecting 536 square kilometres of Canadian Shield that was transformed by the area's rich early logging industry. Just around the corner from Shawinigan and about two hours northeast of Montreal, the park has a mandate to protect and restore the forest's and lakes' ecosystems, and visitors are nearly universally respectful, following carry-in, carry-out protocol and sticking to trails so as not to overly disturb the land.
Just after dusk at the campground, other campers appeared, lanterns and head lamps bobbing like a scene from Tangled, but unlike summer campers, these people didn't make small talk, or even eye contact. They were seeking peace and solitude, I guess, and we had a 5-year-old.
We had intended to stick to ourselves anyway, cooking hotdogs and roasting marshmallows in the outdoor fire pit, which was protected from wind by fivefoot-high snowbanks on three sides, then reading a chapter of Ella Enchanted before putting an extra log on the wood stove and taking turns running down for one last trip to the loo.
Jilly and I were alone when that most dreaded of sounds broke into the eerie silence of the forest: "Mum. Mum I have to pee. I have to pee right now!" I'm no fool. I had a plan. Up. Snow pants. Jacket. Zipper. Bootsno time for socks.
What we didn't have was the lantern. It was down at the bathrooms with Melani. But no problem. I'm a country girl. I can navigate a starless night.
The little green sled was parked right outside. I rarely use my sledpulling muscles, and we'd been up and down a few hills already. My shoulder and carpal-tunnelabused hand throbbed.
My first thoughts"I think I can I think I can"were followed by vague daydreams of the 40-pound weight in the sled just vanishing. The image had barely made it to my thought bubble before I got that terrible tailboneto-neck-bone chill unique to times when there's nothing but black behind you. If the sled suddenly got light, it would probably mean she'd been eaten by a chupacabra. No, no, we were too far north for that.
Sasquatch, then. The dog-shaped tracks outside our oTENTik were fresh on my mind. It was so much darker behind me than ahead. I couldn't turn to check that she was okay because what if I turned around and it was thereBig Foot or a coyote or ... what? It was a mother's instinct to protect battling with a normal human's instinct to Never Look Behind You. I made one last falling-forward pull toward the lit restrooms with the dark close on my heels and that burst came just as we reached the top of the hard-packed incline.
"Muuuuum," came the cry as the sled overtook me and the rope fell from my crippled hand, child and green sled spinning down and away from me and there was nothing I could do but wait till the sled reluctantly stopped just shy of the common building.
And once in the circle of light, with the rush back on to get to a toilet, but her betrayed, joyful face frowning at me, I doubled over laughing so hard I probably scared off the Sasquatch.
And it was a good thing we were right by the bathrooms.
HOW TO GET YOUR FREE PARKS CANADA PASS
I'm not saying Parks Canada is the cure for the common cold. I mean, I sometimes get such simple medical procedures as kissing a boo-boo wrong, so who am I to judge. But I can say that by the end of the weekend, I was breathing easy and I had an extra (tired, slightly sore) spring in my step.
A Parks Canada pass gives admission to all national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas. However, that includes entry to the park onlyit doesn't cover fees for camping, firewood, activities, etc. (Our onenight stay in the oTENTIK cost $120 plus taxes.) A 2017 Discovery Pass is valid for everyone arriving in the same vehicle at a national park, marine conservation area or historic site. You can pick one up at a national park or order it online.
A TASTE OF THE OUTDOORS
HOW TO MAKE YELLOW SNOW
Pick up a yellow sports drink or lemon syrupit's best if it's in a squeeze-type bottle already. Find a blank expanse of snow and write your nameor draw a picture, or a treasure map. If you taste a little, it'll be just like having a snow cone at the fair.
HOW TO MAKE SNOW ICE CREAM
Put 1/2 cup milk and 2 to 3 tablespoons of sugar in a pot. Take it outside and have your kid fill it with about 4 cups of fresh, clean snow. Stir and stir and stir until it has an ice-creamy consistency. Scoop into a bowl and add sprinkles to taste (or till Mum tells you that's enough).

Full text: Canada's economy is already taking a hit from global warming, including more frequent droughts and forest fires plus a burst of carbon-tax-induced inflation, a top Bank of Canada official says.
"Climate change and actions to address it will have material and pervasive effects on Canada's economy and financial system," deputy governor Timothy Lane said in a speech in Montreal on Thursday.
The effects so far are relatively small, but will become more severe over the longer term. Mr. Lane cited federal government sponsored research that estimates the annual costs to the Canadian economy will reach $21-billion to $43-billion within four decades. He said Canada is particularly at risk because it is a major oil and gas producer, manufactures autos and aircraft, and consumes more energy per capita than many other countries.
"Adapting to a lower-carbon economy will likely mean more profound structural changes for Canada than many other countries," he said.
Over the longer term, it's a "near certainty" that the economy will grow more slowly than it otherwise would due to the effects of climate change, Mr. Lane said.
Climate change is a "downside risk" that will hang over the economy for some time, leaving the central bank in reaction mode, he added.
"We can react to events as they occur," he said. "But we cannot build them into our economic forecasts or adjust our monetary policy in advance because each is unique and unpredictable."
The cost of a warmer climate is already being felt, according to the central bank. Mr. Lane cited last year's devastating forest fires in Alberta, which subtracted about a percentage point from economic growth in the second quarter, as well as the mountain pine beetle infestation in Western Canada's forests and the mining industry's inability to depend on some winter ice roads.
The central bank acknowledged this week that a burst of inflation in January was directly attributable to new carbon-pricing policies in Alberta and Ontario.
But Mr. Lane said these carbon taxes will have only a transitory effect on inflation.
Mr. Lane said that carbon pricing also has direct "negative consequence" as consumers and businesses pay the price of reducing carbon emissions.
Mr. Lane acknowledged that carbon taxes "could result in a loss of Canadian competitiveness." But the impact can be mitigated by using the revenue to lower other taxes and by encouraging more efficient energy use.

Full text: Quebec is providing $12.7 million over three years for climate change research through the Ouranos consortium.
The announcement was made Monday by three Couillard government ministers in the offices of Ouranos in downtown Montreal.
The funding is intended to finance applied research projects on how best to adapt to climate change.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough, Ouranos officials said.
They added we must also find ways to live with the effect of climate change on our infrastructure, agriculture and economic development.
"Science makes it clear that greenhouse gas reduction must remain strong, but it will only partially reduce the magnitude of the impacts of climate change," said Alain Bourque, general manager of Ouranos.
With the financial support received, Ouranos will be able to carry out some of the work that was already in the planning stage, such as mapping the risks of forest fires in mid-northern Quebec with forestry partners.
During the holiday season, the Gaspe Peninsula was hit by severe weather that took away or damaged several infrastructures, said David Heurtel, Quebec minister of sustainable development, environment and climate change.
"Ouranos has been talking about this risk for some years now. And it is through this work, these studies, these analyses, that when these events occurred we were able to react quickly and say that we are already at work to find solutions," Heurtel said.
"Clearly, on the public safety side, it's the mission of the department to ensure that our communities are resilient to these changes, which pose issues of civil security in particular," said Martin Coiteux, Quebec minister of municipal affairs and public safety.

Taking Over Public Space; Look out for outdoor displays of art marking Montreal's 375th anniversary

Author: Pohl, John

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/taking-over-public-space-look-out-outdoor/docview/1869704787/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Montreal's 375th-anniversary celebrations will be marked by major outdoor displays of public art, including one along a sixkilometre stretch of Highway 20, another along one kilometre of Sherbrooke St. W. and a third in the Quartier des spectacles. [...]instead of little plastic shrubs, the vegetation in the squares is represented as images of flowers embedded in the tiles or on the sides of central slabs that are neither fountains nor monuments. Ferron, whose stained-glass window in the Champ-de-Mars metro station is a canopy of coloured light, has a small piece of fused antique glass from 1960-65. The artist uses long exposure times on film cameras to create ghostly presences, then enhances the weirdly old-fashioned images through various old darkroom techniques. Another exhibition, Memory Collector, will give visitors access to 110 metres of a collector sewer beneath the museum that was an engineering feat when it was built in the 1830s. The Museum of Fine Arts will turn Sherbrooke St. between its new Pavilion for Peace and the McCord Museum's Urban Forest into a public art walk. KM3 opens in the Quartier des spectacles as a participatory outdoor art event with 20 artworks and installations by Quebec-based practitioners of visual arts, urban art, digital art, design and architecture.

Full text: Montreal's 375th-anniversary celebrations will be marked by major outdoor displays of public art, including one along a sixkilometre stretch of Highway 20, another along one kilometre of Sherbrooke St. W. and a third in the Quartier des spectacles.
Two galleries have jumped the gun with indoor exhibitions that feature artists commissioned to produce public artwork.
The exhibition titled Spaces for Agency, on display at Galerie Hugues Charbonneau till March 4, includes works by Alain Paiement, the artist whose Bleu du bleu will stretch from the Dorval Circle to the 1st Ave. overpass on Highway 20. The project, sponsored by the National Bank, will have 75 free-standing vertical LED tubes and painted diagonal lines on the highway's sounddampening walls.
Paiement also has the largest piece in the Charbonneau exhibition. Voisinage contextual is a 152-cm-by-223-cm digital collage of about 280 overhead views of Montrealers engaging in daily activities of work and leisure, both in private and public spaces.
Paiement used a drone for some of the outside photos, said gallery owner Hugues Charbonneau. Each subject in this complex work consented to be photographed.
David Lafrance presents small sculptures that appear to be maquettes of proposed public squares. But instead of little plastic shrubs, the vegetation in the squares is represented as images of flowers embedded in the tiles or on the sides of central slabs that are neither fountains nor monuments. Lafrance's crude public spaces seem designed to repel any public use, a nice comment on democratic society under siege.
Maria Hupfield's video Survival and Other Acts of Defiance has been seen around the world since its introduction as part of Beat Nation, a travelling exhibition that made a pit stop at the Musee d'art contemporain in 2013. It is a one-minute video that seamless editing has turned into a onehour performance of Hupfield jumping on the spot, affirming her presence through unflagging physical exertion.
She's dressed casually but the tin jingles on her boots indicate her status as an aboriginal and the healing nature of her dance. The second exhibition with an explicit anniversary theme is titled cARTographier, on at Galerie Simon Blais till March 4.
The 16 artists in the exhibition have all left their stamp on the city's public spaces, said gallery assistant Francois Babineau. Some of the artists, like Jean-Paul Riopelle and Marcelle Ferron, have created large public works, while others are known for their photographs of Montreal neighbourhoods.
Riopelle, whose sculpture and fountain La joute graces Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle (a square built over the Ville-Marie Expressway in the Quartier International), is represented by a small sculpture. Ferron, whose stained-glass window in the Champ-de-Mars metro station is a canopy of coloured light, has a small piece of fused antique glass from 1960-65.
One of Charles Daudelin's great public works is an 18-metre-high altarpiece for a chapel in Notre-Dame Basilica. His contribution to this exhibition is a much more modest polychrome bronze relief - just 34 centimetres - from 1954.
A photograph from Bertrand Carriere's series devoted to facades of abandoned buildings is in the show. It's a high-contrast image of a building since demolished at the corner of St-Laurent Blvd. and Ste-Catherine St. The layers of old flaking posts that cover the building matches it to the patches of dirty ice on the sidewalk that are covered in part by fresh white snow.
Another striking image is of a geometric composition of structural elements taken during construction of the Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CHUM) hospital by Yann Pocreau. It is part of a larger project by an artist whose work explores history of place and memory.
Also on at Galerie Simon Blais is an exhibition of 10 abstract works in ink from 1969-70 by Jean-Paul Jerome. But what captivated my attention were photographs of women by Eliane Excoffier.
The artist uses long exposure times on film cameras to create ghostly presences, then enhances the weirdly old-fashioned images through various old darkroom techniques.
The end results are almostauthentic-looking 19th-century photographs with images that capture Romantic esthetics of beauty in a collection that veers between artistry and soft-core porn. They are of a time when subjects had to sit still for their portraits, and photographers could exploit the expressive possibilities offered by the significant amount of time needed to expose a glass or metal plate. The photographs, taken between 2004 and 2011, also made me think that Excoffier is "celebrating" the 19th-century photographers who mastered the technical challenges of their medium.
The images are different, of course, but some of the fascination of Excoffier's images has to do with trying to determine why modern technology can't make contemporary women with bodies and attitudes that are shaped by 21st-century society look exactly like women of more than a century ago.

Where Paiement marks the present with his bird's-eye views of Montrealers, Sarah Hatton looks upward to commemorate a world war that is marking its 100th anniversary.
Hatton commemorates five major battles in the First World War that involved Canadian soldiers with charts marking the position of the stars on the final night of battle. The stars are brass fasteners that held some of the paper files of 650,000 soldiers before the files were digitized.
The battle at Vimy Ridge killed 3,598 Canadian soldiers between April 9 and 12, 1917. Does it matter whether the dying and surviving soldiers could see the stars on the night of April 12 or if their view was obscured by clouds or smoke? Sky conditions weren't recorded in the archives Hatton studied. But "the most terrible acts imaginable can take place below on Earth, and none of it will ever change the position of the stars," she wrote in an email. "I can't think of another constant quite like it, and I find this thought comforting."

Canada's Muslim community stands tall: The country's first Islamic house of worship, the Al Rashid Mosque in Edmonton, provides solidarity and peace for its members in the wake of the Quebec mosque shooting

Full text: Sun pours through tall, rounded windows and off the gleaming hardwood planks inside Canada's first mosque. Rugs where immigrants kneeled while they said their daily prayers nearly a century ago cover the floors.
The country's first house of worship for Muslims was not established in a major centre such as Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver. The Al Rashid Mosque was constructed in Edmonton in 1938. The city had fewer than 90,000 residents and there were only about 700 Muslims in Canada at the time.
The cost of the project was $4,500, and it was imperilled by a cash shortage. Then others in the community, including Christians and Jews, pitched in to help raise funds. Right from the beginning, a special relationship was forged between people from widely different backgrounds - and it continues today.
When a forest fire swept through Fort McMurray, Alta., last summer, the Muslim community in Edmonton opened its doors to evacuees. And, on Monday night, a large crowd gathered in bitter cold outside the Alberta Legislature for an impromptu vigil organized for the shooting victims at a mosque in Quebec City. Six men were murdered in the attack by a lone gunman during evening prayers at the Centre culturel islamique de Québec on Sunday night.
"It is easy to become discouraged when something like that happens," said Aurangzeb Qureshi, a spokesman for the Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council. "The support we have received gives us hope that there is goodness in the world. People from all stripes were there in solidarity with us."
It's a solidarity the Muslim community has felt since it first set down roots in the city. Immigrants from presentday Lebanon and Syria began arriving in Canada in the late 1800s. Christians among them largely settled in the wast, while Muslims migrated more to the west.
Unlike the Europeans, who were mostly farmers, the Muslims were mainly businessmen such as Ahmed Ali Awid. After arriving in Ontario from present-day Lebanon in 1901, he moved to Manitoba, where he sold knitting needles and handkerchiefs door-to-door and then used his earnings to open a general store.
In 1927, Mr. Awid resettled in Edmonton and became a clothier, and then went on to help in the planning and fundraising for the Al Rashid Mosque. It closed in the early 1980s and was replaced by a new, larger building better suited to accommodate Edmonton's growing Muslim community.
The original little mosque on the prairie was moved to Fort Edmonton Park, a recreated pioneer village that serves as a tourist attraction.
The city's Muslim population had grown to 20,000 by then, and stands at more than 50,000 today. There are now more than one million Muslims across Canada.
Mayor Don Iveson and city councillors held an emergency meeting with members of Edmonton's Muslim community at the Al Rashid Mosque on Monday afternoon. In a hallway outside the boardroom where they met, a framed copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms hangs on the wall.
"I feel very sad," Raid Salim, a representative of another mosque in the city, the Dar Al Sunnah, told the mayor. "In Edmonton, we are scared."
Mr. Salim said there have not been any serious threats made against mosques in the city, but a handful have been targeted by vandals in recent years. Windows have been broken and ugly graffiti scrawled on walls.
The shootings on Sunday have only increased a gnawing sense of fear.
"We need an open conversation between levels of government and the city, and we need to have an action plan," Mr. Salim said. "We don't want consolation; we want preventative measures.
"We have to increase our vigilance and the security presence at our mosques just in case something unforeseen happens."
Mr. Iveson said he believes the risk of an incident such as the one in Quebec is low, but promised to take steps to protect the Muslim community.
"If the city needs to provide support, we will help," he said. "There is a particularly disturbing trend of Islamophobia that needs to be challenged in no uncertain terms as un-Canadian."
Plans were discussed about launching a social-media campaign that would make it difficult for anyone to target Muslims and indigenous people in Edmonton. The campaign would involve city officials and prominent residents.
"It has to be our main mission to make people know that racism is not acceptable and not cool," Mr. Salim said.
Aumer Assaf, a spokesman for the Al Rashid Mosque, was at a family dinner Sunday when he learned about the shootings in Quebec City.
"We talked in whispers so the children would not be scared," he said.
"These were people seeking peace and guidance. It is heartbreaking. Six families were destroyed."
Mr. Assaf was born and raised in Edmonton. His father, Mohamed, a real estate broker, arrived from Lebanon in 1965. Today, Mohamed is a diehard Oilers fan and roots for the CFL's Eskimos.
"I was stunned and sad for the loss of those innocent people," Mohamed said.
After sitting in on the meeting with the mayor and a closed-door town hall get-together with Premier Rachel Notley the same night, he felt reassured.
"I am prouder today than I was yesterday about being Canadian," he said.
"Somehow, Canadians are always able to put their heads together and do the right thing."
At the beginning, the Muslims that immigrated to Edmonton focused their energy on establishing themselves in the business world. Once that was accomplished, they set about establishing the first mosque in Canada.
"They felt they were losing their culture and their religion," said Richard Awid, whose father, Ahmed, carried a trunk on his back and sold items doorto-door. Richard is 78 and, until recently, gave interpretive tours of the country's first mosque at Fort Edmonton Park.
The original Al Rashid Mosque structure was moved there in 1989 and is surrounded by other buildings of local historical significance, including a hotel that dates to 1846, a vintage movie theatre and an-old fashioned drug store. Built by a Ukrainian-Canadian contractor, with its soaring spires, the mosque is often mistaken for an Orthodox church by the park's 170,000-plus annual visitors.
Before it could be moved, the roof had to be taken off and all of the bricks had to be removed one by one.
Then, the wooden frame was placed on the back of a flatbed truck and transported through the city's streets at night. City workers rode shotgun, taking down power lines to make room and then reinstalling them once the building had passed by.
Once the mosque arrived at Fort Edmonton, it took four years to put it back together again, brick by brick.
Improvements have been made and the building stands as a treasured piece of Canadian history today.
Students from Islamic schools visit on class trips. Mosques use it for social functions. Pilgrims come and pray in the first house of worship for Muslims erected in this country.
It is a cold winter day and there is a fresh coat of snow on the ground. The original mosque sits quiet on a piece of land not far from the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. It seems frozen in time, just like the river.
"I like the space because it is so incredibly peaceful," said Laura Nichol, the community outreach and volunteer co-ordinator at Fort Edmonton Park. "It just feels special."
"When we have a chance, we are excited to show it off."

Full text: In accepting congratulations this week for Arrival's extraordinary eight Academy Award nominations, director Denis Villeneuve was quick to share credit. "First of all, I exist as a filmmaker because I was formed by the Quebecois scene," he said.
Indeed, as Villeneuve noted in listing off several other much-honoured Quebec filmmakers (not least Xavier Dolan), this province has quite consciously provided an environment that, in Villeneuve's words, "encourages directors to create an original vision without worrying about box office."
Some might sneer that box office is exactly what filmmakers should be worrying about. (If a sublime art film falls in the forest ... ) But, as Villeneuve's own films have demonstrated, audiences can indeed be engaged by movies that are the product of a fresh, authentic vision - where there is no need for formulaic car chases because there is far more action inside the characters' heads.
A thought-provoking story about efforts to communicate with space aliens who land on Earth, Arrival is free of the usual cliches. Audiences have flocked to see it. And now, the film has been nominated for best picture and Villeneuve for best director.
There are also six other nominations, in less glamorous categories like sound mixing, that should not be overlooked. Several also went to Quebecers, which testifies to the depth of talent here. The film was shot in Quebec - in Montreal and near Rimouski - with a largely Canadian crew, and the special effects were also done here, all providing a significant economic boost.
Also not to be overlooked is another Quebec Oscar nominee: Theodore Ushev of the federal National Film Board, for his animated short Blind Vaysha.
Since the Quiet Revolution, Quebec has prioritized culture in a conscious effort to give expression to this province's distinct identity, lest it be overwhelmed by the rest of the continent. Similar concerns gave rise to Canadian content policies and other forms of federal support for artists.
The Quebec cultural scene is flourishing, thanks in part to the staunch financial support for the arts on the part of the government as well as to a cultural infrastructure that celebrates artistic achievement via events such as the ADISQ and Iris awards. It is not just Denis Villeneuve who is a product of the Quebecois scene. Global success stories like Cirque du Soleil and Arcade Fire, and even Celine Dion, have their roots in the uniquely supportive environment for the arts that exists in this province.
As Heritage Minister Melanie Joly reviews Canada's cultural policy - aiming to update it for the digital age - that is something Canadians would do well to ponder.

Full text: The 89th Academy Awards ends in a gaffe for the ages. See what else you missed - and catch up on the movies you still need to watch - from this year's ceremonies
The highlights - and lowlight
Call it: La La Land is this year's Best Picture . Wait, no - it's Moonlight . Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, it seems, with Beatty having the wrong envelope in hand, had their Steve Harvey moment in erroneously announcing La La Land's mistaken win. Moonlight is this year's Best Picture. Barry Hertz breaks down that gigantic gaffe and the rest of Oscar night's biggest moments.
So how did Jimmy Kimmel do in his opening monologue? Not so hot. "Kimmel is like a slightly elevated Jimmy Fallon or James Corden - an affable yuckster with no real agenda, or even a point of view. Which is exactly what this year's awards needed." Barry Hertz weighs in.
Not able to watch live? See tonight's ceremony so far in photos. (Or the red carpet here, if that's more your thing.)

The director of the Best Foreign Language Film was not in attendance: Asghar Farhadi won for The Salesman , but his absence was notable. Iranian astronaut Anousheh Ansari accepted the award on behalf of director Asghar Farhadi. "I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight," Ansari read in a statement. "My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S." "Dividing the world into ‘us' and ‘enemies' categories creates fear," Ansari continued in Farhadi's statement, which concluded with a passionate defence of the power of film to create empathy "between us and others, an empathy that we need today."
Guess who's that much closer to an EGOT after tonight? Viola Davis takes home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in . The film is the first big-screen adaptation of an August Wilson play.

Full text: A single mention in the Panama Papers and a Russian middleman's mysterious exclusion from Canada's sanctions list triggers a round-the-world chase for answers
?
It was a clear and chilly afternoon in Moscow - March 18, 2014 - when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the documents to formally annex the Crimean Peninsula away from Ukraine.
Frustrated Western governments soon began rolling out the only response they could agree on to Mr. Putin's brazen redrawing of Europe's borders: economic sanctions. Over the next two days, the United States would designate 27 individuals who would be denied travel to the U.S. and have their financial assets in the U.S. frozen.
In the Treasury Department news release announcing the sanctions, one of the longest sections was devoted to Vladimir Yakunin, then the head of the massive, state-controlled Russian Railways. "Yakunin is being designated because of his official position in the Russian government, but he is also a close confidant of Putin," it read in part.
That same week, the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper - always keen to confront Mr. Putin and show his support to the large Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora - announced an even longer list of 32 individuals considered close to the Kremlin who would be banned from travelling to Canada and have their assets in the country frozen.
But there was one striking omission: Mr. Yakunin, one of Mr. Putin's oldest and most trusted associates. Before Mr. Putin's rise to the presidency, the two men owned neighbouring dachas - Russian country homes - on the shores of Lake Komsomolsk, near Mr. Putin's native St. Petersburg.
As head of Russian Railways, Mr. Yakunin developed a close relationship with key figures at Canada's flagship transportation company, Bombardier Inc.
During his decade-long tenure at the head of the state railway monopoly - an entity that moves almost a billion passengers a year, and which took in revenue of $31-billion in 2015 - Mr. Yakunin's name became synonymous not only with the Kremlin inner circle, but with allegations of high-level corruption in Mr. Putin's Russia.
He resigned as head of Russian Railways in 2015, several months after a series of media reports alleged Mr. Yakunin had funnelled contracts worth billions of dollars to his close business associates, using shell companies to disguise the ultimate beneficiaries.
A months-long investigation by The Globe and Mail - prompted by a single mention in the Panama Papers leaks - found 100 transactions between Bombardier and Russian Railways that appear to follow a similar, peculiar pattern.
The revelation throws new light on Mr. Yakunin's curious ability to avoid being targeted by Ottawa. Canada's sanctions list has grown 13 times over the past 2 1/2 years - under both Conservative and Liberal governments - and now names 107 individuals and 39 entities. But Mr. Yakunin's name is still not on it.
Vladimir Yakunin, chief executive officer of OAO Russian Railways, listens during a conference session on day two of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum 2012 (SPIEF) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Friday, June 22, 2012.
Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg
When asked in 2015 about his omission from Canada's list, Mr. Yakunin hinted that Russian Railways's long relationship with Bombardier may have played a role - and he suggested that there could have been some sort of retribution. "I suppose Canadians are not the same masochists, like, you know, Europeans," he told a meeting with the heads of several news agencies in St. Petersburg. "This is jokingly answering your question. I consider that I am known enough in Canada as a promoter of the idea of collaboration."
In an e-mail exchange this fall with The Globe and Mail, Mr. Yakunin said he saw no reason he should be sanctioned by any country: "I have no sway over Russia's foreign policy." He also denied there was any corruption at Russian Railways under his leadership.
Mr. Yakunin lavished praise on former Bombardier chairman and chief executive officer Laurent Beaudoin. "He was and I believe still is one of the greatest professionals I have ever met. And I always valued the level of personal trust and respect we had in our relations," Mr. Yakunin wrote.
Official lobbying records show that a Bombardier official - the name on the register is Mr. Beaudoin's son Pierre Beaudoin, who succeeded his father as Bombardier's chief executive - visited the office of then-foreign minister John Baird on March 20, 2014, just as the Russian sanctions list was being drawn up.
Bombardier denied having any influence over the Canadian government's sanctions list, and Mr. Yakunin's exclusion from it. "Obviously there was some lobbying," said a well-placed Conservative source, who described the pressure as "fairly circumspect." The source said there was "constant discussion" within the Harper government about adding Mr. Yakunin's name to the list.
Bombardier has been a major player in the Russian transportation business since the mid-1990s. But its relationship with Russian Railways grew rapidly after Mr. Yakunin took the helm in 2005, including the formation of a new joint venture between the two companies.
The transactions examined by The Globe and Mail took place between 2011 and 2016, and involved about $160-million (U.S.) worth of sophisticated train signalling systems, known as Ebi Lock 950s, made at facilities in Sweden that belong to Bombardier's rail unit. Most often, the equipment was sent to one of two companies in Russia that are jointly owned by Bombardier and Russian Railways.
What isn't clear is why the sale of Bombardier equipment to two Bombardier-affiliated businesses needed a middleman.
The firm in the centre of the transactions is called Multiserv Overseas Ltd. It's a shell company that is registered in Britain, has directors living in Cyprus, and has a shifting ownership history that includes a changing series of other shell companies listed in a trio of offshore tax havens: Seychelles, Panama and Belize.
Multiserv appears to have at least an indirect connection to Mr. Yakunin. Its founding director was a man named Yuriy Obodovskiy, who is described in Russian media as a close associate of Mr. Yakunin (although Mr. Yakunin denies this). Mr. Obodovskiy also sits on the board of directors of one of the joint ventures that Bombardier formed with Russian Railways to import its equipment into Russia.
When asked about his company's relationship with the offshore company, Bombardier Transportation spokesman Marc-André Lefebvre said Multiserv Overseas had been part of Bombardier's supply chain since 2011, but could add little other information. "Multiserv is nominated by Russian Railways as the exclusive dealer of critical components to Ebi Lock 950 CBI System," he wrote in response to e-mailed questions.
But despite its apparent involvement in the sale of about $160-million in Bombardier gear, Multiserv appears to have no staff and no operating headquarters.
So The Globe set out to learn more about Bombardier's mysterious middleman in Russia. Our journey took us to London, Cyprus and Moscow, and yielded as many questions as answers.
Bombardier's expanding ties with Russian Railways

Bombardier has for decades been one of the giants of Canadian manufacturing, and one of the country's best-known corporate ambassadors abroad. Based in Montreal, it remains one of Canada's few genuinely global firms - albeit one that has fallen on hard times.
In October, it announced it would cut 7,500 jobs, more than 10 per cent of its total work force, across its rail and aerospace divisions. That move was the latest in an ongoing retrenchment designed to keep the company afloat while it gets a new commercial jet program, the C Series, off the ground. The C Series is billions of dollars over budget, and the cash drain forced the company to seek a $1-billion investment from the Quebec government; it is still waiting to find out whether the federal government will approve its request for a similar cash injection, money that would help buy some time for its turnaround plan.
Russia, meanwhile, has long been one of Bombardier's most important markets in the developing world. In the past three fiscal years it has reported more than $1-billion in sales in the country.
As with many foreign companies in Russia, it operates with the help of local partners. Twenty years ago, Bombardier joined forces with the national Railways Ministry to create a joint venture called Bombardier Transportation (Signal) Ltd., to produce control systems for Russia's 128,000 kilometres of railway tracks. The contract was continued in 2003, when Russia's rail network was partly denationalized with the creation of Russian Railways as a joint stock company.
The relationship did not always go smoothly. In 2004, Bombardier filed a $70-million lawsuit against Russian Railways in a Stockholm court after its Russian partner tried to walk away from a deal to produce high-speed Bombardier locomotives in favour of an offer from a German rival, Siemens AG. "I would say there are certain sectors of the Russian economy where lawlessness still prevails. Unfortunately, one of them is the natural monopoly of the railway," Christian-David Mueller, then-general director of Bombardier Russia, said at the time.
But Bombardier's troubles seemed to disappear shortly after Mr. Yakunin was appointed head of Russian Railways in 2005.
Mr. Yakunin came to the post from a wildly varied background. In the late 1980s, he served as a Soviet diplomat at the United Nations, leading to the widespread assumption that he had KGB training. Like many former apparatchiks, Mr. Yakunin spent the 1990s in private business, before joining the government shortly after Mr. Putin took power in 2000. He served first as deputy transport minister, before moving to become deputy head of Russian Railways upon its creation in 2003.
Bombardier dropped the lawsuit over the locomotives in 2005, when Russian Railways agreed to fulfill the contract. A few months later, Russian Railways announced plans to buy another $3-billion worth of Bombardier equipment.
The relationship expanded in 2007, when Bombardier became involved in a joint venture with Russian Railways, buying a stake of just less than 50 per cent in the railway's signalling division, known by its Russian acronym, Elteza.
Railway signalling equipment has been a big business for Bombardier in Russia. Its Ebi Lock units are sophisticated computer-based systems that help rail companies control routes and trains, to ensure safe operation and minimize the risk of accidents. Some of this gear has gone to the far reaches of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the world's longest railroad, and its Baikal-Amur branch line, which loops around Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake.
But those epic train journeys were short compared with the route through which money has flowed as the Ebi Lock 950s were sold into Russia.

Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg
The Globe and Mail examined documents relating to 99 sales of the signalling equipment. In each case, the producer of the gear is listed as Bombardier Transportation Sweden, a subsidiary that does engineering and manufacturing on railway and transit systems.
In most of the transactions, the importer of the equipment is one of Bombardier's joint ventures with Russian Railways - either Elteza or Bombardier Transportation (Signal). In others, it's a privately held Russian transportation company known as Prommikrotsentr.
On import documents, Multiserv Overseas is listed as the shipper. But the phone numbers attached to the records don't lead to a Multiserv office. In fact, when The Globe called the numbers, the managers at the companies - one Russian firm, one Lithuanian - told us they had never heard of Multiserv.
The data for the transactions - viewed on importgenius.com - are incomplete: They show only the price declared for the Ebi Lock 950s as they were imported into Russia. They do not show whether the $160-million is what was finally paid for the products, since both Bombardier and Russian Railways regard the final sale price of the Ebi Lock 950s as a corporate secret. "Pricing details in regard to individual pieces of equipment ... are confidential business information that cannot be divulged," said Marc Laforge, another Bombardier spokesman.
Mr. Laforge said that Multiserv Overseas Ltd. "did not receive fees of any type" for its services.
But a separate, 100th, transaction is more fully revealed because it was contained in the Panama Papers leaks, and reported on by Novaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper.
The Bombardier EBI Lock 950 Computer-Based Interlocking (CBI) system.
The documents, shared with The Globe and Mail, go into the details of a January, 2014, deal involving 13 Ebi Lock 950 systems purchased by Multiserv Overseas from Rambo Management Inc., a company controlled by Alexey Krapivin, the son of a long-time associate of Mr. Yakunin.
The transaction involved a $23-million payment to Rambo Management, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, from Multiserv's account at the Nicosia, Cyprus, branch of First Bank of the Middle East (FBME).
Anti-corruption experts say everything about the deal rings alarm bells.
The British Virgin Islands is a notorious tax haven that provides a business and banking address to hundreds of thousands of non-resident companies. Management of FBME Bank, meanwhile, was taken over by the Central Bank of Cyprus in July, 2014, after it was named as a "financial institution of primary money-laundering concern" by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury. FBME was accused of laundering money for organized crime, as well as for Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.
Bombardier's Mr. Laforge said that - although only Bombardier makes the Ebi Lock 950s - his company could not explain the unusual transaction.
"Bombardier Transportation has never conducted business with Rambo Management Inc. and consequently cannot provide any further information," he wrote.
None of the material seen by The Globe and Mail suggests any criminal activity by Bombardier or its Swedish subsidiary. Although two separate investigations into whether Bombardier Transportation paid bribes to win rail contracts in South Africa and South Korea came to light last year, no charges have been laid in either case.
However, The Globe and Mail's research into Multiserv Overseas - which appears to conduct no business other than its relationship with Bombardier - raises questions about whether the Montreal-based company did proper due diligence regarding its partners in Russia. It's also unclear whether Bombardier stayed within the boundaries of its own corporate code of conduct in routing so many transactions through Multiserv Overseas.
Bombardier's code of conduct declares that suppliers "must never make or approve an illegal payment to anyone under any circumstance," and "must disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest, and discuss it with Bombardier's management. Any activity that is approved, despite the actual or apparent conflict, must be documented."
When asked about the Ebi Lock 950 transactions, Russian investigator Sergei Lesnichiy - director of the Centre for Financial Investigations, an anti-corruption body set up by the Russian state - told The Globe and Mail that he saw potential grounds for an investigation. "There are signs of a conflict of interest," Mr. Lesnichiy said in an interview, pointing specifically to Mr. Obodovskiy's roles as both the founder of Multiserv Overseas and deputy chairman of the Elteza board of directors.
Robert Barrington, executive director of the British chapter of Transparency International, concurred. "This has got red flags all over it," he said. Referring to Bombardier's willingness to do business with an entity as murky as Multiserv Overseas, he added: "You would expect the highest levels of due diligence to be done."
The Globe decided to pay Multiserv a visit.
A mystery address in the heart of London
At first glance, Multiserv Overseas has the hallmarks of the kind of big player you might expect to be involved in major transactions between giants of the Canadian and Russian transportation industries.
The company is registered in Britain, with an office at 5 Fleet Place, a nine-storey building that sits atop a trendy tea-and-salads restaurant in the heart of London's financial district. The building is a short walk from the grey dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, though during the business day the ringing of the ancient bells is drowned out by the groaning of construction cranes and the rumbling of double-decker buses.
But the address turns out to be the first of many chimeras.
The receptionist at 5 Fleet Place - who sits at a metallic desk in the middle of a vast lobby that is empty but for a pair of thin, potted trees in the corner - says she has never heard of Multiserv Overseas. The lobby wall isn't much help: While 484 firms declare 5 Fleet Place as their registered address, only four have their names on it.
The biggest of those is Charles Russell Speechlys, a London law firm whose forerunner, Speechly Bircham, is connected to at least eight offshore entities named in the Panama Papers.
After a search of her computer, the receptionist at 5 Fleet Place confirms that Multiserv Overseas - a company that Bombardier says it has been doing business with since 2011 - is one more company registered inside the offices of Charles Russell Speechlys.
In the seventh-floor offices of Charles Russell Speechlys, questions about Multiserv Overseas initially draw looks of confusion. After a flurry of consultation, a Globe and Mail reporter is escorted into a small anteroom of the law office, which contains only a small black table, four chairs, a box of Twinings tea bags and a black telephone.
The telephone rings immediately. "Do you understand that this is not Multiserv, although they are our client?" inquires a polite female voice with an English accent.
Asked to explain the nature of Multiserv Overseas and its business, the woman replies by asking the reporter to return to the lobby to wait for another phone call.
The response comes less than five minutes later, after the secretary herself takes a phone call. "We are not legally compelled to answer your questions about our client," she said with a smile after hanging up the call. "Have a nice day."
It was the first dead end in a round-the-world hunt to understand one of Bombardier's business partners in Russia. But it would not be the last.
From Alpha to Omega

JAMES HILL/NYT
A trail of documents shows that Multiserv Overseas was founded in 2010 by Mr. Obodovskiy, a businessman in his mid-40s who plays multiple roles in Russia's transportation industry. (In addition to his role at Elteza, Mr. Obodovskiy sits on the boards of several railway-related companies with Alexey Krapivin, the owner of Rambo Management.)
When Multiserv Overseas was first incorporated, its address was listed as 13 John Prince's St., steps from the Oxford Circus tube station in London's affluent Marylebone district. That address, then and now, belonged to a firm called Alpha Commerce Ltd.
So we went there.
The cramped offices of Alpha Commerce are comprised of two rooms full of IKEA-style furniture. On a recent Friday afternoon, one among a trio of women working in them was busy entering data called in by a Russian-speaking client who was looking to form a new corporation.
Two floors down from Alpha Commerce is Omega Group, where Aleksej Strukov, one of two directors of Alpha Commerce, keeps a separate, much more expensively furnished, office.
Mr. Strukov said "hundreds" of companies are registered inside 13 John Prince's St., but he nonetheless remembers the creation of Multiserv Overseas.
"I remember because I went to Moscow for that one," Mr. Strukov said. Which, he adds, is not the usual practice. (Omega Group claims on its website that it can set up a new firm, issuing a certificate of incorporation as well as minutes of the new company's first meeting, within "several hours to one day." It charges about $50 for the service.)
Mr. Strukov, a physically fit 47-year-old with short blond hair, said he met personally in 2011 with Anton Belyakov, a Russian who would succeed Mr. Obodovskiy as the director of Multiserv Overseas.
Mr. Strukov said Multiserv Overseas was what it appeared to be on the shipping records, a "supplier" that purchased equipment from Bombardier Transportation Sweden - "and other companies" - and sold it to Russian Railways.
He said the firm was incorporated in London because having a British address was more beneficial than being listed in Russia "with its reputational problems," or higher-tax jurisdictions such as Canada or Sweden.
"I looked into who the beneficial owners of [Multiserv Overseas] are," Mr. Strukov said of his trip to Moscow. But he wasn't about to share the information. "I'm afraid you'd have to be standing here with a warrant."
He directed all further questions to Charles Russell Speechlys.
Asked to provide evidence that Multiserv Overseas was anything other than an offshore shell company, Bombardier spokesman Marc-André Lefebvre declined to comment. "Our commercial relationship with them is subject to standard confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations."
A company with a curious corporate history
Multiserv Overseas's unexplained role in $160-million of Bombardier rail equipment into Russia is not the only thing that seems odd about the company. Its corporate history, though only six years long, is filled with changes of ownership.
At the time of the company's creation in July, 2010, Mr. Obodovskiy was the only named director, and Multiserv Overseas issued only a single share, valued at one British pound. That share belonged to another British company called Multiserv Management LLP, which had been incorporated three months earlier at the same 13 John Prince's St. address in London.
Multiserv Management in turn had two founding shareholders, according to documents filed at Companies House, the British government agency that handles the registration and dissolution of corporations. The first was named as Sevenseals Management Inc. of Seychelles, an independent archipelago of 115 islands off the east coast of Africa. The second was listed as Yu Mark Trading, headquartered in the Central American country of Belize.
Neither Sevenseals nor Yu Mark appears to have conducted any activity other than their joint ownership of Multiserv Management.
In the government files, Sevenseals is listed as sharing one of the planet's most notorious addresses for shell companies: Suite 310 in the Premier Building in the heart of Victoria, the capital city of Seychelles.
Suite 310 first gained infamy in 2007 when then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama published a letter wondering how a woman named Stella Port-Louis - working out of Suite 310 in the faraway Premier Building - could possibly be the owner of more than 100 companies in the state of Wyoming alone. Mr. Obama said the fact that so many companies traced their ownership to a single Seychelles address was a clear example of the "serious problems confronting law enforcement as a result of minimal company ownership information requirements."
Another dark chapter was added to the history of Suite 310 in 2008, when the address was linked to four firms involved in money laundering for Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel. Four other companies linked to Suite 310 were connected to a 2009 effort to smuggle weapons from North Korea to Iran.
One year after that, Bombardier began doing business with an entity part-owned - at least on paper - by a firm at the same address.
The ownership saga of Multiserv Overseas only begins there. In 2012, ownership of Multiserv Overseas was transferred to a single Panamanian " " (anonymous society) called Sistema Amarelo. A year later, Sevenseals was back as part owner, with it and Sistema Amarelo controlling one share each. That structure lasted until January, 2015, when both shares were transferred to an entity called Renson Trading Ltd., newly registered in Belize. The listed address of Multiserv Overseas was briefly moved to yet another central London law office.
"Bombardier Transportation performed a due diligence in regard to Multiserv Overseas Ltd.," Mr. Laforge told The Globe and Mail. "Bombardier Transportation abides by the Bombardier Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and applies the highest standards of ethical business conduct. Our worldwide corporate structure abides by all applicable laws."
When asked whether anyone from Bombardier had visited the Seychelles, Panama or Belize to determine who the real owners of Multiserv Overseas might be, Mr. Laforge replied: "This question should be addressed to Multiserv Overseas Ltd."
Yet another restructuring took place in April, 2015. Multiserv Overseas filed papers declaring that its office had moved again, this time to 5 Fleet Place. It also said its sole director was a woman named Svetlana Tutunaru, a resident of Cyprus.
The Globe and Mail tracked her down, and discovered she spends her days working at a company called Delfi Corporate Services.
'Are you sure you're in the right place?'
Delfi Corporate Services
Delfi Corporate Services can be found on the fourth floor of a mid-rise office block in the modest business district of Nicosia, the laid-back and sun-drenched capital of Cyprus. The building is conveniently located across the street from the government's overwhelmed Registrar of Companies office, where a small team of bureaucrats sits amid a forest of cardboard filing boxes, trying to keep track of the more than 253,000 corporate entities that are registered in the Republic of Cyprus, a country of just 838,000 residents.
The website of Delfi Corporate Services says it provides "virtual office" services for "clients who want to show their permanent presence in Cyprus." Delfi helps clients look as if they have an office in Cyprus by providing a telephone line, receptionist and local business address.
Ms. Tutunaru initially seemed not to recognize the name of Multiserv Overseas, a company she was listed as the sole director of. "Are you sure you're in the right place?" she politely asked a Globe and Mail reporter who arrived unannounced in the cramped lobby of Delfi Corporate Services. "This is not Multiserv Overseas."
Reminded that she was the director of Multiserv Overseas, Ms. Tutunaru responded with a look of confusion.
In fact, publicly available records show that Ms. Tutunaru is the named director of at least half a dozen companies listed in Cyprus, and one listed in Panama. Asked if she could discuss Multiserv Overseas and its relationship with Bombardier, Ms. Tutunaru leaned into a colleague's office. "There's someone here asking about Multiserv Overseas?" she said in Russian.
The colleague rushed into the lobby and declared that she and Ms. Tutunaru were late for a meeting and had to leave the office immediately.
The next day, the receptionist at Delfi Corporate Services said Ms. Tutunaru was too busy to talk any time in the foreseeable future. "She has meetings all the time, so many meetings." Several follow-up calls and e-mails requesting information about Multiserv Overseas Ltd. went unanswered.
Asked about Ms. Tutunaru's position on paper as the only director of Multiserv Overseas Ltd. - a firm Bombardier Transportation does extensive business with - Mr. Laforge said: "Bombardier has no contractual relation either with Ms. Tutunaru personally or with her company Delfi Corporate Services."
Several weeks after that e-mail exchange, Ms. Tutunaru was replaced as the sole director of Multiserv Overseas by Ekaterina Trofimova, a 28-year-old resident of Cyprus with no previous board experience.
The cost of doing business in Russia?

Vladimir Yakunin insists he has done nothing wrong.
"I vaguely recall the name Maltiserve [sic]," the former Russian Railways boss said in his e-mail answers to The Globe. "The idea that contracts at [Russian Railways] could somehow be awarded on non-market or non-competitive terms is groundless and simply impossible."
Mr. Yakunin acknowledges a relationship with Andrei Krapivin - the late father of Alexey Krapivin - but says the media's portrayal of the Krapivin family (and by extension Alexey Krapivin's colleague, Yuriy Obodovskiy) as part of a web of corruption at Russian Railways was "absurd." He says he is "fairly certain" he has never met Mr. Obodovskiy. "There was not a single case where [Russian Railways] paid money to a contractor that did not do the work that it was contracted to do," he said.
After his surprise resignation last year - part of a generational shakeup in Mr. Putin's "politburo" - the 68-year-old is now trying to reinvent himself as an "unofficial voice" of Moscow, a scrupulously pro-Kremlin commentator on political affairs.
Grigory Levchenko, an aide to Mr. Yakunin, said the corruption allegations in Novaya Gazeta and other outlets were "politically motivated attacks" against his boss. He said that Mr. Yakunin, because he was perceived as close to Mr. Putin, "picked up his fair share of opponents, who will do anything to attack him, including thinking up incredibly elaborate accusations, which are fundamentally baseless."
Attempts to reach Mr. Obodovskiy or Mr. Krapivin for comment via several of their companies proved unsuccessful. Bombardier said it could not help arrange an interview with Mr. Obodovskiy, nor answer questions on his behalf.
Russian media have reported that Mr. Obodovskiy and Mr. Krapivin hold - via a series of shell companies - controlling stakes in the lead contractor carrying out a $16.3-billion upgrade of the Baikal-Amur railway, where many of the Ebi Lock 950s are being installed. Russian media have also reported that a Kremlin-ordered audit of the modernization of the Trans-Siberian and Baikal-Amur railways carried out by the accounting firm Deloitte found costs were 45 per cent higher than necessary.
"Russian Railways is the most extreme example of corruption [in Russia] because they are the biggest state company and give out the largest amount of contracts and tenders," said Gyorgiy Alburov, an investigator at the Fund to Fight Corruption, a non-government organization founded by Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny.
Bombardier, Mr. Alburov said, likely faced two choices when it came to doing business with Russian Railways: to accept an unusual payment structure involving offshore companies, or risk losing one of its biggest customers. He said it was astonishing that Mr. Yakunin's name had been left off Canada's otherwise lengthy sanctions list.
"He should be forbidden from entering any civilized country. This person is the symbol of corruption in Russia. He's a friend of Putin who controlled a huge state company and made his own friends very rich."
Canada's Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying records six meetings that Pierre Beaudoin had with Conservative government officials in 2014, including the March 20 meeting with Garry Keller, chief of staff to Mr. Baird. (Mr. Beaudoin stepped down last year as Bombardier's chief executive officer, but remains the company's executive chairman.)
Mr. Keller said the records are inaccurate in suggesting that he met Mr. Beaudoin one-on-one. Mr. Keller said the March 20, 2014, meeting was actually with Pierre Pyun, Bombardier's vice-president of government affairs, to discuss a dispute between Bombardier and the Greek government over payment for four fire-fighting water bombers the transportation company had sold to Athens.
Bombardier, through Mr. Laforge, the spokesman, declined to comment on the March 20 meeting. Mr. Laforge said Bombardier had "regular and frequent contacts with a large number of departments and offices of the Government of Canada," and that those contacts were "in compliance with applicable laws."
Several sources said that the final decision about which names were put on the sanctions list was made in Mr. Harper's Prime Minister's Office.
Austin Jean, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, refused to comment on whether the current Liberal government was still considering adding Mr. Yakunin's name to the sanctions list, which grew again last month when 15 new names were added. "Decisions to list certain individuals and entities are made strategically, and in close co-ordination with our international partners," Mr. Jean said.
Several Western businesspeople based in Moscow agreed with Mr. Alburov's assessment that a struggling Bombardier - which is in constant competition for Russia contracts with Siemens AG of Germany - likely had little choice but to accept a payment structure dictated to it by Russian Railways. They said conducting transactions via apparently superfluous offshore entities was often a condition of winning the deal when seeking contacts from enterprises owned by the Russian state.
"This type of arrangement is quite common in Russia, where a related-party firm is given exclusivity for a certain function or service connected with a large conglomerate or state-owned company," said one Western businessman with extensive experience in Russia, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
"There is no amount of due diligence a Western company could do avoid these arrangements, except to avoid the market altogether," said another Moscow-based Western businessman.
But completely avoiding Russia and other countries where corruption levels are high is probably not a realistic option for Bombardier - certainly not in its current state. As the company's C Series jet program has floundered, its aerospace division has been bleeding money. Over 2014 and 2015 alone, Bombardier Inc. burned nearly $3-billion in cash, forcing it to take significant measures to raise new money - including seeking the help of governments in Quebec City and Ottawa.
The aerospace unit has already been hurt by the sanctions war over Ukraine. The company signed a letter of intent in August, 2013, that would have seen it sell 100 of its Q400 turboprop planes to Russia's Rostec. The deal, worth $3.4-billion at the time, was put on hold after Russia annexed Crimea and Canada joined other Western governments in applying sanctions.
In the midst of this corporate crisis, the Bombardier rail unit has been a rare bright spot. Last year it posted an operating profit of $465-million, and it has $31-billion in future orders. While it has had its share of troubles - its failure to deliver new streetcars on time to the Toronto Transit Commission is one black eye - its future prospects are good enough that when Bombardier needed to raise money, it was able to sell 30 per cent of the rail division for $1.5-billion to the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.
At least some of those prospects are based on the company's ability to make sales in big developing markets including China and Russia, which get poor scores from anti-corruption bodies such as Transparency International - places where mysterious middlemen sometimes appear in corporate deals to take a slice of the action.
Mr. Alburov of the Fund to Fight Corruption said the real victims of the alleged schemes at Russian Railways were ordinary Russians, who had to pay higher train fares - and higher prices for food and other goods shipped by rail - to compensate for what he said were the billions of dollars skimmed from Russian Railways.
Mr. Lesnichiy, the Russian financial-crimes investigator, said that the shifting ownership structure of Multiserv Overseas suggested the company's purpose was to be a "flexible" intermediary. He said it was very unlikely that the offshore firm took no profits, as Bombardier's spokesmen claimed.
"The end goal of any deal is for it to be profitable for all sides, including the middleman," Mr. Lesnichiy said.
"How do you define the sum that the middleman is owed in a negotiation? One hundred rubles or one million? Has he earned it, or has he stolen it? And has he stolen from me or stolen from you?"

Full text:   AT A GLANCE
Learn more about Montreal museums at museesmontreal. org. Montreal's Other Museums: Off the Beaten Track (Vehicule Press, 2013) by Montreal writer Rachel Alkallay, is an illustrated pocket guide to the city's lesser-known museums.
Washington, D.C. is a city rich in museums: On the National Mall alone, more than a dozen beckon. Yet one of my most memorable visits was to an unassuming museum run by the Daughters of the American Revolution; the exhibition featured vintage wedding dresses and its theme was the evolution of wedding traditions and customs over the past two centuries.
I loved everything about the DAR Museum, just a couple of blocks from the White House. I loved that its scope was manageable and that the exhibition dealt with a single topic, that it was accessible, and that my self-guided visit felt personal and intimate.
We have got it into our heads that we have to see a whole lot when we go to museums - that our experiences there have to be, you know, big. They don't.
With that it mind, I decided to check out five Montreal museums that kind of fly under the radar. They're offthe beaten track and a few are really small. Admission is free or nominal and a couple offer free guided tours; two or three rely on volunteers and have limited hours. But each, in its own way, makes for an enriching experience and, in some
cases, even a profound one.
I challenge anyone to visit the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre and not come away moved, even changed. In only a brief visit to the Dorval Museum of Local History and Heritage, I learned something of a community I'd known next to nothing about.
The Musee des Pompiers de Montreal is a fun place, with its antique fire trucks and vintage alarm boxes - and then you find yourself standing before a glass-fronted cabinet holding rows upon row of helmets that belonged to firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty and something catches in your throat.
The Dorval Museum of Local History and Heritage is on Chemin Bord du Lac, or Lakeshore Drive, in what used to be the coach house of the private Forest and Stream Club next door. The mission of the museum, open since 2002, is to inform the public about the founders of Dorval, some of its more highprofile citizens, and events in its history. Maybe take a few minutes to contemplate the splendid view of Lac St-Louis from one of the benches out back.
There are three exhibition rooms and the impeccably preserved former horse stalls are a big draw for kids. On the upper level, the community's history is presented in a lively timeline spanning more than 300 years. In the large room at the front of the main level, the walls are hung with portraits and brief descriptions of prominent residents. Among them are Anne Savage, an artist with the Beaver Hall group and an art educator; Frances Oneson, one of Canada's first female air traffic controllers; and Henry (Harry) Markland Molson, a onetime Dorval mayor who was owner of the Molson Bank at the time of his death in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.
Among the museum's features are memorabilia and trivia from domains including business, culture and places of worship. Longtime Montrealers will recognize the wooden box on which copies of The Montreal Star once sat at newsstands, for instance, and there is a framed sample of Dorval's own tartan, courtesy of the Dorval Weavers' Guild. 1850 Chemin Bord du Lac, Dorval.
Open Thursday through Sunday, 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., with volunteer docents on hand to answer questions. Free admission. 514-633-4314.
The Ecomusee du fier monde, in Montreal's Centre-Sud neighbourhood, provides a window onto the area's industrial history: In the late 19th century through to the middle of the 20th century, Montreal was an industrial and commercial centre and the people who worked in the factories in Centre-Sud also lived in Centre-Sud. They bowled with their friends from work and they met their wives at work, as Ecomusee director Rene Binette explained.
The museum is housed in a former public bath on Amherst St., opened in 1927: The majority of residents of working-class neighbourhoods in the early 20th century had no baths or showers. It's a commanding space with vaulted ceilings, designed in the Art Deco style. The facility had a recreational function as well: It was once the busiest pool in Montreal, Binette said, used for activities such as water polo and synchronized swimming.
The pool closed in 1992, although the original ceramic tile of the pool walls is still visible, and the building was turned over to the Ecomusee, with a mandate to be a museum of industrial history. The permanent exhibition traces the impact of industry on the families who worked in the factories - to make ends meet, often the entire family, including children, had to work - and it includes household objects of the era as well as testimonies from residents.
From the 1950s through the 1970s, as the factories closed and people moved away, the area lost its industrial character. Photographer, visual artist and composer Daniel Heikalo, born in 1954, lived in Centre-Sud for 25 years and his fine and stirring series of photographs of what was essentially a disappearing world makes up the museum's excellent temporary exhibition. Regard inedit sur mon quartier, which features photographs set mostly in the 1970s and largely in black and white, runs to Aug. 28.
Part of the Ecomusee's mandate is to encourage community participation and projects include a literacy group. The space today is used for book launches, cocktail receptions, movie shoots - and even weddings and funerals. 2050 Amherst St.
[broken bar][broken bar]Open Wednesday through Sunday. $8 for adults; $6 for students, seniors and children over 6; $16 family admission. 514-528-8444.
There's something about seeing things with your own eyes, said Alice Herscovitch, director of the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre. Like the 1938 notice on view in a glass case at the Cote-des-Neiges museum that says, "Jews are not wanted here in Ste-Agathe, so scram while the going is good."
The mission of the museum, established in 1979 by a group of Holocaust survivors with support from members of the Jewish community and Federation CJA, is to educate people about the Holocaust, whatever their age or background, and to sensitize them to the perils of anti-Semitism, racism, indifference and prejudice.
"When people come to the museum, I think they are often shocked that they are not in a museum of horror," said Herscovitch. Certainly there is tragedy and incredible sadness in the exhibits. But there is much more than that, including stories of resistance and survival.
"I think people come out reflecting, making comparisons to contemporary society," she said. "They often come away with great inspiration ... asking themselves, in today's world, where atrocity continues, what must we do?" Often people are surprised to learn of Canada's inaction in the face of what was happening to Jews in Europe during the Second World War. "People see Canada as a great human-rights intervener," Herscovitch said, but as is shown through correspondence and more on display at the museum, "only 70 years ago ... a very different set of values" was at work. Between 1939 and 1944, only 4,000 Jews were admitted to Canada - 6.5 per cent of the total number of immigrants.
Among visitors each year to the museum are about 10,000 young people on school visits; about 1,800 more students visit individually. When I was there one recent afternoon, several American and European tourists were there. Still, "in terms of individual visitors, we have space for more," said Herscovitch.
There are still opportunities, if diminishing, to hear Holocaust survivors give testimony. Among other venues, they speak to visitors during open houses at the museum: The next ones will be Sept. 17, Nov. 20 and Dec. 11.
The museum itself features interactive screens and other experiential elements. This year museology students at the Universite du Quebec a Montreal prepared three powerful videos on some of the objects in the collection. And an app featuring three tours of its permanent exhibition can be downloaded free on iPads and Android devices. 5151 Cote-Ste-Catherine Rd. near Westbury Ave.
[broken bar][broken bar] Open daily except Saturday and Jewish holidays. Admission: $8 for adults, $5 for students, seniors and children. Free guided tours for groups by reservation only. 514-345-2605.
Can't really have a Canadian museum exhibition about space that doesn't mention William Shatner, a.k.a. Captain James T. Kirk, or astronaut Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian to float freely in space - and the current exhibition at the Musee des Ondes Emile Berliner in St-Henri, a history of Montreal's involvement in space exploration, mentions both.
Emile Berliner was a pioneer in the record and gramophone industry and the museum, open since 1992, has featured one exhibition each year; topics have included radio and the early years of jazz. What were once Berliner's gramophone facilities eventually became the home of RCA Victor Canada in St-Henri. As the exhibit shows, the company got involved in the development and production of high-tech products including microwave radio relay systems, communication satellites and television broadcast equipment. "The 20th century was all about transformation," said museum director Michel Forest.
RCA Victor produced radios for planes and tanks in the Second World War and went from what was essentially an entertainment company to a high-tech company in the space of six years, he explained. With the onset of the
Cold War, early warning radar detection stations were developed across Canada, including the Distant Early Warning line in the Far North. The space race came next: The Russians were first in space with the Sputnik in 1957, the Americans second in 1958 with Explorer 1: Canada was the third country, with the Alouette 1 satellite in 1962 - and RCA had begun its foray into the aerospace industry.
"I don't think Montrealers understand how important this little space was in the history of the century," said Forest. Satellite components, models of satellites and screens with printed information make for a thorough self-guided visit and there is someone on hand to answer questions. 1001 Lenoir St., Rm E-206.
[broken bar][broken bar] Open to all from 2 to 5 p.m. Friday to Sunday, Wednesdays by appointment only. Suggested donation: $5.
When an organization of auxiliary firefighters established itself in Montreal back in 1944, one of their functions was to operate a canteen that served refreshments to firefighters battling big blazes. They still do that. "It's a way of giving back to the firefighters," said Steve Garnett, who has been president of the organization of 26 auxiliary firefighters and director of its Musee des Pompiers de Montreal since 2004. The auxiliary firefighters, all volunteers, get about 250 calls a year, although not all are to fires: They also attend parades, such as the Santa Claus and the St-Patrick's Day events.
The museum has been on St-Laurent Blvd. at Laurier Ave. since 1980 in a building that was once a combined police and fire station; the police station closed in 1979.
The museum space, which occupies two floors, was renovated in 2005-2006, and there is a good deal to see. The museum has 22 antique fire trucks, although there isn't space for all of them at the museum. There are, however, several vehicles on display, including old ones pulled by hand and hose wagons with steam engines that were pulled by two or four horses.
There are old red fire buckets, with rounded bottoms (so no one would pinch them to use for purposes other than firefighting, Garnett said) and old leather fire hoses. There are old fire photos, vintage uniforms and red alarm boxes, like the ones that were a common sight on Montreal street corners until the early 1980s, and the volunteers leading the tours explain how they worked. 5151 St-Laurent Blvd. at Laurier Ave.
[broken bar][broken bar]Open Sundays, 1:30 to 4 p.m. Free admission, with donations appreciated. 514-872-3757.

On The Beach With Cinq-Mars; New John Farrow novel by Ferguson leads a set of summer crime reading

Author: McGillis, Ian

Full text:   We can only assume there will be weather fit for beach reading some time before September; with a little luck it may even have arrived by the time you're reading this column. As we know, a law of nature links sunshine, sand and surf with genre fare, and sure enough, an array of writers with local connections have been landing with new offerings.
Lawyer/writer Peter Kirby has been gaining momentum with his Luc Vanier series of taut noir thrillers; Open Season (Linda Leith Publishing, 360 pages, $16.95) was actually published late last year, but having recently been named winner of the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Novel, this multi-layered narrative of a Guatemalan journalist kidnapped in Montreal could be the one to put him over the top. John Goldbach, whose alterna-thriller The Devil and the Detective has attracted a small but adamant cult, is back with the story collection It Is An Honest Ghost (Coach House, 144 pages, $18.95), a dip into which confirms a writer equally comfortable in a number of modes, from the supernatural to the accessibly experimental. Legions of Kathy Reichs devotees marking time until the next Bones instalment can avail themselves of Trace Evidence (Puffin, 304 pages, $12.99). Co-written with son Brendan Reichs, this set of four novellas can be taken as an ideal introduction to the Virals series of mysteries featuring teen heroine Tory Brennan, greatniece of forensic anthropologist Temperance. Technically it's Young Adult, but aren't we all young adults when we look in the mirror?
And then there is Trevor Ferguson, whose series of thrillers written as John Farrow have drawn a following far outstripping his critically acclaimed literary work. The new Seven Days Dead (Minotaur/Raincoast, 298 pages, $36.99), set on an island in the Bay of Fundy where the widely despised local patriarch is on his last legs and a nasty struggle to fill the vacuum looks imminent, might be the best Emile Cinq-Mars novel yet. Grand Manan bears many of the hallmarks of island cultures: locals suspicious of outsiders, a festering internal class divide, a hardcore perfectly happy living without electricity, and a flaky fringe, in this case a secretive gathering of New Age oddballs intent on learning how to levitate. Early on, a maverick pastor is gruesomely murdered deep in the forest on a stormy night, and into the resulting cauldron of suspicion steps the now-retired Montreal cop Cinq-Mars for what's meant to be a restorative summer retreat with wife, Sandra. There are no prizes for guessing he gets drawn into the investigation, but beyond that, the mounting sense of unease lets us know we're in the hands of a master. The best crime fiction has always strained against genre confines; Ferguson as Farrow is at the forefront of writers blurring that line to the point where it may soon no longer be needed.
Being John Farrow: A short conversation with Trevor Ferguson
Q Do you find that you can scratch all your literary /artistic itches within the crime genre?
A Oddly enough, Seven Days Dead was taking up residence within my synapses for a time as, potentially, a literary novel. That germination never jelled until I let go of the literary conceits and invited the crime novel in. What eluded me initially was that I didn't have a central character on which the book could turn. The moment Emile Cinq-Mars stepped onto the page, the book was born and I realized almost immediately that he was the answer the story was looking for.
A difference with crime is that narrative drive must never be relinquished, and I'm fine with that. I have to be more self-critical, more judgmental, with respect to how much philosophizing enters the fray, as it's something my character enjoys but the form is uneasy with him when he does so. I do have to be judicious and pick my spots, but that's not so different. Otherwise, it's all systems go.
Q Like your last (non-crime) novel The River Burns, Seven Years Dead explores an isolated community with semi-outlaw elements. What attracts you to such settings?
A The juxtaposition of cultures that are virtually diametrical opposites interests me. Just as individuals learn of themselves when they are challenged or assailed by others, so it is when groups are in opposition. People either learn and adapt, or they retreat. Either way, tensions arise, and that leads to a story unfolding. Folks in Dark Harbour on Grand Manan lived for decades offthe grid - both electrically and socially. They dwelled in shacks and roughhewn homes on the side of a cliff, and lived offwhat they could gather from the seashore. On another cliff, you have Harvard professors living in their summer mansions, an entirely different enclave. Then you have the regular folk, although they can be surprising, too. A significant number of fishermen, for instance, have degrees in English literature. A high number of deaths among them are attributed to recreational drug use. So they live traditional lives, but not in a traditional context. When these groups come together and rub up against one another, a friction occurs that creates sparks. You might say that my job as a writer is to fan the flames to see who can survive the fire.
Q Emile Cinq-Mars is showing his age. Do you have an endgame in mind for him, or will he run indefinitely?
A Emile is showing his age, and I hope to make the most of that. His endgame may well depend on mine, but for the nonce we're both OK. The next two books are written, the next one after that is well underway, and so far he's still standing, although he's hospitalized at this very moment thanks to a bullet hole and a blood infection. Moving him into retirement has freed him from the dictums and doggerel of the police department, allows him to be afoot and explore different locales, but it also has him facing his mortality, the challenges of being an older man with a younger wife, and having to engage younger and more virulent criminals with depleted physical strength, stamina, or his usual quickness of mind. He must adapt. That by itself interests me. A writer ought to allow his or her characters to be themselves, and not be puppets on the writer's strings. Which is to say that the hour of his death can no more be known to Emile Cinq-Mars, or by me, than it is for any of us.
Q Do you keep up on contemporary crime fiction?
A I'm not the leading expert on it. I was speaking to an agent (not mine) in New York last year, and he speculated that what makes my books unique may have to do with the fact that I'm not well read in the form. Arguable, but that may be the case. I did come to the form after reading the likes of Martin Cruz Smith, James Lee Burke and the espionage master John LeCarre. They all write well, and out-write many a literary maven. As I move through the genre, and meet more writers, I'm realizing how extraordinarily diverse and talented the field is. Literary writing is, thankfully, judged by the best of its offerings, which has the effect of raising the profile of lesser writers; yet crime fiction is too often categorized by the least of its writers, which has the effect of diminishing the achievements of the best. May that change. In any case, I'm out to change it.

Full text:   Montreal is excluded from an open-fire ban that encompasses most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River as of 8 p.m. Friday. Other exceptions are Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. The ban, which was recommended by SOPFEU, an organization that helps protect against forest fires, also excludes Ile Jesus (Laval), Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks Laurent Lessard decided to ban fires because of the heat wave we have just entered. Environment Canada forecasts sunny skies in Montreal with temperatures ranging from 27 degrees Celsius to 31 C from Friday till Monday. Fire danger over forested areas of Quebec range from high to extreme. There are two active forest fires in Quebec right now: Abitibi-Temiscamingue, and 20 kilometres northeast of St-Jerome in the Laurentians. Since the season began, there have been 224 fires over 156 hectares.

After a mild winter, meteorologists calling for drier, warmer spring weather

Abstract: "With a drier weather pattern, I think temperatures especially in May, will be clearly above normal," said Anderson, who pointed out that dry weather could lead to an increased risk of forest fires in northern Quebec during the hot summer months.

Full text:   You can put away those winter tires, if you haven't done so already, because the seasonal forecast for Montreal is calling for warmer spring weather.
"No more snow," Andre Cantin, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, declared triumphantly.
"I would say it's over in Montreal for the snow."
Hardly a bold prediction following Sunday's sunny high of 22 C, a teaser for the outdoor terrasse weather that awaits Montrealers in the coming months.
For the record, Sunday's high fell short of the record of 25 C, set in 1960, but Cantin said it's not unusual to see those kind of hot daily temps in April in Montreal.
Cantin pointed out that the record high for April 18 is 28.3 C, set back in 1976, while the hottest April 16 on record was a blistering 29 C, set in 2012.
Brett Anderson, a meteorologist with AccuWeather, sounded hopeful that warmer weather was on its way.
"The cold is behind us, warmth is ahead of us," he said." But I think we're looking at more up and down temperatures for the remainder of April."
Although the spring weather has been soggier than usual, Anderson is predicting warmer, drier weather.
"As we get into the rest of April and into May, dryness will be more common across the region.
"With a drier weather pattern, I think temperatures especially in May, will be clearly above normal," said Anderson, who pointed out that dry weather could lead to an increased risk of forest fires in northern Quebec during the hot summer months.
"Definitely, I'm concerned about wildfires. I think it could be another big season in the northwest of Quebec. If it stays dry, you know how it can be in parts of Quebec, there could be more fires than normal."
Due to a mild winter, Cantin said flooding was not a concern in many areas around Montreal this spring.
"There was not enough snow around Montreal this year for flooding, " Cantin said.
"There were a few threats in the Laurentians and northern part of the Outaouais, and south of Quebec at Riviere Chaudiere.
"But it melted slowly and there was not a lot of rain to make it flood."
Asked if Montreal had seen its last snowflake for some time, Anderson was careful not to make any such prediction.
"I never say that, because you never know what can happen, " he said. "Sometimes things change quickly."

Abstract: La Chaumiere is nestled into a forest less than two kilometres from the Tremblant resort, adjacent to the Tremblant cycling path and at a stop for the local shuttle bus. Bed and Breakfast: La Chaumiere has five guest rooms, all with a classic Alpine look - hand-painted armoires, antiquestyle dressers and petit-point rugs over beautiful knotty floors.

Full text:   I popped in to meet the new owners of La Chaumiere de L'Anse on a recent short hop to Tremblant and found the BB still is at the top of its game.
Martin Menard and Man Li have made the leap to innkeepersas second careers and have lucked into a darling inn with a great location.
La Chaumiere is nestled into a forest less than two kilometres from the Tremblant resort, adjacent to the Tremblant cycling path and at a stop for the local shuttle bus. Deer gambol through the woods and big blue jays feed on the patio. The tableau of a peaceful country getaway is complete.
I felt at home at La Oolong tea and cookies. And Zoe, the couple's big, sweet German shepherd, sChaumiere de L'Anse in five minutes. The fireplace was blazing in the living room. Li served at at my feet, hoping for a rub.
(Doggie note: Zoe schmoozes with guests only if she's invited to do so, and after one pat, she is your loyal BFF. She is so gentle she once saved an injured bird, carrying it to the house, just as retrievers do. Still, we have to admit there are fewer deer in the neighbourhood than before she arrived).
Menard and Li are a dynamic couple. They met a few years ago on a Vancouver-to-Montreal flight when she was returning from a family visit in her native city of Wuhan in China, which has a population of 14 million. He was a sales rep who boarded more than 100 flights a year.
They started out in Montreal, but Menard is a country boy at heart, so he's happy to be stoking the fire, removing snow, landscaping, doing maintenance and even housekeeping. Bed and Breakfast: La Chaumiere has five guest rooms, all with a classic Alpine look - hand-painted armoires, antiquestyle dressers and petit-point rugs over beautiful knotty floors. The colours, different in every room, are soothing tones like saffron, sky blue, sage, antique blue and rose. Botanical prints and vintage landscapes brighten the walls.
Menard and Li share the cooking and present their morning menu on a small blackboard. She prepares freshly baked croissants and copious fruit salads with big bowls of yogurt.
He is an enthusiastic cook whose specialties include: scrambled
eggs with smoked salmon, bacon or sausage; thin French crepes or French toast with maple butter and maple syrup. The omelette Chaumiere - his piece de resistance - is filled with ham, cheese and onions.
And Menard makes his own blueberry, strawberry and raspberry jam.
"You have to try the jam - the recipes are from my mother and grandmother!" He is proud of his family's production of maple syrup and maple butter at La Cabane du Bois a Sucre Vercheres on the South Shore, which is a consistent winner at professional tastings.
It's a welcoming place, with a coffee corner on the landing and a mini-fridge in each room with soft drinks, at no charge. The breakfast portions are generous and Li will wrap up a snack for the road of anything you could not finish, like croissants or fruit.
Tremblant in summer: The ski lifts will operate April 9 and 10, and again April 16 and 17. Golfers can tee up at the scenic Le Geant as of May 20 and Le Diable courses, from May 13.
At Lac Tremblant, there will be beach life, swimming and rentals of canoes, kayaks, paddleboards, pontoon boats and motorized craft.
The picturesque paved Tremblant cycling path runs up and down through the woods, for eight kilometres from the mountain resort to the village, passing La Chaumiere de L'Anse. That trail links with the Linear Parc of the P'tit Train du Nord at Place de la Gare, the old train station, now an art gallery and farmers' market.
Taking cycling up a notch, two major cycling happenings dominate the Tremblant calendar for May. VeloMotion presents the 22nd Quebec /Canada Cup Mountain Bike Series (May 20-23), races that draw top athletes for downhill and cross-country, as well as fun for everyone, like yoga for cyclists and guided tours. The Gran Fondo Mont-Tremblant (May 27-29) is a series of road-biking races from 45 to 160 kilometres, which includes a sunset ride and socializing.
It will be a remarkable summer of pop culture and sporting events, with almost all events free, at least for spectators. Here are the majors: Subaru Ironman 5150 Mont-Tremblant on June 25; Subaru Ironman 70.3 Mont-Tremblant on June 26; Tremblant International Blues Festival from July 8-17; Rythmes Tremblant from July 22-31; Wanderlust Festival (fees apply) from Aug. 11-14; Mont-Tremblant Half-Marathon on Aug. 14: Subaru Ironman Mont-Tremblant from Aug. 19-21; Fete de la Musique from Sept. 2-5; Tremblant Gourmand (fees apply) from Sept. 10-18.

Indigenous languages are link to past

Abstract: Working with a small class, Metallic was able to guide students through the mechanics and subtleties of Mi'kmaq and, in return, they would help with efforts to revitalize the language in Listuguj - where the use of Mi'kmaq has been in a state of decline for decades. "To ask a linguist what it might mean for (Canada) to lose an indigenous language, that's like asking a biologist what it might mean for the rain forest to disappear," said Richard Compton, the UQAM linguistics professor who's organizing the conference.

Full text:   Janine Metallic says that something magical happens when she hears the Mi'kmaq language spoken.
She may live in Montreal now, about 800 kilometres southwest from her home in the Listuguj First Nation on the Gaspe Peninsula, but the words carry her to that distant place.
"When I hear the language, it immediately brings me back home," said Metallic, a PhD student at McGill University. "The way we tell jokes, the way we tell stories, there's a whole world view embedded in those words. It's a different reflection of the world."
In 2011, Metallic partnered with McGill's linguistics department for a project on the Mi'kmaq language. Working with a small class, Metallic was able to guide students through the mechanics and subtleties of Mi'kmaq and, in return, they would help with efforts to revitalize the language in Listuguj - where the use of Mi'kmaq has been in a state of decline for decades.
The study and revitalization of indigenous languages is part of a conference beginning next Friday at Universite du Quebec a Montreal. The conference will host linguists from across the continent as they explore the nuts and bolts of how indigenous languages work, how we record them and how we might be able to preserve them.
"To ask a linguist what it might mean for (Canada) to lose an indigenous language, that's like asking a biologist what it might mean for the rain forest to disappear," said Richard Compton, the UQAM linguistics professor who's organizing the conference. "It's such a critical part of the vitality and culture of this country."
Compton is working on a dictionary that has compiled about 8,000 words in Kangiryuarmiut - a language used by indigenous people in Canada's remote northwest.
Metallic, 43, is one of the few people of her generation in Listuguj that learned to speak Mi'kmaq from her parents. By the 1970s, children in the Mi'kmaq territory were schooled off-reserve after a fire burned down the local school.
This contributed to an erosion of the language - one that started with the residential school system and other assimilationist policies - and it mirrored what was happening in reserves across Canada. "It was important for my family that if we were going to be schooled in English, we had to preserve our language," Metallic said. "Our household policy was Mi'kmaq only. The second we got off the school bus and entered our home, it was only Mi'kmaq.
"Other parents didn't all feel that way. They thought, 'You need English to succeed.' My parents had the attitude that, 'They can learn more than one language.' "These days, in Listuguj, Metallic's mother and her sister are teaching a new generation to speak the language of their ancestors. Though the efforts are community-based, McGill University's linguistics department lent some of its expertise to language immersion programs on the territory.
"What's important to emphasize here is it's really not linguists who 'save' languages. It's communities who do this," said Jessica Coon, a McGill University linguistics teacher who worked on the Listuguj project. "We can assist with existing efforts, we can share some of our research but, in Listuguj, there's a real willingness from the community to learn the language."
Among the most prominent obstacles contributing to the decline of aboriginal languages is the fact that as they continue to erode, it becomes increasingly difficult to practise them.
"If I want to learn Spanish, I can go to Mexico and be surrounded by it," said Coon, who specializes in Mayan dialects. "Whereas if you want to learn Mi'kmaq, there's nowhere you can go where you'd be forced to speak Mi'kmaq. ... So if you want to learn it, you have to really build a strategy, you have to go out and find speakers to converse with and that's not necessarily easy."
The other major hurdle is that implementing these programs is labour intensive and costly. In last week's budget, the federal government announced annual grants of $5 million to promote aboriginal languages, but some argue that doesn't go far enough.
Pam Palmater, a Mi'kmaq lawyer and academic, wrote in a blog post Wednesday that the real cost of reinvigorating Canada's 53 aboriginal languages could be in the billions.
In communities like Listuguj, however, it seems the efforts will continue with or without help from Ottawa. Metallic says that while many may believe there's no practical reason to learn Mi'kmaq - a language spoken by about 10,000 Canadians according to Statistics Canada - there's a yearning for people to reconnect with the dialect of their ancestors.
"People are establishing a link to the previous generations," said Metallic. "So many things in our history, our colonial past, disrupted that intergenerational transmission of language. It's hopeful to see people making that effort." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text:   December showers bring January flowers - recent Montreal winter rhyme.
Unseasonal greetings, everyone. Our weirdly tropical December, November, October and September have made weather the hottest topic in town.
Christmas is supposed to come gift-wrapped in swirling snowdrifts, frosted windshields and the wail of tow trucks dragging your car away. It's supposed to make you feel that: "The weather outside is frightful, But the fire is so delightful." Instead it's as warm as Labour Day.
So far there's been no "snow glistening," or "sleigh bells jingling," or cash registers ringing up big winter clothing sales, since we're all dressing for early fall.
There's been no skiing or skating, because people are still skateboarding and golfing. In fact, I've been taking my last bike ride of the year up Mount Royal regularly for the last 30 days.
There are two ways to view our eerie warm weather, depending on your personality type:
TYPE 1 - APOCALYPSE-NOW: If you're a Type 1, it's easy to see signs of approaching doom everywhere. Spring daffodils are blooming in England, roses are blossoming in New York and lush green grass is thriving in your Montreal backyard.
Our city's squirrels have spent so many weeks stuffing themselves silly for hibernation they look fat enough to explode.
TYPE 1 fears we are seeing a Dickensian "Ghost of Christmas Future" - a glimpse of Montreal in 20 years as climate change increases, making every winter this warm, or warmer.
They envision a bleak, snowless time when our rivers are drying up - and there are swamp tours run in the St. Lawrence Everglades Forest to see the parrots and alligators.
A time when droves of refugees from flooded Florida arrive each day, seeking safety in shacks built on the high ground of Mount Royal - and there's talk of building a wall to keep them out, under Prime Minister Trudeau the Third.
A time when skiing and hockey are only memories, replaced by desert beach volleyball and camel-racing in the Lake St. Louis Gulch.
Type 1 just can't enjoy this winter's warm weather, without feeling irresponsible. Yet there's another kind of person who feels that complaining about a warm winter is unnatural for a Canadian. They are: TYPE 2 - PARADISE FOUND: These snow-weary Canadians have had enough of the white stuff, especially after last winter's Snowmageddon. They feel guilty, but happy.
They say things like: "I know the warm winter is bad for the planet, but it feels good to me. ... No, I'm sorry. I apologize - I shouldn't have said that. I know its wrong, very wrong. Only it feels so wonderful!" Many of them did miss having a White Christmas - but only yesterday. Today they see many benefits of a warm winter.
With no snow falling, the City's saved a bundle on snowclearing while the rest of us save on home heating. People are mostly in a good mood - no one's complaining about icy sidewalks and poor snow removal.
Our roads are so snow and ice-free we may not even get our usual crop of spring potholes to complain about.
There's not even any reason to book a winter holiday in Florida, since the last week's weather brought Miami to Montreal - where Canadian money is still accepted at par.
Type 2 knows there's something about this winter that's creepy - but they'd rather worry about it later.
In fact this winter, the weatherman is in their camp. According to meteorologists our warm winter isn't much due to global warming.
It's mainly caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation - a warming phenomenon in the Eastern Pacific that hits every five years. Only this year they're calling it "the Godzilla of El Ninos."
Snow and ice may have gone missing here, but they've showed up in Texas, Mississippi and California - while Calgary and Vancouver ski slopes are buried in snow.
We've traded places with Vancouver this year - but it's only fair for them to occasionally share the pain.
Whatever type you are, seize the moment while it lasts. On Dec 17, 2011, I began a Gazette column this way: "This December feels more like October. The streets are filled with people in fall clothing, sneakers and shorts. I've been barbecuing outdoors and biking on Mount Royal - along with hordes of winter joggers usually hiding at the gym."
One day later, winter arrived in a huge snowstorm and the mercury soon plunged to minus 29. So soak up the warmth before a sudden reverse oscillation polar de-vortex brings our winter boots out of hibernation and sends our squirrels into it.
Remember: the shortest day of the year is over and spring is only a heartbeat and several blizzards away.
Frankly, I'm dreaming of a Green New Year's so we can all party outside. But after that: Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! Joshfreed49@gmail.com

Full text: For Dahna Goldstein, fulfilling a dream to play hockey was the first step to staying healthy and gaining perspective
here
More than a decade after moving south of the Canadian border, Dahna Goldstein finally fulfilled a long-repressed desire to play hockey.
"My mother will shoot me if this ends up in the article," says Ms. Goldstein, 41, with a laugh, during a telephone interview from her home in Silver Spring, Md., near Washington, D.C. "Growing up in Montreal, I was a huge Canadiens fan. I remember standing in the kitchen as a teenager looking at a flyer that came in the mail. It was hockey season for girls, but even though my mother was a staunch feminist who would say, 'Anything boys can do, girls can do better,' I was informed it was not a feminine enough sport for me.
"Later in 2006, here in D.C., I stumbled on this women's ice hockey league that was open to beginners, bought a bag of gear from a guy on Craigslist, and started playing."
Now the captain of the women's team in the novice division, Ms. Goldstein plays at least once a week, year-round. As the founder and chief executive officer of PhilanTech, a grant management software company acquired last year by Altum, where she is the director of philanthropy solutions, her love of the sport has proved fortuitous for a number of reasons.
For starters, it was an excellent way to stay in shape while running a business that absorbed all her time and energy. Ms. Goldstein launched PhilanTech in 2004 to address a huge problem in the non-profit sector - the high transaction costs of applying for, receiving and administering grants.
Of the $47-billion (U.S.) in grants awarded annually in the United States, about 13 per cent is spent on administering the grant. Rather than rely on spreadsheets to manage the grant-writing process, Ms. Goldstein's system streamlines the process online from start to finish, and ensures continuity and easy searchability between years of previously written grant applications. It helps both non-profits and grant makers operate more efficiently and reduce costs, rerouting funds into programs and services instead of bureaucracy.
Every year, Ms. Goldstein has run an annual "ugliest tracking spreadsheet" contest - the winner gets the software free. "There's some incredibly ugly, complex and inefficient spreadsheets out there. We've gotten entries from around the world - last year's winner was an organization working in Africa.
"Our software provides tracking tools, reminders and ways to get everyone involved in the grant process."
It took Ms. Goldstein three sleepless years to come up with a workable product, which then coincided with the economy tanking in late 2007.
"In those times, when you're totally wrapped up in your business, exercise falls by the wayside. It can be hard to get perspective or stay healthy," she says.
Hockey became her outlet. "Hockey is fun, social and physically intense. There are other people skating at you - so if I think about anything that's not about playing hockey, I will get hit. Many times I've walked into the rink obsessing about something, like the right way to frame a difficult conversation - and then, after not thinking about it while skating, the solution will just pop into my head afterward."
To get into better physical condition to support her habit, Ms. Goldstein also took up running. She stays interested in pounding the pavement through the use of a smartphone app called RunKeeper that helps her draw pictures with her chosen routes, much like an Etch A Sketch. So far, Ms. Goldstein has created a dog, car, sailboat and the numbers 2015 for a run she did on New Year's Day. She posts the sketches on Facebook to share with friends.
Her love of hockey has also made possible another pastime - music. It was while playing hockey that she met her future band mates, who went on to form an indie folk rock group called Fire in the River, for which Ms. Goldstein is the lead singer and guitarist.
"We play fairly regularly around the D.C. area at bars and festivals - sometimes we get paid, sometimes it's just for fun. I think it's really important to do things outside of work - there's a value from both a physical and mental health perspective, when you change your framework," says Ms. Goldstein, who is also juggling a family and raising her two-month-old son with her wife, a human rights lawyer.
Ms. Goldstein moved from Montreal at 19 to pursue her postsecondary education in the United States, including degrees from Williams College, Harvard University and New York University's Stern School of Business. She credits the emphasis her family placed on her education for her success thus far.
Her father, Yoine, a top bankruptcy lawyer and former Canadian senator, was a first generation Canadian whose family immigrated from Ukraine and struggled to make ends meet. "He was driven to provide for his family a different upbringing than he had - he wanted my brother and I to have everything, because he had nothing," she says.
"The only limitation my parents placed on me and my brother was to do the best we could. They really emphasized going to the best schools we could, pursuing advanced degrees, and making the most of ourselves while giving back to the community.
"My father has always been very involved in the Montreal Jewish community and got us involved in fundraising from a young age. It was a combination of that desire to give something back and to create something new that planted the seeds for my entrepreneurial ambitions.
"Grant management software seems like an unsexy, back-office topic - but what we're doing is directly helping organizations feed kids, save rain forests, curb domestic abuse, among many other causes. ... We're helping them gain access to more resources, in order to do more of the good work they're already doing in their communities."

Full text:   On March 25 the City of Montreal issued a press release heralding an agreement with Hydro-Quebec to maintain the biodiversity of plants and animals on servitudes owned by the utility on green spaces on the island.
The agreement, signed on March 24, specifically mentions parks in the Anjou and Ahuntsic-Cartierville boroughs.
On March 25, resident Denis Lemieux, who lives next to the entrance of the Bois-de-Liesse nature park in Pierrefonds-Roxboro, got a hand delivered note explaining that trees in the adjacent park would be cut down the following day.
On March 26 and 27, crews contracted by Hydro went to the Bois-de-Liesse park and cut down approximately 70 mature trees. The 159-hectare park stretches from Dollard-des-Ormeaux in the west, through parts of Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Ahuntsic-Cartierville Lemieux was at the park at 9 a.m. last Thursday to meet with the Hydro crews.
Lemieux said when he asked the Hydro spokesperson about the rush job, he was told that the tree cutting had been worked out with the borough "10 to 12 days earlier."
The agreement signed late last month mentions maintaining the forest canopy, the importance of preserving biodiversity. Nowhere does it mention trimming trees close to hydro lines rather than just chopping them down.
Sylvia Oljemark, a spokesperson for the Green Coalition, said the city has "dropped the ball and sold us out."
"Back in June, Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre promised no more mature trees would be cut," Oljemark said.
"The entente is a mistake because it doesn't mention trimming. All cutting should stop unless the tree is dead. Trimming should be the way to go," she added.
This, according to Lemieux, is not Hydro's modus operandi.
Lemieux had been told by a Hydro spokesperson that all trees marked with blue paint would be cut. He asked why the branches could not be trimmed and the tree saved.
"Hydro does not trim trees. We clean," was the response he was given, he says.
Hydro-Quebec spokesperson Jean-Philippe Rousseau said that the high-tension lines supported by pylons running through the Bois-de-Liesse park carry 315,000 volts. Trees are cut and trimmed to ensure public safety and prevent power outages.
Electricity can arc from a line to a tree causing injury to bystanders and even fire, he said.
"We categorize trees in three groups: immediate risk, shortterm risk and medium-term risk," Rousseau said.
"The trees in Bois-de-Liesse park are short-term risk and could not wait for another year's growth. These trees were moving into the safety clearing zone."
"We've been working on this for two-and-a-half years, meeting with local politicians," Lemieux said.
"I am very upset at the way the city let us down on this project, after all the work we have done," he said. "They don't care. They are the government. They are there to protect the woods, and they let Hydro-Quebec do what they want."
"Hydro does not do this job for fun, we know this is a sensitive issue," Rousseau said.
"We do prune trees, but under high voltage wires, pruning does not allow us to control the risk." asutherland@montrealgazette.com

Season sees Price waiting in wings of Habs history; Ken Dryden's record of 10 shutouts in 1976-77 is in danger of being surpassed

Full text:   Ken Dryden saw only 24 Washington Capitals shots on April 2, 1977, the Canadiens raining 42 on a shell-shocked Bernie Wolfe at the other end of the rink.
When the smoke had cleared that night, a forest fire having blazed in the Forum, the Habs were 11-0 winners, Wolfe was nursing a scorched neck from a goal light that was turned on seven times in the third period, and Dryden was the author of his 10th shutout of the season.
A nasty way to treat the homecoming Wolfe. The former Sir George Williams University goaltending star would go 0-for-18 lifetime against the Canadiens on some truly awful Capitals teams, beginning with a 9-3 loss on Dec. 6, 1975.
"Maybe management isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer," Wolfe told me with a laugh during a 2004 talk. "Since I was from Montreal, they figured they'd start me against Montreal every game."
If he listens carefully, nearly four decades after his cakewalk over the Caps, Dryden will hear a gentle knocking on his door this morning. And those would be the knuckles of Carey Price.
It's been since 1976-77 that a Canadiens goalie has recorded 10 shutouts in a season. With nine games remaining on the Habs schedule, Price's 2-0 whitewash on Saturday of San Jose gives him a lifetime-best nine.
And his 40 victories, also a career high, have him two behind a share of his team's record in that category: Jacques Plante won 42 in 1955-56 and 1961-62, Dryden won the same number in 1975-76.
With his shutout of the Sharks, Price equalled the 34 lifetime unblemished games of Canadiens Hall of Famer Bill Durnan for fourth place on the team's all-time list. Next up: Dryden's 46, Plante's 58, and the distant 75 of early-era George Hainsworth.
You've been hearing for some time that this season is a career year for Price. It is no longer "just" that, of course. This one is sprinkled with stardust, one for the ages, something magical that's been fascinating to watch.
The 27-year-old from Anahim Lake, B.C., and but most nights apparently from a planet not orbiting in this solar system, leads the NHL in wins (40), save percentage (. 938), goals-against average (1.86) and shutouts (nine, tied with Pittsburgh's Marc-Andre Fleury).
Sadly (typing this in the sarcasm font), Price's offensive game needs some work. He's in 22nd place in goaltender assists with only one, two offthe pace of a leading group of five.
Last Thursday, unbuckling his pads following a 4-0 defeat of the Carolina Hurricanes, Price quietly let slip that his father, Jerry, had been in attendance, the third shutout his dad had seen live this season.
"He's retired. Where else does he have to be?" Price joked when it was suggested that he keep Jerry around for a bit.
Indeed, Price pere was at the Bell Centre on Saturday for his son's second consecutive shutout, this one a 29-save effort featuring the usual assortment of sleight-of-hand stops.
It was not immediately clear whether Jerry would be in Nashville on Tuesday, when Price faces the Predators' Pekka Rinne in what has the potential to be a titanic goaltending duel.
"(Jerry) is going to move in for the playoffs," Price's wife, Angela, suggested in the wake of her husband's ninth shutout, and she might even have been kidding.
Here's Price in goals-against and save percentage on a grander scale, accurate comparisons through the decades admittedly impossible given how everything has changed in hockey except for the net opening's 24 square feet: If the season ended today, Price's goals-against would tie for the Canadiens' best in the socalled modern era. Hainsworth, in the 1920s, had seasons of 0.92, 1.05 and 1.47, and Georges Vezina was 1.47 in 1926-27; Jacques Plante is next best, with 1.86 in 1955-56.
Price's save percentage would be the team's best since the statistic has been kept, .007 better than Jose Theodore's .931 in 2001-02 - the year that Theo was voted winner of both the Hart and Vezina trophies as the NHL's most valuable player and best goaltender. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
A decade ago, researching a half-century of NHL save percentages from 1954-55 to 2003-04, Goalies' World magazine charted Plante's .942 in 70 games with the 1970-71 Toronto Maple Leafs atop the list, followed by his .940 in 37 games with 1968-69 St. Louis.
The Blues' Brian Elliott had a .940 in his 38 games in 2011-12, Boston's Tim Thomas a .938 over 57 games the previous season. Now at .938, Price is in rarefied air.
In 1976-77, playing behind the Big Three of Larry Robinson, Serge Savard and Guy Lapointe on defence, Dryden earned 10 shutouts with a 2.14 average and .920 save percentage.
The Canadiens would steam into the playoffs that season to win the Stanley Cup, their second of four straight, in 14 games, only two over the minimum, sweeping St. Louis, beating the Islanders in six, then sweeping Boston in the final.
Dryden would earn four postseason shutouts - one against the Blues to open, two vs. the Islanders and his final vs. the Bruins in a Stanley Cup
final sweep. His 10 shutouts that year are in a three-way tie for fourth place on the Canadiens' all-time list; he joined Durnan, who turned the trick in 1948-49, and Gerry McNeil, who had 10 in 1956-57.
Hainsworth had 1920s shutout seasons of 22 (the NHL record), 14 and 13, the trio at 10 immediately behind him.
Forget about his steely-eyed focus, positional play, lateral movement and puck-tracking, Price's best skill remains his deflections.
"I wouldn't be here without these guys," he told reporters after Saturday's game, crediting his shot-blocking, creaseclearing, furiously backchecking teammates.
"Those are just the cold, hard facts. There's no other way to sugar-coat it. That's just the way it is."
After a day offSunday, the Canadiens will practise Monday morning in Brossard, then charter to Nashville, where on Tuesday the Habs will face the superb Predators.
Better than that, the game will pit Price against Rinne, who on Saturday blanked Buffalo and heading into Sunday's games was ranked second in wins, third in goals-against and fifth in save percentage.
Nine games to the finish will be about more than the Montreal Canadiens' jockeying for their playoffseed.
They will be, as this entire season has been in Montreal, about the magnificent play of a goaltender who in 2014-15 has proved he belongs with the Canadiens' forever legends, icons Price is bringing back into focus night after puck-stopping night.

Full text:   PREVOST There's a vintage blackand-white photo on the wall of Laurentian Lodge that captures a trainful of merry young people on the old Train du Nord, heading up north on a Friday afternoon for a weekend of skiing. They would have loaded their skis and boarded the "snow train" at Mile End station in Montreal, gotten offat Shawbridge and then skied the rest of the way to the lodge or hopped a ride in a sleigh.
That was back in the 1940s or '50s and Laurentian Lodge Club, or Shawbridge Club as it used to be known, was still an exclusive residential cross-country ski club that drew its members from among Montreal's anglophone elite.
Wilder Penfield, the celebrated neurosurgeon who founded the Montreal Neurological Institute, was a member, and so was Brooke Claxton, the first-ever federal minister of health and welfare. (Club legend has it that Penfield was sitting by the fire at Laurentian Lodge when the news came over the radio that Queen Elizabeth II had bestowed on him the Order of Merit, the highest civilian decoration in the British Empire.)
Norwegian-born Herman "Jackrabbit" Smith-Johannsen, who introduced the sport of crosscountry skiing to North America, was another early member of the club after it was founded in 1927. He described it as a place "where one could ski from one village to the next, crossing through farm fields, climbing over fences, winding through maple groves, bushwhacking through the forest beside a quiet lake," according to the book Skiing Legends and the Laurentian Lodge Club (Price-Patterson), by Neil and Catharine McKenty.
The sprawling white clapboard house set back along a quiet road in what is now Prevost, in the foothills of the Laurentians, isn't nearly the exclusive club it used to be. Formal dress is no longer required at dinner (though jeans are still verboten and the men wear jackets, if not ties). And, except at fancy functions, members serve themselves instead of being waited on by staff in waistcoats and bow ties.
Membership has declined from more than 100 in the club's heyday to a current 70 or so members, most of whom are in their 50s to 70s. But the club is still going - the last remaining residential ski club in North America, a relic from a bygone era looking for reinvigoration.
Even in a brutally cold winter such as this one, hardy skiers gather at the lodge on Saturday and Sunday mornings for a hot cup of coffee. They wax their skis and get the lowdown on weather conditions, check the trail maps and then head out in small groups, depending on their age and level of expertise, to explore the many cross-country ski trails all around the area.
Some wait for a boxed lunch prepared by the resident chef, Andre Pelrine, who has cooked in the lodge's kitchen for 57 years. Others will return to the lodge for a hot lunch after just an hour or so of light exercise.
"Laurentian Lodge is sort of like winter camp for adults. We might set out across the road where there's a bridge to a trail down the hill. It's magnificent down there, with a nice run that is thrilling when conditions are good," said Ellen Moore, a retired schoolteacher who has been a member with her husband Jim since 1984.
"There are countless trails all over and few users, so they remain in excellent condition. And we are always in search of new ones."
A couple of members who live in the Laurentians come out on their snowmobiles after a storm to groom the trails, some of which were first mapped in the club's early days. Other trails bend and weave through birch woods and behind new housing developments, or follow the tracks of the Petit Train du Nord, which is now a ski trail in winter and a cycling path in summer.
After a day outdoors, they return for cocktails by the big fieldstone fireplace in the lounge followed by dinner in the dining room. Some will stay overnight in one of the 17 rooms upstairs.
"The lodge has always been a social place. People come to ski, but also to be together, to have fun," said Paula Pedicelli, who is here most winter weekends, as she has been for 22 years.
"Winter can be miserable in the city. But up here feels like a haven."
Since its beginning, only those who were sponsored by other members could join. But now the club has launched a campaign to broaden its base. It has cut membership dues in half this year (to $515 for a family membership, for example, and $320 for a senior single membership) hoping to attract new members, among them young families who will carry on the tradition.
The lodge, which sits on a former nine-hole golf course, is surrounded by glorious snow-covered fields dotted with evergreen trees, the arboreal forest in the distance. But when the golf course closed several years ago, the ski club lost the revenue it had earned by renting out the house in summer as a clubhouse for the golfers. Now it is hoping to find a new summertime tenant, either an art school, children's camp or hiking club, to help pay the bills.
Laurentian Lodge is as much a social club as a ski club. A couple of Saturdays ago, its members hosted a Spanish dinner and tango night featuring a cellist, a pianist, a soloist and two tango dancers. Every season there are five or six such events.
The house is a throwback to another time, a rare old building that retains many of its original features, including pressed-tin ceilings in some of the rooms and beadboard panelling throughout. It was built in 1893 as a farmhouse with a large kitchen and a sprawling veranda. Twenty years later, two wings were added, including one to house a sunny dining room with windows overlooking the lawns on all three sides.
Mont-Tremblant and St-Sauveur are where all the ski action is now. But it's here in the lower Laurentians, in old-fashioned ski clubs like Laurentian Lodge, that skiing got a jump-start in Quebec after its introduction in Montreal in the late 1800s.

New budget arrives amid loud protests; Much of the savings will come out of employee pension plan payments

Full text:   The average Montreal homeowner will see their property taxes rise by $77 in 2015, and overall expenditures by the city will drop - for the first time since the megacity was created in 2002 - under the first budget created by the relatively new administration of Mayor Denis Coderre.
Residential taxes will increase on average by 2.2 per cent a year, with boroughs like Plateau-Mont-Royal (4.5 per cent), the Sud-Ouest (4 per cent), LaSalle and St-Laurent (2.9 per cent), Outremont (2.8 per cent) and Cote-des-Neiges- Notre-Dame-de-Grace (2.7 per cent) seeing the biggest hikes. The Conference Board of Canada has estimated the national inflation rate at 2.0 per cent.
A $418,000 home saddled with a 2.2 per cent property tax hike will see taxes raise by $77. Last year's average tax increase was 2.8 per cent.
Taxes on non-residential properties will rise by an average of 2.1 per cent.
Wednesday's budget presentation was punctuated by the horns and whistles and jostling of hundreds of angry municipal workers protesting against looming changes to their pension plans who started converging at 7 a.m. At one point, they prevented city councillors, escorted by a phalanx of roughly 20 police officers, from entering city hall for five minutes.
Coderre presented a relatively austere operating budget of $4.88 billion, $12.8 million less than last year's offering, representing a cut of 0.3 per cent. For the eight years before 2013, Montreal budgets rose an average of 3.7 per cent annually.
A large part of the city's savings will come through an estimated $103 million in reductions in payments into municipal pension plans, in part because of improved market performances (accounting for savings of $53 million), and because of changes under the Quebec government's proposed Bill 3 legislation that are expected to save Montreal $49 million a year. Proposed by the Liberal government and supported by provincial opposition parties, Bill 3 is expected to pass into law before the end of the year.
Expenditures on services like snow clearing, garbage collection, roadwork and water management will increase only slightly from last year.
"We were able to control expenses without cutting into the services to citizens," Coderre said. "Thanks to efficient financial planning, we were able to reduce our expenses while maintaining our main priorities, in particular public transit and the renovation of our infrastructure."
The Societe de transport de Montreal will receive an increase of $25 million a year from the city, to a total of $409 million. Opposition party Projet Montreal, however, accused the city of "creative accounting" saying the city was combining two payments to the STM made each year into one at budget time to inflate its worth.
The STM will announce Thursday it is raising fare prices in the new year. Monthly passes will rise from $79.50 to $82. A single fare is going up to $3.25 from $3.
The budget won approval from an unexpected camp in Richard Bergeron, the former leader of Projet Montreal who stepped down this month after 10 years at its helm so he could take a spot on the city's executive committee.
"If I had won the last election, it's exactly what I would have done," Bergeron said during a debate on the budget in city council. It is imperative for a city to cut expenses so it can invest in developing the city, he said. "Montreal is seeing a development boom that is has not seen since the 1980s, 30 years ago."
His former party was less effusive. Although it conceded the administration had done a good job of restraining expenditures, Projet Montreal said most of the savings came through a provincial construct - Bill 3 - and the cutting of staff, which could come back to bite the city through a lack of proper inspections on construction projects, and lesser services.
"Since the arrival of M. Coderre, Montreal has lost 35,800 permanent jobs," interim leader Luc Ferrandez said. "We lost 22,000 people again to the suburbs. We have a problem of traffic congestion linked to its several construction sites, but without alternative solutions in public transit.
"Montreal is doing very badly, and in this budget, M. Coderre has not brought solutions to any of these problems." More innovative solutions, like using less expensive employees than police officers to issue traffic tickets, and cracking down on employee absenteeism should be initiated, Ferrandez said.
Cost savings came through reducing the city's workforce, numbering 22,423 employees in 2013, by the equivalent of 410 full-time employees in 2015, mostly through attrition, saving $33 million. The city plans to cut 2,200 jobs over five years. Cuts in pension plan payments represented another major chunk.
To help pay for infrastructure repairs, the city is increasing its borrowing. And 16.6 per cent of the city's overall expenses ($810 million) go to covering servicing its debt payments, the highest rate allowed under Quebec law, and one that threatens the city's long-term financial stability, Projet Montreal warned.

Mayoral mischief: Canada's growing cities face a problem of oversight

Full text: From cronyism to gangsterism, mayors across the country are racking up infractions
Fraud, nepotism, conflict of interest, questionable expense claims. In almost any workplace, these alleged transgressions would have led to one of two bleak prospects: resign or get fired. But in city council chambers across the country, some of those cloaked in scandal keep marching onward.
Last month, Ontario Ombudsman André Marin released a scathing report highlighting the lack of accountability in the local governments of cities and towns across the province.
"To me, some municipalities are like gangrenous limbs," Mr. Marin said in an interview. He's dealt with all manner of scandals in Ontario, but says municipal mayors and councillors "make provincial politicians look like choirboys."
The issues range widely, from cronyism all the way to gangsterism, but the problems plaguing mayors across Canada raise consistent questions: Are municipal structures too broken to hold elected officials to account? Has oversight not grown at the same rate as some municipalities?
There is no doubting the seriousness of many of the alleged offences. In Laval, Que., former mayor Gilles Vaillancourt faces many criminal charges including gangsterism, while corruption-plagued Montreal has had four mayors in just over a year. In Ontario, London Mayor Joe Fontana will be on trial this year on charges of fraud.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has openly admitted to using crack cocaine while in one of his "drunken stupors," though he has not been charged with any crime. Some of the issues are financial or political. Brampton Mayor Susan Fennell's expenses are being audited following unproven allegations of budget misuse, while Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz has weathered accusations of cronyism.
Although polls show Canadians have greater trust in municipal politicians than in provincial or federal ones, lack of accountability seems to be most rampant at the local level, says Brian Kelcey, a Toronto-based political analyst who previously worked as Mr. Katz's special adviser in Winnipeg and is now managing Toronto mayoral hopeful David Soknacki's campaign. The problem, say both watchdogs and analysts, goes beyond individual officials. Some cities, such as Laval and Brampton, have expanded so quickly that mechanisms of oversight have not kept pace.
"You end up with big-city cost and big-city government without the big-city controls that would normally be put in place because there hasn't been the time or political energy to push for those to be in place," Mr. Kelcey said.
Quebec's Mascouche, Terrebonne and especially Laval became cities by turning farmland and forest into bustling bedroom communities in a matter of a few decades. The growth brought millions in real estate deals and public works projects into towns with little of the governance expertise and oversight required to keep things honest.
"Even in bigger cities, a corrupt administration will go to war with auditors," said Danielle Pilette, an urban affairs professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal. "We saw it in Montreal, where the auditor had his tip line taken away. Laval had an auditor who lasted a week."
Brampton's mayor has provoked outrage in recent months after it was revealed she had spent $186,154.60 of public funds since December, 2010, claiming flight upgrades and private language lessons. The spending was only unearthed when the weekly Brampton Guardian filed a freedom of information request to see the claims, as they are not published anywhere. New reports last week revealed she and her staff spent $185,000 on airfare and hotels in the last five years.
Until 2011, the city's finance department reviewed the mayor and city councillors' discretionary spending, but last February council passed a new expense policy that removed that process. In November, Ms. Fennell quickly shifted attention to her fellow councillors' spending, which included buying home security systems and symphony tickets on the taxpayers' dime. "Perhaps they're hoping that if the public looks at my expenses, which I stand by... maybe they're hoping nobody looks at theirs," she said in an interview.
Through a staffer, Ontario Municipal Affairs Minister Linda Jeffrey declined to be interviewed.
In Winnipeg, the issue of oversight has reared its head over the actions of Phil Sheegl, the city's former chief administrative officer. In his two years as CAO, Mr. Sheegl became embroiled in multiple scandals on projects he oversaw, including the new police headquarters that came with major cost overruns and a fire-paramedic station construction program in which an auditor found contracts were unfairly awarded.
Mr. Sheegl is a close friend of the city's mayor, Mr. Katz, and his qualifications - a career spent mostly in real estate - prompted observers to accuse the mayor of cronyism. Mr. Sheegl resigned last fall. The mayor, who sits on the committee that appointed Mr. Sheegl, has said their personal relationship had nothing to do with the hiring. Mr. Katz's office did not respond to interview requests.
Toronto's Mr. Ford has made international headlines with his crack admission, but has remained on the job. Toronto council - lacking the ability to remove him from office - has made do with passing multiple motions that have stripped the mayor of many of his powers.
The recent spate of cases of misbehaving mayors has prompted calls for laws allowing impeachment or voter recall. Mississauga's Mayor Hazel McCallion - who was cleared of conflict-of-interest charges in June - is not a believer. "Is it democratic?" she asked in an interview. "If the public is unhappy with a politician, you could have citizens' groups always asking - you'd be busy dealing with recalls."
Political scientists have speculated that another reason city halls are rife with scandal is the lack of a party system. In Toronto, despite the alienation of many members of his executive, Mr. Ford has not had to face the internal wrath of a party.
Many look to Vancouver, one of the few cities with a party system, as a model. Ahead of 2008's municipal election, incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan, whose popularity was slipping, lost the support of his party, the Non-Partisan Association, to another candidate. Without the backing of the NPA, he decided against running in the election.
"I believe in the party system," he said. "I believe that it really does provide real value and if I couldn't win the party nomination, I accepted the decision of the party."
Still, Mr. Kelcey warns, party systems aren't perfect. They can breed strong controls over messaging and marginalize minority party councillors. "Everything that's gone wrong in Montreal and the Montreal area," he noted, "has gone wrong with a party system in place."

Full text: Taller wood buildings a fire hazard, says Cement Association of Canada
Canada's cement industry is ramping up its fight against a proposal to allow taller wood buildings, one that's pitting it against the forestry sector.
The Cement Association of Canada will be holding a press conference in Ottawa Thursday, as it seeks to stop a potential change in the National Building Code of Canada that would increase the maximum height of wood buildings to six storeys from four.
Such a change would be hazardous because it would increase fire risks, Michael McSweeney, CEO of the Cement Association of Canada, argues.
"We already have a commanding market share of over 85 per cent in buildings taller than four storeys, so it's not a market share issue for us, it's a safety issue," he said in an interview.
He said that wood buildings of this height are generally 10 to 15 per cent cheaper to build, and that taller wood buildings present new challenges for firefighters.
"Typically the people who will live in these wood buildings are the less well off, new Canadians, families that have latchkey kids for example," he said.
The National Building Code of Canada is a "model" guideline that provinces and municipalities can adopt in part or in whole. (Six storey wood buildings are already allowed in British Columbia, and Quebec City has announced that a 10-storey wood building can go ahead, Mr. McSweeney said.) The Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes, which was established by the National Research Council of Canada, has been conducting a public review of potential changes to the 2010 code. The changes would take effect in 2015.
Beyond the height of wood buildings, Mr. McSweeney wants to see the updated code make it mandatory for stairwells and elevator shafts to be built with non-combustible material, to give firefighters more of a platform to work on in the case of a fire.
"If you just go back in history and look at the fire of London in 1693, the fires in Montreal in 1721 - the King of France at the time decreed no more wood buildings in Montreal because they kept burning down," Mr. McSweeney said. "We've moved away from building with wood as a progressive step and now it looks like we're taking a regressive step."
The Forest Products Association of Canada has been pushing to have the code changed to enable the taller wood buildings, making the case that new buildings made from engineered wood products are very durable and exceed fire safety standards.

Full text: Amid backlash from a weekend derailment in Alberta, the company points to an improved third-quarter safety record
? Canadian National Railway Co.'s earnings are riding high as the company books healthy gains in freight volumes, led by a 17-per-cent jump in shipments of petroleum and chemicals.
The railway's third-quarter profit of $705-million topped expectations, and it announced a stock split. But its chief executive officer tried to play down a weekend derailment in Alberta that led to two explosions and asserted that customers can rely on CN to transport energy products safely.
Claude Mongeau said CN intends to increase its presence in the energy market by increasing shipments of crude oil by rail.
"We have to keep getting better, and if we do, I believe we are a viable alternative to move all the energy products, including crude," he said during a conference call Tuesday with industry analysts. "We move more heavy crude than we move light crude, and we believe this is there to stay with us, as long as we continue to operate a safe railroad, which we are committed to do."
Mr. Mongeau said CN's third-quarter performance showed improvement in a key safety indicator - its accident rate per million train miles was 1.31 in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 2.30 in the same period last year.
"During the quarter, we had a very solid safety record. Obviously, we do have accidents from time to time. We had a very serious one this weekend, with fire involving propane cars in Alberta."
Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway's deadly runaway train derailment in Lac-Mégantic, Que., in July, which killed 47 people, as well as the recent Alberta accident have fuelled public debate about the safety of moving energy products by rail.
"Delivering safety and responsibility is a foundation for CN, and we are continuing to focus our record in this regard," Mr. Mongeau said.
"We have an unwavering commitment to operating a safe railroad. It's true of all the dangerous commodities that we move. To be able to have so few accidents in any given year with so much volume is quite remarkable."
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada reported there were 131 main-track accidents across Canada's railway industry in 2012.
Mr. Mongeau said it is important to keep CN's operations in perspective. "We have a handful of accidents every month - two to three would be our average," he said. "It's difficult to get better than that, but we are committed to continue to improve, to make sure that we have as few incidents as we can. And when we do have incidents, we are reacting to them with a comprehensive response, owning up to it, like we did this weekend."
Mr. Mongeau made the comments after CN announced a two-for-one stock split while posting a 6-per-cent increase in its third-quarter profit.
Montreal-based CN had a third-quarter profit of $705-million, compared with $664-million in the same period last year. Share profit climbed to $1.67 from $1.52, while revenue increased to $2.69-billion from $2.49-billion.
Canada's largest railway said it improved its third-quarter operating ratio, a key indicator of productivity that measures costs as a percentage of revenue. `
A lower number is better, and CN registered an operating ratio of 59.8 per cent in the three months ended Sept. 30, down from 60.6 per cent in the third quarter in 2012.
CN garnered $485-million in third-quarter revenue from petroleum and chemicals, up 17 per cent from a year earlier. The railway also enjoyed revenue gains in other categories such as metals and minerals, forest products, automotive and intermodal.
Calgary-based Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. will report its third-quarter results on Wednesday.

BlackBerry dips
BlackBerry Ltd. shares dipped today amid reports that the new Z10 model is already being discounted in the United States.
Best Buy Co. and AT&T Inc. cut the price for BlackBerry's new touchscreen device to $49 (U.S.) with a two-year contract, while Verizon Communications Inc.'s wireless arm is selling the smartphone for $99, also with a two-year agreement. But in the absence of a contract, the Z10 costs $700.
Discounting isn't unusual, but the Z10 has only been on sale since March. However, as Bloomberg News notes today, BlackBerry's even more recent keyboard-equipped Q10 would appeal to the Canadian company's traditional users.
When it last reported quarterly results, the first to include full sales of the new BB10 devices, shipments for the Z10 were far below what analysts had been expecting.

Scotiabank ends deal
Bank of Nova Scotia is pulling out of a deal to buy a chunk of Bank of Guangzhou, saying conditions have changed.
Scotiabank had planned to acquire 19.99 per cent of the bank, originally announcing details last September, The Globe and Mail's Tim Kiladze reports.
Today, however, the Canadian bank said it and the municipality involved have "re-evalued the proposed partnership in light of changing conditions."
It did not spell out those conditions, however, and said it still plans to push ahead in the country.
"Scotiabank will continue to consider future opportunities for investment in China that are in line with our strategy and footprint in the region," said Dieter Jentsch, Scotiabank's chief of international banking.
"The bank also remains focused on our existing operations in the country including the recently announced Bank of Beijing Scotia Asset Management Joint Venture and 19-per-cent stake in Bank of Xi'an."

JPMorgan beats estimates
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. kicked off second-quarter earnings among the big U.S. banks with better-than-expected results.
JPMorgan profit climbed 31 per cent to $6.5-billion (U.S.) or $1.60 a share in the quarter, from $4.96-billion or $1.21 a year earlier. That included a gain on reduced loan loss reserves.
Revenue increased by 13 per cent.
"Loan growth across the industry continued to be soft, reflecting a cautious stance by consumers, many small businesses and corporations," said chief executive officer Jamie Dimon.
"However, we continue to see broad-based signs that the U.S. economy is improving and we are hopeful that, as jobs are added and confidence builds, the U.S. economy will strengthen over time."
Wells Fargo also topped estimates with a profit of $5.52-billion or 98 cents a shares, compared to $4.62-billion or 82 cents a year earlier.

Markets hold gains
Global markets are generally holding onto their strong gains, though at something of a slower pace after yesterday's record-smashing performance in the United States.
Or, as Royal Bank of Canada put it today, a "wild week ends with a whimper."
That's not to suggest there's no action, only that it's muted compared to the jubilation that drove the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average to closing highs yesterday in a rally inspired by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.
Playing into the markets are stronger-than-expected quarterly results from two major U.S. banks and comments from China's finance minister that appeared to suggest Beijing would accept an annual pace of economic growth of 7 per cent.
"In some respects the lack of momentum to the upside tends to give credence to the theory that much of the advancement yesterday was less about sentiment and more about short covering," said senior market strategist Brenda Kelly of IG in London.
"An element of profit-taking, along with the remarks from China's finance ministry which are attempting to temper expectations in respect of the country's global growth, is putting some pressure on the mining sector."
Asian and European markets were mixed, while U.S. stocks were up and the Toronto exchange was down.
Yesterday's global rally was sparked by Mr. Bernanke's comments late Wednesday, when he reassured markets that the central bank would not pull back from its huge asset-buying program, known as quantitative easing or QE, before the economy is ready.
For all intents and purposes, that set the record straight after he'd send markets tumbling in June with the suggestion that the Fed could start to ease the monthly purchases worth $85-billion (U.S.) later this year.
Observers believed the central bank would begin to "taper" the program in the fall, and quit altogether sometime next year.
Mr. Bernanke didn't give a timeline, but calmed investors nonetheless, suggesting, as well, that they not confuse the end of QE with the end of emergency-level interest rates.
The Fed's benchmark rate is now effectively at zero, and the Fed plans to keep it there until unemployment eases to 6.5 per cent.
"It appears bullish equity traders are once again happy to rely on the ‘free insurance' offered by Fed intervention and push risk assets higher - despite the general panic we saw in June when tapering appeared imminent," said Matt Basi of CMC Markets in London.
"The marked decline in U.S. treasury yields and the spike higher in equity markets since chairman Bernanke's statement are signs of a market re-positioning itself for medium-term QE support and with the U.S. gearing up for earnings season, any significant upside surprises could easily push the indices to fresh all-time highs."

Home prices at record
Canadian home prices are at record levels, though they got there at a slower pace, The Globe and Mail's Tara Perkins reports.
Prices climbed 1.8 per cent in June from a year earlier, according to the Teranet-National Bank home price index.
While that increase is the slowest since November, 2009, the index now stands at its highest ever.
Not only that, but prices in Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Winnipeg, Halifax and Hamilton are also at record highs.
On a month-over-month basis, prices rose 1 per cent from May.
"Though this increase may seem large, it is somewhat less than the average June gain of 1.2 per cent over the last 12 years," said senior Marc Pinsonneault of National Bank of Canada.
"May, June and July are generally the months in which upward pressure on home prices is strongest," he added.
"In the 15 years of index data collection, the composite index has not declined in any of these three months."
On a year-over-year basis, prices rose 7 per cent in Hamilton, 5.6 per cent in Quebec City, 5.5 per cent in Calgary, 3.9 per cent in Winnipeg, 3 per cent in Edmonton, 3.6 per cent in Toronto, 2.3 per cent in Halifax, 1.4 per cent in Montreal, and 1.1 per cent in Ottawa-Gatineau.
British Columbia continued to suffer, with prices down 4.6 per cent in Victoria and 2.8 per cent in Vancouver.
Today's report adds to evidence of a soft landing in Canada's housing market, though with regional differences.

Domtar projects loss
Canada's Domtar Corp. expects to post a second-quarter operating loss of $30-million (U.S.) to $35-million (U.S.)
That, the forest products company said today, includes a litigation-related settlement hit of $49-million, restructuring costs of $18-million, a $5-million charge for writedowns, and depreciation of $93-million.
Domtar reports results July 25.
"We had sub optimal pulp productivity and unusually high costs due to significant planned maintenance and delayed restarts in our pulp mills," said chief executive officer John Williams.
"However, a closer look at our operations demonstrates that by quarter end we made very good progress on addressing production issues in the pulp and paper business. We remain confident that we will return to more normalized productivity levels across the business by the end of the third quarter."
Domtar warns of operating loss, shares drop
China's finance minister confuses investors
China's finance minister has left some confusion in the markets with comments on the country's economic growth projections.
At a conference in Washington, Lou Jiwei reminded investors to not "forget that our expected GDP growth rate this year is 7 per cent."
But Beijing's official goal is 7.5 per cent, and "the small difference in the annual average could have significant implications for the remainder of the year," said Adam Cole of RBC Europe.
This comes in advance of official numbers expected Monday, which observers expect to show economic expansion of 7.5 per cent in the second quarter.
That, noted Mr. Cole, would put the average for the first half of the year at 7.7 per cent.
"To hit a 7-per-cent average for the full year, [the second half] would need to be nearer to 6 per cent than 7 per cent - a much more severe slowdown than generally expected," said Mr. Cole.
"It is not clear whether Lou's comments were a slip-up or a deliberate downgrade and no clarification has been offered subsequently."

Full text: Cross-laminated timber could one day safely support 10 floors or more, researchers at FPInnovations say
? At FPInnovations, Canada's forestry research institute, it isn't a tall tale to map out a future where high-rises are made from a new generation of durable wood.
Employees at the forest products centre's Vancouver laboratory are putting cross-laminated timber (CLT) through a battery of tests.
FPInnovations researchers believe that Canada is poised to enter a new construction era featuring engineered wood products. The researchers support the forestry industry's goal in 2020 to build wood structures - from condos to offices - that are 10 storeys high. Eventually, a futuristic 30 storeys could even be possible for hybrid buildings that consist of mostly wood, with minor roles for concrete and steel.
But first, the institute is collecting Canadian data to support existing evidence in Europe that CLT is durable and safe to use in new six-storey wood-designed buildings. Canadian researchers are conducting an array of new studies, including structural tests that involve placing weights on lumber and seismic evaluations to gauge earthquake resistance.
Researchers have built small-scale models using their engineering knowledge to scientifically confirm that large wooden structures, including walls and floors, are safe to withstand snow loads, fierce winds and earthquakes.
"What we're doing now is putting some effort into this renaissance in wood," said Conroy Lum, the FPInnovations research leader for structural performance in advanced building systems. "We can do a much better job to use some of the newer wood technologies for taller structures."
CLT consists of multilayered wood panels, with the surfaces of each layer joined together by industrial-strength glue. The stacks of solid boards are placed perpendicular to each other.
Pioneered in Europe in the 1990s for low-rise buildings, CLT has been gaining industry acceptance in North America for six-storey structures, spurred by advances in adhesive technology and a better understanding of CLT's strength and right-angle design. In Canada, there are now two leading CLT manufacturers - Penticton, B.C.-based Structurlam and Montreal-based Nordic Engineered Wood, which has a plant at Chibougamau, Que.
"In Canada, we were kind of negligent in keeping up with the design codes for timber," Mr. Lum said. "As a result, the use of sawn timber slipped. We basically confined ourselves to using wood in residential construction and low-rises. But wood was used for nine-storey structures a century ago."
Builders of those historic buildings had access to enormous trees 100 years ago, before the ascent of steel and concrete as the main construction materials for high-rises, said Erol Karacabeyli, an FPInnovations research manager. Recognizing the importance of preserving huge old trees for the environment, he emphasized that CLT is produced with lumber from small-diameter trees.
FPInnovations is a collaborative venture that receives funding from industry and the federal and provincial governments. Among the group's partners are Natural Resources Canada while the Forest Products Association of Canada is a strong proponent of tall wood buildings.
Mr. Lum and Mr. Karacabeyli work at FPInnovations' site located on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver, where more than 200 of FPInnovations' 550 employees are based. The other main research sites are in the Montreal suburb of Pointe-Claire and in Quebec City. Fire safety tests on CLT have been conducted in Ottawa at the National Research Council of Canada.
FPInnovations believes that its research will lead to improved manufacturing processes for CLT.
"The goal is to basically implement the research results into building codes so that more wood is used and adequately used," said Marjan Popovski, the institute's principal scientist and quality manager in Vancouver.
British Columbia has allowed wood structures as high as six storeys in residential areas since 2009, but with new Canadian standards expected in 2015 for offices and residences, the tall wood movement is gathering momentum across the country. The National Building Code of Canada is slated to be amended in 2015 to increase the limit for wood structures to six storeys for office and residential buildings, up from the current four storeys.
"Canada has become one of the global leaders in tall wood research, and the work that we're doing at FPInnovations is supporting that leadership," said Peter Lister, vice-president of forest operations and wood products at FPInnovations.
The non-profit group was created in 2007 through the merger of three national organizations that served the forestry sector - the Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada, Forintek Canada Corp. and the Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada. Natural Resources Canada's Wood Fibre Centre was also added to the mix.

Content-curation site Spundge sees move to its platform as replacement
There may be a lot of people disgruntled by Google's announcement that it will kill off Google Reader in July - but the folks at Montreal-based content-curation startup Spundge are likely not among them.
The startup has already jumped on opportunity for those in search of a replacement for Google's service for their RSS feeds, immediately releasing a video on its blog with a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to switch over to its platform to use as a "feed reader, as well as a place to curate, share and create content."
And, as TechVibes reports and the startup, launched in 2011, says on its blog, in a mere 24 hours, more than 10,000 RSS feeds took up its suggestion to be imported into Spundge during what the startup called "the Great Reader Exodus of 2013."
Spundge, which first went after journalists, had already earned some positive press, such as this and this.
There are, of course, other Google Reader alternatives, as, for instance this PC World piece and this Fox News piece suggest. Spundge, naturally, hopes it will be a destination of choice. "Keep 'em coming," it urges on its blog.
Hiring and firing insights from Zappos's Tony Hsieh
Making the wrong hires can be costly for any company. In fact, hiring errors have cost Zappos more than $100-million, estimates Tony Hsieh, the CEO of the online shoe and clothing seller in this video on Inc., in which he also has some advice for startups and entrepreneurs: Avoid the temptation just to get warm bodies on board as fast as possible and drag your feet when it comes to getting rid of those who are not right.
"Instead of trying to hire quickly and fire slowly, really, it should be the reverse," he says in the video. "We should hire slowly and fire quickly when it's not the right decision." In another Inc. video, he also reveals the importance of cultural fit to Zappos's hiring and firing.

Full text: Activist group apologizes for accusing Montreal-based forestry firm of building roads, secretly harvesting in sensitive boreal area
? Resolute Forest Products Inc. has scored a victory over Greenpeace Canada, after the environmental group backed away from its recent allegations that the company contravened a forestry conservation pact.
Resolute said Tuesday that it had conducted its own internal investigation into Greenpeace's accusations in December that the Montreal-based company violated the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA). Resolute said it found Greenpeace vastly mis-characterized logging activities in the boreal, or northern, forests. The environmental group has backtracked and acknowledged that Resolute did not breach any rules.
By listening to Resolute's counterpoints, Greenpeace is demonstrating that it takes opposing views from companies seriously, said Stephanie Goodwin, Greenpeace's senior forest campaigner based in Vancouver. "Resolute challenged our investigation," she said. "Our analysis was based on the use of an incomplete map that lacked a data layer."
Greenpeace withdrew from the CBFA in December as part of its protest over what it believed were Resolute's logging violations. Ms. Goodwin said Greenpeace will continue the boycott because of its long-standing concerns about harvesting trees in sensitive areas.
"Some of the things that Greenpeace said were so outrageous," said Seth Kursman, the pulp and paper maker's vice-president of communications, sustainability and government affairs. "We have stood steadfast in our position that Resolute has been aligned with the word and spirit of the CBFA. We would not allow the deceptive accusations and misinformation to stand."
For instance, Greenpeace investigators said they came across freshly built roads, but Resolute noted those were short sections constructed by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources for the purpose of opening up access for reforestation. Greenpeace also produced a video of what appeared to be a devastated area, but Resolute explained that the images were of wooded property previously burned by fire. Another video that purportedly showed a machine allegedly causing destruction was determined by Resolute to be a scene of reforestation.
Twenty-one forestry firms and nine environmental groups signed the CBFA in May, 2010, with the goal of reaching consensus on permanent areas of protection from logging. "Logging in an endangered forest in the absence of any conservation plan is legal but wrong," Ms. Goodwin said. "There has been no thoughtful analysis on where you can conserve."
Vancouver-based Canopy, a not-for-profit organization that supports environmentally friendly paper, suspended "all formal engagement" with Resolute in December. The group will stick with that suspension because it remains disappointed by the lack of progress in protecting the boreal forest, said Canopy executive director Nicole Rycroft, who noted that the three-year CBFA is set to expire on May 18.
David Lindsay, president of the Forest Products Association of Canada, said there is a process in place for corporations and environmental groups to discuss ways to properly manage the boreal forest, and the three-year time frame could be easily extended to allow for further negotiations. "It's more complicated than anybody thought it would be," Mr. Lindsay said. "A very large and complex agreement requires good relationships with everybody."
While Greenpeace said Resolute has shown that it is onside with the CBFA, the environmental group voiced its disenchantment with ongoing logging in the boreal forest, which includes woodland caribou and old-growth trees. "The best judge of the agreement's success is whether it has achieved the change in the forest it promised the world. It has not. The Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement is no longer a credible tool for forest protection," Greenpeace said.

News of the World to close
News of the World, the widely read British tabloid founded in the 1840s and known for its outrageous headlines, is shutting down amid a scandal over phone hacking. It's the best-selling Sunday paper in Britain.
News International, the division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire that owns the paper, said it will publish its last edition this Sunday. Any revenue from the last issue will be given to charity, though there will be no advertising.
The paper has been "sullied" by bad behaviour, said News International chairman James Murdoch, who added that its actions were "inhuman" if the allegations are true.
Among the allegations are that News of the World hacked into the voice mails of murder victims and their families. In one case, The Globe and Mail's Eric Reguly reports, the tabloid is accused of having intercepted the messages of Milly Dowler, a teenager found dead in 2002.
The scandal has had such an impact in Britain that Prime Minister David Cameron has conceded that a public inquiry is necessary.
It has also put in jeopardy a multibillion-dollar takeover by Murdoch of British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC. Reports today suggested the proposed deal - Mr. Murdoch is bidding for the 61 per cent of the broadcaster he doesn't already own - would be set back by Britain's culture secretary.

ECB hikes rates
The European Central Bank hiked its key lending rate as expected today, and left the door open to further increases, though probably not immediately.
After the ECB boosted the benchmark rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 1.5 per cent, chief Jean-Claude Trichet said the central bank will "continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability." Translation: Further hikes possible to fight inflation.
But he didn't use the words "strong vigilance," which suggests no increase next month.
"His carefully worded comments suggested that, although rates remain low and their stance accommodative, the central bank is not in a huge rush to tighten further," said senior economist Jennifer Lee of BMO Nesbitt Burns. "... Today's move is probably not the final rate hike for 2011."
Some observers see rate hikes in the troubled euro zone as a policy blunder amid a debt crisis that threatens the entire 17-member monetary union and its banking system. Countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland can ill afford rate hikes as they struggle to stay afloat and fight high rates of unemployment.
From Mr. Trichet's point of view, of course, he's not trying to kill the euro zone, only fulfill his mandate of keeping inflation in check. "All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term," he said.
Still, many market players believe it could be a policy mistake, said senior currency strategist Camilla Sutton of Scotia Capital, though she stressed the dilemma of the central bank.
The ECB also eased Portugal's situation somewhat, saying it would now accept Portuguese debt as collateral no matter how it's rated. That does not solve the issue of whether it will take the bonds of Greece should all the major credit raters decide a rollover of some debt constitutes a default.
Separately, the Bank of England kept rates on hold at 0.5 per cent.

Atco to acquire Australian firm
Calgary's Atco Ltd. has struck a deal worth about $1-billion to acquire Western Australia Gas Networks, a distribution utility that serves Perth and its surrounding regions.
"In April 2010, our board of directors approved an Australian growth strategy modeled after Atco's existing Canadian enterprise of diverse yet complementary businesses," chief executive officer Nancy Southern said in a statement.
"The acquisition of Western Australia Gas Networks is an important step towards achieving this strategy. Driven by natural resource development, the utility is situated in the heart of one of the fastest growing economies in the world and complements our existing portfolio of energy infrastructure assets in Australia."

Rogers launches LTE
Rogers Communications Inc. today became the first Canadian wireless operator to turn on a commercial Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless network in the Ottawa region, with plans to roll the new technology into Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal in the fall.
As smart phones and tablets eat up more and more wireless data over the airwaves, global carriers are moving from current third-generation, or 3G, wireless services to next-generation 4G networks such as LTE and Wi-Max, which offer much faster downloading speeds more suited to mobile video and other advanced applications. Globe and Mail telecom writer Iain Marlow reports.

Proxy firm urges RIM to act
A leading proxy advisory firm says it's "underwhelmed" by what it sees as stalling on the part of Research In Motion Ltd. to reform its board-management structure.
The BlackBerry maker has been under pressure to split the jobs of chief executive officer and chairman, and put off a showdown with shareholders by agreeing to strike a committee of independent directors that will study the issue.
Shareholder Northwest & Ethical Investments LP had proposed a vote on the matter at RIM's annual meeting next week, but RIM responded with its proposal, and the two sides agreed. Still, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. said, it's simply avoiding the split and should take "concrete action" on a matter that needs no further study.
"While we commend the board for actively engaging with NEI in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution, we are underwhelmed with the board's continued avoidance of a commitment to appoint an independent chairman," Dimitri Zagoroff and Marian Macindoe of Glass Lewis said in a report, according to Bloomberg News.
Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis each hold the title of co-CEO and co-chairman.

Have house prices peaked?
House prices have likely peaked after a strong six months, Royal LePage Real Estate Services said today.
While prices saw big year-over-year price increases in the second quarter, "high house prices are concealing early signs of a moderating market," the company said, Globe and Mail real estate writer Steve Ladurantaye reports.
"The market has seen its near-term peak in house price appreciation, and a slower second half of the year is expected."
Separately, Statistics Canada said today, prices for new homes rose 0.4 per cent in May, extending April's 0.3-per-cent climb.
Prices were driven largely by the Toronto area and Montreal, the agency said, while the biggest decline was in the Ottawa region "as some builders offered promotional pricing or free upgrade packages to generate sales."

ECB hikes rates
The European Central Bank hiked its key lending rate as expected today, and left the door open to further increases, though probably not immediately.
After the ECB boosted the benchmark rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 1.5 per cent, chief Jean-Claude Trichet said the central bank will "continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability." Translation: Further hikes possible to fight inflation.
But he didn't use the words "strong vigilance," which suggests no increase next month.
"His carefully worded comments suggested that, although rates remain low and their stance accommodative, the central bank is not in a huge rush to tighten further," said senior economist Jennifer Lee of BMO Nesbitt Burns. "... Today's move is probably not the final rate hike for 2011."
Some observers see rate hikes in the troubled euro zone as a policy blunder amid a debt crisis that threatens the entire 17-member monetary union and its banking system. Countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland can ill afford rate hikes as they struggle to stay afloat and fight high rates of unemployment.
From Mr. Trichet's point of view, of course, he's not trying to kill the euro zone, only fulfill his mandate of keeping inflation in check. "All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term," he said.
Still, many market players believe it could be a policy mistake, said senior currency strategist Camilla Sutton of Scotia Capital, though she stressed the dilemma of the central bank.
The ECB also eased Portugal's situation somewhat, saying it would now accept Portuguese debt as collateral no matter how it's rated. That does not solve the issue of whether it will take the bonds of Greece should all the major credit raters decide a rollover of some debt constitutes a default.
Separately, the Bank of England kept rates on hold at 0.5 per cent.

Atco to acquire Australian firm
Calgary's Atco Ltd. has struck a deal worth about $1-billion to acquire Western Australia Gas Networks, a distribution utility that serves Perth and its surrounding regions.
"In April 2010, our board of directors approved an Australian growth strategy modeled after Atco's existing Canadian enterprise of diverse yet complementary businesses," chief executive officer Nancy Southern said in a statement.
"The acquisition of Western Australia Gas Networks is an important step towards achieving this strategy. Driven by natural resource development, the utility is situated in the heart of one of the fastest growing economies in the world and complements our existing portfolio of energy infrastructure assets in Australia."

Rogers launches LTE
Rogers Communications Inc. today became the first Canadian wireless operator to turn on a commercial Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless network in the Ottawa region, with plans to roll the new technology into Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal in the fall.
As smart phones and tablets eat up more and more wireless data over the airwaves, global carriers are moving from current third-generation, or 3G, wireless services to next-generation 4G networks such as LTE and Wi-Max, which offer much faster downloading speeds more suited to mobile video and other advanced applications. Globe and Mail telecom writer Iain Marlow reports.

Proxy firm urges RIM to act
A leading proxy advisory firm says it's "underwhelmed" by what it sees as stalling on the part of Research In Motion Ltd. to reform its board-management structure.
The BlackBerry maker has been under pressure to split the jobs of chief executive officer and chairman, and put off a showdown with shareholders by agreeing to strike a committee of independent directors that will study the issue.
Shareholder Northwest & Ethical Investments LP had proposed a vote on the matter at RIM's annual meeting next week, but RIM responded with its proposal, and the two sides agreed. Still, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. said, it's simply avoiding the split and should take "concrete action" on a matter that needs no further study.
"While we commend the board for actively engaging with NEI in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution, we are underwhelmed with the board's continued avoidance of a commitment to appoint an independent chairman," Dimitri Zagoroff and Marian Macindoe of Glass Lewis said in a report, according to Bloomberg News.
Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis each hold the title of co-CEO and co-chairman.

Have house prices peaked?
House prices have likely peaked after a strong six months, Royal LePage Real Estate Services said today.
While prices saw big year-over-year price increases in the second quarter, "high house prices are concealing early signs of a moderating market," the company said, Globe and Mail real estate writer Steve Ladurantaye reports.
"The market has seen its near-term peak in house price appreciation, and a slower second half of the year is expected."
Separately, Statistics Canada said today, prices for new homes rose 0.4 per cent in May, extending April's 0.3-per-cent climb.
Prices were driven largely by the Toronto area and Montreal, the agency said, while the biggest decline was in the Ottawa region "as some builders offered promotional pricing or free upgrade packages to generate sales."

Full text: Rupert Murdoch shuts down famed paper
Follow Michael Babad and Globe top business news on Twitter
News of the World to close News of the World, the widely read British tabloid founded in the 1840s and known for its outrageous headlines, is shutting down amid a scandal over phone hacking. It's the best-selling Sunday paper in Britain.
News International, the division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire that owns the paper, said it will publish its last edition this Sunday. Any revenue from the last issue will be given to charity, though there will be no advertising.
The paper has been "sullied" by bad behaviour, said News International chairman James Murdoch, who added that its actions were "inhuman" if the allegations are true.
Among the allegations are that News of the World hacked into the voice mails of murder victims and their families. In one case, The Globe and Mail's Eric Reguly reports, the tabloid is accused of having intercepted the messages of Milly Dowler, a teenager found dead in 2002.
The scandal has had such an impact in Britain that Prime Minister David Cameron has conceded that a public inquiry is necessary.
It has also put in jeopardy a multibillion-dollar takeover by Murdoch of British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC. Reports today suggested the proposed deal - Mr. Murdoch is bidding for the 61 per cent of the broadcaster he doesn't already own - would be set back by Britain's culture secretary.

Full text: Our leaders have learned the hard way that voters want them to feel their pain
In the early 1990s, a violent summer storm struck Montreal. Trees were uprooted, roofs were destroyed and Montrealers were quite upset - especially when they found out that mayor Jean Doré, far from rushing back to Montreal, was still quietly enjoying the pleasures of his lakeside cottage in the Laurentians.
He later told reporters: "Even if I had been there, I couldn't have done anything about it." His explanation was rational. The situation didn't call for the presence of politicians but for engineers and city workers. But this was a bureaucratic view. When disaster strikes, the place of an elected official is with his people. Mr. Doré learned the hard way: He was trounced in the next election, an outcome that was precipitated at least in part by his aloofness during the storm.
In contrast, former premier Lucien Bouchard was never as popular as when he firmly took charge during the terrible ice storm of January, 1998, which left half the province without electricity for days. Every day, he was on television with Hydro-Québec's CEO, informing the population about developments.
This summer, we saw elected officials in various parts of the world react very differently to the plight of their voters. As Moscow and its surroundings suffered from intense heat and massive forest fires, with countless human casualties, the city's mayor was holidaying in an undisclosed location - presumably a fancy dacha on the Black Sea. A reporter was bold enough to ask for an explanation from the mayor's office. The answer: This is a problem that concerns not just the city of Moscow but the whole region.
There's worse. Amid the floods that have devastated millions of Pakistanis, President Asif Ali Zardari left for an official visit to Paris and London. Instead of shortening his stay, he spent time at the five-star Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and his manor in Normandy before leaving for London with his 100-strong entourage, where he savoured the joys of the British capital for five days.
The picture was totally different in the United States, Spain and France.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who normally would have preferred Martha's Vineyard, took his family to Florida's Gulf Coast to encourage the return of tourism in the area devastated by the oil spill.
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose country is suffering from a 20-per-cent unemployment rate, decided to skip his vacation. Last year, as the economic crisis was gathering steam, he took heat for having spent part of the summer at the palace hotel of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands.
France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who's been severely criticized for his association with the - his first holiday after his 2007 victory was a Mediterranean cruise on the glitzy yacht of billionaire Vincent Bolloré - opted for a low-profile vacation this year in the family house of his wife, Carla Bruni. Mind you, his wife comes from a rich background - the Bruni Tedeschis are a successful industrialist family from northern Italy who moved to France in the 1970s because they feared Red Brigades kidnappings. Far from being a quaint stone house in a no-name village, the family's summer home is a vast, luxurious manor perched on Cap Nègre, a fashionable spot on the Côte d'Azur.
Perhaps Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff would have rather spent his holidays in Provence. But, in a desperate bid to shore up his party and change his image into an easy-going average Joe, he has been spending six weeks touring small-town Canada - in a bus to boot! - stopping to flip burgers, guzzle root beer and participate in demolition derbies. Mr. Ignatieff says he's had "an enormous amount of fun" - and this may very well be true, since the trip has contributed to the Liberals' recent small rise in the polls.

Full text: The Canadian Open, the third-oldest national open golf championship, will be played this week for the 101st time. It's also the first time in 42 years that St. George's Golf and Country Club is hosting the event. Not enough milestones for you? Here are 10 more from Michael Grange
1904
The details of the inaugural Canadian Open are sparse, given the original minutes of the Royal Canadian Golf Association meeting are missing. Held at the Royal Montreal Golf Club's Dixie course, it was the third national championship held anywhere, following the British Open (established in 1860) and U.S. Open (established 1895). By the standards of today it was a fairly modest event: Thirty-six holes of stroke play on a single day with just 17 entrants - 10 professional, seven amateur - playing for a total purse of $170. Frank Oke, a recently-arrived professional from England shot 76 in the morning in a drizzle to lead by five strokes and followed with an 80 in the afternoon for a two-shot win over Percy Barrett, another English-born pro. Legendary Canadian amateur George Lyon was third.
1919
The tournament was suspended during the First World War and resumed at the elegant Harry S. Colt-designed Hamilton Golf and Country club in Ancaster, Ont. The first championship after a four-year pause attracted a field that included young amateur Bobby Jones and Jim Barnes, a long-driving Englishman from St. Louis. But the event belonged to another English golfer, J. Douglas Edgar, who fought in the war before becoming a club pro in Atlanta. Edgar dominated, building a nine-shot lead after two rounds and pushing the lead to 16 after 72 holes, a tournament record not likely to be broken. "Douglas was simply playing tricks with the ball," Jones said in a radio interview years later. Edgar defended his title in 1920, didn't return in 1921, and died mysteriously in front of his Atlanta home that summer.
1931
There may have been a depression on, but the Canadian Open was able to attract some strong fields during the 1930s. Held at Mississauga Golf and Country Club, the 1931 tournament was bolstered by the presence of the British Ryder Cup team, which arrived in advance of its match with the U.S. side. None made an impact. Instead, it was Walter Hagen who took the crown, outlasting Percy Alliss in a 36-hole playoff. Alliss qualified for the playoff by shooting 32 over the final nine holes in a driving rainstorm. Alliss's son, Peter, went on to become a well-known British golf commentator.
1945
Few great things have been accomplished without a goal in mind. Byron Nelson's goals were perhaps not typical for a championship golfer, but they prodded him to great things. The smooth-swinging Texan had set his mind on a ranch - and was determined to use golf to get it. He arrived at Thornhill Golf & Country Club north of Toronto having won an amazing 17 events and 10 in a row on the PGA Tour. The fear was Nelson would run roughshod over the layout, so it was lengthened by 500 yards and par dropped to 70. Not that it mattered. Nelson shot rounds of 68, 72, 72 and 68 to win by four. "It kept me going," he later said of his cattle ranch dream. "Each win meant another cow, another 10 acres, a bigger down payment."
1954
He won it style. Pat Fletcher was a 38-year-old teaching pro playing out of the Saskatoon Golf & Country Club when he caught fire on the back nine of the 1954 Canadian Open at Vancouver's Point Grey. He shot 32 on the inward nine and made three birdies, overcoming a two-shot disadvantage to win by four over Gordie Brydson of Toronto and American Bill Welch. Having emigrated from England as a four-year-old, Fletcher became the first Canadian citizen since Karl Keffer in 1914 to win the Open, and remains the last to win the national championship. His family listened to a shot-by-shot account of the final round on CBC radio in the pro shop in Saskatoon. The win made headlines coast to coast and earned Fletcher a trip to the Masters in 1955.
1955
Arnold Palmer wasn't the King when he arrived at Weston Golf and Country Club on the northwest edge of Toronto that summer, just a near-broke tour pro travelling with his new bride, Winnie, in a trailer. A successful golfer at Wake Forest University and winner of the 1954 U.S. Amateur, Palmer was still looking for his first win on tour. "I was getting a little frustrated because I hadn't won up to that point," he later said. "It started happening and it was a very special week. My game seemed to come to me." He opened with a career-low tying 64 and never looked back, heading into the final round with a six-shot lead over a deep field that included the likes of Jimmy Demaret and Sam Snead. Palmer shot 70 in the final found to win by four. He called it the kicking-off point for his career and the 61 PGA Tour wins that followed.
1971
Then-Canadian Open sponsor Imperial Tobacco commissioned a trophy to recognize the golfer who won the U.S. Open, British Open and Canadian Open in a single year. Lee Trevino did it in a single month, as he fit in a playoff victory at Richelieu Valley outside Montreal between his win at the U.S. Open and at the British, a week later at Royal Birkdale. The wind was blowing and that suited Trevino's low-ball, Texas style. He opened with a 73, not bad given the distractions - "All those French girls in those hot pants are driving me crazy," he said - but recovered with rounds of 68, 67 and 67. He birdied the first playoff hole against Art Wall and when he later won at Royal Birkdale, earned a $25,000 bonus from Imperial Tobacco and a unique niche in golf lore that he so far has only had to share with Tiger Woods.
1977
It didn't matter who won the 1977 Open, a star had already been born: Glen Abbey Golf Club held its first Canadian championship, forever linking the tournament with one of golf's greatest names, as the Abbey was Jack Nicklaus's first solo design project. The challenge was to create a course that could test the best in the world, remain enjoyable for everyday golf while incorporating facilities that could enhance the spectator experience as well. In 2009, the Abbey is hosted its 25th Canadian Open and is viewed as a success on all fronts. It got a deserving inaugural champion too in the form of Trevino, who won his second of three Canadian titles by four shots over Peter Oosterhuis.
2000
It was the perfect shot to end the perfect summer. There were a record 50,000 people at Glen Abbey to watch Tiger Woods stalk his prey in September of 2000, going for his ninth win of the season. There were 1.5-million Canadians watching on television at home. The Tiger effect? That was a 315-per-cent ratings increase over the previous year, for those keeping count. Tied with Woods heading into the Sunday, New Zealand's Grant Waite pushed the legend to the limit. With Woods leading by a shot, Waite landed an iron pin-high on the par-five 18th to give himself a makeable eagle chance, forcing Woods's hand. Woods responded by famously ripping a 6-iron 218 yards out of the bunker, over water, dead at the flag and into the memories of everyone who saw it.
2004
A Canadian hasn't won their national championship since Fletcher in 1954. But no Canadian came as close as Mike Weir did 50 years later. It was a remarkable tournament at Glen Abbey. Vijay Singh was in the midst of one of the greatest seasons in modern golf history. Weir was a season removed from his Masters win. It was the 50th anniversary of Fletcher's victory and the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Open. Flags were flying at half-mast to honour Canadian golf great Moe Norman, who died the week the 2004 event began. On the final day, Weir of Bright's Grove, Ont., stumbled after leading by three with eight holes to play, but had putts to win on the 72nd hole of regulation and a five-footer on the second playoff hole, failing to make either, leaving Singh the sheepish champion and Weir the devastated loser.

Full text: More than 200 Montrealers call 911, fearing smell of smoke signalled a fire in their neighbourhood
? For a few hours Monday morning, air quality monitors from Ottawa to Quebec City jumped off the charts as fickle winds blew dense plumes of forest-fire smoke up the St. Lawrence Valley.
The spike in carbon monoxide smashed smog records in Montreal and Ottawa. In Montreal, people were roused in the middle of the night by the smell of smoke and anxiously searched for fires in their neighbourhoods. More than 200 people called 911, forcing officials to prerecord a message advising callers that forest fires were the likely cause.
"We were sure something was going up in flames," said Paul Napoli, 42, who awoke around 2 a.m. and had his wife call 911, certain someone's barbeque had started a building on fire. "I'd never smelled anything so intense, even from a fire much closer."
By Monday afternoon, the winds shifted, improving air quality and sending much of the smoke back north.
The swirling winds kept a small northern Quebec native community from burning. Fire crews forced to abandon Wemotaci, about 500 kilometres north of Montreal, were again held at bay by smoke for much of Monday. But aerial surveys showed the evacuated town was still standing and, though flames continued to lick the outskirts of town, the fire appeared to be slowing down.
"We are facing monsters, it's infernal, but we sense things are calming," said Marcel Trudel of the provincial firefighting agency. "The weather seems to be turning, the wind has shifted, there's rain in the forecast, humidity will rise. That's magic for us."
While at least 18 fires have been snuffed in Quebec in recent days, the intensity of a few fires has continued to grow. Two other small communities in the centre of the province were also under partial evacuation advisories.
A look at the numbers so far:
45
The number of fires burning in Quebec. Eight of them have been classified as out of control.
2,600
The number of residents evacuated thus far from three native communities, including 1,300 from Wemotaci and hundreds more from Manawan and Obedjiwan. Many of the evacuees found shelter at a hockey arena in La Tuque, Que., which was also threatened by fire earlier in May. Others sought refuge in Roberval and Joliette. Some of the residents of Manawan have been able to return home.
269
The air quality index in one Montreal neighbourhood at 4 a.m. Monday. The figure is more than five times higher than the threshold for "poor" air quality, and more than two times worse than a record-breaking smog day in 2008. The main pollutant measured by the city was carbon monoxide.
122
The air quality index measured in Ottawa at 11 a.m., more than double the record registered in 2007. (Like Montreal, Ottawa only started keeping records in recent years.)
580
The distance, in kilometres, that the major fire zone is from Portland, Me., where authorities were inundated with complaints about the smell of the smoke emanating from Quebec. Smoke was seen as far away as Cape Cod and Nantucket, Mass., some 800 kilometres from the fires.
39,200
In hectares, the area covered by the largest of the fires, in Le-Domaine-du-Roy, north-central Quebec. The total area burned in Quebec is about 90,000 hectares - nearly twice the size of the Island of Montreal.
11
The total number of outside crews from seven states and four provinces helping fight the Quebec fires, including those from Maine, Massachusetts, Manitoba and British Columbia. Some 1,200 people are working to douse the flames assisted by 64 aircraft.
100
The overnight probability of rain, in per cent, for the area of the most serious fires. The promise of rain gave firefighters hope they might finally get an edge on the most serious blazes.

Smoke from Quebec forest fires wafts over Montreal, parts of Eastern Ontario

Full text: People in counties east of Ottawa should shut their doors and windows, says Chief Medical Officer of Health
? An acrid haze drifted over vast pockets of central Canada as the smoke from forest fires affected urban areas with millions of residents Monday.
In Montreal, Quebec City, and Ottawa, people reported the presence of heavy clouds and burning odours for several hours.
Some people were overheard saying that - because of the smell - they thought their home was on fire. Others described an impact on their breathing.
There are more than 50 forest fires burning in Quebec, including eight that remain out of control. About 40,000 hectares of forest have been ravaged over the last week, while residents of one central Quebec community have been evacuated.
The smoke was not expected to pose a risk to major populated areas, but people with breathing problems were still being warned to take precautions.
The chief doctor of Eastern Ontario issued an air-quality warning in his area, which covers several counties east of Ottawa to the Quebec boundary.
Medical Officer of Health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis urged people to shut their doors and windows Monday.
The doctor called it a health hazard to everybody, but especially young children, the elderly and people with chronic breathing problems.
Environment Canada said the wind was expected to shift northward away from Montreal by late-morning Monday.
About 1,200 firefighters, including some from Maine, New Brunswick, New Hampshire and western Canada are working to extinguish the flames.
One fire, about 300 kilometres north of Trois-Rivieres, forced about 1,300 people from a Quebec reserve to spend a fifth night away from home.
Thick pockets of smoke had drifted to Quebec City on Sunday, diminishing visibility at the city's airport to just one kilometre - less than one-25th of what visibility had been earlier in the day.
The smoke continued wafting southward and reached Montreal overnight. However, the air in the city had already begun clearing considerably by mid-morning Monday.
"The smoke, the smog, over the St. Lawrence region should be ending very soon," David Pelletier, of Quebec's civil security agency, said late Monday morning.
He said the smoke was headed back north. No further evacuations were expected Monday, but several other towns were placed on alert.

Canada's youngest-ever general quit over the unification of forces

Full text: Promoted to brigadier at 27, he led armoured units through fierce fighting all the way from Normandy until the fall of Germany. He later became vice-chief of defence staff
? Standing stiffly at attention in front of a very senior British officer, Robert Moncel of the Canadian army blinked in disbelief when the lieutenant-general told him tersely, "you may send in your brigadier now."
Keeping his temper in check, he replied, "Sir, I am the brigadier!" The corps commander had obviously neglected to check the badges of rank sewn on the shoulder straps of Gen. Moncel's battledress jacket. He looked, he would have seen the three stars and crown of a brigadier-general.
Promoted on Aug. 17, 1944, Gen. Moncel was the youngest general officer in the Canadian army when, at 27, he took over command of the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade (4 CAB). The general had obviously pegged him as a lieutenant, possibly a captain.
To counter his youthful appearance, Gen. Moncel had decided to grow a mustache to make him look more mature. He was tired of people calling him "babyface on stilts!" Gen. Moncel, a tall, slender, soft-spoken man known for his sense of responsibility, enjoyed meteoric promotion during the Second World War. Talented officers who prove themselves in combat and at headquarters are considered valuable assets, and Gen. Moncel earned the admiration of his peers and the approval of his superiors. He commanded 4 CAB from the breakout at Normandy, where he was mentioned in dispatches, all the way through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and into Germany until final victory on May 8, 1945.
Maj.-Gen. Harry Foster thought a lot of Gen. Moncel. "Guy Simonds said that if I got in trouble I could always rely on Moncel," he wrote in his diary. "I came away with the distinct impression that if young Moncel had been 10 years older Guy would have given him the division and left me with the brigade."
That was high praise indeed. Known for his exemplary skills as a staff officer, Gen. Moncel was able to make the transition from fighting a paper war to commanding soldiers in battle. Not every officer can. "Moncel proved to be an excellent brigadier. The officer he replaced was suffering from stress and fatigue and had been drinking heavily, behaviour that had an adverse effect on the formation. Moncel's tenure of command would prove a great contrast. He provided competent leadership and was well respected," said retired major Michael McNorgan, co-author of
Mr. Moncel was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for the leadership he displayed at the end of February, 1945, when 2 Canadian Corps mounted Operation Blockbuster. Commanding Tiger Group, Gen. Moncel and his force fought a tenacious enemy during the Battle of the Hochwald Forest.
He "stationed himself well forward with the leading battle groups and on several occasions, when the impetus of the attack was in danger of being lost by stubborn enemy resistance, personally directed consolidation of objectives and the further forward movement of his armoured and infantry elements," the DSO citation read. "All this was done under extremely heavy hostile fire, and the gallant bearing of this officer, and the complete disregard for his own personal safety, were an inspiration to all troops under his command."
Bob Moncel was born into the 12th generation of an old French-Canadian family. His father manufactured electric fuse boxes and wanted his son to take over the company, but young Robert decided business was not for him. While studying at Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Que., he found a spiritual home in its cadet corps. Founded in 1861, the corps was the oldest in Canada. "It came naturally and easily to me, something I could do fairly well."
He attended Montreal's McGill University and served as an officer with the Victoria Rifles of Canada, which was founded in 1862. Back then, an officers mess in the militia was frequently an exclusive club limited to the social elite. When you applied, they wanted to know who your father was.
Canada declared war on Germany on Sept. 10, 1939, and soon after that Gen. Moncel went overseas with the regular army's Royal Canadian Regiment. After the Germans unleashed their blitzkrieg in May, 1940, he and the RCR were ordered to France the following month in a hopeless effort to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force. Amid complete chaos, Gen. Moncel, who commanded a Bren gun carrier platoon, was soon ordered to turn tail and make for the French coast.
"In the chaos of the evacuation much valuable equipment was abandoned or destroyed to keep it from enemy hands. Although told to destroy his vehicles Lieutenant Moncel instead used his initiative and cool judgment to arrange the evacuation of the carriers and got them back to Britain," said Mr. McNorgan.
That caught his superiors' attention and Gen. Moncel was soon promoted captain. In 1941, he finished first on a staff course. The commandant, Guy Simonds, marked him as a bright officer and he was on his way. In January, 1943, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and given command of the 18th Armoured Car Regiment (12th Manitoba Dragoons).
Eight months later, Gen. Moncel was posted to the headquarters of 2 Canadian Corps, where he organized its general staff branch. He was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire for his "painstaking work and efficiency" there. France made him a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur and awarded him the Croix de Guerre avec Palme.
After the war, Gen. Moncel elected to stay in the army. He filled a variety of high-level staff jobs, including quartermaster-general, deputy chief of the general staff and commander of Eastern Command, responsible for the Atlantic provinces.
By the early 1960s, things were about to change for Gen. Moncel and his beloved army. The Minister of National Defence, Paul Hellyer, was determined to unify the three fighting services, come hell or high water. In 1964, Gen. Moncel gave Mr. Hellyer the benefit of the doubt and became the first comptroller-general of the integrated Canadian Forces Headquarters. A lieutenant-general at only 47, he had almost eight more years to serve until compulsory retirement at 55. There was still time to go even higher. In 1965, he was appointed vice-chief of defence staff.
In his 1990 autobiography, , Mr. Hellyer recounted how he had briefly considered appointing Mr. Moncel the second chief of defence staff (CDS). "A handsome, debonair and bilingual officer, Bob had an excellent war record and was a good administrator. Nevertheless, he was something of an enigma. He wore a lace handkerchief up his sleeve -- which must have been unique in the army -- and his logic was a bit inconsistent. He spent hours trying to persuade me we should only have one regiment of Canadian infantry, with numbered battalions. That would have meant abolishing [some]famous Canadian regiments."
Mr. Hellyer soon decided that offering the top job to Gen. Moncel would be a mistake. "Whereas, I had managed to outlast [Air Chief Marshal Frank Miller] the reverse would be true with a younger, fresher antagonist [Mr. Moncel]who could scuttle the plan by simply stonewalling until I was gone."
In 1966, amid tremendous controversy over unification that split the country, Gen. Moncel decided the minister was moving too fast and resigned. In his book, Mr. Hellyer implied Gen. Moncel was unhappy with the appointment of Lieut.-Gen. Jean Allard as CDS. "The three remaining top men had decided, overnight, to resign en masse. It appeared to me like a calculated attempt to embarrass me in the eyes of my government colleagues and the public."
The following year, in February, 1967, Gen. Moncel, who usually shunned the spotlight, appeared in front of a Parliamentary committee to express his doubts about unification. "To me, [unification]appeared to be moving on an uncharted course at a very, very high speed towards a very, very dim destination, and I did not think I could produce the staff work necessary at that speed to keep the thing on the rails."
"He clobbered us," Mr. Hellyer wrote. "He had been a very effective witness. He said he wasn't opposed to unification, per se, if there were a change in Canadian commitments. However, with our existing commitments, it would affect our close working relationships with the U.K. and U.S. This was a bit of stuff and nonsense, but it sounded plausible to anyone who wanted to believe it."
It didn't take long for Gen. Moncel to get another job. Appointed co-ordinator for visits of foreign heads of state during Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967, he supervised 54 state visits to Ottawa and Montreal, including the Queen, the Shah of Iran and the Emperor of Ethiopia. After it was over, he was made an officer of the Order of Canada.
Gen. Moncel retired to Nova Scotia after Centennial year. He kept busy with painting, gardening, boating, woodworking and community projects. He also obtained his private pilot's license for airplanes and helicopters, and learned the guitar, organ and flute.
ROBERT MONCEL
Robert Guillaume Napoleon Moncel was born on Apr. 9, 1917, in Montreal. He died of natural causes in Halifax on Dec. 10, 2007. He was 90. He is survived by his son-in-law, George Constantis, grandchildren Aliki and Constantine. He was predeceased by his wife, Nancy, and by
daughter Renee.
On Dec. 17, 2007, a military funeral was held at Canadian Forces Base Halifax. The mourners included Gen. Rick Hillier, the chief of defence staff.

Full text: Who has the time and freedom to take a two-week vacation any more? For a growing cadre of travellers, the action-packed mini-trip to a far-flung destination is the way to go
Somewhere between the throbbing techno and Spanish hip hop, vodkas mixed with Guru energy drink to keep the jet-lagged travellers awake, streams of tiny soap bubbles wafting from the ceiling and blasts of cooling mist, Geneviève L'Abbé's whirlwind getaway finally hit its zenith. "It was completely magic," she says. "Everything was so different."
L'Abbé, an equities trader from Montreal, and her friend François had left for Madrid on a Friday afternoon. Arriving at 9:30 Saturday morning for a day of tapas, sangria and some leisurely sightseeing, by 2 a.m. Sunday they were dancing the night away at the trendy Teatro Kapital nightclub. Later, they strolled through the Rastro flea market and snoozed under the sun at famed Parque del Buen Retiro, the city's central park. On Monday afternoon, they headed home. Their visit to the Spanish capital had lasted just over 73 hours, cost around $2,000 and was booked only the Wednesday before departure.
While the idea of flying across the Atlantic for a weekend might seem daunting and decadent to some, mini-trips have become L'Abbé's preferred mode of relaxation, a way to - take a break from the ordinary. "You just want to go somewhere where it's sunny, get out of the city for a while," the 33-year-old says.
It's an increasingly common way of thinking. Studies show that people are taking shorter, more frequent vacations, and they're travelling on impulse more often than ever before. Getaways of no more than four days account for 56 per cent of all trips by Americans, an increase of 10 per cent in the past five years, according to a recent survey by Nova Scotia's Tourism Ministry. A recent British study similarly indicated that tourists are taking fewer traditional, two-week vacations and more mini-trips throughout the year, with 61 per cent claiming to prefer short getaways. And Canadian figures due this year will probably show similar travel patterns, according to the Travel Industry Association of Canada.
Mini-trippers typically have plenty of discretionary income, but they suffer from what some in the travel industry call "time poverty," with personal and work obligations preventing them from taking long vacations.
They are generally seasoned travellers who are not content merely to check into a spa or boutique hotel a short drive from home. Instead, they are flying farther, spending lavishly - at least 15 per cent more on mini-trips than on longer vacations, according to the research - and packing more activity into some surprisingly inventive getaways. This, despite the overall inconvenience of air travel and the physical toll of long-haul flights.
"These aren't the kind of vacations where you just sit down and do nothing," says Eirini Demetelin, co-owner of Superior Travel/Open Skies, a Montreal agency specializing in luxury cruises and travel. "They're action-packed and non-stop. It's all about creating that 'wow' moment."
One popular getaway for Demetelin's moneyed clientele is a new, four-day package from Toronto to Dubai. And her clients are flying across North America and beyond to see live performances and art exhibitions; for example, she booked several weekend trips to Washington, D.C., to see the J.M.W. Turner exhibition, which moves to Dallas next month and New York in June.
For golf, they're
seeking out unique courses and resorts, such as the Blue Monster at Miami's Doral Golf Resort and Spa or the Sanctuary Hotel on Kiawah Island, near Charleston, S.C.
And, of course, there's Las Vegas. The prototypical mini-trip destination now attracts Cirque du Soleil fans as often as gamblers and partygoers, but it is also becoming a jumping-off point for mini-trips to exclusive retreats such as the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah.
Demetelin says the trend is being driven by the proliferation of direct flights and the veritable feast of getaway packages offered by travel agencies, hotels and tour operators.
"I could sit on the phone for 20 minutes and we could go around the world thinking of fun and unique mini-breaks," she says. "There's absolutely no limit to the imagination."
Airlines are trying to cash in on the growing popularity of mini-trips by offering more flexibility on the return portion of flights. Going to Europe used to require a seven-night stay in order to qualify for a lower fare; now, a long weekend with a Saturday-night stopover gets the same rate. Some airlines even sell one-way mix-and-match discount fares to Europe, making it
easier to fly there with Air Transat, say, and back with Zoom Airlines.
A quick getaway
with the kids
But not everyone wants to fly, let alone fly first-class. Car trips still make up the majority of shorter getaways and are often the favourite mode of transportation for people travelling with children. So parents are going to new lengths to make mini-vacations
memorable.
Annie Caldwell, a Toronto mother of two, recently drove her 10-year-old daughter, Emma, to New York for the first time on an unusual shopping expedition. After a stop near Albany, N.Y., to collect Caldwell's friend Donna and her daughter Zoe, 11, they continued on to Manhattan, arriving on a Saturday afternoon for a long-anticipated visit to American Girl Place, the trendy doll emporium.
Later, they scored tough-to-come-by dinner reservations at the store's girl-themed café. During a "cheap and cheerful" meal, Emma's purchase, "2007 Girl of the Year" Nicki, was given her own doll-sized booster seat at the table with her ecstatic new owner.
By the time the mothers and daughters left for home early Sunday evening, they had seen Times Square, taken in the view from Rockefeller Center's 70th-floor observation deck, Top of the Rock, shopped at Bloomingdales and nearby Dylan's Candy Bar, and strolled Central Park's southern tip. With every activity chosen for its special meaning for her daughter, it was Caldwell's best trip ever to New York.
"I don't know who was happier - Emma or me," she said. "I've never seen my daughter beam from ear to ear. She was just so excited the whole time."
Now, taking children on vacation doesn't necessarily encourage relaxation; in the British study, nearly 40 per cent of parents said they ended up exhausted by their family mini-trips. But trying something a little more adventurous than a resort with a kids club doesn't have to be stressful.
On a recent work-related mini-trip to Boston, a client asked Toronto travel agent Ruby Silvertown to book his children on the trip - and into etiquette school.
Another requested a short, positively dizzying adventure in Belize for his young brood, including visits to Mayan temple ruins, cave tubing, zip lining in the rain forest and snorkelling among sharks and stingrays.
And when a Bay Street broker found his father-daughter trip to New York interrupted by an unscheduled business meeting, he asked Silvertown to step in. Through "an incredibly connected friend" in the Big Apple, she arranged for his two daughters to go behind the scenes of the New York City Ballet for the afternoon.
"People used to want to go away and veg for a weekend. Nowadays, they don't want that, and they don't want their kids just to have glorified babysitting, either," says Silvertown, who is president of luxury travel agency the Travel Network. "They're calling a couple of days before, they want these unbelievable trips, and we all jump to give them something unique."
A SELECTION OF DOABLE GETAWAYS FOR THE TIME-STRAPPED TRAVELLER:
trip no. 1 Dubai for a four-day getaway.
The transportation Non-stop flight from Toronto with Emirates ( http://www.emirates.com).
The hotel Emirates Al Maha Desert Resort & Spa ( http://www.al-maha.com; 971-4-303-4222), an oasis within a 225-square-kilometre desert conservation reserve, with views of the Hajar Mountains and only 45 minutes from the bustle of Dubai city.
The food The Dune Dinner, a feast in a "Bedouin encampment," serves traditional Middle Eastern dishes cooked over an open fire, sweet mint tea and a relaxing shisha pipe afterward, all to traditional music.
The fun Try the spa's signature Desert Sand-Herb Rasoul Scrub, a 60-minute "ancient healing ritual" consisting of a full-body scrub on a heated massage table, showers, aromatic steam, lotions and a mud bath that "you and your partner can apply [to]each other."
Trip No. 2 Prague for a long weekend.
The transportation Direct flights from Montreal and Toronto with Czech Airlines (www.
czechairlines.com).
The hotel Four Seasons Prague (Veleslavínova 2a/1098; http://www.fourseasons.com/Prague; 420-221-427-000). Gracing the banks of the Vltava River, the hotel boasts some of the largest rooms in the city.
The food C'est La Vie (Ricni 1, Prague 1, Kampa, Malá Strana; http://www.cestlavie.cz; 420-721-158-403). The restaurant has an extensive wine cellar and an inventive fish and seafood menu.

The food Restaurant Vermeer (Prins Hendrikkade 59-72; http://www.restaurantvermeer.nl; 312-055-648-85). Situated in the NH Barbizon Palace hotel, Vermeer has a one-starred Michelin menu - and a private slip for local canal-dwelling customers.
The fun Rent the hotel's canal boat for a picturesque journey; shop the "Nine Streets" for one-of-a-kind leisurewear; make a solemn visit to the Anne Frank House, some 100 metres from your hotel.

Full text: She may not camp out like a keener, but SARAH HAMPSON knows how to do the Canadian Ski Marathon her way: with a fireplace and glass of cognac at the end
? I am no . That's what you're called when you choose to ski the entire distance of the Canadian Ski Marathon, an annual event in the Gatineau region of the Ottawa Valley that takes you over hill and dale and some pretty steep inclines that can just about kill you.
I have felt like a before -- those hardy folk who trapped furs in the 18th and 19th centuries. In fact, a friend of mine even called me one recently, but that was on a Saturday night when I was wearing a very cool fur-trimmed tapestry jacket that I had bought on Toronto's Queen Street West. Dressed in it, I figure I could mesmerize a grizzly.
Oops, I have strayed off course. Pardon me while I get back to the point, which is simple: I am not a keener, and only a keener would want to be a in the Canadian Ski Marathon. (In the category of , there is the gold and silver participant. The gold keeners ski the entire course carrying 10-kilogram backpacks, in which they have all their overnight equipment because they camp out for the night. The silver run the entire course, but don't sleep out under the stars.)
Me? I am more of a when on cross-country skis. In my mind, it is the least intrusive way to slip into snowy woods, silent and unnoticed. It's like making a perfect surgical incision into the magical cathedral of a forest. You can observe. Hear wind in the branches. Almost smell the snow's crispness.
And that's why I am writing, because the good news is there's a place for in the Canadian Ski Marathon, known, fondly, as the CSM to the 2,000 or so participants (ranging in age from 5 to 85) who come every year from all parts in mid-February. You can register as a "tourer," which means you can choose to ski only certain sections of the course (you can do as little as 10 kilometres or so on both days of the event). The only restriction is that you have to begin and end your course segments of choice while the checkpoints for those sections are still open.
The CSM is a marvel of organizational effort, thanks to a small staff and close to 600 volunteers. The course is well maintained. The checkpoints are stocked with healthy hot food, drink and ski wax, and include portable bathrooms. Local school buses ferry participants to and from other checkpoints and designated transportation hubs. (So, if you wimp out and only want to do one section, you can go back to your hotel or B & B for a little R & R.) Members of the Canadian Forces take up positions at various deep-in-the-trail points to hand out refreshments. (There's nothing quite like turning a corner in what feels like the middle of nowhere to find a man in uniform with a smile and a hot beverage warming on a Coleman stove.)
I had long wanted to go, if only to get a taste of an event that is billed as the world's largest and hardest cross-country ski marathon. Plus, it is one of those quintessentially Canadian Things To Do, like camping in Algonquin Park, smoking a DuMaurier while eating poutine and swigging a Molson, riding horses in the Rockies, or, even better, finding out if you can withstand the bilious ferry ride over to Newfoundland, which is something my father, a great man and an ardent Canadian, decided was a marvellous start to a family holiday when I was about 12.
Everything about the CSM is deeply Canadian. It takes place in the region of our capital city. French and English languages are in the air. And it was initiated in 1967 to mark the country's centennial. Don MacLeod, a former member of the Canadian National Ski Team, decided to celebrate the birth of the nation by leading 400 skiers across a beautiful landscape dotted with frozen lakes, clusters of maple trees, stretches of farmland, and bordered by the edges of the Canadian Shield. Measured in miles at the time, it was exactly 100 (for the centennial, get it?).
It's no wonder the tradition continued. The 160-kilometre course crosses mostly private land, so there's a lovely sense of permitted intrusion into other people's bits of heaven. Not that the keeners take too much notice of that. On the trail, the gold and silver clip along at an impressive speed, barely lifting their heads to take in the view. I felt like a reliable Toyota to their BMW.
Still, they have their own traditions, which are memorable. On the first day, my friend and I, along with my 15-year-old son, all of us keen to feel the vibe of the event, gathered at the starting point at about 7 a.m. in the freezing cold. Many families participate in the event: One quartet of two parents and two teenaged children outfitted themselves with tall, striped Cat-in-the-Hat head gear and big purple boxers worn over ski clothes. They flew over the trail, laughing and chatting.
For me, I loved the sense of community that the event created, even for the . On the school bus I took to get back to my B & B after completing a section that I considered a satisfactory 15-kilometre workout for the day, many of the travellers, strangers to one another for the most part, turned around in their seats to discuss the merits of the trail they had just skied, and which other sections they recommended. (The most treacherous section is No. 3, which starts at the bottom of the ski hill at Carling Lake and ends at the Rouge River. It has endless ups and downs, and can kill you, I hear.)
The camaraderie I experienced with my fellow skiers could be attributed to the mysterious school-bus effect, of course, which makes everyone feel like instant friends. But I felt it, too, in the morning over breakfast and at dinner in our small B & B in Montebello. It was also palpable at the optional closing buffet banquet for the event, which was well attended.
The other tradition I enjoyed was a cognac in front of the massive fireplaces at Chateau Montebello, a resort I think of as the Titanic of winter fun. As I swilled my drink in my bell-bottomed glass, I figured all those keeners were already fast asleep somewhere, either under the stars or in school auditoriums in Papineauville and Lachute, where organizers offer dormitory-style accommodation.
Call my version of the CSM The Wimpathon if you must -- but look who's sipping Courvoisier by a roaring fire.
Pack your skis
MEMORABLE MOMENT
Crossing a wide, frozen lake with no skiers in view. I felt wonderfully alone in the white landscape. SRESS FACTOR
Having to pee in an ancient outhouse near the trail. Lesson learned: Go before you ski.
CANADIAN SKI MARATHON
The 41st-annual CSM takes place Feb. 10 and 11: 1-877-770-6556; csm-mcs.com. The website offers information on trails, ski conditions and different categories of participation. The site also lists local B&Bs. Note: These accommodations book up fast. You can register to ski on the day, but for savings, it's easier to register on-line and there are discounts if you register early. (Online deadline for this year's event closed yesterday.)
Charter buses are also organized through the CSM from Montreal and Toronto. (After a full weekend of skiing, no one wants to drive five hours back to Toronto or two hours to Montreal on a Sunday night.)
WHERE TO STAY
Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello: Montebello, Que.; ; 819-423-6341. Offers a deluxe package for the CSM weekend. Prices are per adult and include Friday and Saturday accommodation, Friday dinner, Saturday breakfast, Saturday dinner and Sunday breakfast. One person is $650, two people, $445.

Full text: Set out from the Chic Choc Mountains' new wilderness auberge, and you're more likely to come across a moose than another backcountry skier
? Leaving the comfort of the Chic-Chocs Mountain Lodge behind, our disparate group started its climb to the base of Mount 780 -- so named because no one's ever really named it.
The first few kilometres were gentle, belying. But when the switchbacks started in earnest, the effort began to show on the faces of the more urbane among us. The snow was crusty, but our short, fat skis dug right in. Then, after about two hours, we started our descent, telemarking through the abundant powder, swerving around snow-clad trees.
Until recently, the sole outpost of civilization in the Chic Choc Mountains on Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula was the Gîte du Mont Albert, an 85-room roadside inn that has earned near-mythical status among outdoor enthusiasts. But in December last year, another property opened its doors, providing an even more isolated base for exploring the region.
Two decades in the making, the first wilderness ski mountaineering lodge in Eastern North America was modelled on the backcountry inns of the Rocky Mountains. But according to Gilbert Rioux, the project co-ordinator, the Chic-Chocs Mountain Lodge differs from those in the Rockies in some important ways.
"For one," he said, "we keep vehicle use to a strict minimum. So if you want to ski on the summits around the lodge, you get there by your own leg power and nothing else."
Sépaq, the Quebec government corporation in charge of developing provincial parks, has also encouraged a heavy ecological penchant at the lodge. Organic food is served whenever possible; biodegradable soaps are used; an extensive recycling program is in place; and a peat-filtered sewage system takes care of the rest.
Getting there, as they say, is half the fun. Our adventure started long before we reached the lodge. It started down near the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where we loaded our luggage into a Snowcat. Then we sat back and watched the river, forest and mountains roll by. Two hours later, we arrived at our new weekend home, ready to play.
Visitors who came for the isolation were well served: We skied out from the 18-room lodge into the surrounding 60-square-kilometre wildlife reserve, and for three days the only other souls we crossed paths with were a moose and her calf.
Some of the more adventurous in our group opted to hit the peaks with alpine touring skis. But beginner downhillers be warned: If you aren't able to make quick, sharp turns in deep snow, you'd be best off strapping on snowshoes or Meta backcountry skis -- short, fat, free-heel skis with snowboard-like bindings.
Of course, no one forced us to play in the snow, and more than a few of my fellow guests opted to curl up with a good book near the fire, or in front of the tall bay windows.
One thing we all had our minds on, however, was food. Meals at the lodge were served up in the convivial Gaspé style. In the evening, staff and guests alike sat around long wooden tables, and helped themselves to a family-style meal of braised lamb with lentils and oyster mushrooms, or gravlax with a salad of zucchini and sun-dried tomatoes.
Alain Laflamme, head chef and innkeeper, has worked on both sides of the Atlantic -- in New York and Lausanne, Switzerland. His last stints were as head chef of the renowned Beaver Club in Montreal, and as executive chef at the genteel Château Bon Entente in Quebec City.
The lodge's isolation has presented him with interesting challenges. "We have to work our magic with ingredients that won't spoil during transport, which means we put more emphasis on winter vegetables and the like," Laflamme explains. "So I'll accompany an emincé of pork with red cabbage and braised parsnip."
Just the kind of high-octane fuel we needed on Mount 780.

Full text: Montreal fire captain who was devoted to his profession was probably overwhelmed by an unexpected 'flashover'
? It was an unfortunate twist of fate that found a firefighter battling a blaze in the wrong place at the wrong time. A captain at Fire Station 14, Marcel Marleau hadn't originally been scheduled for duty last month when a fire broke out at an apartment building in the city's north end. But when a co-worker requested a change of shift, Mr. Marleau readily obliged. Such was the bitter irony that preceded the death of the 28-year veteran of the Montreal fire department.
Mr. Marleau was an undeniable presence at the fire hall. A hulking individual, he was 6 foot 2 and broad shouldered, yet possessed an easy laugh and happy-go-lucky nature.
Claude Forest, the Montreal Fire Department chaplain said that Capt. Marleau's heart was that of a firefighter. "He had the heart of a child, full of spontaneity and joy. He liked to tease. He had a father's heart and, of course, he had the heart of a husband."
The 47-year-old Mr. Marleau was "a maniac for hockey and baseball," his brother, Robert Marleau, recalled. "He loved music -- especially jazz. The only setback he had in his life was attempting to play the trombone."
The fire captain also liked to cook, said his brother. It was an expertise he honed at the firehouse. "You'd arrive at his home and the table would be set for three but he would inevitably prepare spaghetti for 20."
Mr. Marleau, who enlisted with the force in 1978, had been decorated on several occasions for bravery. On April 7, 1992, he was credited with risking his life to save several occupants of senior's home. A fire had engulfed the building and claimed seven lives. Described by fellow firefighters as a man who was devoted to his work, Mr. Marleau had been a fire captain since 2000 and was constantly seeking new ways to improve conditions for firefighters.
It was in the wee hours on a freezing Saturday morning last month when the firefighters from Precinct 14 were summoned to a Montreal apartment building after residents awoke to the smell of smoke. Mr. Marleau's crew raced to the scene but could see no sign of smoke. Punching their way inside, the firefighters found only minor flames and one smouldering sofa. Spreading out through the three-storey structure, the crew began an apartment-by-apartment search for residents.
Fernando Serrano, who lives nearby, observed the progress of the firefighters. At first, he thought the blaze was small and easily contained but suddenly, without warning, a large fire erupted. "I was shocked to see so many flames shooting out of the building."
A woman who escaped by leaping from her apartment told reporters that she knew that something was terribly wrong when she saw firefighters running out of the building hollering and yelling that their captain was trapped inside.
Mr. Marleau had become separated from his men during the search for residents and was surrounded by a sudden "flashover." Technically known as a thermal radiation feedback, a flashover is caused by an accumulation of increasing heat and gases. They can occur when the ceiling and inner walls, and the combustible material contained within them, absorb so much energy that they ignite in an explosive burst of flames when the gas reaches a specific temperature.
"A flashover comes at you like a speeding train," explained James Ross, the chief of operations at the Montreal fire department. In the space of just a few seconds, firefighters can find themselves surrounded by an inferno.
Officials believe Mr. Marleau was inspecting a series of rooms. Because there was no heavy smoke, he was probably caught off guard by the powerful rush of the flashover.
Firefighters ran inside in a desperate attempt to save him, only to be met by an impenetrable wall of flames. Mr. Marleau was trapped by the flames and fire chief Serge Tremblay said firefighters were unable to reach him, despite several attempts Suddenly, what had been a routine low-alert fire was a five-alarm inferno. Knowing that their captain had probably perished, the crew pressed on with the evacuation of the building and helped the residents escape. All told, they rescued about 30 residents. Another firefighter suffered second-degree burns to his face.
At the funeral, Claude Forest described fire as a cruel adversary. "Our sworn enemy is the Beast," he said at a funeral mass for Mr. Marleau. "It's vicious, treacherous and deceitful. You may think you've beaten it. But it's just feigning sleep until, suddenly, it bites.
"On Jan. 21, the Beast's bite was fatal."
The cause of the fire remains unknown and authorities are continuing their investigation.
Marcel Marleau was born
in Montreal on Aug. 21, 1958.
He died in a Montreal fire on
Jan. 21, 2006. He was 47.
He is survived by his wife,
Chantelle, and their two
children, Patrick and Philippe.

MADELINE-ANN AKSICH, HUMANITARIAN: 1956-2005

Full text: Montreal VIA Rail executive who visited her Yugoslav roots was inspired to launch International Children's Institute to help the lost children of Croatia
? The Croatian taxi driver took his passenger from Canada deep within the forest. On the last dark, lonely path, he abruptly stopped. An armed party of silent men had suddenly appeared in front of them.
Her life might have been over at any second, yet the former VIA Rail executive overcame her fear and stepped out of the cab. At stake was the future of the lost children of Croatia.
Madeline-Ann Aksich was a champion of innocence and her brainchild was a children's institute she established shortly after the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia in 1991. She believed in the catharsis of storytelling and used it to help Croatian children to unburden themselves of the traumas inflicted by war.
The daughter of a former Yugoslavian diplomat to the United Nations who settled in Montreal, Ms. Aksich was in Croatia on business when she requested a meeting with an official from the Croatian ministry of health. She had the idea of raising money to help rebuild Dubrovnik, a city not far from her family's traditional home on the island of Sipan. When the official responded that the plight of the country's children was a far more pressing concern, the International Children's Institute was born.
The child of Anton Aksich and Kay Orloff, Madeline-Ann Aksich attended McGill University where she earned both her BA and MBA. Following graduation, she became an executive with Via Rail and worked as an international business consultant. A fixture in the non-profit sector of non-government agencies, she sat on the board of directors for the Couchiching Institute and worked tirelessly for the Montreal Musée des beaux arts and the YWCA.
In 1992, she left her consultant's job to devote herself entirely to the ICI. The institute quickly established programs in Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Kosovo. Its mandate: to send books, games, sports equipment, puppets and art supplies to refugee camps to help children cope with their traumas.
One of the ideas that she was most proud of was an innovation that addressed the needs of children who complained that no one was listening to them. The children felt so isolated and disconnected from their immediate families, she wrote in her memoirs, that she came up with a bold solution that would allow the children to be heard everywhere, by everyone in the camp.
"We bought loudspeakers, really big loudspeakers, and a radio system, and established a weekly radio program, by the children, for the children . . . All the adults had to listen to the children because the volume was cranked up really loud. So even if they stayed within their barracks and did not come out, they heard."
For Ms. Aksich, children influencing policy and influencing parent action was what the International Children's Institute's programs were all about. Storytelling and drawing also became an important element. Ms. Aksich and her staff realized that the war children of Croatia -- and later those of Bosnia, Sierra Leone and other war zones -- could make a powerful statement. They all offered the same message -- an overwhelming cry for peace. On another level, their words and pictures demonstrated a profound resilience. Children are slow to surrender and hold high a hope in the future, even when the odds seem to be against them. Their messages came through loud and clear, says the ICI website: "Because children often repress less than most adults, they can also be far more eloquent."
What follows is a condensation of three stories. One boy identified only as C. A. wrote: "The gunfire woke me up and I was very afraid. Everything was burning and shaking, and I thought that nothing would remain from this life. I heard screams coming from under my house. We fled and went through the forest for nine days and nights, exhausted and thirsty. But we were cut off by the enemy trucks and men who loaded us all inside. They struck us with their rifles and insulted us. I was afraid. They took us to a school in Kalinovik and placed us in the classrooms, where we spent our days filled with sorrow and pain. I saw a lot of people being taken away and killed. The days were filled with death and blood. I was in that dark camp for two months."
K. E., a girl, who suffered an amputation, wrote: "I asked my mother if I could go outside and play. My two sisters were with me. Suddenly, grenades started falling around us. I guess it must have been out of fear that I began to climb the nearest tree. Thick smoke and dust were everywhere.
"I felt pain and I saw blood all over my leg. The pain was terrible, unbearable. The ambulance came soon. They picked us up, my sisters and me, and loaded us inside. My leg really ached a lot, and I kept asking my sister to move her own legs off me. Then I lost consciousness. I woke up in the hospital. Mother was there, crying, and she told me that my sisters were dead."
A boy from Sierra Leone wrote: "The rebels burned many houses and took many properties. They burned my father's two houses. They also killed my father and my mother in my presence. They said, 'Everyone come out of the house!' So we came out, and they made my father and my mother, as well as my brothers, go back inside to burn together with the house. I saw my parents burning in the fire."
Not only was she someone of conviction, Madeline-Ann Aksich also possessed the ability to breathe life into ideas. In 1993, she hoped to organize a conference in Dubrovnik to bring together policy makers, school-board officials, teachers, parents, as well as community members and children to work on solutions to help the youngest victims of the war. Yet nothing could happen until she got government permission. So in Zagreb she found a taxi cab that would take her to meet an official named Slobodan Lang. The cab delivered her to his bodyguard in the forest.
"They had their weapons aimed at the car," she said years later. "I [had]told no one where I was going. No one knew where I was."
The taxi sped away and she was immediately searched. It was only then that she learned the men with the machine guns were part of Slobodan Lang's security forces. They escorted her to their special attaché of humanitarian affairs who ended up wholeheartedly sanctioning her conference proposal.
A superb navigator of bureaucracies, Ms. Aksich lobbied tirelessly on behalf of her cause. In 1996, she was invited to the Carter Centre in Atlanta, Ga., to represent Canada at a mental-health conference. She was disappointed to find that access to former U.S. first lady Roslyn Carter, a woman whose philosophy on mental health inspired her own, was restricted. At a conference dinner, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his wife appeared only when surrounded by Secret Service agents and were clearly off limits to the rest of the guests. Determined to have a word with Mrs. Carter, Ms. Aksich waited for an opportunity.
"Towards desert time, I stood up and approached Mrs. Carter. A security guard immediately put his hand out to usher me back. I said, 'Mrs. Carter, my name is Madeline Aksich and I recently set up an Organization called the International Children's Institute.' "
At that point, Ms. Aksich had the savvy to invoke the name of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. It worked. "She knew Trudeau very well . . . Within 30 seconds I'd given her the highlights when she asked, 'How do you spell your last name?' "
Six weeks later, Ms. Aksich received a phone call from the secretary of the Carter Centre with the news that Mrs. Carter would not only endorse the ICI but do it in front of the press. In July of 1996, Mrs. Carter flew to Montreal for the official inauguration of the ICI.
In 2002, Ms. Aksich was awarded the order of Canada. By then, she was seriously ill and then governor-general Adrienne Clarkson broke with tradition to make the presentation at Ms. Aksich's home in Beaconsfield, Que. The year before, Ms. Aksich had been diagnosed with uterine cancer and told she had just three months to live.
Defying the odds by living years beyond her prognosis, she returned to the former Yugoslavia. Her mother, Kay Aksich said determination alone kept her alive. "There were things she needed to do and she lived to ensure that those things got done."
Madeline-Ann Aksich was born
in Montreal on June 28, 1956.
She died of uterine cancer
in Montreal on Sept. 25, 2005.
She leaves her mother, Kay, her brother Anthony, and thousands of children around the world.

Full text: There's no need to go through the traumas of ABC's TV castaways just for some solitude. KIRA VERMOND finds more enjoyable ways to satisfy your inner Crusoe
Rampaging polar bears and kidnappers aside, some would say the castaways on ABC's have got it made. No cellphones. Loads of free time. Some interesting -- albeit unstable -- companionship. And one heck of a stunning view. The runaway TV drama is set to kick off its second season on Wednesday, tracking the lives, losses and mind games of plane-crash survivors stranded on a Pacific island.
But you don't have to go through the trauma of a plane's stomach-clutching death spiral (or take an ill-fated three-hour tour, for that matter) to get that shipwrecked, I'm-all-alone-in-the-world feeling. Heck, who even needs an island? From isolated mountain lodges to lighthouses perched on the edge of the ocean, and from swank private Caribbean isles to remote fire-lookout cabins, here are some off-the-beaten-path accommodations and adventures to help you get away from it all, without stepping into harm's way.

Really private islands
Who hasn't dreamed about vacationing on a lush private island where it's just you, your closest friends and a icy pitcher of Coco Loco? Or maybe your fantasies run more toward survivalist adventure, a holiday where you're dropped off on a deserted island with a wave and a promise to come back at the end of the week.
There are all kinds of private islands available for sale or rent around the world, from Canada's Great Lakes to the waters off Belize. And they're not only for the billionaire crowd, either.
For the most daring who want a shoestring vacation, Vladi Private Islands, with offices in Germany and Canada, offers a "Robinson Crusoe" adventure in which clients are dropped off on islands (one is the alleged original Crusoe island off the coast of Chile) with nothing more than a Swiss army knife and a hammock.
Or check out Bowe Cay, a tropical island in the Bahamas where travellers are set loose on 120 hectares -- completely alone -- for seven days of snorkelling, hiking and swimming. No swishy accommodations here. Visitors sleep in yurts.
If you'd like some permanent isolation, Farhad Vladi, owner of Vladi Private Islands, can help you. His company sells islands starting at $1,500 for 500 square metres in Lake Charlotte, N.S. The average price for an island is only about $356,000, according to the company literature.
Of course renting an island can be far cheaper, starting from a few hundred dollars a night and climbing to about $53,000 for a high-season night on Musha Cay in the Bahamas, one of the most luxurious resorts in the world.
"After staying in some of these places, I would never go back to a hotel," says Nick Guezen, director of business development for Caribbean Way, a Montreal-based vacation broker that handles 12 private islands in the Caribbean, including Musha Cay and Sir Richard Branson's more famous Necker Island.
Nestled in the British Virgin Islands, the Necker property runs a cool $18,000 to $43,000 a night for its 13 bedrooms, two tennis courts, two swimming pools, water toys and staff that outnumber guests. Want lobster at 2 a.m.? You just have to ask. Feeling frisky? Climb a ladder into a tree to enjoy one of Branson's "love nests."
The last time Guezen visited the island, the chef sent two sea kayaks filled with platters of sushi down to the lagoon pool where 20 peckish swimmers were frolicking.
"It was kind of surreal," Guezen says. "But absolutely incredible."
A lodge in the clouds
"We really are an island in the sky," says Paul Leeson, owner of Purcell Mountain Lodge, a luxury mountaintop getaway built high in the Canadian Rockies near Golden, B.C. There are only two ways to approach the building: A long hike, or a helicopter ride.
The timber-frame lodge features 10 private rooms, a cedar sauna and stunning dining room where meals are presented family-style. To keep things running, lights and appliances operate off electricity generated from a mountain stream. But don't expect your cellphone or BlackBerry to pick up a signal.
"There's no connection at all," Leeson says almost gleefully. "Some people are panicked by that, but we know we'll be getting hugs by the time they leave."
Saying adieu to civilization is probably just what a doctor would prescribe for many of the urban execs who make up the majority of Purcell Lodge's clientele. Leeson says most arrive tightly wound, but after a few days of hiking, backcountry skiing, meadow walking or curling up with a book in front of the living room fireplace, they feel more stress-free than stranded.
The only requirement? "Just be back at 6:30 for dinner," Leeson warns.
Like Swiss Family Robinson
Tree house vacations are gaining ground. Travellers -- those who aren't afraid of heights, anyway -- can rent a tree house in India, Tanzania, South Africa and Australia. Closer to home, the U.S. West Coast boasts a few tree-house resorts where visitors can live like the shipwrecked Swiss Family Robinson, if only for a night.
And don't expect barebones service. Cedar Mountain Treehouse, for example, is a privately owned mountain B & B about 20 kilometres from Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State. Relax 15 metres up a 200-year-old red cedar. Sleep in one of the two double beds in the lofts or climb the stairs to stare up at the sky from a glass-enclosed observation room. The experience costs about $300 a night for two people.
Or stay in a bamboo "hooch" tree house in the lush hills of Rincon, Puerto Rico, minutes away from the area's beaches. The Sunset Hooch, owned by American expat Jo Scheer, is a self-sufficient tree house a short walk away from the main house. Snuggle in the queen-sized bed, make a cup of coffee in the kitchenette or visit the "hoochette" for a flush toilet and sink. It costs about $120 a night for two people.
Leave the light on
Hundreds of lighthouses dot the coastlines of North America, but only a few offer guest accommodations and invite travellers to spend the night. The West Point Lighthouse on the southwestern tip of Prince Edward Island has nine cozy guest rooms, some with whirlpool baths. All have been furnished to recreate the era when light keepers lived and worked there to warn ships away from treacherous waters. But with a full-service restaurant downstairs and world-class views, being stranded on PEI might not be such a bad deal.
Unlike the more stereotypical octagonal or round lighthouses, West Point is a square tapered wooden tower, the first built by the federal government on PEI. Its total height is 20.6 metres from ground to vane.
The tower room, located on the second floor of the lighthouse across the hall from the recreated light keeper's quarters, is the only bedroom in the original 1875 structure and it is the most popular space. Rates range from $125 to $135 for one night.
Rent a fire lookout
While fire-lookout cabins are hardly used any more to spot forest fires in remote locations -- technology, vehicle access, aerial observation and electronic fire detection have replaced the need for manned lookouts -- they can be an exceptionally inexpensive way to get some privacy.
Hike a three-kilometre trail to reach Washington-based Evergreen Mountain Lookout with views of Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier and a 360-degree vista of the surrounding Cascades.
The lookout was built in 1935 and occupied each summer until the 1980s. It was also used as an aircraft-spotting station during the Second World War. In 1990, a local volunteer group adopted the lookout, perched at 1,700 metres above sea level, and renovated the small, rustic wooden structure. It is now available for rent Aug. 1 to Oct. 10.
For about $47 a night, don't expect more than one twin bed, three extra mattresses, a two-burner propane stove and propane lights. A short walk down the slope takes you to a pit toilet. You've got to pack in your own water.
But who cares?
"Saw a meteor that lasted longer than a Roman candle," notes one entry into the cabin's visitor log.
With memories like that, roughing it in solitude sure beats anything a cruise director could cook up for 2,000 guests. Maybe feeling a little lost is a sure-fire way to be found.

Jan. 3: James (Tip) Anderson, 71, of St. Andrews, Scotland, was Arnold Palmer's caddy for many British Opens. Once a top junior golfer and club maker, Anderson impressed Palmer as "the epitome of the Old World caddy - a man of few words, wry Scottish wit, loyal, punctual."
Jan. 3: James (Doc) Counsilman, 83, legendary U.S. Olympic swimming coach from 1964 to 1976. His 1976 Montreal Olympic team won 12 of the 13 men's titles.
Jan. 5: Charles Dumas, 66, 1956 Olympic gold medal high jumper was the first man over the seven-foot barrier. He won at Melbourne, using the straddle style that predated the flop technique.
Jan. 5: Tug McGraw 59, was a top relief pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Born Frank Edwin McGraw, he played on the Phillies' only World Series championship team, in 1980. A southpaw with a befuddling screwball, he popularized the slogan "You gotta believe" during the Mets' unlikely 1973 run, in which they rose from last place to win the National League championship.
Jan. 13: Mike Goliat, 82, the second baseman on Philadelphia's 1950 pennant-winning Whiz Kids team, which lost the World Series to the New York Yankees. Goliat was sold to the St. Louis Browns in 1951 and later played in Toronto, where he was chosen as the International League's most valuable player in 1956 and served as a player-coach in four pennant-winning seasons.
Jan. 17: Harry (the Cat) Brecheen, 89, a pitcher who won three games for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1946 World Series.

Jan. 25: Fanny Blankers-Koen, 85, won a record total of four gold medals sprinting for the Netherlands at the 1948 Olympics. The International Association of Athletics Federations honoured her in 1999 as the best female athlete of the 20th century. She won four of the nine women's track and field events at the London Olympics. The only others to win four gold medals in track and field in a single Olympics were Jesse Owens in 1936 in Berlin and Carl Lewis in 1984 in Los Angeles. She set 20 world records.
Jan. 28: Elroy (Crazy Legs) Hirsch, 80, an NFL Hall of Fame receiver with the Los Angeles Rams from 1949 to 1957, was nicknamed for his elusive, gyrating running style.
Jan. 31: Eleanor Holm Whalen, 91, was the glamour girl of U.S. Olympic swimming after winning two gold medals at Los Angeles in 1932. But Holm was cast into disgrace on the 1936 sea voyage to the Berlin Olympics because she stayed up late drinking champagne. She was dropped from the U.S. team, returned home and embarked on a career in show business, joining a company putting on swimming spectaculars and playing the role of Jane alongside Glenn Morris in the 1938 film Tarzan's Revenge.
Jan. 31: Ernest Burke, 79, pitched for the Baltimore Elite Giants in the old Negro Leagues and later played in Quebec. Burke, raised by a family in Iberville, Que., after he was orphaned as a child, was one of the first black U.S. marines to serve in the Second World War.
Feb. 9: Michael Rowland, 41, was only two wins short of the 4,000-victory milestone when he died of injuries suffered in a three-horse spill at Turfway Park in Kentucky.
Feb. 13: Johan Sermon, 21, a Belgian cyclist with the Daikin team, died in his sleep, apparently of a heart attack.
Feb. 14: Mario Pantani, 34, was adored as Italian cycling's Il Pirata (the Pirate) as he charged to victories in the 1998 Tour de France and Giro d'Italia. He had flair, with his shaved head, bandana and earring giving him a swashbuckling look. But his late career was dogged by allegations of drug use. He felt persecuted and undertook treatment for depression. He was found dead in his hotel room on Valentine's night.
Feb. 15: Lawrence S. Ritter, 81, collected the pioneering oral history of baseball, The Glory of Their Time. He spent five years in the early 1960s tracking down old-time baseball stars living in obscurity and taped their tales of baseball's early days. The original tapes are kept at Cooperstown.
Feb. 16: Charlie Fox, 82, a former Montreal Expos field manager and general manager, was also the 1971 National League manager of the year with the San Francisco Giants, as they won the NL West title.
Feb. 17: Shirley Strickland de la Hunty, 78, won an Australian record of seven Olympic medals. She was the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic titles. She won the 80-metre hurdles at Helsinki in 1952, took some time off to have a baby, then returned in time to defend her title at the 1956 Melbourne Games.
Feb. 21: John Charles, 72, a genial and gentlemanly Welshman who was a star defender and centre forward with Juventus in the 1950s and 1960s. He scored 269 goals in 530 games and was never sent off or cautioned.

Feb. 24: Carl Liscombe, 89, helped the Detroit Red Wings win the Stanley Cup in 1943. Liscombe played from 1937 to 1946 for the Red Wings, and shares the club record for most goals in a playoff game (four) and most points in a game (seven).
March 2: Marge Schott, 75, was the tough-talking, chain-smoking, seriously flawed owner of the Cincinnati Reds. Some saw her as quirky, believing that by rubbing her dog's hair on the Cincinnati players she helped them win the 1990 World Series. Such buffoonery gave her an amusing side, but it but didn't cover up Schott's underlying prejudices. Major League Baseball finally decided to ask her to leave the owners' ranks, and she sold controlling interest in 1999.
March 6: Tabasco Cat, 13, the winner of the 1994 Preakness and Belmont Stakes under jockey Pat Day, died of a heart attack in a breeding shed in Japan.
March 19: Brian Maxwell, 51, founded the multimillion-dollar PowerBar nutritional supplement empire in 1986 with his wife, Jennifer. Maxwell was born in London, grew up in Toronto and was a member of the 1980 Olympic team that boycotted the Games in Moscow.
April 5: Darrell Johnson, 75, managed the Boston Red Sox to the 1975 World Series and was the first manager of the expansion Seattle Mariners. In eight major-league seasons as a manager - three with Boston, four with Seattle and one with Texas - Johnson won 472 games and lost 590.
April 8: Bruce Edwards, 49, caddied for two-time Masters winner Tom Watson for more than 30 years through 40 victories. Lou Gehrig's disease took his life just before the tee-off of this year's Masters tournament.
April 19: Norris McWhirter, 78, co-founded the Guinness book of records with brother Ross. The book, which sells more than one million copies a year, is the authoritative trivia treasury for bar bets, listing sport records and everything from the fastest climb of Mount Everest to the world's longest hot dog.
April 22: Pat Tillman, 27, walked away from millions in the National Football League to fight for his country in Afghanistan. The former Arizona Cardinals safety died in a friendly fire incident.
April 28: Mike Wadsworth, 60, was a former CFL star lineman player for five seasons with Toronto Argonauts, but he played six positions professionally after retiring from the field: lawyer, president of the CFL Players Association, Canadian ambassador to Ireland, athletic director at the University of Notre Dame, football broadcast commentator and corporate executive.
April 29: Sid Smith, 78, the eighth captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, was a model of consistency, with six consecutive 20-goal seasons on the left wing of Ted (Teeder) Kennedy. He won the Stanley Cup three times (1948, 1949, 1951), the Lady Byng Trophy twice (1951-52 and 1954-55) as the National Hockey League's most gentlemanly player and the world hockey championship (1958) with the Whitby Dunlops.
May 22: Alex Woodley, 71, coached and mentored U.S. Olympic champion sprinters in the 1960s and 1970s as the head of the Philadelphia Pioneer Club.
June 4: Wilmer Fields, 81, Negro League baseball player.
June 8: Mack Jones, 65, the Mayor of Jonesville in left field for the early Montreal Expos. Jones's three-run home run and two-run triple highlighted an 8-7 win over St. Louis in Montreal's Jarry Park debut. He also played for Atlanta and Cincinnati.
June 9: Roosevelt Brown, 71, the New York Giants' Hall of Fame offensive tackle, was a 10-time all-star and a member of the Giants' 1956 championship team.
June 16: George Haussman, 88, major-league baseball player, suspended for playing in Mexico.
June 17: Gerry McNeil, 78, is destined to be remembered as the Montreal Canadiens' goaltender who allowed Bill Barilko's Stanley Cup-winning shot for Toronto in 1951. McNeil backstopped the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup final against Toronto in 1951 and Detroit in 1952, but it wasn't until the 1952-53 season that he was able to lead the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup title.
June 20: Don Loney, 80, made a lasting mark with the St. Francis Xavier X-Men, guiding them to a 133-31-2 record from 1957 to 1973. His teams won nine university football conference titles, four Atlantic Bowl championships and the 1966 College Bowl title. Loney, who also played in the CFL, was inducted into the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame in 1981.
June 25: Karol Kennedy Kucher, 72, and her brother Peter became the first American pair to win a world figure-skating championship when they captured the gold medal in London in 1950. They also won a silver medal at the 1952 Winter Olympics.

July 12: Joe Gold, 82, a pioneering bodybuilder who in 1965 founded Gold's Gym in Venice, Calif., where Arnold Schwarzenegger built his legend among the dumbbell set. He sold the rights to Gold's Gym in 1971 and later started the World Gym franchise.
July 14: Papa Joe Hendrick, 84. The former race driver and patriarch of the powerful, tragedy-stricken NASCAR family was the father of Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick and company president John Hendrick. Fifteen weeks after Joe's death, a small-plane crash killed 10 Hendrick family members and team associates, including John and grandson Ricky.
July 22: William (Sou) Bridgeforth, 97, was the last living owner of a Negro League baseball team. In the mid-1940s, he purchased the Baltimore Elite Giants for $11,000 (which included the team bus) and later owned the Birmingham Black Barons.
July 24: Lowell (Cotton) Fitzsimmons, 72, ranked 10th on the NBA career coaching list with 832 victories in 29 seasons with Atlanta, Buffalo, Kansas City, San Antonio and Phoenix.
July 26: Ruben Gomez, 77, one of the first prominent Puerto Rican pitchers in the majors, was best known for his years with the Giants in New York and San Francisco.

July 27: Bob Tisdall, 97, won the gold medal in the 1932 Olympic hurdles.

Aug. 11: Joe Falls, 76, a sportswriter for the Detroit News and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He covered 50 World Series, 20 Kentucky Derbys, 15 Super Bowls, 20 Masters and U.S. Open golf tournaments and 25 Indy 500s, as well as Rose Bowls, Stanley Cups and NBA finals.
Aug. 12: Rosie Gacioch, 89, was a long-hitting outfielder and pitcher for the Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Baseball League from 1945 to 1954. The women's league inspired the 1992 film A League of Their Own. Known for her blunt way of speaking, she was appropriately portrayed in the movie by Rosie O'Donnell.
Aug. 14: Robert Howard, 28, the U.S. Olympic long jumper in 1996 and 2000. A medical student at the University of Arkansas, Howard leaped to his death from a dormitory, dressed in blood-splattered surgical scrubs. Police said the blood was that of his wife, Robin Mitchell, the chief neurosurgery resident at the medical school's teaching hospital and a former track star. Mitchell had been stabbed nearly 50 times. Howard left a rambling note apologizing for his perceived failures. There was no mention of having killed his wife, but investigators called the deaths murder-suicide.
Aug. 16: Ivan Hlinka, 54, was a star for the Czechoslovak national hockey squad, then was instrumental as a coach in building the Czech hockey team into a world power. He died of injuries suffered in a car crash just before the World Cup of Hockey. In a ceremony at the 2004 world championship in Prague, Hlinka was chosen as the best Czech player in history.

Sept. 2: Paul Shmyr, 58, played 511 games in the World Hockey Association, including 160 with the Edmonton Oilers, and 343 in the NHL with Chicago, Minnesota, Oakland and Hartford. He was the captain of the Oilers in 1979, their final season in the WHA.
Sept. 4: Moe Norman, 75, the colourful and eccentric legend of Canadian golf, was awkward and uncomfortable in social situations, but blessed with a talent to be the best ball-striker in the world. He won two Canadian Amateur championships and provincial opens in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Later, he won seven Canadian PGA Seniors Championships. The Royal Canadian Golf Association inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1995.
Sept. 19: Line Ostvold, 26, was the first Norwegian to win a World Cup snowboard event. He suffered fatal head and neck injuries in a fall during training in Chile.
Sept. 20: Brian Clough, 69, the eccentric, hard-drinking soccer manager, lifted Nottingham Forest from deep in England's second division in 1975 to win successive European Cups in 1979 and 1980, and he also won the league title with Forest and Derby.
Sept. 21: Larry Phillips, 62, was a stock-car racer whose 2,500 career wins included five Winston Racing Series championships. In one season, Phillips won 38 of the 40 Winston events.
Sept. 22: Ray Traylor, 42, wrestled as Big Boss Man, Big Bubba and Guardian Angel.
Sept. 23: Billy Reay, 86, had the most coaching wins behind the Chicago Blackhawks' bench. A Winnipeg native, Reay was a player with Detroit in 1943, but was dealt to Montreal after two seasons. In his eight-year stay in Montreal, Reay centred a line with Maurice (Rocket) Richard and played on two Stanley Cup teams (1946, 1953). He coached the Toronto Maple Leafs (1957-59) before leaving the coaching ranks for four years. He returned with the Blackhawks in 1963, spending 14 years behind their bench. He had six first-place finishes and reached three Stanley Cup finals.
Sept. 26: Dean Kutz, 48, overcame medical obstacles to ride 2,835 winners and win $33.6-million (U.S.) during almost 30 years at tracks in the U.S. upper midwest and Kentucky. His victories included the 1992 Phoenix Breeders' Cup aboard British Banker.

Oct. 2: Wayne Rutledge, 62, was a goaltender for the Los Angeles Kings in their first three NHL seasons. Rutledge shared the Kings' nets with Terry Sawchuk during the 1967-68 season. He later jumped to the WHA and played six seasons with Gordie Howe's Houston Aeros, winning two Avco Cup championships.
Oct. 2: Norm Schachter, 90, refereed the first Super Bowl and the first Monday Night Football game.
Oct. 3: John Cerutti, 44, the former Blue Jays pitcher who became a television analyst for the club, was found dead in his hotel room. Cerutti was Toronto's first-round draft pick, 21st overall, in 1981. He joined the Blue Jays in 1985 and spent six seasons with the club, helping it win American League East titles in 1985 and '89. He was the Jays' first winning pitcher in the SkyDome.
Oct. 6: Johnny Kelley, 97, a two-time Boston Marathon champion, became a beloved figure in the history of the race by running it a record 61 times.
Oct. 8: Johnny Sturm, 88, the starting first baseman on the New York Yankees' 1941 world championship team, was credited by many for alerting the team to a young prospect named Mickey Mantle.
Oct. 10: Ken Caminiti, 41, the 1996 National League most valuable player, admitted to taking steroids during a 15-year playing career. The three-time all-star struggled with alcohol and cocaine after he retired, and he died of a heart attack brought on by a drug overdose three years after retiring.

Nov. 3: Sergei Zholtok, 31, Latvia's star forward, who played 588 NHL games in 10 years with stops at Boston, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Minnesota and Nashville, collapsed and died in an arena corridor during a game with his Riga 2000 team in Belarus.
Nov. 4: Jimmy (Baby Face) McLarnin, 96, was one of boxing's greatest welterweights. He was the welterweight champion of the world in the 1930s. Born in Belfast, but raised in Vancouver, McLarnin fought 15 world champions in his 77-fight career from 1924 to 36, including Tony Canzoneri, Barney Ross, Benny Leonard and Young Corbett III. He had a record of 62 wins (20 knockouts), three draws and one no-decision against 11 losses.
Nov. 8: Lennox Miller, 58, brought Jamaica the 100-metre silver medal from the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and a bronze medal from Munich in 1972. The relay gold of daughter Inger Miller in 1996 made them the first father-daughter Olympic medalist combination in track and field.

Full text: Montreal's Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre Company
? Bryna Wasserman strives to maintain her calm as she directs the actors and technicians during a harried, last-minute dress rehearsal. Standing in the front row of the theatre, overseeing a run through of ,one of two plays the company is preparing to perform, Wasserman's sense of urgency is fairly understandable. The company that bears the name of her mother, Dora Wasserman, must work with just a few hours of tech rehearsal to get their act together. Standing at just over five feet tall, hands clenched together, the petite powerhouse Wasserman hurries her cast members off the stage in preparation for setting up the next scene.
It could be any theatre company in the throes of impending opening-night mayhem, but this scene was playing itself out in a different context. Wasserman was directing the Sholem Aleichem play in Vienna's Akzent Theatre, marking her company's second trip to the city in four years to perform theatre in Yiddish.
Invited by Kurt Rosenkranz, the founder of Vienna's Judisches Institut, Wasserman and 38 cast and crewmembers staged two excellent examples of Yiddish theatre, despite the deadline frenzy. As well as ,written by the famous Yiddish writer Aleichem (upon whose stories was based), the troupe performed (Green Fields), a light romantic comedy by Peretz Hirshbein.
Both are musicals and were written in Yiddish, but the similarities stop there. Though has some entertaining moments, it was that offered substantive intrigue and points of connection for the audiences, a good proportion of who were members of Vienna's Jewish community.
Set in Czarist Russia, the play's story involves two men, one Jewish and the other Gentile (played by Ben Mazor and Elan Kunin respectively), who trade identities for a time in order to pursue romantic interests. As a result, the Gentile learns of the hardships faced by Jewish citizens. The play couldn't help but touch audiences in the middle of Vienna, in particular the Jews who attended. "I couldn't really hold back my tears," one Jewish woman told me as she exited the theatre after the opening-night performance of . In particular, she said she'd responded to a song sung in the final moments of the play, after the Rabbi character (played by Montreal lawyer Pinchas Blitt) warns of the possible threat that could soon face the Jews. In the staging of these final eerily prescient moments, Wasserman has the walls of the set move slowly inwards towards the cast who are singing. This final bit of movement suggested an ominous sense of the world closing in on this theatrical representation of European Jewry.
As successful as the shows have proven, with almost-sold-out houses, favourable press from the Viennese critics and audience members left (Yiddish for choked up; overwhelmed) in wake, Wasserman explains that the road to Vienna was not a simple one for her troupe. The invite came from Rosenkranz, 75, after he visited Montreal and saw the company perform. While there are other Yiddish theatre companies -- including ones based in New York, Poland, Romania and Israel -- Rosenkranz argues that "the company in Montreal is the best in the world."
But upon receiving the initial invite, Wasserman says not everyone in the company was entirely thrilled about the prospect of venturing to Austria, a place where Yiddish was virtually wiped out by the Nazis during the Second World War. Prior to Hitler's invasion, Vienna had been home to 200,000 Jews, many of them fluent in Yiddish. The city had at least 30 synagogues (the Nazis left one standing, only because fire marshalls warned them that if it were burned down, the fire would threaten adjacent buildings), and two Yiddish theatre companies. The city had been a centre of Jewish cultural, political, religious and intellectual life. Sigmund Freud produced most of his oeuvre here; Theodor Herzl wrote his landmark article on Zionism, The Jewish State, in the city in 1896, making Vienna the birthplace of political Zionism. Today's Vienna stands in sharp contrast: the city's Jewish population is approximately 8,000.
Montreal's Jewish community has the third largest Holocaust survivor population in the world; thus many of the troupe feel directly touched by the war, either through relatives or, in some cases, by their own experiences. Pinchas Blitt, lawyer by day, Yiddish theatre performer by night, was a young child during the war years, when his family hid out in the Ukrainian forest to evade the Nazis. When the concept of taking a show to Vienna came up four years ago, Blitt says he wasn't entirely against the idea. But, he tells me through a flowing white beard, he did pipe up at a meeting, discussing his sense that the Austrian people had still not come to terms with their past as collaborators in the Holocaust. "I wasn't necessarily against going to Austria," Blitt explains. "But I wanted my fellow actors to know where we were going. To understand exactly what it is we might be facing, and the kind of people who do live there, and what some of their attitudes still are."
Still, Wasserman managed to convince her troupe of the significance of such a trip. The very act of performing Yiddish in a place where the language was almost completely extinguished through genocide, she argued, would be inherently radical.
Bolstering her argument was the company's invitee, Rosenkranz himself, a survivor who founded his institute as a means of educating Gentile Austrians about Jewish people and culture. Rosenkranz began his institute in 1991 after guiding a tour through one of the city's synagogues. It was at this point, he recalls, that he felt the calling to educate people about Jewish culture. "It hit me then that this was why I'd survived."
Still, many in the company still seemed a bit queasy about the venture. "We decided our trips to Vienna would be tours. [A Yiddish word translating roughly as "in your face."]We wanted to illustrate that this language is still very much alive, which has always been part of our mandate."
While the company did maintain their focus, pulling their shows off with a great deal of finesse, it's fair to say that Austria's historical role in the Holocaust hung over the trip like a bad stench. The crew and cast find themselves discussing their feelings about encountering the often chilly and crusty Austrians, notorious for maintaining a certain social distance. Not knowing entirely what to expect, members of the troupe find a few of their worst suspicions about contemporary Austria confirmed during the tour.
Driving on a tour through the Austrian countryside, Aaron Gonshor, an actor with the troupe who's an oral surgeon by day, says he found himself in an uncomfortable historical debate with their tour guide. "Someone on the bus was mentioning that they understood was not a particularly popular film in Austria," says the mustachioed Gonshor, looking a wee bit like a Marx Brother. The driver then proceeded to explain that the depictions of Austrians as Nazi collaborators was off-putting to much of the Austrian public, seeing as 60 per cent of Austrians were opposed to Hitler's arrival in the country.
"I'm not sure what was worse," Gonshor says. "His defensiveness or his complete rewriting of history." (The history books are quite clear about Austrian complicity in Hitler's campaign; when faced with a referendum on Hitler's burgeoning empire in 1938, 96 per cent of Austrians responded favourably to the dictator's advance into Austria.)
But the nastiest moment came for Jack Ossof, who plays a vagabond in . Heading to a tavern one night after a show, Ossof brushed up against a few skinheads. "As they came closer, we realized that they had shaved heads and black boots on. They were stomping on the pavement and chanting '!' over and over again -- I couldn't believe my eyes."
While Wasserman is clearly pleased with her company and their theatrical output, she concedes she would have liked to have brought a more politically risqué piece of work to Vienna. Originally, she had envisioned bringing the company's production of Jon Marans's 1996 two-hander, . Set contemporarily in Vienna, the play artfully raises questions of both Jewish identity and Austrian complicity in the war.
Rosenkranz felt differently. "It's a provocation for Austrians, this play. The Canadians can't really understand this. For Montreal audiences this would be something special. Not for those in Vienna. Austrian audiences want to laugh, to cry, but they don't want a confrontation." Rosenkranz insists this is not a case of self-censorship, despite the fact that his organization receives all of its funding from government coffers.
The differing tastes in plays pointed up a slight rift between the Austrian Jews and Canadian Jews in terms of what they felt would be an appropriate way to address Austria's past today, while performing in Yiddish.
"What Kurt [Rosenkranz]has in mind, I don't know," Blitt says. "He knows the situation in Vienna better than I do, obviously. But I suspect that if you're afraid to say what you want, then something is wrong, something is not kosher, something is not right.
"What's the point of freedom, of putting on a show, if you can't say what's really on your mind?"

Full text: Nordic skiing is experiencing a surge in popularity among
Ever since Norwegian-Canadian ski legend Jackrabbit Johannsen marked out the Maple Leaf Ski Trail north of Montreal in the 1930s, Canada has steadily increased rights-of-way through endless forests so Nordic skiers could kick and glide to their hearts' content. Cross-country skiing is now the fastest-growing winter sport in the country, as baby boomers take to its unbeatable cardiovascular benefits, its ability to burn calories and the innate and deep pleasure of flying through forests in midwinter. Not by accident is the Calgary-based Loki Ski Club named after the Norse god of fun and mischief. This is a work-hard, play-hard sport, with excellent trails within an hour or two of many of the country's city centres. Ontario Who would imagine that just 120 kilometres north of Toronto are some of Canada's best Nordic ski trails? The three H's: Hardwood Hills, Horseshoe Valley and Highlands Nordic have perfected the art of a well-made trail. Hardwood and Highlands make snow, and all three have rentals, day lodges, accommodation, instruction and Jackrabbit ski programs for kids. (Named after Johannsen, the program has taught thousands of Canadian kids how to ski.) Each of the three H's is reliable, with its own microclimate that produces white stuff even when fields nearby lie snowless.
Horseshoe Valley is where I cut my teeth Nordic skiing 30 years ago, and just the name brings back memories of amazing descents and long, corridor-like trails perfect for honing technique. It has a child-friendly cafeteria upstairs and is not nearly as pretentious as its alpine sister across the road.
Hardwood Hills, just 5 kilometres away, is a cross-country skier's dream. The trails are challenging: Blast down Waterfall and the Bowl for starters, then climb Stairway to Hell (I mean Heaven) and see if there's anything left of your lungs. This is a great place to people watch over lunch as skiers crowd into the cafeteria to discuss the day's best wax.
Highlands Nordic has another set of fantastic trails. While they aren't as extensive, at the top of the escarpment the view can't be beat. The S-shaped trails are cut wide for beginners, but can be great fun cornering. Highlands Nordic also has fantastic food -- everything is homemade, as if you'd wandered into someone's farm kitchen.
To the novice, Nordic skiing, with its proliferation of tight Lycra outfits, waxing lingo and equipment that can rival that of alpine gear in price, may seem intimidating. But this is a sport that goes back thousands of years, to when a couple of Scandinavians tied strips of wood to their feet, grabbed two branches and glided through the forests. Today, these "classic" skis have evolved into slim, lightweight numbers but are still used in the traditional manner of kicking and gliding in a parallel motion.
Skate skis came about when American Olympic skier Billy Koch realized he went a lot faster if he used a sideways skating motion instead of kicking. These skis use a different kind of track, as the path through the woods must be wide enough to accommodate a sideways glide. Ski areas should specify whether they provide classic or skating trails or both.
A little farther but worth it are the trails on the beautiful Bruce Peninsula, about 2½ hours north of Toronto.
The Sawmill Trails in Hepworth are 10 kilometres of pure magic (skating and classic). Here you can fly down The Chute, Freefall or Double-By-Pass, or climb Heart Attack Hill.
Near the town of Wiarton, the Colpoys Bay route follows old wagon and logging trails. It is an excellent starter route, but provides no shelter so pack extra clothes, food, water and a map.
On the Lake Huron side of the peninsula, the stunning 15-km Red Bay wilderness trail offers plenty of dips and doodles.
In Arrowhead Provincial Park, three hours north of Toronto, the volunteers of the Arrowhead Nordic Ski Club have resurrected the Muskoka Loppet, which was once Southern Ontario's premier Nordic race/tour. After years off the calendar, this 30-km classic event (4 km for kids) returns on Jan. 12. British Columbia If there is snow (and there isn't any yet), Hollyburn Ridge in Cypress Provincial Park, just 40 mintues from Vancouver, has 35 kilometres of skate and classic trails including a number of lit trails for night skiing. The three best things about this place are its location, the quality of the trails and the 100 years of skiing history packed into the beautiful old walls of its Hollyburn Lodge.
Manning Provincial Park is a mountain wonderland with 32 km of trails (skating and classic), just three hours east of Vancouver. The best way to go to Manning is with a ski package from Vancouver's Sigge's Sports Villa. Why worry about navigating mountain passes in a lone automobile when there's a luxury bus heading there every Sunday from Vancouver? And everyone on Sigge's staff knows how to pour wine and serve cheese on the bus for the trip home.
Sigge's also sends buses every other Saturday to the Lost Lake trails in Whistler. These trails are at their best in January and February, so don't miss the Lost Lake Shuffle Jan. 18, a four-hour enduro-relay, and the Fairmont-Chateau Whistler Cup on Feb. 9 that offers 15- or 30-km race/tours.
To get away from the frenzy of the mountain, put on your skinny skis and start up at the 8-km Lost Lake Loop, switch to Cedar Way, and then Upper Fairways. It's a couple of kilometres of climbing, but worth the lactic acid. The view -- you are on the edge of Blackcomb -- is spectacular. Alberta There are a number of excellent, accessible trails in Banff. Access Spray Trails (skating and classic) behind the Banff Springs Hotel Conference Centre. After 5 km of varied terrain, there is a turn-off heading back to Banff. If you go straight for 4 km, you meet Goat's Creek Trail (an 18-km classic), which leads to Spray Lake Road outside Canmore. It's a gorgeous climb, but if you don't have someone waiting for you at the other end, you may not be found again.
Heading west along the Bow River from the Banff library, there is plenty of wonderful skiing on Sundance Trail that eventually winds into the woods, but it's best on windless days. Cascade Fire Road (skating and classic) on Lake Minnewanka is the trail where Francis Frost was killed by a cougar in 2001 while skiing here, so ski with a buddy -- a good idea no matter where you are.
The Banff trails are free, as are the 150 km of classic trails in the Kananaskis mountain range, 150 km southwest of Calgary. My favourites start at Pocaterra Day Lodge (which offers shelter, fireplace and washrooms but no concession, so pack a big lunch). It is easy to get turned around here, so pay attention to maps and drink enough water to stay hydrated. None of these trails have "sweepers" at the end of the day.
Outside of the parks is Canmore Nordic Centre, 100 km west of Calgary, which hosted the 1988 Olympic cross-country events. If you like ups and downs, this place is for you: There is no such thing as a flat trail among the centre's 55 kilometres. Facilities include a day lodge, cafeteria, ski store, rentals and lessons. A trail pass is $5.
Lake Louise is a little farther to drive, three hours west of Calgary, but has snow even when other areas are still brown. Nordic skiers have been logging kilometres on Moraine Lake Road and the old Highway 1A since mid-November. These two trails are on opposite sides of the Lake Louise road, but are tied together by another twisting trail system. Moraine Lake is 9 km of steady but beautiful climbing, groomed for classic and skating, with a great view of the Valley of the Ten Peaks at the top. Wrap a warm jacket around your waist to wear for the descent -- it's fast, fabulous and chilly. Six kilometres down on the left side of Moraine Lake is the entrance for the Fairview Trail. This 5-km classic trail winds through the woods and ends at Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise. The Upper Telemark that winds behind the Chateau is a 4-km classic track that crosses the IA trail and becomes the Lower Telemark for another 6 km. Both have exciting descents and fast corners to keep you on your toes. Quebec La Belle Province is the granddaddy of Nordic skiing, the province where Jackrabbit Johannsen marked the Maple Leaf Trail. His legacy still lives on in thousands of kilometres of trails today, most of which are free or cost a small fee. The old rail line that starts just north of Montreal and goes to Mont-Tremblant is groomed for skiing, with networks of trails shooting off it providing endless possibilities.
One place to pick up this incredible trail is Domaine-St. Bernard, just outside Mont-Tremblant. The lodge used to be a monastery and is still complete with a stable, great dining and wine, and lots of charm.
Imagine 295 km of skating and classic trails with warming huts every 5 km -- that's what Gatineau Park offers just minutes from Ottawa. Start at the Old Chelsea/Camp Fortune Visitor's Centre entrance where there are also cafés and Greg Christie's Skiworks for rentals, trail passes, instruction and pro shop. Hit the park during mid-February's Winterlude to participate in the winter triathlon (running, skating, Nordic skiing) or the Keskinada Loppet (10 km-55 km skating or classic), Feb. 14-16. Newfoundland and Labrador This part of the country is almost guaranteed to have early snow, and Labrador City has world-class ski trails (both World Cups and World Championships have been held here).
For a real change in direction, go north and east and check out the 35 km of fabulous skating and classic trails at Menihek (Montagnais for "challenging trail") Nordic Ski Club. There's night skiing on Vello's Trail; Koch's Delight and The Hole are for experts; and beginners can try out Dumbell Tour and The Birches. On March 29, the Great Labrador Loppet will be held here.

Full text: Fires continue to burn out of control in northern Quebec, belching out an acrid cloud of smoke that reached all the way to Corner Brook and Gander, Nfld., on Wednesday.
Fires continue to burn out of control in northern Quebec, belching out an acrid cloud of smoke that reached all the way to Corner Brook and Gander, Nfld., on Wednesday.
Environment Canada says shifting winds are now blowing the smoky haze that has shrouded much of the East Coast of North America in the past few days eastward to Newfoundland - about 1,200 kilometres from the 25 fires that still rage in Quebec, six of them out of control.
New Brunswick's chief medical officer also repeated a health alert for a third day Wednesday, warning that the smoke - which is expected to linger for at least another day - could affect children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems.
Although one summer camp for children with asthma near Fredericton sent its children home, a spokesman for New Brunswick Health and Wellness said that no illnesses related to the smoke have been reported.
"We've seen some scattered incidents of people who came to emergency rooms, but those were mostly people with pre-existing conditions such as heart problems," Don Richardson told globeandmail.com. "We're hoping that's because people have heeded the chief medical officer's warnings."
About 500 firefighters, with 16 water bombers and 50 helicopters, some borrowed from other jurisdictions, are battling the Quebec blazes. During the past week, the fires have blackened about 244,000 hectares of timber, an area more than four times the size of the island of Montreal.
A change in weather overnight dropped a few millimetres of rain and blew away some smoke - but not enough to cool the worst hot spot, about 1,000 kilometres northeast of Montreal, a spokeswoman for the Quebec agency responsible for forest-fire prevention said.
"It's got a little better," Charlotte Léger said. "The biggest ones, they can't do anything about that. It's too hot."
Firefighters' attempts to stamp out the biggest blaze have had little effect, she said, because the intense heat swirls the skies so turbulently that planes cannot pass and evaporates water before its hits the burning wood.
The news wasn't all grim - the 650 residents of the Cree villages of Nemaska and Chisasibi in northern Quebec near James Bay, the only populated areas threatened by the flames, headed home after the province lifted a state of emergency on Wednesday.
Nemaska's Chief George Wapachee said the fire danger has lessened because there just is nothing left to burn - his village is the only green spot in the area.

Full text: Massive fires continue to rage in northern Quebec Tuesday, destroying so much timber that forestry companies laid off thousands of workers and belching out smoke that blankets several provinces and U.S. states.
Massive fires continue to rage in northern Quebec Tuesday, destroying so much timber that forestry companies laid off thousands of workers and belching out smoke that blankets several provinces and U.S. states.
A few millimetres of rain sprinkled overnight on the worst hot spot, about 1,000 kilometres northeast of Montreal, but it wasn't enough to stem the advancing blaze. There are now 34 fires - eight out of control - that are ripping through the province's stands of grey pine, black forest pine, spruce and other evergreens. More than 267,000 hectares of forest have been destroyed during the past week.
About 500 firefighters, with 16 water bombers and 50 helicopters, are battling the fires, but water bombers have had almost no effect on some of the biggest blazes, where the heat is so intense that the water turns to steam before it hits the embers.
Two of the worst fires each stretch over more than 100,000 hectares, or 1,000 square kilometres - an area more than twice as large as the Island of Montreal.
Last night's rain had a slight impact, but firefighters don't expect any real relief from the weather until Thursday, said a spokeswoman for the province's forest protection services.
"[The rain]did help them get closer to the big ones, so it's a little easier to work on the fire, but they're waiting for more rain in two days," Charlotte Léger told globeandmail.com.
Timber giants Abitibi-Consolidated, Domtar Inc. and about 23 other forestry companies have been forced to temporarily lay off 6,000 workers because they can't get into the affected areas, which have been closed by the provincial government.
The fires have created an enormous cloud of gray haze as wide as 400 kilometres that has blocked the sun as far east as the Maritimes and south to Washington, D.C.
A number of communities have issued health warnings, including Quebec City and St. John, N.B., warning children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems to stay indoors.

Smoke heads for Maritimes

Full text: Thick black smoke caused by forest fires that covered most of Quebec and clouded New York's skyline over the weekend is now headed to the Maritimes because of winds from the west.
Thick black smoke caused by forest fires that covered most of Quebec and clouded New York's skyline over the weekend is now headed to the Maritimes because of winds from the west.
"Over Montreal, and in the west of the province, it has cleared," Charlotte Leger, a spokeswoman for the forest-fire protection agency in Quebec, told globeandmail.com on Monday.
She said, however, that the provincial forest fire service has received reports of a haze over Quebec City and is still receiving calls from U.S. border states, although it is nothing like it was over the weekend.
Health officials in Montreal and in the entire state of New York state issued air-quality alerts for those with respiratory problems.
Because winds changed Monday, smoke is now drifting into the Maritime provinces.
Environment Canada has issued an advisory saying the smoke is already drifting across northern New Brunswick and will likely hit Prince Edward Island later Monday.
A spokesman said the smoke will result in reduced visibility and poor air quality.
Ms. Leger said there are still 33 active fires raging across the province, nine of them out of control.
Another six fires are being held by perimeters, she said.
"All of them are situated north in the province," Ms. Leger said.
The most severe one is north of Lac St-Jean, and has blackened about 650 square kilometres of forest.
In total this year, more than 200,000 hectares have been blackened in the province, she said.
On Monday, more than 500 firefighters were attacking the fires with water bombers whenever they had the chance, she said.
"It depends on the heat of the fire. The out-of-control ones, when the heat is so intense, it makes turbulence in the air, and you can't go overhead."
She said the 18 water bombers, along with more than 40 helicopters, will continue to fight the northern fires this week, being careful to observe the heat and smoke before heading in to drop water.
Hot, dry weather conditions are expected to continue until at least Thursday, Ms. Leger said.
"We really need a good rain."
In Saskatchewan, a fire that came within kilometres of Prince Albert is now under control.

Full text: Residents in the northern Saskatchewan community of Montreal Lake have been allowed to return home after a raging forest fire threatened their safety earlier this week.
Residents in the northern Saskatchewan community of Montreal Lake have been allowed to return home after a raging forest fire threatened their safety earlier this week.
Just over 140 people were allowed to return to their homes in Montreal Lake late Wednesday, Saskatchewan Social Services spokesman Doug Wakabayaski told globeandmail.com on Thursday. They had been staying at a college campus in Prince Albert since the blaze got dangerously close to their community on Monday.
The fire damaged a house in the area as well as some logging equipment. Several other homes had smoke damage.
The 558-hectare blaze is not under control, but fire crews are making progress, John Cook, spokesman for Saskatchewan's provincial forest fire centre in Prince Albert, told globeandmail.com on Thursday.
More than 130 firefighters are working on the fire but continue to face dry conditions.
"It is very, very dry," he said. "There is no rain in the forecast."
Saskatchewan Environment urges residents to use extra caution in the extremely dry conditions.
In Alberta, a forest fire about 130 kilometres south of Fort McMurray and 80 kilometres north of Lac La Biche continued to burn Thursday. The fire, still considered out of control, continued to cover an area about 70,000 hectares, said Terry Cunha, spokesman for Alberta Sustainable Resource Development.
"There has been no significant growth [in the fire]" Mr. Cunha told globeandmail.com on Thursday.
Just over 500 firefighters continue to battle the fire, 70 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide at it widest point, which started on Friday.
Fire crews faced warmer temperatures and lower winds on Thursday but there was no rain in the forecast.
"Hopefully we will get some precipitation in the area," Mr. Cunha said.

Full text: A forest fire has forced about 100 people from their homes in a northern Saskatchewan community.
A forest fire has forced about 100 people from their homes in a northern Saskatchewan community.
Residents living near Montreal Lake, about 250 kilometres north of Saskatoon, were forced from their community Monday and are now staying at a college campus in Prince Albert, about 100 kilometres south, Saskatchewan Social Services spokesman Doug Wakabayashi told globeandmail.com Tuesday.
Residents from nearby smaller communities were also told to leave their homes, he said, adding that in total, less than 200 people have been ordered out.
No injuries have been reported. Fire officials are assessing the situation to determine when the residents will be allowed back home, Mr. Wakabayashi said.
The fire started after 1 p.m. Monday afternoon on the north end of Bittern Lake and burned through the forest toward Montreal Lake. The exact cause of the fire is unknown, but it is believed to be "human caused," John Cook, spokesman for Saskatchewan's provincial forest fire centre in Prince Albert, told globeandmail.com Tuesday. "That fire is not yet under control," he said.
Fire crews are are being assisted by six air tankers, three helicopters, six bulldozers, conservation officers and the RCMP, Mr. Cook said.
He said strong winds made the flames spread and change direction several times. Warm temperatures and dry conditions are added factors in the blaze, he added.
Fire crews in the province faced three other fires over the Victoria Day weekend, but the Montreal Lake fire affected the most people, he said.
As of Monday, Saskatchewan had reported 209 fires for the year, down from 242 fires during the same time last year, Mr. Cook said, but added that this year the fire count was still far above the five-year average of 141.
"Last year we had a busy spring," he said.
In Alberta, a forest fire near Fort McMurray died down enough on Tuesday to allow officials to reopen the main highway to the northeastern Alberta city.
Traffic is flowing in both directions, but Angela McGonigal, spokeswoman for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, warned that the the highway could be closed again if the fire flares up.
"Conditions can change so rapidly," Ms. McGonigal told globeandmail.com.
About 350 firefighters, facing high winds and heavy smoke, are battling the blaze, which is still burning and has spread to an area 70,000 hectares in size. The fire is burning about 130 kilometres southeast of Fort McMurray, said Barb Toker, spokeswoman with the Forest Protection Division in Fort McMurray.
"The fire is currently out of control," she told globeandmail.com. "We're dealing with erratic fire conditions."
Crews are using 34 helicopters and two air-tanker units and bulldozers to fight the fire, about 400 kilometres north of Edmonton.
Another fire that destroyed a home and a cabin and forced 70 families to flee is reported still to be burning near Smoky Lake.

British Columbia Gordon Campbell and his Liberals shook down the NDP from the legislature and left them only a slim two pickings, vowing to take the province into Harris and Klein country. But the province, which is already in the economic doldrums, faced immediate pressure as it saw a $5-billion deficit looming in the horizon. Its nurses threatened mass resignations, so it passed an anti-strike bill, and for good measure brought down a vicious civil servant work force cut of one-third. A too, too long transit strike hit the region, which left commuters trying to find alternate routes and methods. Southern British Columbia was rattled on April 30, and left waiting for the Big One to strike after an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit the region, the most powerful in 50 years. And, of course, a marijuana tea house opened shop.
Alberta Two girls, one lost, the other found. One snatched away, the other wandered out into the backyard. Albertans will remember Jessica Koopmans, the five-year-old from Lethbridge, whose body was found in a field after she disappeared from her home in May. A family friend later became the prime suspect. Then there was baby Erika who, just reaching past the year mark, found her way out into the -17 cold. Several hours later, she was found, frozen solid. After several days, she was hailed the miracle baby, who was expected to walk again, and attracted world-wide attention. Ralph's world took a roller coaster ride, as Premier Ralph Klein, high on another provincial election victory, visited Washington as a strong oilman, then plunging into the terror of self admission when his drinking habit got the best of him at a homeless shelter. Mr. Klein admitted his problem, asked for forgiveness and, in the poll of public opinion, was on his way up again. Saskatchewan The fields were scalded a rusty gold, its water was tainted in one town, and it bid goodbye to a long-time Premier. The growing season across southern Canada was its driest in 34 years. The effects were felt especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, with some districts weathering their second or third year of water shortages. Farmers took to the streets, many hit Ottawa, but most saw their plights ignored. Percy Schmeiser lost his case over genetically modified canola to biotechnology giant Monsanto Co. after a court ruled he infringed the company's patent. Robert Latimer entered jail this year after the nation's high court, showing little mercy, ruled that the farmer must serve at least 10 years for the murder of his severely disabled daughter Tracey. NDP Premier Roy Romanow formally stepped down from his post, Lorne Calvert took over, and his NDP-Liberal coalition was forced to face a no-confidence vote (they won). Mr. Calvert called for an inquiry, perhaps taking a lesson from Ontario's Harris, immediately after North Battleford reported an outbreak of cryptosporidium that made a wary public frightened to drink tap water.
Manitoba The province ended the year on a sad note, saluting a fallen Mountie. At the legislature, the famous Golden Boy atop the building was covered up, then they decided to take him down for repairs after workers found a structural support post corroded. Inside, 35 farmers spent a night in March in protest of inadequate support from the federal government. The province saw fit to lift restrictions on liquor laws, and let stores and outlets sell alcohol on Sunday, while federal Health Minister Allan Rock, after legalizing marijuana use for medical treatment, toured a government sanctioned growing operation in Flin Flon, housed in a mine shaft. The province was hit by its own animal scare, culling 1,200 sheep in the south as a precaution against the spread of scrapie, a nervous disorder similar to mad-cow disease but believed harmless to humans. Thomas Sophonow was recommended to get $2.6-million for "crushing" injuries and lost opportunities resulting from his wrongful conviction in the strangling death of a vivacious Winnipeg teenager 20 years ago, and Manitoba's share was $1-million.
Ontario Before Windsor became occupied with the long lineups clogging trade routes into Detroit, it was on the lookout for dead birds, a sign of a U.S. invasion of the West Nile virus. Crazy, you'd say, but then again, t'was a summer in which the Snowbirds went down near London, Mike Harris took the stand in Walkerton and a judge slapped parents in Aylmer for doing the same to their kids. Oh yeah, and then the bugs invaded Toronto. In an almost unprecedented move, the Premier and his so-called 'common sense revolution' took the stand in the Walkerton inquiry, which was probing the deaths and illnesess caused by E.coli bacteria. He later, more surprisingly, decided to announce he was leaving politics. But not before privatizing Hydro One and setting up a leadership race that could dwarf the Canadian Alliance campaign. West Nile was the talk, with dead blue jays and crows being spotted from Windsor to Ottawa, bring fears that the virus that killed some in New York City was here. It was a hot summer, with lava-like temperatures, leading to the invasion of green aphids on Toronto streets, forcing people to cover up or eat insects. Storyboy, no relation to Quebec's Mafiaboy hacker, saw his charges dropped, after drawing national attention in 2000 by spending 35 days in jail for writing about a bullied student who blows up his school. In Aylmer, Ont., family of an ultraconservative fundamentalist church made headlines over parents' right to discipline their children. And in a sign that some higher power was with them, in nearby London, Ont. our own Snowbirds were involved in a midair collision during a publicity flight sending one jet into Lake Erie but no one died. Quebec Lucien Bouchard gave up the reins, and Bernard Landry took over, only to infuriate the federalists. Quebec City got the chance to host the Summit of the Americas in April, trying to fence out those who wanted to get in. Arrests were made, baseball bats were confiscated and when the event actually took place, the war of words changed into a live, made-for-TV cat-and-mouse game. A tear gas canister would fly through the air, with the speed and arc of a football thrown by a to-be-sacked quarterback. Then it would replay, reverse angle. Fences were torn, declarations were made, marches were completed, agreements signed. In the end, no declared victor, but the post-Seattle movement seemed stymied at the borders, only to set its sights on Kananaskis, Alta., for next year's G8 summit. Quebeckers watched the saga of Maurice (Mom) Boucher, a biker chieftain facing 15 murder charges, whose latest episode a $30-million lawsuit against Mr. Landry and other public figures to re-establish his honour. He saw the police swoop in on his organization, make arrests, and ever since, he's been described as 'lonely.' The province trumpted their specially built courthouse, attached to a prison through an underground passageway. In Montreal, it was all show when 2,000 posed nude for New York artist Spencer Tunick outside the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art. And finally, and sadly, Quebec, Canada and the world lost Mordecai Richler, who gave the world such novels as and . Nova Scotia The nurses stood up and the government backed down, and it's fair to say the nurses won. In a year in which provinces and nurses stood off, the nurses in Nova Scotia got the politicians to back off on Bill 68, which would have given cabinet the right to impose a settlement and outlaw their right to strike. The union staged wildcat walkouts and threatened mass resignations. The community in Lunenburg mourned the loss of the St. John's Anglican Church that rang its bells for nearly 250 years after it was hit by fire, believed to be sparked by arson on Halloween night. In Stewiacke, a Via train derailed and a youth was charged with mischief endangering the lives of 123 people. A $35 lock would have prevented the accident, officials said later. Cape Breton coal miners ended an era this year, as the Prince mine shut down after the industry began more than two centuries in the Sydney area. The provinces hopes that one of the industry's legacies, the infamous Sydney tar ponds, would create jobs with a cleanup project started this year, likely to cost as much as $800-million.
New Brunswick He grew up in New Brunswick, but didn't survive . The doctors walked out. Civil servants were banned from personal Internet use. And Brunt Church didn't erupt, but the forests did. Late in the year, E. coli hit the province, claiming the life of a 23-month-old boy in Saint John. And in a historic referendum, voters chose by a narrow margin to keep their video lottery terminals. The referendum was seen as a landmark decision in the controversy over the use of the machines that bring in more than $1.6-billion to eight provinces. The popular show got its first pseudo-Canadian import in Kelly Gleason, a U.S. Army intelligence officer who was born in the United States, moved to Fredericton when he was 2. He studied in elementary school and high school there. In Burnt Church, fisheries officials gave a limited communal lobster licence to the reserve. At one point in the summer, dozens of fires were burning in the tinder-dry province, including one covering 30 hectares, forcing people to leave their homes. And the doctors, after a three-day walkout, signed a contract giving them an average pay raise of 12 per cent over three years. Newfoundland and Labrador
If such races were counted, Newfoundland won a doozy. Wait, make that Newfoundland and Labrador, the new name of the province that helps it outletter former longest-titled heavyweight Prince Edward Island. Unfortunately, there's no word on whether the new name will be shortened to NAL, nowhere near the ring of PEI. Speaking of doing things big, bulk water, for a time, made national headlines when Premier Roger Grimes announced his intention to allow the export of billions of gallons of water from Gisborne Lake for export. Ottawa quickly poured cold water on the talk. Civil servants walked out en masse, timing their job action with a snowstorm, but got a hefty settlement. The community in Pouch Cove mourned the loss of three teenagers who died after playing on unstable ice in March. Newfoundland and Nova Scotia began a fight over boundary rights, specifically over 60,000-square-kilometre expanse of seabed. Finally, as December comes to a close, the curtain rises on the Hollywood version of centred on Kevin Spacey with Newfoundland - make that Newfoundland and Labrador - as its backdrop. Prince Edward Island Potato, potatoes, it's all the same to us, but for the United States it caused a lot of fuss. After prolonged battles, the United States scrapped import restrictions on most PEI spuds, bringing an end to a nine-month dispute with Canada over a small fungus outbreak that severely curbed exports of PEI's primary cash crop. It's been a bad year for the pie guy, you know, the man who pushed some tart in the Prime Minister's face at a Charlottetown fair. Evan Brown, a playwright who says he is a member of a loosely organized group called the PEI Pie Brigade, was given a 30-day sentence for the offence, then, after he arrived at the PEI correctional center, was punched by an inmate. No charges were laid.

Full text: To achieve Nordic nirvana on the doorsteps of Canada's
Nothing in the urban world compares with Canada's Nordic ski trails. They wind through forests, along streams, down mountain pitches, and take you soaring into valleys and flying onto plateaus.
Climb up to a vista, open the trail mix and water bottle with a group of friends, and then swoosh down the other side. Here's an assortment of trails that won't disappoint. Start your snow dance now. Near TorontoHardwood Hills: If Highway 400 is clear of snow, Torontonians can make it in less than two hours. It has a barn, wax horses, irons for waxing, snow-making equipment and 42 kilometres of trails with loops from three to 15 kilometres for both skating and classic styles. All trails except the recreational Pine Trail are challenging with hills such as the Elevator, Eliminator, Terminator, Black Hole, Waterfall, Stairway to Heaven, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Drawback? At $16.50, the trail fees are a little steep, considering there are many free public ski trails and some cross-country facilities charge as little as $4. But quality trail maintenance is guaranteed. Hardwood also attracts certain Type A skiers -- guys in Lycra who think every day is race day. Two of my fave guys to ski with there, Mike and Peter, are perfect examples. We arrive as early as possible, do a minimum of 40 kilometres, with our heart rates one beat below aerobic meltdown.
Snow is usually ready in early December and stays until the Spring Fling Relay (March 24). The Hardwood Hundred (25, 50 or 100 kms), which is also the Cancer Society Skiathon, is on March 3.
Horseshoe Resort: Ski trails here wind their way around the alpine centre. The hills are as impressive now as when I first skied them as a teenager. There are 35 kilometres of classic trails and a limited number of skating trails. The atmosphere is low-key compared with the testosterone-driven Hardwood scene nearby. The trails are narrow, pretty and wind through the Copeland Forest. Expert means expert, as the climbs and descents are hair-raising and fantastic.
Highlands Nordic: Farther from Toronto but worth the drive. Despite high-tech snow-making and grooming, it still feels rustic and homey. The 12-kilometre red trail winds up the Niagara Escarpment for a lung-bursting, nirvana-inducing state of mind. Once you hit the plateau, there's a beautiful agricultural area to wander through, followed by an S-turn descent that provides enough momentum to take you back to the lodge. The looped-trail system allows for mix and match. Start on the red, switch to blue, finish on yellow. All junctions are well marked. Great food. Don't miss the butter tarts.
Near Montreal/OttawaQuebec trails: Thanks to the European flavour of sports in Quebec and the influence of Norwegian legend Jack Rabbit Johannsen, the province is laced with thousands of kilometres of life-altering ski trails. Quebec has consistently put many Nordic skiers on national teams because trails are either free or nominally priced.
Every time I stay in Montreal, I jog over, skis in hand, to Mount Royal where the trails are beautiful, free, well-groomed and lit for night skiing. Trails in Quebec City are even more extensive, but it's the trails in the national and provincial parks that are so captivating.
Gatineau Park: Located outside Hull, it has 200 kilometres of trails, most providing skating and classic. The entire parkway is turned into groomed trails, with twisting, turning subtrails that wander into the woods. While this is skier's heaven, there are few amenities such as restaurants and lodges, though plenty of places to stay in the region.
Daily passes are available at the park's 16 parking lots and the visitor centre in Chelsea, all giving direct access to the trails. S easonal passes are $85. There's room to change into ski clothes at the visitor centre and eat a packed lunch. It has no food, but restaurants are nearby. The National Capital Commission has converted a barn into a waxing hut. While amenities aren't luxurious, there are four huts on the trails that provide a stove and wood. Grab a map to find them, and look for Keogan, Huron, Western and McKinstry Lodges when you want a trail break.
The park's biggest event is the Keskinada Loppet, an international tour/race that attracts thousands of skiers on Feb. 15-17.
Near CalgaryCanmore Nordic Centre: A mere 100 kilometres from Calgary, it is a legacy from the 1988 Olympics, so the trails meet international standards. None are flat, though I would rank the Banff Trail as beginner to intermediate. If you've just arrived, you'll also have to adjust to the altitude.
Stop at Books and Bagels on Canmore's Main Street for early breakfast. The service -- by spaced-out grunge kids -- is deplorable. But a delicious toasted bagel with cheese, and one of those mile-high muffins will take you up the steepest of climbs, and there's a great selection of books and magazines.
I enjoy skiing here, especially early in the season when the snow is artificial. But like Ontario's Hardwood Hills, it attracts its share of Type As, who suffer through stern training regimes, and never go to interesting films. Makes for limited conversation. The 70 kilometres of killer trails are poorly marked, so get a map.
Kananaskis Country: Come here for 160 kilometres of free trails. My favourites are in Peter Lougheed Park, where 97.2 kilometres wind around forests, streams and mountains. Take the Trans-Canada west from Calgary to Highway 40, which leads past Mount Allen, site of the 1988 Olympic alpine events, and Nakiska Ski Village. Eventually, the winter road ends at a gate, where you turn right to reach the Pocaterra entrance to the trails.
You've got to know how to ski here: There are no rentals, lessons or ski patrollers to search for your body. Pocaterra Lodge is a lovely chalet with washrooms, tables and chairs, but no refreshments or wax. Bring plenty of food and pay attention to where you are. With high altitudes and potentially very cold temperatures, fabulous downhills and plenty of junctions, it's easy to get lost when you're a little dehydrated or hypothermic. The temperature can rise by 10 Celsius degrees in one hour once the sun peaks above the mountains, so don't despair if it's -30 at 9:30 a.m. By 11, it could be a balmy -18.
Of all the great trails here, Fox Run is the most fun. As you funnel onto its narrow woodsy corridor, you've got plenty of speed from the last downhill.
Plan your visit so you can enter the Great Cookie Race, organized by Foothills Nordic Ski Club on Feb. 23 (24 or 42 kilometres with shorter distances for children). At checkpoints, there are homemade cookies, and at the finish there's a big tent with plenty of soup, hot chocolate and cookies.
Kananaskis Country Ski Trails Ski Trails in the Canadian Rockies Banff National Park: All trails are free. Despite the death of skier Frances Frost last year because of a cougar attack, the Cascade Fire Road Trail (either skating or classic skiing) is still a beauty. Head north from Banff and follow directions to Lake Minnewanka. Park where the road ends at a gate. Don't ski alone. Animal attacks are rare, but hypothermia, especially during mountain storms, is more common. It's five kilometres to the first bridge, with plenty of climbing, and nine more kilometres to the Stoney Creek Bridge, where the trail also splits to the left and ends at the warden's cabin. Incredible vistas.
My favourite quick ski, the Spray Trail, starts behind the Banff Springs Conference Centre and runs beside the Spray River for five kilometres, at which point you can turn left, cross the bridge and come back on the other side for another five kilometres. Plenty of ups and downs that aren't a problem as long as the trail is well-groomed. Sometimes people walk their dogs and wreck it. After your ski, saunter into the Banff Springs Hotel and head to the Rundle Café for nourishment and the view.
Get a map or tour leader for the Sundance Canyon Trail: You don't want to be lost in the bush. But check it out on the last Saturday in January when it's the final section of the Lake Louise-to-Banff Loppet and Relay, a 65-kilometre individual or team event sponsored by the Banff SkiRunners.
Lake Louise: And now for my true love, again at no cost. Moraine Lake Road is one of three trailheads, all with great skiing.
These trails, with my new skiing buddies, Harry, Bob, and Ross, are sweet. Our favourite route is to ski to the top of the road, which is eight kilometres, mainly climbing, see if we have a good view of Seven Peaks, zip up our jackets, pull our tuques securely over our ears, and bolt back down the hill. After skiing six kilometres back down, we hang left onto the classic Fairview Loop, which eventually leads to Chateau Lake Louise. We continue to loop back to Moraine Lake though, because there are two excellent downhills that take us flying through the forest. The trail spits us out onto the road again and we continue down to the bottom. Fairview is not quite five kilometres one-way. You can break it up and stop at the Chateau for a snack, or take the shorter and more gentle Tramline Trail back to Moraine Lake. Just look for the signs.
When you're famished after a day on the trails, grab a table at Laggan's Bakery in the Village of Lake Louise, and order one of everything including a sticky cinnamon bun. There is also the Lake Louise Hostel, which is considered the Hyatt of hostels -- café, kitchen, sauna, international skiers, fabulous loft with cozy couches where you can crash with a good book.
Near VancouverCypress Lake Provincial Park: A 40-minute drive from downtown Vancouver, the park offers 16 kilometres of ski trails. The temperature, which hovers around 0 C, makes for klister (wet snow) waxing conditions. But the trails are groomed for classic and skating at Hollyburn Ridge.
I'd stick to skating or use non-wax skis. Cross the Lion's Gate Bridge and then go north on Taylor Way and take the Upper Level highway to the Cypress Park turnoff. Continue about four kilometre to Hollyburn Ridge.
My Vancouver friends say this isn't their first choice. There's plenty of up and down, and potentially icy conditions, but the lit trails are perfect for after-work workouts. There's also a huge Jack Rabbit program for children.
Manning Provincial Park: It is at least a three-hour drive from the city, but is considered a paradise. Go east on the Trans-Canada to Hope and then follow Highway 3. As you climb 1,300 metres and move into an interior climate, the warm, wet stuff of the coast will transform into nice, cold, spiky snowflakes.
The best way to do this trip is with Sigge's Sports Villa, (604) 731-8818. Its day trips to the park commence the first Sunday in December and run through March. It will load up to three coaches, at a cost of $39 a person, which includes transportation and trail fee. If you're a beginner, for $79 you can have this, plus rentals and instruction. Frequent-user passes also available.
Whistler: Keep Saturday open to try B.C.'s best-kept secret -- the 29 kilometres of Lost Lake trails just north of Whistler (about 140 kilometres from Vancouver). Signs at the base of Blackcomb point to the trails, both skating and classic. Anders Bjorklund of Sigge's says these are the best trails within a day's drive of the city, but the season here is short, starting in January and usually wrapping up by the end of February. Don't miss the Chateau Whistler Loppet, Jan. 27, a 36-kilometre tour/race. Starting the beginning of January, Siegi's does Saturday Lost Lake trips. Call for trip updates and other information.
Waxing tips If you want to figure out where you should Nordic ski this winter, and what kind of skiing to do, just imagine you are a snowflake -- with six nice little spiky points that catch the wax on the bottom of skis.
That way, you can decide whether you will classic-ski, skate-ski or both. When the wax and the snowflakes are well matched, the little spikes dig into the wax and provide enough grip to kick the ski forward and glide over the water you make with the friction of your kick. This is classic skiing, and works best in cold or dry snow.
But, as moisture and temperature increases -- as is the case in Southern Ontario -- those nice little spikes become rounded. So, even when the temperature is -5 C, which means blue or blue special wax, they're acting as if they're only -2 C, which is blue extra, purple special, or even purple wax, or if you've switched to fluro-carbon waxes, VR 45 and VR50.
Or, if the snowflake has melted and now it's turned to granular ice, wax won't work at all, and that old sticky friend in a tube called klister must be used for a mucky grip.
Waxing nightmare? If you're not familiar with wax and snow, it can be, and that's why people in soggy Southern Ontario and Vancouver have taken up skate skiing, a motion that uses only glide wax, as opposed to grip wax, and can be learned by anyone who grew up on a pair of ice or in-line skates. All you need is a lesson or two and tree trunks for thighs. The beautiful old tradition of classic skiing -- with grip wax -- still works perfectly in the dry or colder areas in the North and West.
Don't let the waxing jargon intimidate you. I have logged most of my skiing kilometres on the humid trails of Southern Ontario, and the vast majority have been skating since 1985, when it became popular.

Full text: The journey has become the destination
Railway barons should forget freight and bring on the scenery. Passengers await. So perhaps do profits.
Luxury train travel, when it's done properly, makes the journey the destination and cultivates a kinship among travellers that can never be achieved in a claustrophobic airplane.
Here are some Canadian train trips to get your holiday on a roll: Whistler Northwind This 745-kilometre luxury passenger service was launched this month by Crown-owned BC Rail. Linking Vancouver with Prince George, it showcases the province's scenic heartland from the comfort of first-class rolling stock.
BC Rail is well placed to tap the multimillion-dollar market of affluent rail romantics. It already boasts a wide variety of passenger rail services and it owns its rail lines, meaning passenger services aren't treated as irritating interruptions of freight schedules. And BC Rail's lines run through some of the world's most diverse and spectacular scenery.
The nine-car, 220-passenger Northwind represents a $12-million start-up investment. It features three new $1.75-million dome coaches outfitted with wrap-around tempered-glass windows custom-built for BC Rail in Denver, Colo. The train also includes such refurbished classics as the 1939 Summit service club car built for the Florida East Coast Railroad and the Panorama club car built in 1954 for the Canadian National Railway.
The Northwind's inaugural run exposed a number of minor operating hiccups. It also revealed a dedication to restoring a sense of civilized community to the travel experience. The Northwind offers two levels of service: Summit and Panorama. Both begin and end in the dome cars.
The more expensive Summit service offers a higher level of hotel accommodation during stopovers in Whistler and 100 Mile House (both in B.C.) and exclusive use of the train's Summit club car. Meal service is also provided in the first-class Summit dining car. Panorama passengers are served at their dome car seats.
The Northwind menus feature local ingredients. Salmon, for example, on the initial 119-kilometre North Vancouver-to-Whistler leg; fresh produce, perhaps, from the Pemberton area at the outset of the 298-kilometre day two; beef and other Cariboo country staples on day three's 327-kilometre leg. Portions are small but quality and presentation are good.
Other train amenities are of uniformly high quality, from the linen and silverware table settings to the comfortable high-backed seats in the dome car and the lounge car armchairs.
The ride is Cadillac smooth, with a leisurely cruising speed of 32-40 km/h. Add in strains of Enya over the sound system and absolute tranquillity approaches. Bags, once checked in at the station, move seamlessly from train to hotel rooms and back. Staff service is courteous and obliging.
The scenery is spectacular and ever-changing. The train starts at sea-level in the fiord-like Howe Sound rain forest, heads to 608 metres above the Fraser River, then travels through high Cariboo country.
Veteran rail travellers prefer to view it in the open air by stepping out through the dutch doors on either side of the dome coach's vestibule. There's no better place to take in the arid majesty of the Fraser Canyon.
Historical highlights are provided in running commentaries from Northwind attendants. Sometimes too much; sometimes too little.
Overnight stays in Whistler and 100 Mile House allow a combination of daylight sightseeing from the train with such late afternoon and evening activities as horseback riding and mountain helicopter tours.
When: The Northwind is scheduled to run weekly through October.
Cost: Northbound trips are three-day, two-night affairs; prices run from $900 a person up to $1,375. Southbound land cruises are two-day, one-night trips. Ticket prices range from $600 to $1,100.
Other BC Rail trips: Cariboo Prospector trips link North Vancouver with Squamish, Whistler and Lillooet. The Royal Hudson steam train makes day trips between North Vancouver and Squamish.

Rocky Mountaineer Railtours Credit for reviving luxury train travel in Western Canada must go to Rocky Mountaineer Railtours. The company took over the Rocky Mountaineer Canadian Rockies service from Crown-owned Via Rail in March, 1990. Via had started the service two years earlier but its enthusiasm soon waned, and the Rockies route was tendered to the private sector. Rocky Mountaineer started with approximately 11,000 passengers in its first year; that number has increased by close to 700 per cent over the past 10 years. Last year, its annual customer total hit 75,000. Rocky Mountaineer Railtours is now the largest privately owned passenger rail operator in North America.
Its two-day, all-daylight rail adventure, which runs between Vancouver, Jasper or Banff and Calgary, follows a historic route built over 100 years ago through Western Canada and the Canadian Rockies.
Last year, the company pushed the opening of its season back to April from May; this year its fleet of GoldLeaf Service dome cars has been increased to 10 from eight with the addition of two new $3.4-million dome coaches. Rocky Mountaineer Railtours has twice been voted one of the 20 best rail experiences in the world by the International Railway Traveler.
When: Mid-April to mid-October. Winter tours are also available.
Cost: Spring rates for the two-day GoldLeaf tour start at $990 a person based on double occupancy.
Contact: Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (800) 665-7245. Web site: http://www.rockymountaineer.com. Epicurean Adventure Train Launched in late 2000, the three-day Epicurean Adventure Train (EAT) trip is a joint venture of the Oak Bay Beach Hotel & Marine Resort in Victoria, the Aerie Resort, (a 50-minute rail trip to the north), and Vancouver Island's E&N Railway. Starting from the Oak Bay hotel, the train travels through Vancouver Island's Malahat Mountains to the Aerie. The trip includes opportunities for kayaking, astronomy, dining and foraging for wild mushrooms.
When: Runs monthly all year round.
Cost: The package starts at $764 a person and is based on double occupancy. The train portion of the trip starts at $349 a person.
Contact: Call the Oak Bay Beach Hotel & Marine Resort at (800) 668-7758.
Via Rail Canada The Crown corporation has been promoting romantic rail trips since the early 1990s. Its Silver and Blue class service rolls travellers in luxury across the country in 1950s-vintage art deco rail coaches. Add in, for good measure, Panorama cars, sophisticated culinary options, fluffy pillows and breathtaking scenery.
For the past two years Via has also been providing peak season Romance By Rail packages on its Vancouver-Toronto, Montreal-Toronto and Montreal-Halifax routes. The service offers passengers en suite double bedrooms with queen-size beds, down duvets, daily freshly cut flowers in rooms, chilled champagne and breakfast in bed.
Optimum scenic romance comes with Via's Skeena service from Jasper on the east side of the Rockies through the Skeena and Bulkley valleys to Prince Rupert on B.C.'s coast.
On the East Coast, Via offers its first-class Bras D'Or. The relatively short land cruise runs between Sydney and Halifax, N.S. The June 5 to Oct. 17 service departs from Halifax on Tuesday mornings and arrives in Sydney in the late afternoon. Departures from Sydney are on Wednesday mornings and include a one-hour stop at Port Hawkesbury.
When: Departure times vary.
Cost: Silver and Blue service starts at around $1,100 and heads upwards of $1,700 a person; Skeena service starts at around $150 a person. Totem class, which includes all meals, goes for around $400; Bras D'Or tickets are $219.

Royal Canadian Pacific Operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway, this vintage train is now into its second season offering a six-day, five-night excursion of the Golden/Crowsnest Pass loop with departure from Calgary. The 1,046-kilometre journey takes passengers through the Canadian Rockies via Banff, then through the Columbia River Valley and back to Calgary via the Crowsnest Pass and Lethbridge. The Royal consists of up to eight historic rail cars built in the early 1900s.
When: From May to October.
Cost: All-inclusive Golden/Crowsnest Excursion: $6,989 a person based on double occupancy. Other package tours range from $3,887 for the Royal Clubhouse Golf Excursion to $5,998 for the Rare Mileage Tour.
Contact: (877) 665-3044; Royal Canadian Pacific Web site http://www.cprtours.com. American Orient Express The Great Trans-Canada Rail Journey is a 10-day/nine-night luxury excursion that starts in Vancouver, travels east through Kamloops and on to Jasper, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Thunder Bay before continuing across Ontario and the Canadian Shield to Ottawa and Montreal.
When: Vancouver to Montreal July 14 to 23, Aug. 1-10; Montreal to Vancouver July 23 to Aug. 1, Aug. 10-19.

Full text: Whether he is putting in pink fibreglass trees or
? Ask Claude Cormier about his philosophy in landscape architecture and he's liable to pull out his business card. On it is the definition for "artificial," translated from the Larousse Dictionary: "Produced by human technique, rather than by nature; that which substitutes itself for a natural element."
In five years, his Montreal-based Claude Cormier Architectes Paysagistes has produced an impressive record of projects with a decidedly "artificial" feel.
Currently, the firm is working on bold interior and exterior plans for the major expansion of Montreal's Palais Des Congrès. The landscaping will include lipstick pink fibreglass trees. Then there is the rebirth of Place d'Youville, arguably Canada's most historic urban square, whose design harkens to a long-lost river. In the mean time, Cormier has also proposed a 10-kilometre-long "revalourization" project that will attempt to make an escarpment readable.
"We don't try to make things that look natural," the affable and articulate Cormier says in his office in a turn-of-the-century converted rowhouse in Montreal's Plateau district. "Our influences are pop culture, culture itself, art, any aspect that surrounds us in the city, or country, or suburbs.
"Our landscapes can still be ecological in the sense that they all contain aspects of a natural landscape. They are presented, however, in an unnatural way."
He sees his work in the same light as those who do theatre, architecture or fashion -- "we create the mise en scène."
In 1996-97, for example, Cormier dyed parts of the lawns at Montreal's Canadian Centre for Architecture vibrant blue as part of its The American Lawn exhibition because, he says, "the North American obsession with perfect grass deserved celebration."
At last year's International Garden Festival at Grand Métis, Que., he scanned the Reford Gardens' prized blue poppy beds to create a computerized pattern of blue pixels. He then manufactured square sticks painted blue on three sides, pink on one, and hammered them into the ground to create a sea of blue that mutated in colour as you glided down the paths. "The idea of the blue stick garden was to trace the evolution of our visual culture from impressionist brush strokes to digital outputs."
In Quebec City, he has proposed to make the Sainte-Geneviève escarpment "readable" by creating at both top and bottom, a continuous, artificially ordered border of oaks -- one every seven metres -- to frame a reintroduced forest.
This decidedly idea-driven approach to landscape might seem strange from someone who grew up on a farm in Quebec's bucolic Eastern Townships. According to Cormier, however, it is precisely the business relationship to nature inherent in farming that underlies his work.
"Nature was a resource, nature was not an escape; indeed, it was almost, well . . . boring." Forests provided wood for cutting. It was, he says with a shrug, a pragmatic relationship. "The ideal of the as a myth doesn't exist for me, so I am not afraid to turn it into a plastic thing and give it artificial colour."
Not surprisingly, therefore, his current proposed winter garden for Palais Des Congrès eschews the standard tropical garden for an artificial winter forest of leafless, fibreglass trees coloured lipstick pink, "a symbol of Montreal's inexhaustible joie de vivre."
After he left the farm, Cormier studied plant breeding at the University of Guelph in Ontario, where he earned his degree in agronomy before deciding that "genetics and I were not compatible." After getting his landscaping degree at the University of Toronto and working for seven years in Toronto and Montreal, he completed his Masters in Design at Harvard in Boston.
It was there that he studied under Martha Swartz, the scourge of insipid landscape design. A visual artist originally, Swartz had scandalized the profession with her use of Astroturf and, in one mall project, a glorious platoon of gilded bull frogs.
"She demystified the process of challenging preconceived conceptions," says Cormier. Swartz replaced a sense of doubt about trying new things, he says, "with the courage to believe in your own idea."
But Cormier's approach is about more than in-your-face bravado. A number of his major projects demonstrate, first, a consideration for a site's specific qualities -- botanical, ecological, geological and geographical -- and, second, a reconsideration in light of its history and sociology.
Nowhere has this generated a richer result than at Place d'Youville. A long, pie-shaped sliver running east from rue McGill, past Dan Hanganu's iconic Pointe-à-Callière archeology museum to Montreal's harbour, the square is split by an ornate 1905 fire station and lined by some of the city's oldest buildings. Most importantly, it is one of the continent's oldest meeting places. Originally, a river ran outside the city's fortified walls, with market stalls lining the banks and small boats using the waterway to circumvent the Lachine rapids. The river was vaulted over 1832, gradually became a sewer, the market square a parking lot.
Cormier, with Groupe Cardinal Hardy, has reversed the decay with a convincing design that is picturesque but interpretive. His approach, Cormier explains, was to create a general narrative that rejected any one period of history. Down the course of the now buried river bed runs a gently vaulted, landscaped spine that reflects the brick vault below. Gurgling water in steel channels spreading out from this central path hints at the river itself. Crisscrossing this path is a quilt of sidewalks fabricated from various materials.
"A quilt," Cormier explains, "is a construction of a single whole out of many elements, each of which has its own meaning." Thus, wooden walkways cross from domestic door to domestic door; concrete paths link to pathways through the city; and limestone sidewalks link cultural buildings. "In the middle, the granite promenade makes reference to the old sewage collector by becoming a collector of pedestrians."
Found objects -- like the Founders Obelisk, an original survey marker for a long gone bridge, a well and a piece of sculpture -- have been left in place, augmented by new trees and embedded shards of steel plates like those used to cover road construction. Ankle-high steel and granite fencing and waist-high lighting along the spine draw the eyes down to the pathway quilt that symbolizes centuries of movement.
"The thing about this project," Cormier concludes, "is the way it is an unmistakably contemporary design that still makes an honest reference to history without merely marking the past, a process that only makes public space banal."
If good sense prevails, the city will complete Cormier's design for the western section of the square, a particularly historic place where, in 1844, an English mob burned the Parliament of Lower Canada.
His latest completed work, done with Montreal's parks department, is the Montreal Garden in Shanghai, a 28,000-square-metre landscape with Saucier+Perrottes Architectes' technology pavilion at the centre.
"The building deals with modern Canadian technologies, so the landscape needed to deal with modernity. So, we decided to do a modern forest that could abstract Canadian culture and the sensations of our land -- vastness, humility, sameness and diversity."
The landscape features amoeba-like hills, planted with stands of poplar and a different ground cover for each -- English ivy, periwinkle and azalea. "This landscape," Cormier says, "attempts to represent the similar and distinct qualities of our different provinces and territories."
When asked why he has been able to do so many interesting, if financially modest, projects, Cormier laughs heartily, invokes his talented, cohesive team and then talks about having a passion for his work and a positive belief in the future.
"I do believe in the future," he says. "So we try to be progressive by being informed by history but adapting our work to today's constraints and ideologies, while also pushing forward ideas in what is an appropriate landscape. It makes us persuasive, and I guess it is that persuasiveness that makes it happen for us."

Full text: It's that time of year when schools close their doors --
Where you live determines the exact dates on which it falls. But along with death and taxes, March Break is a certainty of life for parents everywhere. Becoming the full-time master of ceremonies, even if for only a week or two, can be a daunting job. Herewith, some cue cards to help you get through it all:
Vancouver
Pacific Space Centre , 1100 Chestnut St. (604-738-7827), home of the H.R. MacMillan Planetarium. The centre has interactive exhibits that include a virtual voyage and a chance to touch a piece of the Moon. Even better, March Break Space Camp (March 20 to 24) has a number of kid-centric things on offer, priced from $40 to $175 and lasting one to five days. Among them: involves an introduction to robotics and the use of robots in society, and the chance to build a Hyper Peppy robot, which has a sound-and-touch sensor to control its direction. teaches kids about the International Space Station, helps them create their own space-station models, and looks at Canada's involvement in space research. teaches kids about astronaut training, microgravity and spacesuits, and allows them to make rockets, space-shuttle gliders, and to take a ride on a motion simulator.
You can't consider Vancouver with the kids without considering Stanley Park , the city's 400-hectare heart of dense West Coast forest, marked trails, beaches -- and one-of-a-kind playground with vintage fire engine, pool and water slides. There's also thegreat Stanley Park Horse-Drawn Tours (604-681-5115), guided, hour-long meanders through the park.
March is a perfect time to visit Maplewood Farm 405 Seymour River Place, North Vancouver (604-929-5610), where kids can pet pygmy goats and bunnies, watch a milking demonstration, or get a close-up look at about 200 birds and domestic farm animals, including the newest additions: baby lambs, donkey and calves.
If that all sounds a bit too tame, there's the Cliffhanger Indoor Rock Climbing Centre 106 West 1st Ave. (604-874-2400), 720 square metres of climbing walls with 12-metre ceilings that has something for everyone from as young as 3. Each climber needs a spotter, though, so booking in advance is a must.
Indoor rock climbing is also one of the more than 100 challenges at Score Virtual Sportsworld 770 Pacific Blvd. (604-602-0513), a 2,400-square-metre interactive sports-and-entertainment complex featuring real and virtual-reality attractions -- everything from archery and golf to interactive games and a mini roller-hockey rink. Reliable standbys:
Greater Vancouver Zoo , 5048 264th St., Aldergrove (604-856-6825).
Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge & Park (604-987-5922). A narrow bridge strung across a rocky canyon 50 metres above a rushing river, plus lots of trails through the 250-hectare park.
Canada Games Pool , 65 East Sixth Ave. (604-526-4281). The complex includes an Olympic-sized pool, waterslide, toddler pool, water toys and fitness centre.
Science World & Omnimax Theatre , 1455 Quebec St. (604-443-7443). Lots of interactive science fun and larger-than-life movies.
Calgary
A completely cool interactive exhibit can be found at the Calgary Police Service Interpretive Centre (316 7th Ave. S.E., 403-268-4566), featuring both the history of the Calgary Police Service and displays about crime in the city, and how it's fought. Visitors can examine aspects of police work from fraud scams to murder, and match wits with interactive computer/video exhibits.
Any city that's played host to the Olympics, as Calgary did in 1988, is bound to have plenty of kid-friendly leftovers. At the Canada Olympic Park (88 Canada Olympic Rd. S.W., 403-247-5452), you can take in the view from the highest point in Calgary -- the top of the 90-metre ski jump -- or head to the Hall of Fame and try the bobsled or ski-jump simulators. There's also : a computer keeps score as you try five Olympic sports. You even get to stand on the podium to see if your performance was medal-worthy.
The other thing Alberta's got is a rich relationship with dinosaurs. The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology (90 minutes northeast of Calgary, 403-823-7707) recreates the area as it was as many as 225 million years ago, complete with life-size dinosaur exhibits, computer simulations, interactive displays and multimedia shows. An added bonus: visitors can watch scientists as they restore dinosaur skeletons. Reliable standbys:
Aero Space Museum (4629 McCall Way N.E., 403-250-3752).

Winnipeg
If an evening with Ricky Martin (March 16, Winnipeg Arena, 204-780-7328) isn't your idea of fun -- and you'd better consult with your pre-teens before making that decision -- or if it's too warm for a leisurely skate at The Forks, there are still plenty of options.
The Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature (190 Rupert Ave., 204-956-2830) is playing host to a new show, opening March 25, called Aside from puzzles, computer games and a large maze, all of which explore math concepts, there are daily performances by magicians, clowns, jugglers, balloon artists and face painters.
About 15 minutes north of the city is Oak Hammock Marsh (1 Snow Goose Bay at Hwy. 220, 204-467-3300), 36 square kilometres that support wetlands, aspen/oak forest, willow bluffs and the largest piece of unbroken tall-grass prairie in the province. There are hundreds of species of birds, 25 species of mammals, plus amphibians, reptiles, fish and invertebrates. And from March 27 to 31, there will be special slide, film and craft presentations as well as daily excursions through the marsh.
The Tin Lizzie Auto Museum (1033 Hwy. 26, St. Francois-Xavier) will bowl over any fan of motor vehicles. The two-level museum in a three-building complex is home to 50 antique and classic cars as well as a dozen smaller modes of transportation, including a penny farthing. The owners usually have an antique car or two outside to give rides. Reliable standbys:

Toronto
There's lots of extra activity at the Royal Ontario Museum (100 Queen's Park, 416-586-5797) for March Break, including The Pyramid Makers, special activities to complement the new exhibit, In addition, Sharon, Lois & Bram alum Eric Nagler brings his new production, , to the ROM every day between March 14 and 18, complete with a band of shakers, rattlers, spooners and bangers. Bring your own homemade instruments.
Fort York (Garrison Road off Fleet Street between Bathurst Street and Strachan Avenue, 416-392-6827) mounts its popular from March 13 to 17.

Montreal
It's not all that common to find an interactive artexhibit, but the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts , 1379 Sherbrooke St. W. (514-285-1600) has mounted a combination of work from different eras and activities. Kids can try to copy a drawing, build a sculpture, design a chair, create a two-dimensional picture and much more.
At the Montreal Botanical Garden and Insectarium 4101 Sherbrooke St. E. (514-872-1400), activities run the gamut from sugaring off to an exhibition of butterflies (some with wing spans up to 25 centimetres) and the not-to-be-missed insect-tastings (really!). Outside, weather permitting, there's plenty of space to cross-country ski.
Until March 5, the ice of the Bonsecours Basin (514-496-4724) is artificially refrigerated; after that it's up to Mother Nature to decide whether it's safe to skate the almost half-kilometre-long natural ice loop around the basin. Reliable standbys:

At the risk of sounding old-fashioned, one tailor-made for the girls: The Duke of Kent and his sisters lived in a round, domed house by what is now Hemlock Ravine park (between Halifax and Bedford, at the end of Kent Avenue, off Bedford highway). The house is still there; there's also a heart-shaped pond built by the duke and lots of trails, which were originally laid out to spell the name of his love, Julie.
There's more history at the Shearwater Aviation Museum (Bonaventure Avenue, 12 Wing Shearwater, 902-460-1083), which is home to more than 10,000 artifacts, ranging from a large collection of uniforms to aircraft equipment and personal memorabilia.
