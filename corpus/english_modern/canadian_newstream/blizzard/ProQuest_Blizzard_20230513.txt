c) FACE
d) Royal West
And here are the answers:
1- d) 96.9 per cent: In Quebec and elsewhere, deaths linked to COVID-19 are overwhelmingly concentrated in the 60-plus age group. Known adult cases - which is to say, positive tests - are relatively evenly distributed by age. Reported deaths linked to COVID among Quebecers ages 30 and under: zero.
2- c) Pittsburgh Penguins: In 2020, the Canadiens both missed the playoffs and made them, owing to the unique post-lockdown 24-team play-in format. In the summer the Habs upset the talent-laden Penguins in the Eastern Conference "qualifying round" before succumbing in the "first round" to the Philadelphia Flyers.
3- b) bike paths: The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-De-Grâce borough council scrapped the lanes in response to citizen complaints about the elimination of curbside parking. "We've disrupted an entire neighbourhood," city councillor Marvin Rotrand said, adding that "hardly anyone" was using the paths.
4- a) Réseau express métropolitain: The transit system will link Montreal Central Station to Brossard, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Deux-Montagnes and, it was announced this month, Pointe-aux-Trembles. The Central Station-to-Brossard leg will be operational, if all goes as planned, in 2022. Give yourself half a point if you guessed Réseau électrique métropolitain, the system's original name.
5- a) Stéphane Aquin: The Montreal native and Université de Montréal alumnus left the Smithsonian system in Washington to take over the MMFA, which dismissed Nathalie Bondil in July. Bondil had objected to the promotion of Mary-Dailey Desmarais as director of the curatorial division. Aquin pledged to North Americanize the museum: "We are not a suburb of Paris." Bondil holds French and Canadian citizenship.
6- d) Moishe's: The venerable steakhouse was supposed to move downtown to Victoria Square. The pandemic had other ideas. Lenny Lighter, son of founder Moishe Lighter, has promised that the restaurant will return. Moishe's was purchased in 2018 by the company that operates the chain La Cage.
7- b) Increase pay to orderlies more quickly: "If I was able to redo one thing, I would have increased the wages of orderlies faster, even without the accord of the unions," the premier said, as the gravity of the nursing home crisis became apparent. Orderlies - many of whom did not report for duty - were paid between $20.55 and $22.35 an hour. Doctors, nurses and eventually the Armed Forces were forced to make up for the shortfall.
8- a) Louise Penny: The Knowlton-based crime writer has set her latest mystery not in the fictional Townships municipality of Three Pines, but in Paris, where Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec has no authority. "I learned more than I ever expected to know about a rare earth element called neodymium and its potentially sinister uses," commented reviewer Robert Croan in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
9- b) QCGN (short for Quebec Community Groups Network): The anglo activist group will presumably have a busy 2021 if the Legault government tables new legislation to strengthen French. Marlene Jennings, a former Liberal MP, had another four-letter affiliation in 2020 as a trustee of the EMSB - the English Montreal School Board. Before this she was executive director of the Montreal YMHA.
10- b) A downed pilot: Molson was boating on Lake Massawippi on the morning of Sept. 12 when a small aircraft hit the water and went down fast. Happily, the pilot managed to stay afloat. Post-recue comment was limited. "Modesty has always been the Molson family's way of doing things," a Canadiens spokesman said.
11- b) Oil heating: The TMR council was prepared to do its bit for global warming by approving the ban as of Jan. 1, 2025. Mayor Philippe Roy got cold feet. Montreal hopes to phase out heating oil in industrial and commercial buildings by 2025 and residential properties by 2030. Only a small fraction of homes are still heated by oil.
12- b) A $3.3-billion tramway project: Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume had been pushing the 22-kilometre tramway system for a decade. BAPE, the environmental review board, contended that the proposal did not serve suburbs adequately and that a subway or light-rail system should have been considered. Labeaume called the report "distorted, biased and full of contradictions."
13- b) Falaise St-Jacques: The 2.8-kilometre forested area between the cliffs (falaises) south of St-Jacques St. and the CN tracks and Highway 20 is slated to become a recreational park with a bicycle path. Protesters have noted the creation of the new "bande verte" will entail the cutting down of between 400 and 600 trees.
14- c) No one was elected: Sorry, this is the mandatory trick question. After Alexandre Cusson withdrew from the race to replace Philippe Couillard, only Dominique Anglade was left. The MNA for the Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne electoral district acceded to the post by acclamation. A former president of the Coalition Avenir Québec who became disaffected by the party's stance on immigration, Anglade is the first woman to lead the Liberals.
15- a) To abolish school boards: Bill 40 replaced them, including the English Montreal School Board, with "service centres" comprising community representatives, staff members and parents. Court challenges restored the English school boards in the summer. "Early on Feb. 14" means early: The final vote in the National Assembly - 60 for and 35 against - was taken at 3:21 a.m. after Premier François Legault invoked closure.
16- a) A pipeline in British Columbia: The proposed Coastal GasLink Pipeline, bringing crude oil from Dawson Creek, B.C., to the port town of Kitimat, crosses traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation. The Mohawks of Kahnawake established a blockade in sympathy with the hereditary chiefs who were opposed to the project (the elected chiefs were in favour). The disruption to freight and passenger traffic lasted until early March.
17- d) Baking Portuguese tarts. Quebec's personable director of public health has mixed standard medical advice with suggestions intended to preserve high spirits amid the pandemic. Born in Ste-Thérèse to parents from the Azores, Arruda turned "pasteis de nata" into a minor sensation. Not that baking was his only pastime. He was found fishing in Quebec City's Old Port.
18- a) Laurent Duvernay-Tardif: The NFL lineman, a native of Mont-St-Hilaire, was one of five Sportspersons selected by the magazine. All were named in part for their "activist journeys" as well as their athletic performance. A medical doctor, Duvernay-Tardif opted out of the 2020 season to work on the COVID-19 front lines. That was after playing for the victorious Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.
19- c) A katana or Japanese sword: The suspect, a 24-year-old man from Ste-Thérèse, north of Montreal, was dressed in what was described as "a medieval costume" on Halloween. Two people died.
20- c) Turkeys: A native species reintroduced in the 1970s after being hunted out of the province by 1909, Meleagris gallopavo has proliferated to the point of causing crop damage. There have been turkey sightings in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie and even N.D.G. Mild winters might be to blame.
21- c) Lost time in a 2017 snowstorm: On March 14 of that year a blizzard and a jackknifed tractor-trailer conspired to keep hundreds of drivers stuck for as long as 11 hours on Highway 13. Some slept in the cold, some abandoned their vehicles and walked home. A class-action lawsuit against the province proved successful. Compensation depends on how long people were stuck in their car.
22- d) Black Theatre Workshop: Founded officially in June 1971 with a production of How Now Black Man, the company traces its roots a few years earlier to the Trinidad and Tobago Association. COVID has put the kibosh on live theatre in Montreal but BTW was in the news in December for being named the co-curating company for the English Theatre division of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.
23- b) Je contribue: "Some positions require experience or training in health and social services, but not all," reads the website. "In particular, that of the service assistant who performs general tasks such as cleaning, maintaining, storing the material and the equipment in use."
24- a) New England Revolution: Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2016 - in part owing to the expansion of the Eastern Conference - the Impact lost to the Revolution with seconds remaining in added time. Will the Impact change its name in 2021 to the depressingly generic (and English) Montreal FC? "FC" stands for "football club."
25- b) Kent Nagano: The American conductor was supposed to exit the regular Orchestre symphonique de Montréal season in June with Mahler's Second Symphony ("Resurrection") and bid his outdoor farewell to Montreal in August in Beethoven's Ninth. Instead, his final live performance appearance as OSM music director was at an annual benefit event to raise funds for children's programming. The sold-out Mahler concerts were styled as postponements, not cancellations.
26- b) Erin O'Toole: The federal Leader of the Opposition announced on Sept. 18 that he had tested positive, presumably having acquired the coronavirus from a staffer. Legault self-isolated accordingly, but did not develop the disease. Several politicos (including Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet) have picked up the bug.
27- a) A karaoke bar. The Quebec City night spot was linked to dozens of late-summer COVID-19 infections in August and helped put the capital on yellow alert. The province promptly banned karaoke in September - as well as other more orderly forms of the performing arts.
28- c) Norman Webster: Editor-in-chief from 1989-1993, this resident of North Hatley was the author of an immensely readable weekly political column in the Gazette up to Jan. 10, 2010, when he posted a colourful portrait of Yemen. A foreign correspondent for (and editor of) the Globe and Mail, Webster recently revealed that his original ambition was to become sports editor at the Sherbrooke Record.
29- c) Air Creebec: Having temporarily discontinued regular passenger service because of the pandemic, the Cree-owned airline, headquartered in Waskaganish restarted Montreal-Val-d'Or flights in August. Now they operate daily. Timmins to Moosonee (both in Ontario) is a popular route. The airline also services Whapmagoostui, a former Hudson Bay Company outpost and the northernmost Cree village in Quebec.
30- a) Drivers: REM trains will be fully automated. No need for a driver, nor a cockpit at the front. Designers from Alstom, the French-based transportation company, co-operated with a request to make the "driver's seat" panoramic and youngster-friendly.
31- d) Nelligan: Premiered by the Opéra de Montréal, the pop-opera hybrid with words by Michel Tremblay has been revived a few times, including last January by the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde. The flashback treatment of the troubled poet Émile Nelligan (1879-1941) includes a setting of his most famous lyric, Le Vaisseau d'or. Gagnon, who was 84, lived for years in Nelligan's house on St. Louis Square.
32- b) Val-des-Sources: Tired of living in a town named after a notoriously toxic substance, a total of 2,796 residents of Asbestos - 48 per cent of eligible voters - cast their ballots for a romantic alternative. There were other options, including Phénix. Val-des-Sources squeaked through after three run-offs with a slight majority of 51.5 per cent. Residents will be called valsourciens or valsourciennes.
33- b) Simone Simoneau : Chronique d'une femme en politique:Simone Simoneau is a community organizer who runs for a seat on city council and encounters an array of obstacles that prove to be surmountable. Plante has said about the nonstandard literary format: "I think it's accessible, it can be fun, and I love graphic novels myself." The English title is Okay, Universe: Chronicles of a Woman in Politics.
34- a) Dion: Thérèse Tanguay Dion, who died on Jan. 17 at age 92, was the mother of Céline Dion, but also "like the mother of all of Quebec," according to talk-show host Julie Snyder, who turned the affable matriarch into a cooking-show icon. A native of the Gaspésie, she raised 14 children with her husband, the late Adhémar-Charles Dion. Maman Dion did much to promote the career of her youngest child.
35- c) Guy Lafleur: The famous forward turned up without his sweater in a fundraising spot for the CHUM owing to the refusal of the Canadiens to let their logos to be used, even for the benefit of a hospital. Lafleur, who turned 69 on Sept. 20, had received a successful quadruple bypass at CHUM the year before. Said the Flower: "I am very proud to be the ambassador for two great Montreal institutions and I wish nothing but success for both of them."
36- d) A whale: The humpback was the first of its species to be seen so far upriver. "It might be because it followed prey, it might be because it's a young whale exploring or it could because the whale is disoriented" were among the explanations offered by an expert. Unfortunately, the visitor disappeared by June 7. Its remains were spotted on June 9 near Varennes, east of Montreal.
37- a) Trudeau Airport: Deprived of its normally bustling summer schedule, the orchestra under its former principal guest conductor Jacques Lacombe made an offbeat and outdoor appearance in Parking Lot P-5 of Trudeau Airport. Listeners in their cars tuned into a drive-in style FM radio signal. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony was greeted with much honking and headlight-flashing.
38- b) Tampa Bay Rays: Stuart Sternberg, principal owner of the shaky Florida franchise, told the Tampa Bay Times that the prospect of a two-city team has not been affected by the COVID catastrophe. "It's become more important not to be reliant on one place and one market," he said. Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has said that Montreal is a potential "standalone" if the league expands to 32 teams. Stephen Bronfman is mentioned as the potential Montreal partner.
39- d) CJAD: The English-language "voice of Montreal" was started, remarkably, by a francophone, J. Arthur Dupont (1901-1967), whose initials form the call letters. Dupont began his broadcasting career as an announcer in 1929 for CKAC, the first French-language radio station in North America.
40- c) FACE: The Fine Arts Core Education school was then known as Fine Arts Core Elementary School (FACES) and advanced only as far as Grade 8, which explains Harris's switch to Westmount High in 1978. Her divorced mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast-cancer researcher working at McGill University and the Jewish General Hospital. Prior to FACE, Harris attended Notre-Dame-des-Neiges primary school on Côte-des-Neiges Road. The French language did not stick. The future VP writes in her memoir: "I used to joke that I felt like a duck, because all day long at our new school I'd be saying, 'Quoi? Quoi? Quoi?'"

Orderlies - many of whom did not report for duty - were paid between $20.55 and $22.35 an hour. Doctors, nurses and eventually the Armed Forces were forced to make up for the shortfall. 8 a) Louise Penny The Knowlton-based crime writer has set her latest mystery not in the fictional Townships municipality of Three Pines, but in Paris, where Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec has no authority.

A former president of the Coalition Avenir Québec who became disaffected by the party's stance on immigration, Anglade is the first woman to lead the Liberals. 15 a) To abolish school boards Bill 40 replaced them, including the English Montreal School Board, with "service centres" comprising community representatives, staff members and parents. Court challenges restored the English school boards in the summer. "Early on Feb. 14" means early: The final vote in the National Assembly - 60 for and 35 against - was taken at 3:21 a.m. after Premier François Legault invoked closure. 16 a) A pipeline in British Columbia The proposed Coastal GasLink Pipeline, bringing crude oil from Dawson Creek, B.C., to the port town of Kitimat, crosses traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation. The Mohawks of Kahnawake established a blockade in sympathy with the hereditary chiefs who were opposed to the project (the elected chiefs were in favour). The disruption to freight and passenger traffic lasted until early March. 17 d) Baking Portuguese tarts Quebec's personable director of public health has mixed standard medical advice with suggestions intended to preserve high spirits amid the pandemic. Born in Ste-Thérèse to parents from the Azores, Arruda turned "pasteis de nata" into a minor sensation. Not that baking was his only pastime. He was found fishing in Quebec City's Old Port.
18 a) Laurent Duvernay-Tardif The NFL lineman, a native of Mont-St-Hilaire, was one of five Sportspersons selected by the magazine. All were named in part for their "activist journeys" as well as their athletic performance. A medical doctor, Duvernay-Tardif opted out of the 2020 season to work on the COVID-19 front lines. That was after playing for the victorious Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. 19 c) A katana or Japanese sword The suspect, a 24-year-old man from Ste-Thérèse, north of Montreal, was dressed in what was described as "a medieval costume" on Halloween. Two people died. 20 c)
Turkeys A native species reintroduced in the 1970s after being hunted out of the province by 1909, Meleagris gallopavo has proliferated to the point of causing crop damage. There have been turkey sightings in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie and even N.D.G. Mild winters might be to blame. 21 c) Lost time in a 2017 snowstorm On March 14 of that year a blizzard and a jackknifed tractor-trailer conspired to keep hundreds of drivers stuck for as long as 11 hours on Highway 13. Some slept in the cold, some abandoned their vehicles and walked home. A class-action lawsuit against the province proved successful. Compensation depends on how long people were stuck in their car. 22 d) Black Theatre Workshop Founded officially in June 1971 with a production of How Now Black Man, the company traces its roots a few years earlier to the Trinidad and Tobago Association. COVID has put the kibosh on live theatre in Montreal but BTW was in the news in December for being named the co-curating company for the English Theatre division of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. 23 b) Je contribue "Some positions require experience or training in health and social services, but not all," reads the website. "In particular, that of the service assistant who performs general tasks such as cleaning, maintaining, storing the material and the equipment in use." 24 a) New England Revolution Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2016 - in part owing to the expansion of the Eastern Conference - the Impact lost to the Revolution with seconds remaining in added time. Will the Impact change its name in 2021 to the depressingly generic (and English) Montreal FC? "FC" stands for "football club."
25 b) Kent Nagano The American conductor was supposed to exit the regular Orchestre symphonique de Montréal season in June with Mahler's Second Symphony ("Resurrection") and bid his outdoor farewell to Montreal in August in Beethoven's Ninth. Instead, his final live performance appearance as OSM music director was at an annual benefit event to raise funds for children's programming. The sold-out Mahler concerts were styled as postponements, not cancellations. 26 b) Erin O'Toole The federal Leader of the Opposition announced on Sept.
18 that he had tested positive, presumably having acquired the coronavirus from a staffer. Legault self-isolated accordingly, but did not develop the disease. Several politicos (including Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet) have picked up the bug. 27 a) A karaoke bar The Quebec City night spot was linked to dozens of late-summer COVID-19 infections in August and helped put the capital on yellow alert. The province promptly banned karaoke in September - as well as other more orderly forms of the performing arts. 28 c) Norman Webster Editor-in-chief from 1989-1993, this resident of North Hatley was the author of an immensely readable weekly political column in the Gazette up to Jan. 10, 2010, when he posted a colourful portrait of Yemen. A foreign correspondent for (and editor of) the Globe and Mail, Webster recently revealed that his original ambition was to become sports editor at the Sherbrooke Record.
29 c) Air Creebec Having temporarily discontinued regular passenger service because of the pandemic, the Creeowned airline, headquartered in Waskaganish restarted Montreal-Val-d'Or flights in August.
Now they operate daily. Timmins to Moosonee (both in Ontario) is a popular route. The airline also services Whapmagoostui, a former Hudson Bay Company outpost and the northernmost Cree village in Quebec. 30 a) Drivers REM trains will be fully automated.
No need for a driver, nor a cockpit at the front. Designers from Alstom, the French-based transportation company, co-operated with a request to make the "driver's seat" panoramic and youngster-friendly. 31 d) Nelligan Premièred by the Opéra de Montréal, the pop-opera hybrid with words by Michel Tremblay has been revived a few times, including last January by the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde. The flashback treatment of the troubled poet Émile Nelligan (1879-1941) includes a setting of his most famous lyric, Le Vaisseau d'Or. Gagnon, who was 84, lived for years in Nelligan's house on St. Louis Square. 32 b) Val-des-Sources Tired of living in a town named after a notoriously toxic substance, a total of 2,796 residents of Asbestos - 48 per cent of eligible voters - cast their ballots for a romantic alternative. There were other options, including Phénix. Val-des-Sources squeaked through after three run-offs with a slight majority of 51.5 per cent. Residents will be called valsourciens or valsourciennes.
33 b) Simone Simoneau: Chronique d'une femme en politique Simone Simoneau is a community organizer who runs for a seat on city council and encounters an array of obstacles that prove to be surmountable. Plante has said about the non-standard literary format: "I think it's accessible, it can be fun, and I love graphic novels myself." The English title is Okay, Universe: Chronicles of a Woman in Politics. 34 a) Dion Thérèse Tanguay Dion, who died on Jan. 17 at age 92, was the mother of Céline Dion, but also "like the mother of all of Quebec," according to talk-show host Julie Snyder, who turned the affable matriarch into a cooking-show icon. A native of the Gaspésie, she raised 14 children with her husband, the late Adhémar-Charles Dion. Maman Dion did much to promote the career of her youngest child. 35 c) Guy Lafleur The famous forward turned up without his sweater in a fundraising spot for the CHUM, owing to the refusal of the Canadiens to let their logos to be used, even for the benefit of a hospital. Lafleur, who turned 69 on Sept. 20, had received a successful quadruple bypass at CHUM the year before. Said the Flower: "I am very proud to be the ambassador for two great Montreal institutions and I wish nothing but success for both of them." 36 d) A whale The humpback was the first of its species to be seen so far upriver. "It might be because it followed prey, it might be because it's a young whale exploring or it could because the whale is disoriented" were among the explanations offered by an expert. Unfortunately, the visitor disappeared by June 7. Its remains were spotted on June 9 near Varennes, east of Montreal. 37 a) Trudeau Airport Deprived of its normally bustling summer schedule, the orchestra under its former principal guest conductor, Jacques Lacombe, made an offbeat appearance in Parking Lot P-5 of Trudeau Airport. Listeners in their cars tuned into a drive-in style FM radio signal. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony was greeted with much honking. 38 b) Tampa Bay Rays Stuart Sternberg, principal owner of the shaky Florida franchise, told the Tampa Bay Times that the prospect of a two-city team has not been affected by the COVID catastrophe. "It's become more important not to be reliant on one place and one market," he said. Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has said that Montreal is a potential "stand-alone" if the league expands to 32 teams. Stephen Bronfman is mentioned as the potential Montreal partner.
39 d) CJAD The English-language "voice of Montreal" was started, remarkably, by a francophone, J. Arthur Dupont (1901-1967), whose initials form the call letters. Dupont began his broadcasting career as an announcer in 1929 for CKAC, the first French-language radio station in North America. 40 c) FACE The Fine Arts Core Education school was then known as Fine Arts Core Elementary School (FACES) and advanced only as far as Grade 8, which explains Harris's switch to Westmount High in 1978. Her divorced mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast-cancer researcher working at McGill University and the Jewish General Hospital. Prior to FACE, Harris attended Notre-Dame-des-Neiges primary school on Côte-des-Neiges Road. The French language did not stick. The future VP writes in her memoir: "I used to joke that I felt like a duck, because all day long at our new school I'd be saying, 'Quoi? Quoi? Quoi?'"

Full text: Djemira de Pagter lived through the 1998 ice storm and was en route to Dawson College during the 2006 shooting.
But the toughest time of her life was a March evening in 2017 when she was stranded overnight in her vehicle during a blizzard that walloped Montreal with nearly 40 centimetres of snow.
The massive snowstorm and a jackknifed tractor-trailer trapped about 300 motorists on a busy stretch of Highway 13 for many hours.
"I was there for about 11 hours," de Pagter, 32, recalled in an interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"I had almonds, a lollipop and half a chocolate bar for dinner. I had to keep getting out to get the snow off my tires and my windshield."
Many motorists were without food and water and slept in their cars in sub-zero weather. Some had to relieve themselves outside their vehicles. Others abandoned their cars and walked home in the heavy snow.
More than three years after the nightmare, she received a letter Friday saying financial compensation is on the way.
Stranded motorists, who were part of a successful class-action law suit against provincial agencies, will receive between $400 and $1,400 each.
"I don't know how much I'm getting, but it will be nice for Christmas," she said. "I have a medical condition and just had surgery."
Knowing that she would be facing a snowstorm that evening, de Pagter filled her gas tank and headed home to Lachine from her job in Anjou.
She ran into trouble on Côtede-Liesse Rd. because plows had failed to clear the fast-falling snow.
Her father, who had just collected his wife from Trudeau airport, suggested his daughter take Highway 13 because there had been a snowplow in front of his vehicle.
But as she headed south on Highway 13, traffic slowed and eventually ground to a halt about four kilometres from the exit to Highway 20.
Trucks blocked the highway and Transport Quebec didn't send plows in time. Tow trucks couldn't get through and finally the fire department was called in. Many motorists called 911 in tears, pleading for help.
A government investigator blamed Transport Quebec and the Sûreté du Québec for the Highway 13 fiasco. There was also poor management that night and subcontractor Roxboro Excavation had failed to clear snow and spread abrasives, the investigator wrote.
As a trained nurse, de Pagter said she managed to stay relatively calm as the hours dragged on.
She chatted on the phone with her boyfriend and started a livestream on Facebook to share the ordeal.
"At (one stage), I started screaming and banging on the steering wheel because I was hungry and had to go to the bathroom."
Around 5 a.m., cars started moving in front of her.
De Pagter had to drive around several abandoned vehicles and eventually made her way to a McDonald's, where she bought a cheeseburger.
But when she arrived outside her apartment in Lachine, she was forced to dig a parking spot in fivefoot-high snowdrifts.
"I was exhausted," she said.
"There were snowplows passing me and no one stopped to help me."
When she finally entered her apartment, more than 12 hours after leaving work, she barely had enough energy to crawl into bed.
"I was so tired, I didn't even eat," she said. kwilton@postmedia.com

Josh Freed: Six ways COVID-19 will change the way we interact

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/josh-freed-six-ways-covid-19-will-change-way-we/docview/2412840532/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Whew! The worst of COVID's first wave has passed through Montreal, for now.
We're gradually returning to our old lives, apart from staying away from each other like we had .... well, a bad flu.
But so much has changed in three short months it's breathtaking. And we're all wondering: Which changes are here for good?
Thankfully, Guru Josh is gazing into his newly sanitized, Purell-powered crystal ball that's guaranteed to be 80 per cent right almost half the time.
So here are some post-COVID predictions and suggestions for the future.
1. Cash: Forget that germ-ridden, crinkly stuff we once used to buy things. The credit card "tap" has become routine for everything from $200 supermarket orders to 99-cent dépanneur chocolate bars.
No one will be using filthy money again unless they're having it ... er, laundered.
The challenge now is how to give cash to panhandlers and squeegee kids who've literally been short-changed since COVID started.
It's time for a government aid program that hands panhandlers their own Visa machines. That way, we can tap a tip through our car window, after they squeegee it.
2. Greetings will never be the same now that we're scared to hug, handshake, cheek-kiss, fist bump, chest bump or high five.
No U.S. president will ever again shake the estimated 65,000 hands a year they did in the past. With luck the current president will depart after next November's election - with a simple hand wave.
Expect many new experimental greetings, from the military salute to the Samoan "eyebrow flash." Quebecers will learn to blow six-foot air kisses - while many wear masks full-time, partly to avoid germs and partly to avoid face-recognition.
3. Queues: Three years ago I made a film called "The Taming of the Queue" where I predicted "the end of the line" - as queues got replaced by modern technology.
Boy was I wrong! Instead, endless lineups now fill major streets queuing for everything from shoes to booze. But technology may yet rescue us.
Let's learn from big Japanese sports events where people queue up for tickets the night before, then reserve their spot in line with a small sticker placed on the pavement.
When they return the next day, everyone politely honours it.
So expect an app that lets us place an online double of ourselves in line outside a Costco while we wait comfortably at home.
We'll only show up in person when we're near the door. Then whoever's behind us online will politely let us in line.
4. Restaurants are poised to reopen in Montreal, with expanded outdoor terrasses permitted on sidewalks, parking lots and even many streets.
This should let us safely eat outdoors all summer, but what happens when the weather turns cold in the fall? I predict we'll extend our terrasse season by months by installing thousands of outdoor space heaters.
I've sat outside in minus-20C in bustling terrasses in Sweden and Norway - warmed by blazing propane heaters and complimentary blankets.
Once our bars and restaurants install heaters, hardy Montrealers will drink and dine outside during COVID, even in blizzards. But given the virus it'll be strictly BYOB: bring your own blanket.
5. Transit: Welcome to cycling summer as city hall opens hundreds of kilometres of temporary bike paths - for those avoiding buses and subways.
Bravo! But between our new bike paths, walking corridors, overflowing sidewalk queues and new street terrasses, woe to anyone driving a car.
Yet, ultimately, this pandemic will likely do more for the scorned auto than the saintly bike. Mass transit use has plummeted everywhere and it may take years to lure back germ-leery commuters.
When winter arrives, many cyclists will want warmer wheels. Expect a mini-boom in new and used car sales, as families seek germ-free steel capsules where they can choose the passengers whose air they share.
Ride-sharing, home-sharing and joint-sharing will also plummet as "sharing" literally becomes a dirty word. And how appealing does Airbnb sound to you now?
Elsewhere, telemedicine will replace doctor checkups. You'll Zoom over online to your physician who'll instruct you to weigh yourself, then take your own pulse and draw your own blood.
Then you'll take out a tongue depressor stick and lean your face into the screen as your doctor says: "Say AHHHH!"
6. Holidays: With travel on hold for the foreseeable future, anxious Canadian snowbirds are already asking: where can I flee next winter?
If warmer countries impose COVID quarantines, expect to see a vast exodus of Canadian "vacation refugees" being smuggled south in yachts, rowboats and canoes.
These new boat people will drift about the Caribbean, begging asylum anywhere from Canada's cruel winter.
But coast guard patrols from Cuba, Costa Rica and other traditional refuges will shout through megaphones: "Canadians Go Home!"
By the time COVID finally vanishes for good, six-foot distancing will gradually have become the norm for generations of germaphobes who now associate affection with infection.
But just as it's been all through this unpredictable disease, the distance will only make us all feel closer.

No U.S. president will ever again shake the estimated 65,000 hands a year they did in the past. With luck the current president will depart after next November's election - with a simple hand wave.
Expect many new experimental greetings, from the military salute to the Samoan "eyebrow flash." Quebecers will learn to blow six-foot air kisses - while many wear masks full-time, partly to avoid germs and partly to avoid face-recognition.
3. Queues: Three years ago I made a film called "The Taming of the Queue" where I predicted "the end of the line" - as queues got replaced by modern technology.
Boy was I wrong! Instead, endless lineups now fill major streets queuing for everything from shoes to booze. But technology may yet rescue us.
Let's learn from big Japanese sports events where people queue up for tickets the night before, then reserve their spot in line with a small sticker placed on the pavement.
When they return the next day, everyone politely honours it.
So expect an app that lets us place an online double of ourselves in line outside a Costco while we wait comfortably at home.
We'll only show up in person when we're near the door. Then whoever's behind us online will politely let us in line.
4. Restaurants are poised to reopen in Montreal, with expanded outdoor terrasses permitted on sidewalks, parking lots and even many streets.
This should let us safely eat outdoors all summer, but what happens when the weather turns cold in the fall? I predict we'll extend our terrasse season by months by installing thousands of outdoor space heaters.
I've sat outside in minus-20C in bustling terrasses in Sweden and Norway - warmed by blazing propane heaters and complimentary blankets.
Once our bars and restaurants install heaters, hardy Montrealers will drink and dine outside during COVID, even in blizzards. But given the virus it'll be strictly BYOB: bring your own blanket.
5. Transit: Welcome to cycling summer as city hall opens hundreds of kilometres of temporary bike paths - for those avoiding buses and subways.
Bravo! But between our new bike paths, walking corridors, overflowing sidewalk queues and new street terrasses, woe to anyone driving a car.
Yet, ultimately, this pandemic will likely do more for the scorned auto than the saintly bike. Mass transit use has plummeted everywhere and it may take years to lure back germ-leery commuters.
When winter arrives, many cyclists will want warmer wheels. Expect a mini-boom in new and used car sales, as families seek germ-free steel capsules where they can choose the passengers whose air they share.
Ride-sharing, home-sharing and joint-sharing will also plummet as "sharing" literally becomes a dirty word. And how appealing does Airbnb sound to you now?
Elsewhere, telemedicine will replace doctor checkups. You'll Zoom over online to your physician who'll instruct you to weigh yourself, then take your own pulse and draw your own blood.
Then you'll take out a tongue depressor stick and lean your face into the screen as your doctor says: "Say AHHHH!"
6. Holidays: With travel on hold for the foreseeable future, anxious Canadian snowbirds are already asking: where can I flee next winter?
If warmer countries impose COVID quarantines, expect to see a vast exodus of Canadian "vacation refugees" being smuggled south in yachts, rowboats and canoes.
These new boat people will drift about the Caribbean, begging asylum anywhere from Canada's cruel winter.
But coast guard patrols from Cuba, Costa Rica and other traditional refuges will shout through megaphones: "Canadians Go Home!"
By the time COVID finally vanishes for good, six-foot distancing will gradually have become the norm for generations of germaphobes who now associate affection with infection.
But just as it's been all through this unpredictable disease, the distance will only make us all feel closer.

Full text: Whew! The worst of COVID's first wave has passed through Montreal, for now.
We're gradually returning to our old lives, apart from staying away from each other like we had .... well, a bad flu.
But so much has changed in three short months it's breathtaking. And we're all wondering: Which changes are here for good?
Thankfully Guru Josh is gazing into his newly sanitized, Purell-powered crystal ball that's guaranteed to be 80 per cent right almost half the time.
So here are some post-COVID predictions and suggestions for the future.
1. Cash: Forget that germ-ridden, crinkly stuff we once used to buy things. The credit card "tap" has become routine for everything from $200 supermarket orders to 99-cent dépanneur chocolate bars.
No one will be using filthy money again unless they're having it ... er, laundered.
The challenge now is how to give cash to panhandlers and squeegee kids who've literally been short-changed since COVID started.

Full text: Born June 04, 1923, in County Donegal, Ireland; died Feb. 13, 2020, in Edmonton; of Alzheimer's disease; aged 96.
Ellen McGlinchey was six years old when she arrived in Montreal in 1929 with her mother and four siblings. They reunited with their father in a rented house in "Griffintown" - a neighbourhood for new Irish immigrants.
After much hard work and sacrifice, her father purchased a four-storey home and turned it into a rooming house. Ellen and her sisters helped her parents look after their guests. After completing Grade 10, Ellen left school and honed her baking skills at the Royal Victoria Hospital.
In 1943, Ellen met Joe Daniel in Eaton's revolving doors. He had pushed so hard that she flew out onto the sidewalk. Joe apologized, helped her up and walked her home. A sailor in the Royal Canadian Navy, he was wearing his white dress uniform and Ellen's parents thought her escort was a garbage man. Joe was smitten and the couple married in Montreal in April, 1944.
During the Second World War, Joe was first posted to Sydney, N.S., and then to Halifax. After the war, they moved across the country to CFB Esquimalt. Money was tight, and Ellen remembered their hourlong walks into Victoria for a 5-cent icecream cone - they took turns having a lick.
In 1948, Joe was hired by Transport Canada and posted to Snag, Yukon. It was remote and cold, and only men were allowed in the barracks, so Ellen returned to Montreal to live with her family. But she was lonely and took the train to Haines Junction, Yukon, then hitchhiked to Snag.
The base commander was so impressed that he allowed her to stay. "Married housing" was a wood shack with tar-paper insulation. Ellen wasn't afraid to try anything; she learned how to shoot a rifle and shop by dog team, and the couple even helped build a log church in Snag.
Ellen and Joe would often invite friends over for roast bear and potatoes.
In 1950, Ellen and Joe transferred to Churchill, Man., where they lived next to a blubber shack, watched out for polar bears and clung to rope pathways during blizzards to get around town. In 1951, they moved to Fort St. John, B.C., and after many years of trying to start a family, decided to adopt. They took the train to Vancouver and cradled their long-awaited son - Joseph Michael - in their arms.
A devout Catholic and devoted wife, Ellen now turned her supportive and encouraging manner to her son. She was a true homemaker and a great baker - there were always homemade desserts on the kitchen table and theme cakes (hockey rink, freight train) for Joe Jr.'s birthday parties. At the age of 2, she taught him how to skate in an unused Quonset hut on the base.
Future postings would take the family to Calgary, Ottawa and, finally, Cornwall, Ont. In Ottawa, Ellen loved skating on the Rideau Canal. She would be gone for hours and often see Pierre Trudeau skating to work - he once did a pirouette for her.
Joe retired in 1986 and the couple moved back to Victoria. In 1996, they moved for the last time to Edmonton to be near their son and his family. Shortly after Joe died in 2003, Ellen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She fought hard for 10 years, but the disease took its toll. Throughout her life, Ellen was the epitome of a party girl: always ready for a gathering wherever there was music, dancing, cocktails and, most importantly, funny stories and lots of laughs.
Ellen would lose many of her precious memories, but her adventurous and positive spirit endured right to the end.
Joseph M. Daniel is Ellen's son.

A damp Thursday morning will give way to snowfall over Montreal

Full text: Montreal's morning rush hour was slowed but not snarled Thursday as a major low-pressure system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-and-ice-and-nothing-is-nice-in-montreal-weather-warning ) packing a double-barrelled dose of rain and snow tightened its grip on the city and the province.
While on-island and most Laval school boards remained in operation, those north of Laval were announcing closures due to a heavy overnight snowfall.
Montreal's Trudeau airport( https://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/departs ) was also feeling the effects of the weather system, which is expected to sweep east across much of the province by Friday. While most scheduled overseas departures were able to take off Thursday morning, many domestic or U.S. flights were cancelled or delayed. Meanwhile, most scheduled arrivals between 10:30 a.m. and noon had been re-scheduled cancelled or delayed. Travellers are advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport.
By 11 a.m., road conditions in the Montreal area were displaying a distinct, north south split, with thoroughfares north of the Metropolitan Expressway reporting snow covered or partially covered conditions while midtown highway remained relatively clear.
The storm system, which originated in the American southwest, is expected to dump up to 45 centimetres in certain regions of the province, according to Environment Canada. And high winds of up to 70 km/h are expected in the Montreal area in time for the afternoon commute.
The fact the system's fallout was striking harder north of the Saint Lawrence was evidenced mid-morning by power failures( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ) in the Laurentians, Outaouais and Lanaudière regions that left more than 22,000 customers without electricity - more than 13,000 of them in the Laurentians.
The Montreal area is expected to receive 10 to 15 centimetres of precipitation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), which started to fall as rain overnight and continued to do so through the morning.
Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin said conditions created by the system are expected to be "particularly difficult Thursday morning in the Outaouais, the north of Montreal, Lanaudière, then move toward Trois-Rivières and Quebec City later in the morning."
Twenty-five to 45 centimetres of snow are expected to fall in the Laurentians, Lanaudière, the Mauricie region, Quebec City and the Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspé regions.
Whiteouts caused by the high winds are also expected to reduce visibility on highways along the St. Lawrence River, particularly in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.
Other road closures could be added( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) should the ministry receive information from motorists reporting deteriorating conditions via the quebec511.info website.( https://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx )
The system's impact will be less intense in the areas of Sherbrooke, Victoriaville, Lac-Mégantic, Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville and Thetford Mines, with rain and a little snow on Thursday afternoon.
This story will be updated.

While on-island and most Laval school boards remained in operation, those north of Laval were announcing closures due to a heavy overnight snowfall.
Montreal's Trudeau airport( https://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/departs ) was also feeling the effects of the weather system, which is expected to sweep east across much of the province by Friday. While most scheduled overseas departures were able to take off Thursday morning, many domestic or U.S. flights were cancelled or delayed. Meanwhile, most scheduled arrivals between 10:30 a.m. and noon had been re-scheduled cancelled or delayed. Travellers are advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport.
By 11 a.m., road conditions in the Montreal area were displaying a distinct, north south split, with thoroughfares north of the Metropolitan Expressway reporting snow covered or partially covered conditions while midtown highway remained relatively clear.
The storm system, which originated in the American southwest, is expected to dump up to 45 centimetres in certain regions of the province, according to Environment Canada. And high winds of up to 70 km/h are expected in the Montreal area in time for the afternoon commute.
The fact the system's fallout was striking harder north of the Saint Lawrence was evidenced mid-morning by power failures( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ) in the Laurentians, Outaouais and Lanaudière regions that left more than 16,000 customers without electricity.
The Montreal area is expected to receive 10 to 15 centimetres of precipitation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), which started to fall as rain overnight and continued to do so through the morning.
Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin said conditions created by the system are expected to be "particularly difficult Thursday morning in the Outaouais, the north of Montreal, Lanaudière, then move toward Trois-Rivières and Quebec City later in the morning."
Twenty-five to 45 centimetres of snow are expected to fall in the Laurentians, Lanaudière, the Mauricie region, Quebec City and the Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspé regions.
Whiteouts caused by the high winds are also expected to reduce visibility on highways along the St. Lawrence River, particularly in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.
Other road closures could be added( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) should the ministry receive information from motorists reporting deteriorating conditions via the quebec511.info website.( https://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx )
The system's impact will be less intense in the areas of Sherbrooke, Victoriaville, Lac-Mégantic, Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville and Thetford Mines, with rain and a little snow on Thursday afternoon.
This story will be updated.

Full text: A snowfall warning issued for the Montreal area is forecasting a mix of rain and snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-rain-freezing-rain-welcome-to-the-rest-of-montreals-week ) Wednesday night that will coalesce into "sustained snow" in time for Thursday's morning rush rush hour.
A total of 15 to 20 centimetres of snow is expected to fall over the region over the next 24 hours. And the warning from Environment Canada,( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#702177391744273262202002260504ww1070cwul ) issued at 5:01 a.m. Wednesday, cautions motorists to expect "poor travelling conditions due to low visibility and rapidly accumulating snow on roads, especially Thursday morning. Consider changing your travel plans. ... There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas."
The forecast for Wednesday afternoon calls for a high of 0 degrees Celsius with a windchill of minus-8 C and an accumulation of 2 centimetres of snow. Things will get dodgier this evening, with snow becoming mixed with rain overnight. While about 5 cm of snow is expected in Montreal, twice that amount could fall in Laval.
The forecast high for Thursday morning will be 2 degrees C. Expect snow mixed with rain in the morning and blowing snow in the afternoon.
Environment Canada's warning for the Montreal area is one of several issued for those regions of Quebec in the path of a low-pressure system originating in the American southwest.
Heavy snowfall is being predicted for regions north of the St. Lawrence Valley.
Accumulations of snow varying from 20 to 40 centimetres are forecast for the Outaouais and Mauricie regions, the Laurentians as well as the Lanaudière, Beauce, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspé and Côte-Nord regions and from Baie-Comeau to Natashquan.
In the Quebec City region, as much as 45 centimetres of snow is being forecast.
Precipitation is expected to be much milder in Sherbrooke, Victoriaville, Lac-Mégantic, Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville and Thetford Mines.

Full text: A special weather statement issued for the Montreal area is warning of a meteorological cocktail that will include snow, rain and freezing rain beginning Wednesday night and continuing into Thursday.
The statement, issued at 4:24 p.m. Tuesday, forecasts a winter storm for much of the province that in southwestern Quebec will manifest itself as rain and freezing rain on Wednesday night before turning into snow on Thursday.
"This system will bring heavy snow over most areas( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), with general amounts upwards of 15 centimetres that could reach more than 25 cm over some areas," according to the statement. "Additionally, this system will bring strong winds that are likely to produce blowing snow over many exposed areas, especially along the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St Lawrence."
Motorists are warned( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) that they should expect "poor travelling conditions due to low visibility and rapidly accumulating snow on untreated roads, especially Thursday morning. Consider moving ahead or postponing your travel plans."
The weather system is expected to slowly roll across the province for 73 hours and reach eastern Quebec by Friday.
As is usual in the case of such statements, more detailed information is expected over the course of the week as the track of the system becomes more certain.

Full text: QUEBEC - The province's transport minister says "swift action" will be taken to improve safety on Highway 15 where dozens of people were injured in a multi-car pileup Wednesday.
While he repeated the stretch of road is not considered an accident-prone area, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he has heard the voices of citizens and local mayors who said it is not safe.
"Yes, beyond the statistics, the area did not have more accidents than elsewhere in Quebec," he said. "But I know the area well. It is an an area which can be risky under certain weather conditions."
The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident. The Quebec coroner's office identified the dead as Charles Rivard, 54, and Pierre Boudreau, 69, both of them residents of St-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded by debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.

Bonnardel noted Transport Quebec trucks passed through the area at 11:26 a.m. and again at 11:56 a.m. Wednesday. The whiteout hit 25 minutes later.
Bonnardel said he asked his team Wednesday evening what can be done as of next summer to make the road safer. That could involve signs warning about high winds or more vegetation.
"Do we need to erect a wall? These are things we can look at," he said. "We are looking all the options."
Bonnardel noted witnesses did say some motorists were travelling too fast in the area.
"We will have to take action rapidly next summer to prevent these types of accidents," he said.

Full text: QUEBEC - The province's transport minister says "swift action" will be taken to improve safety on Highway 15 where dozens of people were injured in a multi-car pileup Wednesday.
While he repeated the stretch of road is not considered an accident-prone area, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he has heard the voices of citizens and local mayors who said it is not safe.
"Yes, beyond the statistics, the area did not have more accidents than elsewhere in Quebec," he said. "But I know the area well. It is an an area which can be risky under certain weather conditions."
The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident. The Quebec coroner's office identified the dead as Charles Rivard, 54, and Pierre Boudreau, 69, both of them residents of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.

Bonnardel noted Transport Quebec trucks passed through the area at 11:26 a.m. and again at 11:56 a.m. Wednesday. The white out hit 25 minutes later.
Bonnardel said he asked his team Wednesday evening what can be done as of next summer to make the road safer. That could involve signs warning about high winds, or more vegetation.
"Do we need to erect a wall? These are things we can look at," he said. "We are looking all the options."
Bonnardel noted witnesses did say some motorists were travelling too fast in the area.
"We will have to take action rapidly next summer to prevent these types of accidents," he said.

Full text: Quebec's transport minister says "swift action" will be taken to improve safety on Highway 15 where dozens of people were injured in a multi-car pileup Wednesday.
While he repeated the stretch of road is not considered an accident-prone area, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he has heard the voices of citizens and local mayors who said it is not safe.
"Yes, beyond the statistics, the area did not have more accidents than elsewhere in Quebec," he said. "But I know the area well. It is an an area which can be risky under certain weather conditions."
The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident. The Quebec coroner's office identified the dead as Charles Rivard, 54, and Pierre Boudreau, 69, both of them residents of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.

Bonnardel noted Transport Quebec trucks passed through the area at 11:26 a.m. and again at 11:56 a.m. Wednesday. The white out hit 25 minutes later.
Bonnardel said he asked his team Wednesday evening what can be done as of next summer to make the road safer. That could involve signs warning about high winds, or more vegetation.
"Do we need to erect a wall? These are things we can look at," he said. "We are looking all the options."
Bonnardel noted witnesses did say some motorists were travelling too fast in the area.
"We will have to take action rapidly next summer to prevent these types of accidents," he said.

Full text: The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.

Full text: Two people were killed during a massive pileup of cars midday on Wednesday.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The Sûreté du Québec confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.
The state of the other injured crash victims was not known on Wednesday night, and the SQ did not divulge the identities of those who died.
The injured were sent to the Anna-Laberge Hospital in Châteauguay, the Charles-Le Moyne Hospital in Longueuil and the Haut-Richelieu Hospital in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Those hospitals all declared Code Orange protocols, signalling the procedure for an event with mass casualties.
There were whiteout conditions at the time of the crash, as snow and high winds reduced visibility to zero, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said during a Wednesday news conference. He added that two snow-clearing operations had been carried out minutes before the crash because there had been intense snow in the morning.
"The conditions were nice, but the high winds caused the zero-visibility situation," he said, adding that the area is not known to be prone to accidents.
Highway 15 was closed in both directions at the Matte Blvd. access ramp into the night as emergency crews transported at least 12 people to a hospital for urgent care. Rescuers had to use saws to extricate people out of at least nine vehicles.
Others were taken from the scene by bus and treated for minor injuries either in a hospital or at the nearby Centre multifonctionnel Guy-Dupré. In all, at least 40 people were injured in the crash, according to a preliminary report. About 150 people were transported to the community centre.
Crews also had to clean up diesel fuel that was spilled on the highway when a tanker truck was pierced during the crash. More than 125 cars and trucks had to be towed away from the scene.
A school bus was also involved in the crash, but Bonnardel said no one on board was seriously injured.

It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown onto the road by winds from nearby fields. The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads when there are windy conditions.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.
The incident came a day after westbound Highway 10 was closed at Marieville( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/accidents-force-closure-of-highway-10-near-marieville ) for several hours in the wake of a chain-reaction pileup involving dozens of vehicles because of poor road conditions.

Full text: Two people were killed during a massive pileup of cars midday on Wednesday.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The Sûreté du Québec confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.
The state of the other injured crash victims was not known on Wednesday night, and the SQ did not divulge the identities of those who died.
The injured were sent to the Anna-Laberge Hospital in Châteauguay, the Charles-Le Moyne Hospital in Longueuil and the Haut-Richelieu Hospital in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Those hospitals all declared Code Orange protocols, signalling the procedure for an event with mass casualties.
There were whiteout conditions at the time of the crash, as snow and high winds reduced visibility to zero, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said during a Wednesday news conference. He added that two snow-clearing operations had been carried out minutes before the crash because there had been intense snow in the morning.
"The conditions were nice, but the high winds caused the zero-visibility situation," he said, adding that the area is not known to be prone to accidents.
Highway 15 was closed in both directions at the Matte Blvd. access ramp into the night as emergency crews transported at least 12 people to a hospital for urgent care. Rescuers had to use saws to extricate people out of at least nine vehicles.
Others were taken from the scene by bus and treated for minor injuries either in a hospital or at the nearby Centre multifonctionnel Guy-Dupré. In all, at least 40 people were injured in the crash, according to a preliminary report. About 150 people were transported to the community centre.
Crews also had to clean up diesel fuel that was spilled on the highway when a tanker truck was pierced during the crash. More than 125 cars and trucks had to be towed away from the scene.
A school bus was also involved in the crash, but Bonnardel said no one on board was seriously injured.

It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown onto the road by winds from nearby fields. The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads when there are windy conditions.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.
The incident came a day after westbound Highway 10 was closed at Marieville( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/accidents-force-closure-of-highway-10-near-marieville ) for several hours in the wake of a chain-reaction pileup involving dozens of vehicles because of poor road conditions.

It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown on the road by winds from nearby fields and had formed into snowbanks. The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads when there are windy conditions.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.
The incident came a day after westbound Highway 10 was closed at Marieville( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/accidents-force-closure-of-highway-10-near-marieville ) for several hours in the wake of a chain-reaction pileup involving dozens of vehicles because of poor road conditions.

Full text: Twelve people were transported to a hospital and two others remained stuck in their vehicles three hours after a blizzard caused a major pileup on Highway 15 in La Prairie on Wednesday.
The incident occurred around noon, and nearly 200 vehicles were involved in the pileup, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said in a news conference. Highway 15 was closed in both directions at the Matte Blvd. access ramp Wednesday afternoon, and was likely to remain closed well into the night, as emergency crews extricate drivers and clean up the scene. Some diesel was spilled on the highway when a tanker truck was pierced during the crash.
While there were no immediate reports on the number of injuries or vehicles involved, aerial images broadcast from the scene by TVA depicted a massive traffic jam forming behind the accident site. Provincial police said buses had been called in to house the injured and those unable to remain in damaged vehicles.
There were whiteout conditions at the time of the crash, as snow and high winds reduced visibility to zero, Bonnardel said. He added that two snow-clearing operations had been carried out minutes before the crash, as there had been intense snow in the morning.
"The conditions were nice, but the high winds caused the zero-visibility situation," he said.

The aerial footage showed at least two people were being treated by first responders at the accident site, which involved the highway's southbound lanes. It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown on the roadbed by winds from nearby fields and had formed into snowbanks.
The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
Around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau said it was too early to give the state of health of the people involved in the crash, saying they were still doing triage.
Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.

Full text: A roundup of some of the North American equities making moves in both directions today
On the rise
Montreal-basedCAE Inc.(CAE-T), the world's largest civil aviation training company, rose 2.4 per cent in early afternoon trading on Friday after reporting a better-than-expected profit, driven by strength in its commercial pilot training and simulators business.
CAE is inking deals to train pilots for airlines like easyjet Plc, as air traffic rises.
Both CAE and U.S.-based Textron Inc's TRU training division are also seeing an increase in demand for flight simulators after Boeing earlier this year recommended that airline pilots retrain before flying the grounded 737 MAX plane, which is being fixed by the planemaker for a software problem.
Revenue in CAE's civil aviation training business jumped about 22 per cent to $558.1-million in the third quarter ended Dec. 31.
CAE reaffirmed its full-year outlook for 30-per-cent growth in operating income in the civil aviation training business.
Uber Technologies Inc.(UBER-N) jumped 9.7 per cent after it moved forward by a year its target to achieve a measure of profitability to the fourth quarter of 2020, but the ride-hailing company still expects to lose a total of more than US$1-billion this year.
After the bell on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said the company would cut costs, aim to generate more repeat-customer business and try to increase use of premium ride services.
He also said Uber would accelerate growth at the company's loss-making food delivery business, Uber Eats, to become the top player in most of its worldwide markets, eventually increasing the segment's margins, currently a drag on Uber earnings.
Mr. Khosrowshahi revealed the new profitability target on a conference call with investors after the company reported results for the fourth quarter of last year, in which it continued to lose money, but increased its customer base
On the decline
Aurora Cannabis Inc.(ACB-T) plummeted 15.4 per cent after it said chief executive Terry Boothis stepping downand the company is cutting 500 full-time jobs as it looks to stabilize its balance sheet.
The company also said it expects to take a $740-million to $775-million writedown on goodwill, and an impairment charge of between $190-million and $225-million.
Before the bell on Friday,several equity analysts downgraded Aurora stockin response to the news.
Canada Goose Holdings Inc.(GOOS-T) was down 4.3 per cent after it said on Friday lower store traffic in China and travel restrictions due to the coronavirus epidemic wouldimpact its revenue and lead to a smaller profit in 2020.
The virus outbreak has forced several luxury brands, including Capri Holdings and Ralph Lauren, to shut stores and cut their forecasts.
The parka maker expects revenue to grow between 13.8 per cent and 15 per cent, compared with its prior forecast of at least 20-per-cent growth.
That translates to $945-million to $955-million, a hit of up to $51.6-million. Analysts were expecting $1.03-billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It forecast full-year adjusted profit growth to be in the range of 2.2-per-cent decline to 0.7-per-cent rise from a year earlier, compared with a prior forecast of at least 25-per-cent growth.
The forecast of $1.33 per share to $1.37 per share was below the average analysts' estimate of $1.68.

Domtar Corp. (UFS-T) dropped over 6 per cent after itreporteda net loss of $34-million or 59 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared net earnings of $87-million or $1.38 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $1.2 billion, which was in line with expectations and down from $1.4-billion for the year-ago period.
Adjusted earnings of $2-million or 3 cents per share for the fourth quarter compared to earnings of $103-million or $1.63 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS of 8 cents.
Ford Motor Co.(F-N) dipped 1.4 per cent after announcing the top executive Jim Farley will assume the position of chief operating officer, positioning him as potential heir to Chief Executive Jim Hackett.
Mr. Farley, president of new businesses, technology and strategy, has been viewed as one of the potential successors to Mr. Hackett, who took over in 2017. The news comes three days after Ford offered investors a disappointing 2020 profit outlook.
Ford also said that another executive, Joe Hinrichs, president of automotive, will retire. Many employees and outside observers had seen him as a favourite to succeed Mr. Hackett.
"Jim Farley is the right person to take on this important new role," Mr. Hackett said in a statement. "Jim's passion for great vehicles and his intense drive for results are well known. He also has developed into a transformational leader with the imagination and foresight to help lead Ford into the future."
Boeing Co.(BA-N) was down 1.4 per cent after it flight testers discovered another flaw in the software of its grounded 737 MAX, the plane that suffered two fatal crashes, though the company and the top U.S. aviation regulator said on Thursday the issue most likely could be fixed without extending the target date for the plane's return to service.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson mentioned the new flaw at an airline industry event in London, but said he did not think it "will be a significant delay" in the aircraft's return.
Spirit AeroSystems Inc.(SPR-N),Boeing Co.'s (BA-N) largest supplier, slid 0.9 per cent after it said on Friday it would slash its quarterly dividend to just 1 US cent per share as it grapples with the grounding of the planemaker's 737 MAX jets.
"The Company's Board will consider further action with respect to the dividend in the future, upon the MAX's return to service and further production stabilization," Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile said in a statement.
Spirit last paid a dividend of 12 US cents per share
Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.(TTWO-Q) fell 10.8 per cent after the videogame publisher missed estimates for quarterly adjusted revenue amid competition from big-budget titles from rivalsActivision Blizzard Inc.(ATVI-Q) andElectronic Arts Inc.(EA-Q).
After the bell on Thursday, the company narrowed its full-year forecast range to US$2.80-billion to US$2.85-billion from US$2.75-billion to US$2.85-billion, the midpoint of which is below analysts' average estimate of US$2.85-billion.
Activision reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted revenue on Thursday, riding on the success of its blockbuster title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
The strong launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Orderduring the crucial holiday season helped rival Electronic Arts to beat third-quarter adjusted revenue estimates in January.
Activision shares were up 2.2 per cent, while EA was 0.4 per cent lower.
EBay Inc.(EBAY-Q) lost 3.7 per cent after New York Stock Exchange ownerIntercontinental Exchange Inc(ICE-N) decided to stop exploring deal options for the ecommerce company.
ICE confirmed on Tuesday it had approached eBay to explore "a range of potential opportunities," following reports it had mulled a more than US$30-billion takeover of the online marketplace, but that eBay was unresponsive.
"I didn't think it's particularly shocking and outrageous," Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher told analysts on a post-earnings call.
Intercontinental shares rose 3.1 per cent.
Interfor Corp.(IFP-T) slid 3.1 per cent after itrecordedquarterly results that fell short of expectations on the Street.
Raymond James analyst Daryl Swetlishoff said: "4Q19 adj. EBITDA of $17.6-million compared to Raymond James estimates at $15-million and consensus of $19-million. Compared to 3Q19 EBITDA of $16.8-million, results were largely in-line with the prior quarter despite a decrease in shipment volumes, in addition to a lower average lumber selling price.
"We rate Interfor Strong Buy, reflecting our constructive lumber market outlook, attractive organic growth opportunities, and higher relative exposure to the U.S. and strong balance sheet. In the wake of unprecedented sawmill curtailments, North American lumber shipments are poised to decline. At the same time, U.S. housing activity levels have gained steam in recent months. We expect these factors will allow benchmark lumber pricing to continue its upward trend. With Interfor as one of the few pure lumber plays, we encourage investors to add to positions."

Full text: Environment Canada updated its winter storm warning for the Montreal area, raising the maximum possible precipitation to 50 centimetres by Friday evening. That's more than the 45 cm max in its earlier warning, issued Thursday morning. It also prompted most major school boards to close their doors on Friday.
As snow was falling, the updated late-afternoon warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) predicted that "a total of 30 to 50 centimetres of snow is expected by Friday evening. ... Snow will intensify this evening and persist through Friday. In addition, strong northeast winds will gust up to 60 kilometres per hour. These winds combined with snow will cause blowing snow over several areas of Southern and Central Quebec."
Repeating Environment Canada's own warning to avoid unnecessary travel, especially on Friday, Urgence Québec and Sûreté du Québec were among the agencies urging caution for motorists and homeowners.
Montreal-area school boards also said they were monitoring the situation.
The Lester B. Pearson School Board was the first to announce that all its schools and all adult and vocational centres will be closed to students and staff members on Friday.
The closures also affect the board's daycare services and after-school and evening activities.
Please note that due to the weather, all Schools, all Adult & Vocational Centres, all Daycares & the Head office of the Lester B. Pearson School Board will be closed to students and staff members, Friday, February 7th.
All after-school and evening activities are also cancelled.

In the Habs' Room: Carey Price stacks pads to keep playoff hopes churning

Full text: Carey Price made 35 saves Thursday night, but there was one that stood out.
The score was tied 2-2 and there was 1:47 remaining in regulation time when Jakob Silfverberg had an opening to Price's left on an odd-man rush. Price threw his legs out and stopped the Anaheim sniper with a double-pad stack.
It's not a move you can practise, Price noted when he said: "It's a spur of the moment thing. I don't do it very often, but when I do, I need both pads."
The double-pad stack save was a trademark for Martin Brodeur and Dominik Hasek and Price was asked if he patterned his move after either of those Hall of Famers.
"It's a combo, (but) I think they were smoother than I am."
Carey Price made 35 saves Thursday night at the Bell Centre to help Montreal beat the Ducks 3-2 in overtime.
The save allowed defenceman Jeff Petry to win the game 25 seconds into the 3-on-3 overtime.
"He had a big game and he had a big-league shot there to win it," Price said.
With Shea Weber on the sidelines for at least a week with a lower-body injury, the Canadiens relied heavily on Petry. He led all skaters with 27:25 of ice time, playing a regular shift and seeing time in the power play and the penalty kill.
Rookie Nick Suzuki, who scored his 11th goal of the season on a first-period power play, didn't figure on the scoresheet on the game-winner, but he served as a decoy, pulling a defender away from the goal.
"(Joel Armia) came back and made a good pass to me and allowed me to pretty much skate up the ice two-on-one," Petry said. "I saw Suzuki going down the left side, but the D-man faded to the post and it seemed like he was giving me the shot the whole way so I had to take it there.
"At this point a win's a win," Petry added. "Obviously, we want to play the right way and there's things we need to clean up and do better. But at this point of the year and the situation we're in, we'll take a win any way we can get them."
The win allowed the Canadiens to close some ground on the teams they are chasing for a playoff spot. Montreal finished the night five points behind Florida in the battle for third place in the Atlantic Division. The Panthers, who lost 7-2 at home to Vegas, still enjoy three games in hand.
And the Canadiens are six points behind Philadelphia in the race for the second wild-card spot. The Flyers, who were shut out 5-0 by New Jersey, hold two games in hand.
With injuries and the flu taking their toll. Jake Evans was called up from Laval and made his NHL debut. Evans, who got the call Thursday morning, was stopped on a breakaway on his first shift and played a solid game on a line with Ilya Kovalchuk and Max Domi.
"We were all cheering for him to score on his first NHL shift," Claude Julien said.
Evans has been a centre all his life, but played right wing for the second time in his career. The first time was Wednesday in Laval to make room for Jesperi Kotkaniemi in the middle.
"For a guy who plays centre, he did a good job," Julien said. "He played with speed and he did a good job on the wall. Jake's got some skill. If he struggled, I would have made a change, but he didn't and I kept him with those guys."
The announced attendance was 20.896, but the actual turnout was much lower. There were hundreds of no-shows which could be attributed to the quality of the matchup and/or fears of an impending blizzard.

Full text: Environment Canada has updated its winter storm warning for the Montreal area, raising the maximum possible precipitation to 50 centimetres by Friday evening. That's more than the 45 cm max in its earlier warning, issued Thursday morning.
As snow was falling, the updated late-afternoon warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) predicted that "a total of 30 to 50 centimetres of snow is expected by Friday evening. ... Snow will intensify this evening and persist through Friday. In addition, strong northeast winds will gust up to 60 kilometres per hour. These winds combined with snow will cause blowing snow over several areas of Southern and Central Quebec."
Thursday's forecast for the Montreal area calls for a low of -6 C, light snow and a windchill of -14.
Repeating Environment Canada's own warning to avoid unnecessary travel, especially on Friday, Urgence Québec and Sûreté du Québec were among the agencies urging caution for motorists and homeowners.

The warning, issued at 5:01 a.m., predicts that "a first snowfall will give five to 10 centimetres before the snow weakens (Thursday) afternoon. The snow will redevelop again tonight and will be very heavy until late day Friday."
The warning goes on to say that a further "25 to 35 centimetres of snow are expected Friday" and suggests that those in the region "consider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve."
Thursday's forecast for the Montreal area calls for a high of minus 6 Celsius and a windchill of minus 14.

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#201107528424489630202002030504ws1070cwul ) for the Montreal area that warns of the possibility of snow - as much as 15 centimetres of it - on Thursday.
The snow is expected to start falling over southern Quebec Thursday morning and may change to freezing rain in the southern edge of the province Thursday evening before reverting to snow on Friday.
While the statement notes that snowfall accumulation may vary from one region to another, it adds that it "may exceed 15 centimetres over most areas."
As is usual with special weather statements issued by the federal agency, Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ) cautions that "this scenario could change by the time the system arrives, given the uncertainty of its track."

Food hall monitor; How do the recently opened marketplaces stack up against one another?

Author: Tousignant, Isa

Full text: In the last three months, three major food halls have opened in Montreal's downtown core, jumping on a bandwagon that has already taken the world by storm. Those who remember Place Ville Marie's Mövenpick know the phenomenon has existed before - even Marché Artisans, which opened a couple of years ago in Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth hotel, offers an array of counters and a luxury approach to lunch foods in a cafeteria context that approaches the concept.
The difference with these big new food halls (or food marketplaces or emporia or whatever you call them, so long as it isn't "food court") is that it isn't one outfit providing the food, it's a selection of Montreal chefs - the hotter and buzzier, the better. And unlike food courts, there are no multinational chains allowed.
As Montreal Gazette columnist Josh Freed recently wrote, the reasons we love food halls are many, from the convenience to the variety to the primo people-watching.
But how do these new spots differ from one another? The grandest: Le Cathcart Restaurants et Biergarten The latest addition to Montreal's food hall roster, Le Cathcart opened on the bottom floor of Place Ville Marie on Thursday, and it wins the prize for best esthetic. Designed by Sid Lee Architecture, it's airy, comfortable and luxurious, with lasting materials like brass, iron, marble, wood, black-and-white tiled flooring and well-stuffed peach, teal and aubergine leather seating. The atmosphere is eclectic and loft-like, thanks to a variety of zones, each with its own design vibe. And the pièce de résistance is the biergarten's fully glassed ceiling, which reveals the grandeur of the surrounding skyscrapers.
Filled with plants that reflect the greenery of the now-visible Mount Royal, Le Cathcart is an oasis among the area's food courts. And of course, the important part: the food! The dozen or so restaurants, counters and coffee shops serving the 1,000 (!) seated spots run the gamut, from wood-oven pizzas by Pizza del Fornaio to tall-stacked fried chicken burgers from Chikin to platefuls of fragrant Middle Eastern goodies from Omnivore (try their mixed salad plate and their Beirut kefta sandwich). There are also mouth-wateringly generous bento boxes from the Japanese cantina Akio, courtesy of the project's patron-chef Antonio Park.
The overall array is less haute than Time Out, less international than Central, and the prices seem to sit right in the middle. 1 Place Ville Marie; lecathcart.com The chicest: Time Out Market Ride up the Eaton Centre elevator to Time Out Market and you'll be struck by the moodiness of the dark-designed space, featuring a black industrial ceiling and grey and cement surfaces illuminated with dramatic spotlights that reflect on the golden wood tables.
The fanciness carries through to the food options, which include outposts by renowned Montreal restaurants ranging from burgers signed by Toqué! to Club Chasse et Pêche to Montréal Plaza. So far, the most beloved by my trusted foodie sources are Moleskine's pizzas, anything from Olive & Gourmando, the decadent baked goods of Hof Kelsten and the Haitian-influenced dishes by Agrikol chef Paul Toussaint. There are 16 "unique food concepts" (their words) to choose from in all.
A meal here feels like something of an event - $30 for a burger and a glass of wine has that effect on me - and that elevated experience is hard to come by in the constantly bustling, chain-restaurant-addled downtown. It's a real escape and would make for a great place to meet the gang after work, where everyone can choose their own dish but meet in the separate bar section to catch up before a show.
The wine selection is small, but very well curated - in fact, it's the judicious curating of everything, especially the choice of restaurants, that will keep me coming back for more. Eaton Centre, 705 Ste-Catherine St. W.; timeoutmarket.com/montreal The most fun: Le Central The prize for greatest expression of Montreal's unique vibe goes to Le Central, at Ste-Catherine St. and St-Laurent Blvd.
Fun radiates from this place, thanks to a design that's eclectic and personalized to each eatery, featuring a range of materials - from solid wood sharing tables to '50s-style red plastic chairs. The irregular distribution of the 25 food counters - or, in cases like Pintxo, full-on restaurant spaces - gives it the feel of a permanent food truck meet-up. (First Fridays all year round - my dream!) When I visited, kids filled the place, running and exploring all the options before returning to the enormous tables in the central space, making it clear it's a very family-friendly experience with a vibrant and festive atmosphere.
The options include Mignonette's alluring raw bar, Misoya's ramen, Portuguese chicken from Emilia, delicious dosa from Le Super Qualité, Thai-Laotian yums from Thip Thip and Chinese fried chicken from Ho Lee Chix. My meal from Bonita's Taco & Deli was an extremely affordable ray of sunshine on a grey winter's day: a vegan carnitas taco made from wonderfully meaty-textured enoki mushrooms and a beefy barbacoa taco, dry-spiced and so fragrant, topped with fresh onion and cilantro and served with a juicy orange wedge to squeeze over. For dessert, I highly recommend the chocolatey Blizzard from Trou de Beigne.
Bon appétit! 30 Ste-Catherine St. W.; lecentral.ca

The options include Mignonette's alluring raw bar, Misoya's ramen, Portuguese chicken from Emilia, delicious dosa from Le Super Qualité( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/local-food-reviews/restaurant-review-le-super-qualite-is-a-superstar-indian-snack-bar ), Thai-Laotian yums from Thip Thip and Chinese fried chicken from Ho Lee Chix. My meal from Bonita's Taco & Deli was an extremely affordable ray of sunshine on a grey winter's day: a vegan carnitas taco made from wonderfully meaty-textured enoki mushrooms and a beefy barbacoa taco, dry-spiced and so fragrant, topped with fresh onion and cilantro and served with a juicy orange wedge to squeeze over. For dessert, I highly recommend the chocolatey Blizzard from Trou de Beigne. Bon appétit!

Full text: I spent most of my teenage years despising winter, viewing it as an aberration, a gross miscalculation by the weather gods when they were fashioning the calendar year. They must have had an off-day, I thought. Or, as it happens, an off-season.
It’s not a surprising sentiment for someone who spent most of her youthful winters in Toronto on the brink of hypothermia. Even in subzero temperatures, my outdoor attire was little more than a thin ski jacket and flimsy leather boots. Between the two were knee socks and a very short uniform kilt. I survived winter virtually bare-legged and spent months cursing the cold while speed-walking home and praying desperately for the first signs of spring.
Sound familiar?
Then I moved to even colder Montreal for university and was spellbound at the gusto with which the locals embraced my least favourite season. On frigid January weekends, they gathered on Mount Royal, families in tow, for an afternoon walk. “What on earth?!” I thought. At the Winter Carnival in Quebec City, I stumbled upon an outdoor play – an outdoor play! And it was a full house, with people sitting on snow-covered benches intently watching, children included. Stranger yet, they looked happy.
Years later, it’s no surprise Quebec opened the continent’s first, and only, ice hotel.
But the Quebeckers I encountered were bundled up warmly in hats, scarves and proper winter boots – there wasn’t a thin jacket in sight. In other words, they were warm. I wasn’t.
Time to go shopping.
And just like that, I discovered how tolerable winter could be when you’re dressed for it. For the first time in my life, it was winter and I wasn’t covered in goosebumps. It was a revelation.
My walking slowed down, I noticed the views and I was no longer consumed with the thought of reaching the great indoors, counting the minutes it would take to get me there.
Still, I was tickled pink when I set off for Cologne, Germany, for a year of study, relishing the thought of a warm-ish, snowless winter, with the temperature staying well above zero. Yes please, I thought, as I put my down-filled parka into storage. See you in a year. What I failed to realize was that Cologne, similar to most of northern Europe, was covered in a thick, lifeless cloud from about October through to March. I de facto traded blazing sunshine and crisp, white snow for endless rain, leafless trees and more shades of grey than I could count (the sexless kind). It was grim.
On the one occasion it did snow – only to melt as soon as it hit the ground – my university class halted mid-lesson and all the students rushed to the window to watch. These were people in their 20s, not toddlers. And just like that it hit me: I missed winter. I missed the snow, the whiteness, the crunch under my feet, and most of all, I missed waking up to a brilliant winter wonderland. Not long after, I moved to Kyiv, Ukraine for work, and watched enraptured as the stunning, historic city metamorphosed into a Doctor Zhivago-esque landscape every winter. I got a dog and spent hours strolling through its many parks, watching my pooch jump with boundless energy through the snow. I discovered long underwear and expanded my winter wardrobe – if there’s anything that will teach you to dress for the cold, it’s a dog in need of a daily walk. I’d head to the majestic, brightly lit Christmas tree set up on the Maidan, the main square, where everyone would gather to drink, sing songs and, somewhat strangely, eat ice cream. No longer did I just like winter, I loved it.
I wasn’t alone. Since then, I’ve travelled to many wintry destinations where I feel at one with others who, like me, embrace the season, be it in Copenhagen, with its outdoor patios still in full operation in February, woollen blankets folded over chairs and portable heaters dotting the floors, or small, picturesque ski towns at the tip of Italy, where everyone gets decked out in their finest (warmest) gear for the evening passeggiata.
Then I returned to Toronto, the land of chronic winter-weather complainers, where even the weather forecasters join in with their menacing predictions of a heavy “dump.” Must they compare a brilliant clean snowfall with such an, um, unsanitary activity, I thought. I was amazed at the overwhelming winter bashing whenever the temperature dipped below zero. So pervasive has this habit become it’s now ritualized, with everyone adding their own knee-jerk response, usually along the lines of, “Only [insert number] more months until spring!” It’s like a wacky weather version of Waiting for Godot. And because misery loves company, there’s a snowball effect (pun very much intended).
Come winter, everyone here talks of wanting to pack their bags and head to Mexico. I want to pack my dog and head to High Park. Embracing winter has become the domain of a tiny few – an outcast group of winter warriors ready to buck the trend and smile at the first snowflake. Whenever I mention my love of winter, all conversation stops. Try it sometime, it’s quite amusing. Then I brace myself for what I know is coming: “You must ski.” Because, of course, only a skier could be crazy enough to enjoy the season. As it happens, I do, but not nearly enough for it to make a dent. Do people in Norway go through this, I wonder.
Even Newfoundlanders, digging themselves out after a record-breaking blizzard, are looking at the bright (or should I say white) side of things. Twitter is teeming with the more comical moments of #Snowmageddon2020, including a young man stepping onto a massive pile of snow in shorts, beach chair under his arm, sitting down to pop open a bottle of beer. “What storm?” he tweets. In another, someone aptly points out that only Newfoundlanders could experience the storm of the century and make the rest of us feel as though we’re missing out on all the fun. So true.
A final word to all the winter kvetchers out there: please stop. It’s tiresome listening to your endless moaning for five months of the year. Go buy a parka instead. Maybe throw in a pair of snowshoes and take a hike … through one of the magnificent trails north of the city. You’d be amazed at how beautiful it is. It’s tough being a winter-lover in Toronto. It’s also tough still seeing hatless people on the streets, shivering in their thin jackets and likely dreaming of Caribbean vacations, more underground walkways and maybe even – gasp – global warming. Just yesterday, on one of the most bone-chilling days in decades, I saw someone in sneakers. It felt like déjà vu. “It doesn’t have to be this way!” I wanted to yell.
“I know. I was once one of you.”
Luckily, I’m not any longer. Haven’t been in decades. Winter in Canada? Bring it on.

Full text: In the last three months, three major food halls have opened in Montreal's downtown core, jumping on a bandwagon that has already taken the world by storm. Those who remember Place Ville Marie's Mövenpick know the phenomenon has existed before - even Marché Artisans, which opened a couple of years ago in Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth hotel, offers an array of counters and a luxury approach to lunch foods in a cafeteria context that approaches the concept.
The difference with these big new food halls (or food marketplaces or emporia or whatever you choose to call them, so long as it isn't "food court") is that it isn't one outfit providing the food, it's a selection of Montreal chefs - the hotter and buzzier, the better. And unlike traditional food courts, there are no multinational chains allowed.
As Montreal Gazette columnist Josh Freed recently wrote( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/josh-freed-five-reasons-these-new-fancy-food-halls-are-worth-checking-out ), the reasons we love food halls are many, from the convenience to the variety to the primo people-watching. But how do these new spots differ from one another? It's time for a little compare-and-contrast.

The grandest: Le Cathcart Restaurants et Biergarten( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-pvm-is-joining-the-battle-for-your-tummy )
The latest addition to Montreal's food hall roster, Le Cathcart opened on the bottom floor of Place Ville Marie on Thursday, and it wins the prize for best esthetic. Designed by Sid Lee Architecture, it's airy, comfortable and luxurious, with lasting materials like brass, iron, marble, wood, black-and-white tiled flooring and well-stuffed peach, teal and aubergine leather seating. The atmosphere is eclectic and loft-like, thanks to a variety of zones, each with its own design vibe. And the pièce de résistance is the biergarten's fully glassed ceiling, which reveals the grandeur of the surrounding skyscrapers.
Filled with plants that reflect the greenery of the now-visible Mount Royal, Le Cathcart is an oasis among the area's food courts. And of course, the important part: the food! The dozen or so restaurants, counters and coffee shops serving the 1,000 (!) seated spots run the gamut, from wood-oven pizzas by Pizza del Fornaio to tall-stacked fried chicken burgers from Chikin to platefuls of fragrant Middle Eastern goodies from Omnivore (try their mixed salad plate and their Beirut kefta sandwich). There are also mouth-wateringly generous bento boxes from the Japanese cantina Akio, courtesy of the project's patron-chef Antonio Park( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-with-antonio-park-multicultural-in-life-and-in-food ). The overall array is less haute than Time Out, less international than Central, and the prices seem to sit right in the middle.

Le Cathcart's luxurious dining areas win the prize for best esthetic out of the recent spate of food halls.
The chicest: Time Out Market( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-a-tasty-sneak-peek-at-the-time-out-market )
Ride up the Eaton Centre elevator to Time Out Market and you'll be struck by the moodiness of the dark-designed space, featuring a black industrial ceiling and grey and cement surfaces illuminated with dramatic spotlights that reflect on the golden wood tables. The fanciness carries through to the food options, which include outposts by renowned Montreal restaurants ranging from burgers signed by Toqué! to Club Chasse et Pêche to Montréal Plaza. So far, the most beloved by my trusted foodie sources are Moleskine's pizzas, anything from Olive & Gourmando( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/dyan-solomon-shares-salads-soups-stories-in-olive-gourmando-cookbook ), the decadent baked goods of Hof Kelsten( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-hof-kelstens-panettone-is-a-hit-for-the-holidays ) and the Haitian-influenced dishes by Agrikol chef Paul Toussaint( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-paul-toussaint-brings-haitian-heart-to-agrikol ). There are 16 "unique food concepts" (their words) to choose from in all.
A meal here feels like something of an event - $30 for a burger and a glass of wine has that effect on me - and that elevated experience is hard to come by in the constantly bustling, chain-restaurant-addled downtown. It's a real escape and would make for a great place to meet the gang after work, where everyone can choose their own dish but meet in the separate bar section to catch up before a show. The wine selection is small, but very well curated - in fact, it's the judicious curating of everything, especially the choice of restaurants, that will keep me coming back for more.

With a fancy atmosphere and well-curated outposts of renowned restaurants, a meal at Time Out Market feels like something of an event.
The most fun: Le Central
The prize for greatest expression of Montreal's unique vibe goes to Le Central, at Ste-Catherine St. and St-Laurent Blvd. Fun radiates from this place, thanks to a design that's eclectic and personalized to each eatery, featuring a range of materials - from solid wood sharing tables to '50s-style red plastic chairs. The irregular distribution of the 25 food counters - or, in cases like Pintxo, full-on restaurant spaces - gives it the feel of a permanent food truck meet-up. (First Fridays( https://montrealgazette.com/news/open-wide-montreals-first-fridays-is-canadas-biggest-food-truck-event ) all year round - my dream!) When I visited, kids filled the place, running and exploring all the options before returning to the enormous tables in the central space, making it clear it's a very family-friendly experience with a vibrant and festive atmosphere.

Full text: Stop us if you've heard this one before, but it looks like we're in for 15 centimetres of snow just in time for the weekend.
Twenty-four hours after withdrawing a weather statement that warned the same amount of snow would fall on Thursday, Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday afternoon( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal-area forecasting snow that will begin to fall on Saturday and into Sunday.
"A low pressure system will track across southern Quebec and is expected to bring 10 to 15 centimetres of snow Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning," the federal agency said in a statement issued at 1:02 p.m. Thursday. "Also, moderate to strong easterlies will cause blowing snow, especially over exposed terrain such as the St. Lawrence Valley."

Monday's Quake A Wake-Up Call

Author: Hanes, Allison

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mondays-quake-wake-up-call/docview/2337723788/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature.
Mercifully, the freezing rainstorm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast, though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers.
On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Montreal actually sits on a continental "weak spot," explained Christie Rowe, a professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University and the Canada Research Chair in Earthquake Geology, making it prone to seismic activity.
"The St. Lawrence lies in a very old fault zone. It's pretty wide. It goes from the Laurentians basically down to the U.S. border. And the fault formed when the Atlantic Ocean was opening, so hundreds of millions of years ago," she said. "But faults in continents never fully heal. So it's always this weak spot."
The last "Big One" to rattle the area occurred in 1732, said Rowe, but predicting the next one is notoriously difficult.
"We don't understand the timing of earthquakes when they're not on a plate boundary," she said. "They're totally unpredictable. We know looking back in history that there've been a few since Europeans arrived. That could mean we have one tomorrow, it could mean we don't have another one for 500 years."
The rarity and lack of certainty around their timing may make the risk easy to ignore compared to more imminent threats like spring floods or blizzards, but even a moderate earthquake could be incredibly damaging in Montreal.
"I can only imagine what would happen to the Olympic Stadium," Rowe said. "We're not built for this type of risk."
In 2013, the Insurance Bureau of Canada released an eye-opening and sobering study examining earthquake risk in the two seismically volatile regions that are home to 40 per cent of the population.
It estimated that a 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami in British Columbia could cause as much as $75 billion in damages. Meanwhile a major convulsion of magnitude 7.1 along the St. Lawrence fault line could cause losses in excess of $60 billion, while crippling the economy.
The IBC research outlined the dual threats in financial terms. Journalist Kathryn Schulz chronicled the humanitarian and civilizational toll, if - or likely, when - the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Pacific coast gives way. The piece, published in the New Yorker, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.
At once understated in tone and alarming in effect, the article might have jolted cities on the West Coast into action and prompted people in the Cascadia danger zone to stock up on First Aid kits.
Montrealers may know how to confront the ravages of an Ice Storm after shivering through 1998. And we are commemorating the devastation of the quake that hit Haiti 10 years ago, given Montreal's close ties to that country. Yet it seems there is little awareness about what to do if the ground starts trembling here.
"We 100 per cent don't take it seriously enough," said Rowe, who grew up in California, where readiness is second nature.
"The immediate risks during the shaking and then during any aftershocks, would be from falling objects and that could be part of the building, it could be windows breaking. So if you start to feel shaking, get under a heavy table or desk so that falling objects won't hit you," she advised. "If people do feel an earthquake in the city, if they're in a modern building that has steel stairwells, those are some of the safest parts of modern buildings. And just stay away from the frontage of any building, stones could be falling."
Rowe suggested holding earthquake drills in Montreal that include schools, public authorities, willing businesses and ordinary citizens. She also invited those who experienced Monday's seismic event to go to Did You Feel It? on Earthquakes Canada's website (earthquakescanada. nrcan.gc.ca) and share their observations to help scientists like herself gather data.
"I'd like the community to know that there are researchers who are working on this and we are trying to better our understanding of it with the hopes of making us safer," she said.
Freezing rain may be a frequent peril for Montrealers, but the latest tremor should be a wake-up call. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature.
Mercifully the freezing rain storm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/less-freezing-rain-than-expected ), though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers.
On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/did-the-earthquake-wake-you-up-it-was-magnitude-3-4-near-valleyfield ) rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Montreal actually sits on a continental "weak spot," explained Christie Rowe, a professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University and the Canada Research Chair in Earthquake Geology, making it prone to seismic activity.
"The St. Lawrence lies in a very old fault zone. It's pretty wide. It goes from the Laurentians basically down to the U.S. border. And the fault formed when the Atlantic Ocean was opening, so hundreds of millions of years ago," she said. "But faults in continents never fully heal. So it's always this weak spot."
The last "Big One" to rattle the area occurred in 1732, said Rowe, but predicting the next one is notoriously difficult.
"We don't understand the timing of earthquakes when they're not on a plate boundary," she said. "They're totally unpredictable. We know looking back in history that there've been a few since Europeans arrived. That could mean we have one tomorrow, it could mean we don't have another one for 500 years."
The rarity and lack of certainty around their timing may make the risk easy to ignore compared to more imminent threats like spring floods or blizzards, but even a moderate earthquake could be incredibly damaging in Montreal.
"I can only imagine what would happen to the Olympic Stadium," Rowe said. "We're not built for this type of risk."
In 2013, the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/on/resources/studies/air-study ) released an eye-opening and sobering study examining earthquake risk in the two seismically volatile regions that are home to 40 per cent of the population.
It estimated that a 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami in British Columbia could cause as much as $75 billion in damages. Meanwhile a major convulsion of magnitude 7.1 along the St. Lawrence fault line could cause losses in excess of $60 billion, while crippling the economy.
The IBC research outlined the dual threats in financial terms. Journalist Kathryn Schulz chronicled the humanitarian and civilizational toll, if - or likely, when - the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Pacific coast gives way. The piece, published in the New Yorker( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.
At once understated in tone and alarming in effect, the article might have jolted cities on the West Coast into action and prompted people in the Cascadia danger zone to stock up on First Aid kits( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-really-small-ones ).
Montrealers may know how to confront the ravages of an Ice Storm after shivering through 1998. And we are commemorating the devastation of the quake that hit Haiti 10 years ago, given Montreal's close ties to that country. Yet it seems there is little awareness about what to do if the ground starts trembling here.
"We 100 per cent don't take it seriously enough," said Rowe, who grew up in California, where readiness is second nature.
"The immediate risks during the shaking and then during any aftershocks, would be from falling objects and that could be part of the building, it could be windows breaking. So if you start to feel shaking, get under a heavy table or desk so that falling objects won't hit you," she advised. "If people do feel an earthquake in the city, if they're in a modern building that has steel stairwells, those are some of the safest parts of modern buildings. And just stay away from the frontage of any building, stones could be falling."
Rowe suggested holding earthquake drills in Montreal that include schools, public authorities, willing businesses and ordinary citizens. She also invited those who experienced Monday's seismic event to go to Did You Feel It?( https://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/dyfi-lavr/known-connu-en.php ) on Earthquakes Canada's website (earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca) and share their observations to help scientists like herself gather data.
"I'd like the community to know that there are researchers who are working on this and we are trying to better our understanding of it with the hopes of making us safer," she said.
Freezing rain may be a frequent peril for Montrealers, but the latest tremor should be a wake-up call.

Shanghai is beating the world at video games: City spends millions on professional gamers and tournaments as China cashes in on booming e-sports industry

Author: VANDERKLIPPE, NATHAN

Full text: For 20 frenzied minutes, five young men sit side by side, staring at screens where colourful characters duel in flashes of weapons fire and bursts of flame.
“If you told me earlier you didn’t get him, I would have kept my best weapon for the last minute,” a voice calls out from the row of players, seated inside a marbled luxury villa that serves as their digital training ground.
“You’ve lost some blood,” a voice calls out. “I’m dead,” another responds.
It’s a sound sought by governments and well-heeled investors alike in Shanghai, a city at the forefront of China’s bid to grasp power and profit in a digital gaming world that, the industry estimates, generates more global revenue than movies and music combined.
Stadiums, professional leagues, million-dollar salaries, broadcasting and training facilities are all part of an ambitious Chinese strategy to profit from a fast-growing industry – but also to assert Chinese influence on an important, youth-dominated segment of the entertainment universe.
When the game ends, the young men gather in a half-circle around a large monitor, where Luo Shou, their manager at the Topsports club, shuttles through a replay of the League of Legends battle they’ve just completed. He is not pleased. The team has deviated from the strategy he had set out.
The players, who rarely leave this elevator-equipped luxury villa – sleeping on the third floor, training daily on the ground level, eating regional delicacies prepared by a dedicated nanny – defend themselves. One says he felt like giving up because the opponents “were so severe and cruel.”
Mr. Luo ends with a few words of praise.
Then, they swing back to their computers, beneath the writing on the wall that says, in English: “Set the goal of training the place where will never reach, sometimes you will feel tired, hesitate, even depressed, but don’t give up, because victory is not a miracle.” It’s an exhortation to achieve that could as well describe the ambitions of Shanghai, a port city that has itself been in search of greatness – not just in League of Legends, but in the broader esports industry of professionals playing and broadcasting.
The city wants to become what Zhu Qinqin, deputy director of the Shanghai E-Sports Association, calls “the e-sports centre of the universe.”
The dense coastal city, with some of the most expensive real estate in China, has devoted a sixsquare-kilometre commercial area to the industry.
It created an official identity certificate to register e-sports athletes inside its borders.
It has also succeeded in attracting major tournaments to the city, including the 2020 League of Legends World Championship, and eye-popping investment, with gaming company NetEase pledging to spend $945-million to build what it calls “China’s first large professional e-sports stadium.”
“From the perspective of policy and government, Shanghai’s esports development plan must be the biggest in the world,” Mr. Zhu said.
In part, it’s a bid to latch onto growth. Where other industries have stagnated in China, e-sports revenues are rising at greater than 20 per cent a year, he said.
“We can see the potential here,” he said.
But it’s also part of a wider Chinese effort to assert influence in an entertainment market with global reach, making e-sports perhaps the most robust soft power venture in modern Chinese history.
While the country’s investors and artists have an uneven track record in penetrating Hollywood, and Chinese musicians struggle outside their home borders, China has made much deeper inroads in digital gaming, bolstered by the size of the market at home.
The world’s largest video game company is Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns Riot Games (creator of League of Legends), has a 40-per-cent stake in Epic Games (the company behind Fortnite), and has smaller stakes in Bluehole, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard.
For Chinese authorities, foreign “soccer, American superstar movies, Japanese cartoons – they are a cultural infection,” said Hongyu Chen, a British-educated writer who follows the industry.
E-sports, however, have offered a way “to use culture as a weapon.”
At home, Mr. Chen said, esports “can unite people” – particularly youth – around the national flag, as they cheer on domestic teams that are increasingly successful. Abroad, e-sports can be used to inculcate elements of Chinese culture and enforce official dictates on foreign soil.
Earlier this year, for example, participants in Blizzard games raised controversy when they openly supported protesters in Hong Kong. Blizzard, in response, suspended several people.
In December, NetEase removed Mesut Ozil from its Pro Evolution Soccer 2020 game in China after the midfielder for the Arsenal Football Club in London spoke in defence of Muslim Uyghurs incarcerated in China. NetEase opened a Canadian production centre in Montreal this July.
Chinese gaming executives openly acknowledge objectives that go beyond profit. “This is how we want to pass on our cultural heritage to the younger generation and make them love the ancient culture,” Colin Yao, who leads TiMi Studios at Tencent, told Fortune, as he described the company’s Honor of Kings, the highest-grossing mobile game last year.
That game has also illustrated the difficulty in exporting Chinese values: An overseas adaptation called Arena of Valor has not been a runaway hit.
But China’s pursuit of supremacy in e-sports is proceeding undimmed. Some 40 universities now offer e-sports courses. Companies such as Shanghai-based ImbaTV have rapidly built up entirely new lines of business, including an e-sports hotel and an e-sports experience in a local shopping mall, in addition to competitions the company organizes.
Top e-sports hosts and commentators can earn nearly $2million a year, ImbaTV co-founder Zhou Lingxiang says. Live events in second– and third-tier cities sell out in minutes.
Top players, meanwhile, are signing contracts worth nearly $10-million – and at least 10 of the 16 clubs in the country’s League of Legends Pro League “can afford a price like that,” said Guo Hao, the team’s manager.
The Topsports club occupies three villas in a luxury development on the outskirts of Shanghai – temporary accommodations, until construction is completed on a purpose-built, sixstorey facility, complete with space for “game training, physical exercise, eating and sleeping,” Mr. Guo said. In total, it will measure more than 32,000 square feet.
Budgets are big. In the club’s first year, it spent more than $28million, money that is building both expertise and hopes.
“My goal in life is very clear and very simple,” says Bai Jiahao, a member of Topsports’ core elite group. “I want to be the world champion. Not just in China, but the world.”

Schukov: An inconvenient truth about West Island car shelter bans

Full text: Occasionally, I like to hitch my gasbag commentary to a Montreal Gazette vehicle, particularly in the realm of give the people what they want.
One such newsy temptation is the recent column entitled It's car-shelter season and the tempo of the debate has picked up( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-its-car-shelter-season-and-the-tempo-of-the-debate-has-picked-up ); Albert Kramberger, West Island Gazette; Nov. 13, 2019.
So when confronted with the decision of "eyesore or a necessity" allow me to slide off to the curb and beg a question: If it's 30 degrees below zero in a blizzard outside, and the only tuque you have is one of the Maple Leafs (I am thinking eyesore here) do you still put it on (a necessity) to go out?
Answer: Duh.
And when a well weathered journalist like Kramberger( https://montrealgazette.com/author/akramberger ) has done his homework and noted, "An online poll in which around two-thirds of the 1,200 West Island respondents indicated it was time to ease up on car-shelter bans in the West Island" there is reason to repeat, "Duh."

Kramberger: Poll indicates it's time to ice car-shelter bans( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-poll-indicates-its-time-to-ice-tempo-car-shelter-bans )
Pointe-Claire announces two-step process for snow, ice removal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-announces-two-step-process-for-snow-ice-removal )
Brutal winter conditions challenge snow removal across West Island( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/brutal-winter-conditions-challenge-snow-removal-across-west-island )
I lived a bunch of Dr. Zhivago (look it up) winters in Pointe-Claire Village where temporary frosty carports are banned (but it costs you money to put up a Welcome flag.) As pointed out, the shelters are banned in most West Island towns, so here's the 1-2 deal:
Residents without a garage (in towns where snow shelters are legal) are not thrilled with having to put together (I know, I've done a few) these wind-catching monstrosities but some winter snows are a real bitch to clear. (Some people with garages may still be puzzled at this, and focus only on the unsightly attack on their Dick and Jane pulling Spot in a red wagon little suburban streets.)
Again, garage-less people do not want to put up some ugly, flappy shelter that takes away from their frontage, either, but it's . . . uh . . . winter!
How about considering seniors? (Duh.) How about considering less municipal government nosiness with respect to a basic winter necessity? They should be legal everywhere. How about each town hold a vote? Give the people what they want. (No brainer.)
Guess what, winter is not convenient nor pretty on the worst days, so city halls of Baie-D'Urfé, Beaconsfield, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Kirkland, Pointe-Claire and Senneville . . . lighten up.
Kudos to Dorval, Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue for permitting them with - naturally - size and duration restrictions. These towns do honour their taxpayers.
If I had my way, I would have no rules for the colours permitted. God forbid we should have a few polka dot shelters and maybe a full size face logo of the Montreal Canadians. Crayola colours work in Lunnenburg, Nova Scotia. Why not even go overboard with unrestricted shades. After all, Christmas lights do that. (Makes me think, is there restrictions to what I can paint on the side of my car?)
And the smart town halls see legal car shelters as extra budget income through permit fees( https://www.ville.dorval.qc.ca/en/the-city/page/winter-car-shelter ).
All something to think about while you are seriously considering buying snow shoes.

Full text: Christmas is coming, but that's no reason for theatregoers to put up with too many silent nights over the next month or so.
There's the usual feast of family shows, and we've chosen 12 of the most promising, including a première from Cirque du Soleil, one or two children's classics, and some seasonal singalong specials with a touch of Broadway.
And before the regular theatres go dark, there are still some adult-oriented productions to be found, such as a dinner party from hell, courtesy of D2 Productions, that will hopefully help you enjoy your holiday get-togethers all the more by way of contrast.
Axel (Dec. 19-29, Bell Centre): Cirque du Soleil's second extravaganza on ice (the first being Crystal) gets its official première this month. It's the story of a young guy with a passion for skating, music and graphic arts who falls in love with an enigmatic young woman. Mounted on the scale of an arena rock concert, it features spectacular projections and variations on the music of Radiohead, Tears for Fears and the Bee Gees, among others. ($40-$140; 855-310-2525; evenko.ca)
Blizzard (Dec. 17-Jan. 5, TOHU, 2345 Jarry St. E.): More wintry circus from Quebec City's Flip Fabrique, as that titular snowstorm sweeps not only into the city streets, but into rooms as well. This is no grim apocalyptic vision, though, but a playful tribute to the magic of the season. ($33-$56; discounts available; 514-376-8648; tohu.ca)
Treasure Island (Dec. 13-Jan. 5, Hudson Village Theatre, 28 Wharf Rd.): It's time for Hudson Village Theatre to roll out its annual, unashamedly preposterous, Britstyle pantomime. Groan-worthy jokes, raucous singalongs and gaudy costumes will no doubt fuel this less-than-reverent Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation, as Long John Silver tangles with the Smuggler's Cove Women's Institute. ($23; 450-458-5361; villagetheatre.ca)
Peter and the Starcatcher (continues through Dec. 14, Casgrain Theatre, 21275 Lakeshore Rd., Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue): The theatre students of John Abbott College plunge into the world of Peter Pan in this adaptation of Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's popular children's novel, a prequel of sorts that includes origin stories of Captain Hook, Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys. ($15; students and seniors $10; 514-457-6610; brownpapertickets.com)
Mamma Mia! (Dec. 12-29, Théâtre St-Denis, 1594 St-Denis St.): Serge Postigo's Juste pour rire production of the sunny ABBA musical, which played here last summer, returns to warm up the season. All the songs, as well as the dialogue, are translated into French. Watch out for anglo theatre favourite Eloi Archam-Baudoin (a META winner for Hosanna) in the cast. ($70-$146.80; 514-849-4211; theatrestdenis. com)
Pinocchio (Dec. 27-29, Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts): Carlo Collodi's classic story of the little puppet boy with a penchant for alternative facts. This acclaimed francophone adaptation comes courtesy of Tout à Trac, the company behind the excellent version of Around the World in 80 Days that played at Théâtre du Nouveau Monde a few years back. ($20; 514-842-2112; placedesarts.com) Ça! (Dec. 18-Jan. 5, Théâtre Outremont, 1248 Bernard Ave. W.): Milva Ménard, who appears in the aforementioned Pinocchio, is having a busy season. She can also be found in this one-woman feast of music, magical lights and francophone storytelling, with texts from Louis-Dominique Lavigne and Étienne Lepage, who previously adapted the rather weightier War and Peace and The Idiot, respectively, on Montreal stages. ($15; 514-495-9944; theatreoutremont.ca) Musicals and Mistletoe (Dec. 15 and 18, Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave.): A collection of Broadway and holiday hits, courtesy of the West Island company Full Circle Productions (whose Six Degrees of Broadway Separation played at Centaur last spring). ($30; students and seniors $25; theatrerialto.ca)
Candlelight Christmas (continues through Dec. 8, Concordia's Loyola Chapel, 7141 Sherbrooke St. W.): Another cosy evening of musical performance with a Broadway flavour, from the Lyric Theatre Singers. ($33; seniors and students $30; age 12 and under $16; 514-735-9908; lyrictheatrecompany.com)
The Nutcracker (Dec. 12-30, Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Place des Arts): Christmas in Montreal would be a duller place without Les Grands Ballets'annual presentation (now in its 56th year) of Fernand Nault's impossibly lavish production of the classic Tchaikovsky-scored ballet. Kids can also enjoy a French reading of E.T.A. Hoffmann's original tale an hour before each performance. ($50-$149; 514-842-2112; grandsballets.com)
À travers mes yeux (continues through Jan. 5, Maison Théâtre, 245 Ontario St. E.): A welcome return for this acclaimed dance show, which looks at everyday objects through a child's eyes and earned Hélène Langevin an award for best choreographic work at this year's Prix de la Danse. ($17; 514-288-7211; maisontheatre.com) It's a Wonderful Life (Dec. 7, D.B. Clarke Theatre, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.): Geordie Theatre's annual gala fundraiser brings back an old favourite: their adaptation of the irresistibly feel-good Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart movie about a man who loses it all, only to discover the true meaning of the season.
Mike Payette and Jessica Abdallah direct a cast of 31, which includes local legal, business and medical worthies. The $100 ($75 tax-credited) tickets include a cocktail and a catered reception. (514-845-9810; geordie.ca) Theatregoers who aren't yet done with more adult-oriented holiday treats could do a lot worse than Jordan Tannahill's Late Company, which D2 Productions is reprising from Dec. 10 to 15 at the Segal Studio (5170 Côte-Ste-Catherine Rd.). It's a searing, at times caustically funny, play about the tragic fallout from homophobic bullying and is beautifully performed, especially by Helena Levitt as the devastated mother.
There's a feast of new writing starting with Infinithéâtre's annual festival the Pipeline, whose readings continue with works by Oren Safdie (Dec. 7, 7 p.m., Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave.) and Marc-André Thibault (Dec. 8, 2 p.m., KIN Gallery, 397A Ste-Catherine St. W.).
There's a double bill of new plays from Black Theatre Workshop, Dec. 10-15 at the MAI centre (3680 Jeanne-Mance St.). It consists of Willow Cioppa's Dark Red, an epistolary barrage directed at past sexual partners, and Cry Baby, Kalale Dalton-Lutale's archival dig into her history.
Meanwhile, MainLine Theatre (3997 St-Laurent Blvd.) is keeping busy, with Late Night Double Feature (through Dec. 8), two one-act plays inspired by grindhouse cinema; The Living Room Sessions (Dec. 14), a cosy concert from musical theatre specialist Noelle Hannibal and pianist Ian Baird; and over in the Mini-Main the same evening, Dishonour on Your Cow, an evening of comedy storytelling from Silvi Santoso.
And don't forget, Centaur Theatre is still hanging out with puppet master Ronnie Burkett and his very wonderful Scrooge spoof Little Dickens, which has been extended to Dec. 21.

Full text: Christmas is coming, but that's no reason for theatregoers to put up with too many silent nights over the next month or so. There's the usual feast of family shows, and we've chosen 12 of the most promising, including a première from Cirque du Soleil, one or two children's classics, and some seasonal singalong specials with a touch of Broadway. And before the regular theatres go dark, there are still some adult-oriented productions to be found, such as a dinner party from hell, courtesy of D2 Productions, that will hopefully help you enjoy your holiday get-togethers all the more by way of contrast.
Axel (Dec. 19 to 29, Bell Centre). Cirque du Soleil's second extravaganza on ice (the first being Crystal( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/cirque-du-soleils-crystal-attempts-to-tame-the-ice )) gets its official première this month. It's the story of a young guy with a passion for skating, music and graphic arts who falls in love with an enigmatic young woman. Mounted on the scale of an arena rock concert, it features spectacular projections and variations on the music of Radiohead, Tears for Fears and the Bee Gees, among others. ($40-$140; 855-310-2525; evenko.ca( https://www.evenko.ca/en/artists/13756/cirque-du-soleil-axel ))
Blizzard (Dec. 17 to Jan. 5, TOHU, 2345 Jarry St. E.). More wintry circus from Quebec City's Flip Fabrique, as that titular snowstorm sweeps not only into the city streets, but into rooms as well. This is no grim apocalyptic vision, though, but a playful tribute to the magic of the season. ($33-$56; discounts available; 514-376-8648; tohu.ca( http://tohu.ca/en/season/spectacle/2019-2020/blizzard/ ))
Cirque du Soleil is back on ice in Axel.
Treasure Island (Dec. 13 to Jan. 5, Hudson Village Theatre, 28 Wharf Rd.). It's time for Hudson Village Theatre to roll out its annual, unashamedly preposterous, Brit-style pantomime. Groan-worthy jokes, raucous singalongs and gaudy costumes will no doubt fuel this less-than-reverent Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation, as Long John Silver tangles with the Smuggler's Cove Women's Institute. ($23; 450-458-5361; villagetheatre.ca( https://www.villagetheatre.ca/ ))
Peter and the Starcatcher (continues through Dec. 14, Casgrain Theatre, 21275 Lakeshore Rd., Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue). The theatre students of John Abbott College plunge into the world of Peter Pan in this adaptation of Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's popular children's novel, a prequel of sorts that includes origin stories of Captain Hook, Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys. ($15; students and seniors $10; 514-457-6610; brownpapertickets.com( https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4360809?fbclid=IwAR3FOISEkWqMQLqhp5LdEvIEJqS1tSuScclSnuNmdJtYbNWv3Q_3r00r8bY ))
Mamma Mia! (Dec. 12 to 29, Théâtre St-Denis, 1594 St-Denis St.) Serge Postigo's Juste pour rire production of the sunny ABBA musical, which played here last summer, returns to warm up the season. All the songs, as well as the dialogue, are translated into French. Watch out for anglo theatre favourite Eloi ArchamBaudoin (a META winner for Hosanna( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/michel-tremblays-hosanna-a-quebec-classic-or-transphobic )) in the cast. ($70-$146.80; 514-849-4211; theatrestdenis.com( https://theatrestdenis.com/en/event/mamma-mia/ ))
Quebec City's Flip Fabrique brings the magic of winter weather to TOHU in Blizzard.
Pinocchio (Dec. 27 to 29, Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts). Carlo Collodi's classic story of the little puppet boy with a penchant for alternative facts. This acclaimed francophone adaptation comes courtesy of Tout à Trac, the company behind the excellent version of Around the World in 80 Days that played at Théâtre du Nouveau Monde a few years back. ($20; 514-842-2112; placedesarts.com( https://placedesarts.com/en/event/pinocchio ))
Ça! (Dec. 18 to Jan. 5, Théâtre Outremont, 1248 Bernard Ave. W.) Milva Ménard, who appears in the aforementioned Pinocchio, is having a busy season. She can also be found in this one-woman feast of music, magical lights and francophone storytelling, with texts from Louis-Dominique Lavigne and Étienne Lepage, who previously adapted the rather weightier War and Peace and The Idiot, respectively, on Montreal stages. ($15; 514-495-9944; theatreoutremont.ca( http://www.theatreoutremont.ca/en/event/ca-le-theatre-de-quartier/ ))
Musicals and Mistletoe (Dec. 15 and 18, Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave.). A collection of Broadway and holiday hits, courtesy of the West Island company Full Circle Productions (whose Six Degrees of Broadway Separation played at Centaur last spring). ($30; students and seniors $25; theatrerialto.ca( https://www.theatrerialto.ca/calendar/2019/12/15/musicals-amp-mistletoe-a-broadway-holiday-extravaganza ))
Candlelight Christmas (continues through Dec. 8, Concordia's Loyola Chapel, 7141 Sherbrooke St. W.). Another cosy evening of musical performance with a Broadway flavour, from the Lyric Theatre Singers. ($33; seniors and students $30; age 12 and under $16; 514-735-9908; lyrictheatrecompany.com( https://thelyrictheatre.ca/shows/upcoming-shows/ ))
Krystel Descary both plays and operates the little wooden boy in Tout à Trac's Pinocchio.
The Nutcracker( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/14-year-old-star-of-les-grands-ballets-nutcracker-has-happy-feet ) (Dec. 12 to 30, Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Place des Arts). Christmas in Montreal would be a duller place without Les Grands Ballets' annual presentation (now in its 56th year) of Fernand Nault's impossibly lavish production of the classic Tchaikovsky-scored ballet. Kids can also enjoy a French reading of E.T.A. Hoffmann's original tale an hour before each performance. ($50-$149; 514-842-2112; grandsballets.com( https://grandsballets.com/en/performances/nutcracker/ ))
À travers mes yeux (continues through Jan. 5, Maison Théâtre, 245 Ontario St. E.). A welcome return for this acclaimed dance show, which looks at everyday objects through a child's eyes and earned Hélène Langevin an award for best choreographic work at this year's Prix de la Danse. ($17; 514-288-7211; maisontheatre.com( https://www.maisontheatre.com/spectacle/a-travers-mes-yeux/ ))
It's a Wonderful Life (Dec. 6 and 7, D.B. Clarke Theatre, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.). Geordie Theatre's annual gala fundraiser brings back an old favourite: their adaptation of the irresistibly feel-good Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart movie about a man who loses it all, only to discover the true meaning of the season. Mike Payette and Jessica Abdallah direct a cast of 31, which includes local legal, business and medical worthies. The $100 ($75 tax-credited) tickets include a cocktail and a catered reception. (514-845-9810; geordie.ca( https://geordie.ca/2019-20-season/its-a-wonderful-life/ ))
Eloi ArchamBaudoin, centre, and the Mamma Mia! cast bring a touch of summer to Théâtre St-Denis.

Theatregoers who aren't yet done with more adult-oriented holiday treats could do a lot worse than Jordan Tannahill's Late Company( http://www.d2productionsmtl.com/ ), which D2 Productions is reprising from Dec. 10 to 15 at the Segal Studio (5170 Côte-Ste-Catherine Rd.). It's a searing, at times caustically funny play about the tragic fallout from homophobic bullying and is beautifully performed, especially by Helena Levitt as the devastated mother.
There's a feast of new writing starting with Infinithéâtre's annual festival the Pipeline( http://www.infinitheatre.com/the-pipeline.php ), which presents readings of winning plays from its Write-on-Q competition. This year includes new works from Alyson Grant and Oren Safdie. All four readings, which you can catch Dec. 5 through 8 at Rialto Theatre (5723 Parc Ave.) and the KIN Gallery (397A Ste-Catherine St. W.), are directed and performed by Montreal's finest.
There's a double bill of new plays from Black Theatre Workshop( http://www.blacktheatreworkshop.ca/doublebill/ ), Dec. 10 to 15 at the MAI centre (3680 Jeanne-Mance St.). It consists of Willow Cioppa's Dark Red, an epistolary barrage directed at past sexual partners, and Cry Baby, Kalale Dalton-Lutale's archival dig into her personal history.
Meanwhile, MainLine Theatre (3997 St-Laurent Blvd.) is keeping busy, with Late Night Double Feature( http://mainlinetheatre.ca/en/spectacles/late-night-double-feature ) (through Dec. 8), two one-act plays inspired by grindhouse cinema; The Living Room Sessions( http://mainlinetheatre.ca/en/spectacles/the-living-room-sessions-with-noelle-hannibal-and-ian-baird ) (Dec. 14), a cosy concert from musical theatre specialist Noelle Hannibal and pianist Ian Baird; and over in the Mini-Main the same evening, Dishonour on Your Cow( http://mainlinetheatre.ca/en/spectacles/silvi-santoso-dishonour-on-your-cow ), an evening of comedy storytelling from Silvi Santoso.
And don't forget, Centaur Theatre( https://centaurtheatre.com/shows/little-dickens/ ) is still hanging out with puppet master Ronnie Burkett and his very wonderful Scrooge spoof Little Dickens( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/theatre-have-yourself-a-filthy-little-christmas-with-little-dickens?preview_id=1640928&preview_nonce=216ea87334&_thumbnail_id=1643645 ), which has been extended to Dec. 21.

WINNIPEG FAN LONGS FOR HIS SHORTS PLEDGE TO END

Full text: WINNIPEG A casual bet about the Winnipeg Blue Bombers getting the ultimate Canadian Football League win has left one of their most dedicated fans in shorts for the past 18 years.
Chris Matthew has optimistically dusted off his old zubaz print pants from the 1980s in preparation of finally covering up his calves as the team prepares to square off with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the Grey Cup on Sunday in Calgary.
“Be careful of what you say, because if you have to live up to it sometimes it can be a little uncomfortable,” Matthew, 62, said with a hearty chuckle.
The long-suffering fan was dressed in black shorts, a Bombers jersey and light coat standing on his Winnipeg driveway as wet, cold snow fell around him Wednesday morning. The retired teacher recalled the fateful evening a week before the Grey Cup in 2001 when the Bombers had the best record in the CFL.
“I was still wearing shorts at the time and somebody asked, ‘How long are you going to wear those?’ ” Matthew said.
“I said, ‘Well until the Bombers win the Grey Cup.’ I figured it was a give-in.”
But the Bombers lost 27-19 to the Calgary Stampeders in Montreal.
“I’m still waiting to put pants back on,” Matthew said in a matter-of-fact tone.
Matthew has a closet full of different shorts to cover half of his legs during the harsh Prairie winters.
He has worn pants on a couple of occasions to funerals of people who did not know the story of the shorts.
If it’s a formal occasion, he wears his kilt.
Even when he was still teaching junior high, he wore the shorts to teach the children “don’t go flapping your gums and not back it up.”
“Most people just think there’s something wrong with me and I think maybe they are right,” Matthew said with a laugh.
As Matthew talks about all the activities that seem opposed to a life in shorts – shovelling in a blizzard as an example – his wife of 27 years, Darla Robinson, just shakes her head.
“I laugh every day. He’s ridiculous,” she said.
“I really didn’t think I’d be here 18 years later standing in shorts,” Matthew said.

A key focus for the Alberta-born, Toronto MP will be to oversee dealings with Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe.

The latest from the Trump impeachment hearings
All eyes will be on the U.S. ambassador to the European Union in today's impeachment hearings. Gordon Sondland faces questions over his role in what an increasing number of officials have described as a Ukraine pressure campaign to investigate President Donald Trump's political rival.
Sondland background: Two U.S. embassy staffers in Kyiv have said they were with Sondland at a restaurant when they overheard the ambassador and Trump discussing a need for "investigations" in a phone call.
Kurt Volker:The former special envoy to Ukrainerevised his testimonyyesterday to say he should have realized that a decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine was tied to a push to investigate ex-vice president and 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden. "In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently," Volker said.
In a column, Sarah Kendzior writes thatthe impeachment inquiry is not just about Ukraine, but "Trump's ceaseless and brutal effort to eliminate the inconvenient." And Lawrence Martin argues that"because of the descent of American media into two competing camps ... the public verdict on the impeachment issue is divided sharply along partisan lines."
The bail system in Northern Manitoba has 'collapsed,' a judge says
Thousands of people, most of whom are Indigenous, are forced to remain in Manitoba jails for days or weeks as they await a hearing. Many sit in crowded courtrooms all day, but are often sent on a 400-kilometre ride to the nearest detention centre when crowded courts close at 5 p.m.
The judge's comments came as part of a ruling in a case where a woman spent 51 days waiting for a bail hearing. Thebreakdown of the system"should shock the conscience of any reasonable person," Justice Chris Martin said.
Hong Kong: China's latest rebuke, plus a look at Ottawa-Beijing relations
China has warned Hong Kong that its courts must defer to Beijing on constitutional matters. The rebuke of the city's judiciary, which has a reputation for independence, followed a decision by a Hong Kong court that declared unconstitutional a law banning the use of masks worn by protesters in clashes with police.
Separately, a student group at Carleton University warned membersto avoid upsetting Chinese officials during a visit to the country's Ottawa embassy. The Carleton International Relations Society told gueststo "be aware of the sensitivity of key issues such as Hong Kong, Uyghurs, South China Sea and Taiwan."
In a column, Robyn Urback argues that Ottawa haslost its voiceon human rights in China: "Canada's moralizing has all but dried up - right at the time, coincidentally, when it is desperately warranted."

BoC issues warning on global debts:Heightened levels of worldwide debt could create a "perfect storm" of financial risk if trade wars trigger an economic slump, Bank of Canada senior deputy governorCarolyn Wilkins said. That would make a downturn "deeper than usual and fraught with financial stresses."
New Brunswick Premier defends abortion access:Blaine Higgs said hedoesn't believehis province has breached the Canada Health Act by declining to fund out-of-hospital abortions. The federal government is facing calls to act as a Fredericton clinic warns it's facing "impending closure" because of a lack of funding.
MORNING MARKETS
Investors rush to safe assets as Sino-U.S. tensions flare
World stocks wereknocked off 22-month highstoday as a renewed flare-up in U.S.-China tensions and the creeping return of U.S. recession fears fuelled a bid for bonds and other "safe" assets such as gold.
European equities tumbled half a per cent at the open, edging further off recent four-year highs hit when it had appeared Washington and Beijing were about to agree on the first phase of a trade deal. Wall Street futures were marked lower while oil prices suffered their biggest daily loss in seven weeks.
The mood in markets soured after the U.S. Senate angered China by passing a bill requiring annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy and warning Beijing against violently suppressing protesters. China demanded the United States stop interfering in its internal affairs and said it would retaliate.
U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened to up tariffs on Chinese goods if a trade deal is not reached soon.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Firing of Alberta elections watchdog borders on an abuse of power
Globe editorial: "The firing of Alberta's election commissioner by the United Conservative Party government of Jason Kenney is such an obviously poor decision that, in normal times, it would be reversed by the end of the week. But these are not normal times."
Climate-proofing Canada's economy
Jim Leech and Sean Cleary: "Canada cannot wait to establish the expertise required to navigate successfully to a low-carbon economy. If we delay, others will shape Canada's economic future for us." Leech is on the advisory board at the Institute for Sustainable Finance, while Cleary is its executive director.
TODAY'S EDITORIAL CARTOON
LIVING BETTER
What it's like to meet CanLit icons
The Globe caught upwith Ian Williams the morning after his Giller Prize win for his debut novel, Reproduction. The University of British Columbia professor was still giddy about his interactions at the gala ceremony. "I was a total fanboy: I got a photo with [Margaret] Atwood and told her things I've wanted to tell her forever, if I ever met her."
How would he describe the Gillers? "Remember when Sarah McLachlan did Lilith Fair in the nineties? It's like the Lilith Fair of writers across the country."
MOMENT IN TIME
Vanier Cup awarded for the first time
Nov. 20, 1965: The first game was held at Toronto's Varsity Stadium and pitted the Alberta Golden Bears against the Toronto Varsity Blues. It was a cold day, with a biting wind, but a decent crowd of 3,488 still showed up to watch the hometown Blues beat the visiting Bears 14 to 7 to become the recipients of the inaugural Vanier Cup, named after George Vanier, this country's first French-Canadian governor-general. For more than two decades, the game was played at the Toronto stadium before hitting the road in 1988. Since then, the cup has travelled from one end of the country to the other. It has been hoisted in a bone-chilling -36 C in Saskatoon (2006) and a blizzard in Hamilton two years later. Nasty weather aside, it's a high point for university athletes who this year - for the 55th Vanier Cup - will go head on Saturday at Telus-Université Laval Stadium in Quebec City, where the Montreal Carabins will face the Calgary Dinos. The Dinos will be seeking their first Vanier Cup title since 1995. Montreal last won the cup in 2014. (The forecast? A relatively balmy -3 C). - Gayle MacDonald

Full text: The Wednesday Moment in Time feature included an incorrect spelling for Canada’s former governorgeneral Georges Vanier, after whom the Vanier cup is named.

The first game was held at Toronto’s Varsity Stadium and pitted the Alberta Golden Bears against the Toronto Varsity Blues. It was a cold day, with a biting wind, but a decent crowd of 3,488 still showed up to watch the hometown Blues beat the visiting Bears 14 to 7 to become the recipients of the inaugural Vanier Cup, named after George Vanier, this country’s first French-Canadian governor-general.

Nasty weather aside, it’s a high point for university athletes who this year – for the 55th Vanier Cup – will go head on Saturday at Telus-Université Laval Stadium in Quebec City, where the Montreal Carabins will face the Calgary Dinos. The Dinos will be seeking their first Vanier Cup title since 1995. Montreal last won the cup in 2014. (The forecast? A relatively balmy -3 C). GAYLE MacDONALD

* * *
When I first heard Halloween was officially postponed in Montreal, I thought it was related to Bill 21 - and the fear some costumes might have non-Quebec values.
But it turned out we were just spooked by bad weather, the latest casualty of our growing paranoia about weather and all things.
Meanwhile, Laval and Ottawa faced down the same forecast and lived to tell the tale. What a Halloween horror!
"Halloween-gate" has been a porthole into several aspects of 21st-century modern life.
Partly it's about weather sensationalism, as the spread of competing weather channels and apps makes forecasts more omnipresent and frightening (though they still seem wrong half the time).
Every second day brings an extreme thunderstorm alert, heavy rainfall warning, heat advisory or wind, smog or fog warning. Or the likelihood of a possibility of a chance of an extreme no-laundry-on-the-clothesline alert.
The media gleefully pick up these forecast "possibilities" and hype them even more - and next thing you know we're all cancelling outdoor plans and sitting by our screens.
Halloween's forecast was typical overkill. There were overblown Wednesday news reports about biblical 70 mm rainstorms and 90 km/h winds expected over the "Halloween period."
Yet the actual forecast for trick-and-treat hours between 5:30-8:30 p.m. was just light wind and some 10 millimetres of rain. But City Hall got swept up in today's weather hysteria and reacted as if we were getting Hurricane Halloween.
So Halloween was postponed for rain, though we've all been out in blizzards where Frankenstein suits had to slide over snowsuits.
Our city's surrender to ordinary fall weather was slightly embarrassing. We've always had a rep as the party-hardy, weather-toughened town that scoffed at Toronto for bringing in the army during a routine snowstorm. But this time we were the weather wimps.
Staid old Ottawa faced an almost identical forecast to ours, with five degree colder temperatures, but refused to blink even after Montreal did.
Their mayor announced: ''I don't think rain is a reason to move Halloween."
Given our different response to Ontario's, is this a new distinct Quebec trait we can add to our province's new immigrant "values test"?
What day is Halloween?
A) Oct. 31
B) The day after Halloween
C) The first beautiful day after Halloween in November, or December ... or spring
Why did Valérie Plante decide to trust a 24-hour-away forecast anyway? I never do, or I wouldn't step outside. Was there a City Hall Halloween Advisory Committee Of Weather Wizards who voted on the chances of violent rain?
Whatever the reason, by 5 p.m. Thursday afternoon, with only light rain falling, Mayor Plante was probably praying for Noah's flood.
Some children I know were terribly upset at the delay because "Halloween is today!" and kids think about now, not tomorrow. One friend fought a war with his daughter after bowing to the city's decision.
"She said we weren't really committed to Halloween, that we weren't willing to get soaked like her - and she was probably right."
The irony is Halloween is our scary holiday filled with ghosts, ghouls, skeletons, and mock graves - and the standard Hollywood backdrop is fierce lightning storms. The scarier the weather, the more thrilling.
Many families insisted on going out illicitly on the traditional night so there were two Halloweens: the scary one and the supposedly safe one. But that robbed magic from both.
Yet Halloween's postponement is also symbolic of another 21st century trend, as we try to make the world an ever-more protected place for our kids and us.
Most cities now build ultra-safe, often sterile playground swings, slides and other equipment, designed more by safety specialists than play experts. Few kids are allowed to play street hockey, or walk to school alone as over-protection trumps adventure.
But where does safety stop and paranoia begin? As climate change makes weather more extreme, will future Halloweens be delayed because they're too cold, too hot, too scary or too dark?
If someone falls off a chair tomorrow while changing the clocks, will we ban the time change?
Thank goodness St. Patrick's Day refuses to give in to its traditionally awful weather. In 1993, over 41 cm of snow fell but the parade went on, which still sets a good Montreal example.
Each new safety precaution we take makes some logical sense in itself, but added up they can create an over-protective, unadventurous world for our kids and us.
Yet Mother Nature doesn't play by logical rules. Ironically, by early Friday afternoon a severe wind warning was in effect with gusts threatening to go to 100 km/h. Over 100,000 Montreal households were out of power for our new, improved Nov. 1 Halloween( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ).
But this time City Hall was wisely silent, a sign they'd learned something - and at least there wouldn't be three Halloweens.

Thursday's analyst upgrades and downgrades: Inside the Market's roundup of some of today's key analyst actions

Full text: Inside the Market's roundup of some of today's key analyst actions
Summit Industrial Income REIT(SMU-UN-T) received a "large gain" on the sale of its interests in three data centres in a $178-million transaction, said Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Rothschild.
On Wednesday after the bell, the Brampton, Ont.-based REIT announced the deal, which involves two facilities in the Greater Toronto Area and one in downtown Montreal, and projects it will generate "a significant realized gain" of approximately $42-million or 35 cents per unit, as well as the repayment of related working capital loans and mezzanine loans of approximately $62-million.
Calling the price tag "a significant premium to recently appraised values," Mr. Rothschild raised his rating for Summit Industrial to "buy" from "hold."
"The price .... allows Summit to extract capital from a business that was ultimately non-core and reinvest in its core industrial portfolio, both through acquisitions and new development," he said. "Management indicated that the REIT will pay a special distribution of 7 cents per unit on Oct. 2, 2019, which equates to 20 per cent of the realized gain. Summit will continue to be an investor in the development of data centers with Urbacon, although it will be a relatively small investment."
"While management had spoken positively about its entry into the data centre business, the opportunity to exit with a large gain, and reinvest in its core industrial portfolio, was a powerful motivator for the sale. In the near term, the sale will be FFO dilutive and will result in a material drop in leverage. As the proceeds are fully invested; however, FFO should recover. We have assumed that the capital is reinvested by year-end and therefore, while we have reduced our 2019 estimates slightly, there is no impact to our 2020 estimates."
Mr. Rothschild maintained a $14 target for Summit units. The average target on the Street is $13.48, according to Bloomberg data.
"We view Summit as an excellent vehicle to gain exposure to the strong Canadian industrial market, the GTA in particular," he said. "This should result in NAV rising over the next few years through internal growth. The unit price has declined 8.5% since early August and the units are currently trading at only a slight premium to NAV. Reflecting the more reasonable valuation, and an 18.7-per-cent forecast total return to our target price, we are upgrading our recommendation."
Elsewhere, keeping a "buy" rating, Desjardins Securities analyst Michael Markidis trimmed his target to $13.50 from $14.
"SMU entered the data-centre space as a passive capital provider (in partnership with Urbacon) in December 2017," said Mr. Markidis. "The initiative generated an attractive return; however, given the dramatic improvement in SMU's cost of capital subsequently, the strategic importance of the program was likely diminished in the eyes of management. The estimated proportion of total assets attributable to this segment falls to 1 per cent (from 10 per cent). The liberated capital should soon be redeployed to future acquisitions/developments of light industrial properties in SMU's target markets (GTA, Montreal and Alberta)."
"The impact to our spot NAV (slips by 10 cents to $10.60) is not material. However, owing to the disparity between the returns previously earned on data-centre investments (direct ownership and mezzanine loans) and what we believe is achievable in the Canadian industrial sector, we believe this initiative will negatively impact SMU's earnings power on a leverage-neutral basis. This view has been reflected in our revised FFO outlook."
=====
After reducing his financial projections following Wednesday's release of weaker-than-anticipated second-quarter results, CIBC World Markets analyst Matt Bank now thinks 2019 will be the second consecutive year of 20-per-cent EBITDA declines forRoots Corp.(ROOT-T).
"The major issues of 2019 have been related to the transition to a new distribution centre, and the costs are very large," he said. "H1 EBITDA was down $7-million, driven by deep discounting (GM% down 445 bps) to clean up older inventory not suited for the new DC. In addition, a slower ramp-up has impacted in-stock levels, resulting in lost sales and higher labour costs to catch up the rest of the year. Other issues include softness in Asia and China-U.S. tariffs.
"While these should normalize next year, implying significant upside in 2020, it is also possible that underlying brand weakness is partially responsible for the slower sales and deeper discounts. With Q3 and to a lesser extent Q4 results impacted, investors will need to wait until Q3/20 to see a 'clean' seasonally significant quarter without one-time issues."
Mr. Bank thinks Roots should display "solid recoveries lapping issues that are in large part transitory and fixable" in the fourth quarter he stressed the third quarter wull again be challenging," and he emphasized "visibility is limited."
"Free cash flow has also been constrained over F18-F19 due to higher capex (also largely DC-related)," the analyst said. "As this spending falls off and new / renovated stores slow, solid FCF should return, as was demonstrated consistently before last year. While leverage is elevated at 3.7 times net debt/EBITDA (or 4.5 times including leases), Roots is onside with covenants and this should improve seasonally through the year."
Maintaining a "neutral" rating for Roots shares, he lowered his target to $3.50 from $4.50, noting "soft results are offset by potential earnings upside and depressed valuation." The average on the Street is currently $3.19.
"We acknowledge material upside in earnings, and at 5 times to 6 times EBITDA the shares are trading near the low-end of peer ranges," said Mr. Bank. "Balancing the potential upside should operations normalize with deteriorating results and significant uncertainty ahead, our rating remains Neutral. We continue to apply a 6-times target EV/EBITDA multiple on our lowered 2019 forecast."
Elsewhere, BMO Nesbitt Burns analyst Stephen MacLeod lowered his target to $4 from $5.50 with an "outperform" rating.
Mr. MacLeod said: "We acknowledge that Roots may not be attractive at this point for GARP- or growth-oriented investors; however, given Roots' strong brand equity, the stock may be appealing for value investors, or even potentially strategic buyers.
"For long-term-oriented investors, we believe the stock has largely re-rated, and at 4.6 times 2020 estimated EV/EBITDA, we think presents decent risk-reward, but success for the stock rests on management execution."
=====
A "lower optimism" for zinc led Credit Suisse analyst Caio Ribeiro to downgrade his rating forNexa Resources S.A.(NEXA-N,NEXA-T) to "neutral" from "outperform."
"Zinc prices have been on a bumpy road this year coming from a high of $3,000 per ton to $2,341 per ton dragged down by incoming supply and trade war effects," the analyst said. "Meanwhile, Nexa's stock has remained under pressure (down 20 per cent year-to-date) mainly on the back of zinc and copper weakness but also as cash costs/t particularly for mining have been increasing considerably on a year-over-year basis (up 86 per cent year-over-year in 1H19)."
After updating his financial projections to account for its second-quarter results and higher-than-anticipated costs and expenses, Mr. Ribeiro lowered his target to US$11 from US$12.50. The current average on the Street is US$11.89.
"At this point, we see few reasons to believe in a zinc price rebound and mainly because of this we are downgrading Nexa," he said.
"We acknowledge that Nexa has an attractive and accretive growth ahead which we calculate should add an additional NPV of $2 per share, but we see valuations near 'fair' at 5.5 times EV/EBITDA 2019 and find it difficult for the stock to outperform without a significant rebound in zinc prices."
=====
Citing the "strong, above-expectations engagement" of the its recently launchedWorld of Warcraft Classicgame, Nomura Instinet's Andrew Marok became the third analyst this month to upgradeActivision Blizzard Inc.(ATVI-Q).
Moving the California-based video game maker to "buy" from "neutral," Mr. Marok said Warcraft's success in addition to new features added to its Overwatch game, create "a much more favorable backdrop heading into November's BlizzCon."
He raised his target to US$64 from US$59. The average is US$56.40.
=====
Following Wednesday's release of a "mixed" pre-feasibility study for its Railroad-Pinion project, PI Financial Corp. analyst Chris Thompson downgradedGold Standard Ventures Corp.(GSV-T) to "neutral" from "buy," calling it a "good start" but prompting a "retooling" of his valuation.
"Whilst we continue to view South Railroad as a mine in the making, and recognize the PFS as the first iteration of many economic studies (scope for optimization + refinement), we were too aggressive in our previously modelled expectations," he said. "We have adjusted our operating assumptions for Railroad (Pinion & Dark Star), pulling back on ounces modelled for the time being and have re-scoped our mine/processing plan in-line with the PFS. We plan to revisit our assumptions for South Railroad and rating for GSV after reviewing the PFS Technical Report anticipated within 45 days."
Mr. Thompson lowered his target to $1.30 from $2.60. The average is $2.48.
=====
Calling it "preferred vehicle for investors looking for international office exposure," BMO Nesbitt Burns analyst Jenny Ma initiated coverage ofDream Global Real Estate Investment Trust(DRG-UN-T) with an "outperform" rating and $17 target. The average is $16.36.
"In the eight years since its IPO, Dream Global has been exceptionally active in growing and evolving into one of the largest publicly traded European office portfolios," said Ms. Ma.
Ms. Ma also assumed coverage ofInovalis Real Estate Investment Trust(ION-UN-T) with a "market perform" rating and $10 target, falling from the firm's previous "outperform" rating and $11 target. The average is $10.25.
"We apply a 10-per-cent discount to NAV in arriving at our target price for Inovalis REIT to account for its smaller portfolio, lower liquidity, and greater near-term operational risk given that leases encompassing nearly half of the REIT's portfolio are due to mature through 2021, as well as greater economic uncertainty in Germany and to a lesser extent France," she said.
=====
In other analyst actions:
Macquarie analyst Ben Crowley upgradedAlacer Gold Corp.(ASR-T) to "outperform" from "underperform" with a target of $6.30, rising from $5.40. The current average on the Street is $6.54.

Highway 13 lawsuit: Quebec settles, Montreal says they are not liable

Full text: A Superior Court of Quebec judge signed off Wednesday on a settlement for motorists stuck on Highway 13 during a snowstorm on March 14, 2017, but the plaintiffs are still in a legal battle with the city of Montreal for compensation.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs were happy with the provincial government's settlement, which has agreed to pay between $350 and $1,375 per person, based in part on the number of hours they were stuck waiting to be rescued.
But the city of Montreal's lawyers "haven't even agreed to negotiate at all," said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Gabrielle Gagné, of Trudel Johnston & Lespérance. "They didn't settle, they had a chance to."
That leaves the plaintiffs - about 2,500 in all - no choice but to pursue the city in court, Gagné said.
"They felt that their case is strong, but we felt that our case is strong," Gagné said.
On Wednesday, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante reiterated that the incident occurred on Transport Québec territory and that city officials acted appropriately given the circumstances and are not liable.
Gagné said they expect to have a judge assigned to the case against the city in the fall.
The lawyers for the plaintiffs have received a lot of positive feedback about the Quebec settlement, but Gagné said some still feel it is an insufficient amount.
"Some members didn't understand that this amount was not final because we're continuing (the motions) against the city of Montreal," said Gagné.
Once the claim form becomes available online in the next month, people will have three months to complete it. It is expected that the complainants will be compensated in early 2020.

Full text: Circus, puppetry, Indigenous theatre and even professional wrestling will light up Le Diamant, the Quebec City theatre centre initiated by Robert Lepage, during the building's inaugural season this fall. Seven productions will be shown in short runs over a period of 10 weeks, in Le Diamant's black-box performance space.
The inclusion of a production by Menuentakuan, an Indigenous theatre company based in Montreal, makes good on Lepage's promise to showcase works by, and not merely about, Indigenous people. Last summer, Lepage drew widespread criticism for Kanata, a project about the history of relations between white people and Indigenous people, which included no Indigenous artists in the creative team or cast.
In a statement, Lepage described Le Diamant as an "antenna for new ideas" and a place for "the most audacious and innovative works." Bernard Gilbert, general manager and programmer, said in a phone interview that the new facility's first year will feature about 20 productions, plus numerous one-off events.
Instead of subscription sales, Gilbert said, Le Diamant will introduce itself to the city via relatively low ticket prices, and then pursue a model more often used by museums. "People will buy memberships that come with privileges," he said.
Le Diamant, built on the site of an old YMCA building near Quebec City's Place d'Youville, will begin its fall season on Sept. 9, with a remount of Lepage's seven-hour epic The Seven Streams of the River Ota.It's the first work Lepage made (in 1995) with his company Ex Machina, which is also Le Diamant's main resident ensemble. Flip Fabrique, a Quebec City circus troupe, follows on Sept. 24 with Blizzard, a "crazy, poetic and tender" meditation on winter in Quebec.
The first of three Pro Wrestling Galas for 2019-20 pits Ontario wrestler Shawn Spears against Quebec City's Matt Angel, on Oct. 5. Lepage has made no secret of his interest in pro wrestling as a form of theatre.
Menuentakuan's production of the Kevin Loring play Là où le sang se mêle opens on Oct. 8. The play, by the director of Indigenous theatre at the National Arts Centre, tells the story of an Indigenous person's return to their home reserve.
Montreal multimedia circus company Les 7 Doigts brings Passagers to Le Diamant on Oct. 18. The work, about trains and those who ride them, will play Sherbrooke's Salle Maurice-O'Bready two days earlier.
The Compagnia Finzi Pasca will give three performances of Per Te starting Oct. 30. The work is Daniele Finzi Pasca's theatrical tribute to his late wife, Julie Hamelin, a Québécoise and co-founder of Cirque Éloize.
The fall season ends with The Daisy Theatre, Ronnie Burkett's flashy, profane puppet musical revue, the content of which changes each night. The show opens Nov. 6.
Le Diamant, which includes offices, a space for show development and a restaurant, received about $49-million in capital funds from three levels of government. Mr. Gilbert said the final cost could be around $57-million, and that a fundraising campaign is on track to raise at least $10-million.

Toronto unveils 'resilience' strategy to counteract future effects of climate change on city: Strategy aims to mitigate effects of climate change, eliminate poverty, build green infrastructure and increases government transparency

Full text: The city of Toronto unveiled a broad set of recommendations on Tuesday to counter and manage the effects of climate change as part of its "resilience" strategy, a set of principles meant to guide decision-making in city hall.
The strategy includes other lofty goals: eliminating poverty, building green infrastructure and increasing government transparency.
Climate change will affect weather over Toronto and the city will need to invest in ways to adapt to significant meteorological changes, said the city's chief resilience officer, Elliott Cappell, who was in charge of writing the 157-page document.
"Toronto is getting hotter, wetter and wilder, and of course that's a result of climate change," he said.
In the coming years, the city's climate is expected to become more violent and less predictable. Extreme weather events, like heat waves and violent rainstorms, are projected to become more common. On Sunday, Lake Ontario water levels hit their highest point ever recorded and parts of the Toronto Islands were flooded. It's the second time in three years that the city has seen such severe flooding.
The announcement of the resilience strategy did not come with any dollar amounts attached and it is unclear what specific effects it will have in countering the effects of climate change or in addressing the strategy's other goals.
In the coming decades, the population of Toronto is projected to grow, hitting 3.4 million people by the 2040s. Growing social inequality means that some populations will be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than others. To deal with these changes, Mr. Cappell said it will become more important to invest in ways to adapt to climate change.
"In Canada, pretty much everywhere, a large portion of our leadership and our effort is spent on climate change mitigation - that is, decreasing our impact on the environment," he said. "On the adaptation side, we don't have the same investment. We haven't necessarily had to, but that is changing."
Tuesday's announcement cemented Toronto as a "resilient city" - one of 97 around the world. It joined the ranks of cities such as Milan, Honolulu, Rio de Janeiro and Paris - all part of the 100 Resilient Cities network, an organization set up and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation.
In Canada, other cities in the network include Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver, all of which have also committed to becoming more resilient - a broad term loosely defined as a city's ability to respond to shocks like climate change but including anything from terrorist attacks to blizzards.
"It's a term that comes from ecology. A resilient ecosystem is one that can survive through time. Often that comes from the biodiversity of the system," Mr. Cappell said.
Alex Versluis, senior vice-president of property development and management at the YMCA of Greater Toronto, who was present at the announcement Tuesday, said his organization is applying the principles in the resilience strategy on the ground. Generators are being installed in YMCAs across the city, allowing them to act as shelters in the event of a power outage.
Mr. Versluis said he saw the effects of climate change while in New York in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy where YMCA locations opened their doors to people who didn't have power.
"It's just a piece of the puzzle in that response fabric," he said.
Ray Park, communications adviser at the City of Toronto, said Tuesday in an e-mail that the city's Resilience Office and various city divisions will take the lead in implementing the resilience strategy.
He said the city will develop guidelines for "applying a climate lens" in the city's capital planning process. Toronto will also develop more localized plans to prepare for extreme weather.
Toronto Mayor John Tory told reporters at a separate presentation on Tuesday that the city has hundreds of millions of dollars set aside to invest in climate change mitigation measures over the next 10 years.
"This strategy adds some additional ideas to things we had already taken on board as to the need for us to prepare ourselves better for different kinds of flooding that happen across the city caused by unusual weather patterns and by the growth in the city," the mayor said.
But there's more to resilient cities than just vision statements, according to Kevin Manaugh, an academic who studies urban transportation and the environment at McGill University in Montreal.
"It's easy to call yourself a resilient city. It's easy to use a buzzword and say we're going to be resilient or aim towards resiliency, but it has to be backed up by actual investments in sustainable infrastructure and changes in things like energy use and things like emissions," he said.

Review: Florence and the Machine feed off Montreal fans' hunger

Full text: About a third of the way into Florence and the Machine's commanding Bell Centre show Tuesday, Florence Welch stopped spinning long enough to praise her fans: "I feel like you're giving as much as I am." It's no criticism of an enthusiastic audience to say it wasn't even close.
For nearly two hours, Welch gave a gale-force performance that blended possessed fervour and crowd-pleasing glee. For return customers( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/concert-review-florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-beautiful ), her spectacular charisma was nothing new, and yet it always is: Welch's stamina, elation and holy roar have few peers. And with every visit, her constant motion inches closer to the realm of modern dance, straddling the line between refined and visceral, much like the miniature orchestra sharing the stage.
She knows how to build anticipation, taking the room's temperature while the initially muted June escalated to a double-percussion attack as lights blazed through a slatted backdrop. Welch's sudden burst of physicality at the climax had the power of an exorcism and was soothed by a soulful Hunger, the bionic-lunged singer skipping across the stage without a trace of breathlessness.
If Welch had been rooted in place, she would have been riveting for her golden voice alone. Her vibrato sliced through the Bell Centre, but she left ample room for her eight-piece band. The billowing arrangements boasted an exceptionally rare dynamic range, and not just by arena standards. At its most sophisticated - the passionate nostalgia of South London Forever, a tense 100 Years - this was high art filtered through a chamber-pop prism.
And yet Welch remained within reach of her audience. Soon after taking a running leap off the riser in Queen of Peace, she seemed sincerely awestruck by a prolonged ovation. "I'm English ... we're not good with praise," she said endearingly, "unless a sarcastic joke added at the end makes you feel bad. So if you've got any ... 'Yeah, keep twirling!' "
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine in Montreal on Tuesday, May 28, 2019.
A mighty Dog Days Are Over was especially galvanizing, with Welch pleading for phones to be pocketed and the general-admission floor taking up her invitation to jump for the sky. Later on, she dashed to the back of the floor in Delilah, living up to her words about breaking down divisions between stage and audience as she danced through the crowd on her return.
But she was more than capable of toning down. Dedicated to Patti Smith, Patricia was scaled back from the heart-racing clatter of the version on last year's High as Hope album. No Choir sounded full and warm with little more than voice and harp. The Game of Thrones ballad Jenny of Oldstones was "for Arya Stark," its Celtic shimmer silencing the room.
Cosmic Love was both humble and huge, with Welch thanking longtime fans for "keeping this song safe" for 10 years. She didn't overstate matters: it takes a special artist and devoted audience to shepherd music with such precious fragility into an arena without crushing it.
Big God was a further sign of Welch's delicate touch, the penultimate number anchored by ominous piano as a confetti shower drifted down like gold dust, in contrast to the typical cannoned blizzards. The cleansing Shake It Out that followed brought it all together: the vulnerability, the drama, the singular singer who can stand at the heart of a unified room.

Full text: About a third of the way into Florence and the Machine's commanding Bell Centre show Tuesday, Florence Welch stopped spinning long enough to praise her fans: "I feel like you're giving as much as I am." It's no criticism of an enthusiastic audience to say it wasn't even close.
For nearly two hours, Welch gave a gale-force performance that blended possessed fervour and crowd-pleasing glee. For return customers( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/concert-review-florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-beautiful ), her spectacular charisma was nothing new, and yet it always is: Welch's stamina, elation and holy roar have few peers. And with every visit, her constant motion inches closer to the realm of modern dance, straddling the line between refined and visceral, much like the miniature orchestra sharing the stage.
She knows how to build anticipation, taking the room's temperature while the initially muted June escalated to a double-percussion attack as lights blazed through a slatted backdrop. Welch's sudden burst of physicality at the climax had the power of an exorcism and was soothed by a soulful Hunger, the bionic-lunged singer skipping across the stage without a trace of breathlessness.
If Welch had been rooted in place, she would have been riveting for her golden voice alone. Her vibrato sliced through the Bell Centre, but she left ample room for her eight-piece band. The billowing arrangements boasted an exceptionally rare dynamic range, and not just by arena standards. At its most sophisticated - the passionate nostalgia of South London Forever, a tense 100 Years - this was high art filtered through a chamber-pop prism.
And yet Welch remained within reach of her audience. Soon after taking a running leap off the riser in Queen of Peace, she seemed sincerely awestruck by a prolonged ovation. "I'm English ... we're not good with praise," she said endearingly, "unless a sarcastic joke added at the end makes you feel bad. So if you've got any ... 'Yeah, keep twirling!' "
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine in Montreal on Tuesday, May 28, 2019.
A mighty Dog Days Are Over was especially galvanizing, with Welch pleading for phones to be pocketed and the general-admission floor taking up her invitation to jump for the sky. Later on, she dashed to the back of the floor in Delilah, living up to her words about breaking down divisions between stage and audience as she danced through the crowd on her return.
But she was more than capable of toning down. Dedicated to Patti Smith, Patricia was scaled back from the heart-racing clatter of the version on last year's High as Hope album. No Choir sounded full and warm with little more than voice and harp. The Game of Thrones ballad Jenny of Oldstones was "for Arya Stark," its Celtic shimmer silencing the room.
Cosmic Love was both humble and huge, with Welch thanking longtime fans for "keeping this song safe" for 10 years. She didn't overstate matters: it takes a special artist and devoted audience to shepherd music with such precious fragility into an arena without crushing it.
Big God was a further sign of Welch's delicate touch, the penultimate number anchored by ominous piano as a confetti shower drifted down like gold dust, in contrast to the typical cannoned blizzards. The cleansing Shake It Out that followed brought it all together: the vulnerability, the drama, the singular singer who can stand at the heart of a unified room.

Cosmic Love was both humble and huge, with Welch thanking longtime fans for "keeping this song safe" for 10 years. She didn't overstate matters: it takes a special artist and devoted audience to shepherd music with such precious fragility into an arena without crushing it.
Big God was a further sign of Welch's delicate touch, the penultimate number anchored by ominous piano as a confetti shower drifted down like gold dust, in contrast to the typical cannoned blizzards. The cleansing Shake It Out that followed brought it all together: the vulnerability, the drama, the singular singer who can stand at the heart of a unified room.

Full text: About a third of the way into Florence and the Machine's commanding Bell Centre show Tuesday, Florence Welch stopped spinning long enough to praise her fans: "I feel like you're giving as much as I am." It's no criticism of an enthusiastic audience to say it wasn't even close.
For nearly two hours, Welch gave a gale-force performance that blended possessed fervour and crowd-pleasing glee. For return customers( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/concert-review-florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-beautiful ), her spectacular charisma was nothing new, and yet it always is: Welch's stamina, elation and holy roar have few peers. And with every visit, her constant motion inches closer to the realm of modern dance, straddling the line between refined and visceral much like the miniature orchestra sharing the stage.
She knows how to build anticipation, taking the room's temperature while the initially muted June escalated to a double-percussion attack as lights blazed through a slatted backdrop. Welch's sudden burst of physicality at the climax had the power of an exorcism and was soothed by a soulful Hunger, the bionic-lunged singer skipping across the stage without a trace of breathlessness.
If Welch had been rooted in place, she would have been riveting for her golden voice alone. Her vibrato sliced through the Bell Centre, and yet she left ample room for her eight-piece band. The billowing arrangements boasted an exceptionally rare dynamic range, and not just by arena standards. At its most sophisticated - the passionate nostalgia of South London Forever, a tense 100 Years - this was high art filtered through a chamber-pop prism.
And yet Welch remained within reach of her audience. Soon after taking a running leap off the riser in Queen of Peace, she seemed sincerely awestruck by a prolonged ovation. "I'm English ... we're not good with praise," she said endearingly, "unless a sarcastic joke added at the end makes you feel bad. So if you've got any ... 'Yeah, keep twirling!' "
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine in Montreal on Tuesday, May 28, 2019.
A mighty Dog Days Are Over was especially galvanizing, with Welch pleading for phones to be pocketed and the general-admission floor taking up her invitation to jump for the sky. Later on, she dashed to the back of the floor in Delilah, living up to her words about breaking down divisions between stage and audience as she danced through the crowd on her return.
But she was more than capable of toning down. Dedicated to Patti Smith, Patricia was scaled back from the heart-racing clatter of the version on last year's High as Hope album. The Game of Thrones ballad Jenny of Oldstones was "for Arya Stark," its Celtic shimmer silencing the room.
Cosmic Love was both humble and huge, with Welch thanking longtime fans for "keeping this song safe" for 10 years. She didn't overstate matters: it takes a special artist and devoted audience to bring music with such precious fragility into an arena without crushing it.

Northbound on a flight that's a lifeline for the Inuit

Full text: The aircraft rumbles over the sea, banking toward snow-capped cliffs as it makes its final descent toward Salluit.
After a day of easy flying, the crosswinds have come alive, drowning out the sky in an icy fog. But Melissa Haney guides the plane with a cool hand, calm in the knowledge that she's done this hundreds of times.
She's at the helm of a 1991 Bombardier Dash 8 - a plane designed to take off and land on short runways, hit a maximum speed of 515 kilometres an hour while carrying up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, 45 passengers and an assortment of salty snacks.
Even so, as it hovers along the Hudson Strait - where the winds can reach up to 180 kilometres an hour in the winter - any illusion of technology having mastered Quebec's northern frontier disappears.
"This isn't so bad," Haney says. "Sometimes it's so windy we couldn't land even if we tried. Up here, Mother Nature decides when we fly. The sooner you get used to that idea, the better off you and your crew will be."
"This job is special. You're not just flying a plane full of tourists to Mexico to party for a week," says Melissa Haney, the first female Inuk pilot to reach the rank of captain.
The Dash touches down in Salluit as dusk settles over the village, ending a day that began 12 hours, seven landings and 1,854 kilometres ago in Montreal.
As one of Air Inuit's captains, Haney's job is to connect Montreal to the north. A flight from the south can reunite families on the Hudson coast, bring in medicine to a remote Inuit village or drop a shipment of new hockey sticks just in time for a youth tournament.
Each year, there are about 7,000 Air Inuit flights to, from and between northern villages. They carry 150,000 passengers and over 12 million kilos in cargo across the sprawling tundra annually.
For the 12,000 Inuit who populate Quebec's north, the Montreal-based airline is an essential service connecting 14 Inuit villages over a landmass twice the size of England. It's also a lifeline to Montreal itself, where a community of roughly 600 to 1,000 Inuit live at any given moment.
The city's Inuk population is larger than many of the 14 northern communities. Now a grassroots movement is underway to have the federal and provincial governments formally recognize Montreal as an Inuit community.
In essence, to be Inuit in 2019 is to have a foot in both worlds, north and south.
Haney lives that duality.
Melissa Haney is often at the helm of a Bombardier Dash 8 - a plane designed to take off and land on short runways and carry lots of cargo. "Sometimes we take people to bury their loved ones or maybe there was a death in one of the villages and we let everyone off the plane so they can pay their respects."
Tuesday, February 12, 2019, 7:40 a.m., Trudeau International Airport
Betty Tuckatuck is headed north to bury her sister.
"I wish it were different, I wish I was just visiting," says Tuckatuck. "Instead I'm going to say goodbye to someone I love."
Tuckatuck doesn't know much about why her sister Marlene died and she wants answers. She says Marlene went to the nursing station in Kuujjuarapik last week, crippled by a pain in her gut.
Without a doctor in the village, she would have to be transferred to a hospital in Puvirnituq 530 kilometres up the coast or wait for a flight south to Montreal.
"She died on her bathroom floor," Tuckatuck says. "She was waiting for paramedics."
Tuckatuck has been splitting her time between Montreal, where she lives, and her job at the Glencore nickel mine near Salluit.
But today she's heading back to the village where, as a child, she learned to hunt, fish and survive on the icy shores of Hudson Bay. She sits next to her friend Mina and waits to board Air Inuit flight 802 northbound.
The airline began as a sort of pipe dream, an Inuit-owned service founded to connect villages scattered across the northern wilderness. In 1978, Air Inuit's fleet was a single-engine, six-seat bush plane designed to land on water.
Forty years later, the airline runs daily flights from Montreal up the Hudson coast, into Ungava Bay and back down to the city - employing Inuit pilots, air traffic controllers and baggage handlers across the north.
The company's emergence mirrors a demographic explosion in Nunavik. Between 1996 and 2016, the population in Quebec's northernmost region grew by 38 per cent.
During that same period, Canada's population experienced a net growth of just 1.2 per cent.
A young, vibrant Inuit population means more people travelling south to attend college, seek employment or simply try their hand at living in Canada's second-largest city for awhile.
Despite high school dropout rates around three times the provincial average, more Inuit are enrolled in post-secondary education now than at any point in Nunavik's history.
Meanwhile, a growing population means more flights to bring in teachers, nurses, doctors and engineers to help expand services in the north. But funding for this expansion hasn't kept pace with population growth.
Last year, Quebec's ombudsman released a scathing report on housing in the north, saying overcrowded living conditions are making it nearly impossible for Inuit children to succeed in school.
Growing pains notwithstanding, the north is becoming increasingly linked to Quebec's urban south. For someone like Tuckatuck, it's not uncommon to travel up and down the coast a dozen times in the same year.
There are no frills in the northbound gates of the Trudeau Airport, no $5 double espressos or duty-free shops selling Cartier watches to American tourists.
It is purely a functional space. Vinyl-covered seats face vending machines that dispense orange soda and candy bars to hunters dressed in rubber boots and snow pants.
Melissa Haney walks by the gate with a smile on her face, waving at a passenger.
"Hey Melissa!" she exclaims.
Haney is the first female Inuk pilot to reach the rank of captain. She earned her wings in 2017 and has become something of a celebrity in Nunavik. But to her passengers, many of whom remember her from her days as a flight attendant for the airline, she is known simply as Melissa.
"This job is special. You're not just flying a plane full of tourists to Mexico to party for a week," she says. "The other day, we brought a six-day-old baby back (up north) from the hospital (in Montreal)."
Many women still come south to give birth or if their baby is born premature.
"Sometimes we take people to bury their loved ones or maybe there was a death in one of the villages and we let everyone off the plane so they can pay their respects. It takes a little longer but we have to adapt to life in the north."
Camille Lapointe oversees the Dash 8's refuelling. She covers her face to shield it from the wind.
11 a.m., Kuujjuarapik Airport
Haney steps out of the aircraft and takes a deep breath.
"The air is different, it feels fresher, it feels sharper than down south," Haney says. "When you land from Montreal and open the plane door, it feels like you're in a different world."
Just a few hundred metres away, sheets of ice the size of football fields shift and crackle from the Hudson Bay into the sea.
Haney stands under the plane's left wing and places her hand on its propellers, inspecting each blade. The runways in Nunavik don't have the same smooth finish as the ones down south. The surface tends to be covered in gravel and landing on it presents the risk of nicking the Dash 8's propellers or fuselage.
"In many ways, we're a big airline but when we're out here, we do a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves," Haney says.
As Haney inspects the plane, her co-pilot Camille Lapointe oversees the Dash 8's refuelling. Lapointe covers her face with a scarf to shield it from the wind.
On the runway, workers unload crates of food that just arrived from the city, stacking boxes of Kellogg's breakfast cereal, V8 tomato juice and granola bars in a nearby hangar.
The air delivery of food, mail, medicine and essential goods to the north is part of a fragile supply chain that's constantly threatened by poor weather conditions. A whiteout can ground flights, passengers and their precious cargo for days at a time.
Haney recounts one of her first emergency landings. She was a bush pilot, flying hunters in from a camp near Salluit when fog settled over the tundra.
"We had to improvise and wound up finding an abandoned air strip about a mile outside Salluit," Haney says. "There was an old cabin and we settled in, warmed up and ate army rations for awhile."
One of her passengers took them on a trek into the fog and they wound up tracking a herd of caribou, hunting one and harvesting its meat.
"We ate from the land and it was just this really, this incredibly unique experience," Haney says. "When the fog cleared, we packed the plane and brought back enough meat to share with the community."
1:15 p.m., Inukjuak
The aircraft has reached capacity on the last stop before landing near the hospital in Puvirnituq.
Passengers shuffle onto the aircraft with manilla folders full of medical documents, stopping to chat up a cousin or neighbour along the way. Some recognize the flight attendant, Isabelle Nolasco, and they exchange greetings in Inuktitut.
While Haney and Lapointe navigate the skies, Nolesco is the lone flight attendant on board.
Some aspects of that job are indistinguishable from the duties of any flight attendant at a regional airline: safety demonstrations punctuated with graceful hand motions, stowing luggage like Tetris blocks and bribing small children with cookies.
But Nolesco is also trained to assist on medical evacuations for patients urgently requiring surgery in a Montreal trauma centre.
"If the patient is stable, we're generally the ones to take them south," says Nolesco, who has been with the airline for 20 years. "You might see a man who has two broken legs in the back of the flight. We're equipped to carry a baby in an incubator, really any patient that isn't in a life-threatening situation."
"Sometimes we do two, three medevacs a week. It's just a part of the job."
Baggage handlers unload cargo in an Inuit village near the Hudson Strait.
5:50 p.m., Ivujivik Airport
The night wind picks waves of snow off the coast and brushes them past the airfield.
Just as it begins to recede over the horizon, sunlight blends into the icy haze and cloaks the runway in a pale blue fog. For a moment, it looks as though the Dash 8 has landed at the bottom of the sea.
Lapointe stands on a stepladder under the aircraft's right wing, using her exposed hands to fiddle with gauges and the fuel pump. Meanwhile, a baggage handler shines his flashlight into the cargo to help the other two hustle boxes into an idling truck.
The wind is merciless, searing every trace of exposed skin.
"You have to look at it as an adventure, as something so few pilots get to experience," says Lapointe, now 28.
7:50 p.m., Salluit
Haney parks the company pickup in a driveway overlooking the airstrip and helps unload the crew's luggage from the truck into their staff house.
In some villages, Haney stays with friends or family but tonight - after a long day - she'll stay with the other crew members ahead of an early flight back to Montreal in the morning.
The airport in Salluit serves as the mid-point for Haney's loop around the north.
After stopping in seven villages along the Hudson coast, the crew will head back south on the George River route, landing in seven Inuit villages tucked along Ungava Bay, the iron mining town of Schefferville near Labrador, Quebec City and then Montreal.
Some flights head up the George River route from Montreal and back down the Hudson coast the following day.
Her journeys up and down the tundra are one of the ways Haney reconnects with her roots.
Haney was eight years old when her family moved south from Inukjuak. Most of the Inuktitut she could speak has been lost but her bond to the north remains strong.
"Back then, the quality of education you could get up north wasn't so great," says Haney. "So my mom took us south. Maybe it would have been different today. (Nunavik) is still a huge part of who I am.
"When you talk to people down south, they don't know much about how things are up here. They only see the social problems. And those are very real but I get to see the beauty as well.
"When I'm up here, I get to go out on the land, I see family and my close friends. This job allows me to live in both worlds - the north and the south. And that's the reality for more and more people."

Wednesday, February 13, 2019, 7:45 a.m., Salluit Airport: control tower
Yuliusie Papigatuk leans back in his chair and watches the sun rise above fjord. It softens the rocky edges with a pink glow.
On the runway, just a few feet below his desk, a team of baggage handlers load the Dash 8 ahead of its flight to Deception Bay.
Papigatuk looks out for Haney and the other pilots, to keep in touch with the network of control towers along the coast and watch weather patterns that might threaten their flights.
"We get weather in a flash up here," says Papigatuk. "Sometimes the planes won't move for two, three days or even a week during the springtime. ... Once we get strong winds from the north, it'll drown out visibility and flood the runway.
"Sometimes we have to close the airport, the access road and use snowmobiles to get from our homes to here."
Papigatuk says he remembers the first time he saw Haney nearly 20 years ago. Back then, she was still a flight attendant with Air Inuit.
"There was a dog race in one of the communities, so I see this young woman standing on the plane, surrounded by sled dogs," he says. "There were just dogs everywhere and she couldn't help but smile."
Across the room, Elaisa Alaku scrolls through her phone and listens to country music from the local radio station.
Today, she says, is the second anniversary of the day she earned her pilot's licence. Alaku flies Twin Otter planes up and down Ungava Bay for Air Inuit - carrying cargo, passengers and patients between villages.
She says Haney was one of the reasons she chose to move south and attend flight school in St-Hubert.
"She's awesome," says Alaku. "I only sort of remember my first flight: I could feel the adrenaline rushing through my body. It's windy and bumpy up there, there's low visibility sometimes, but when (the sky clears) it's the most beautiful scenery you could imagine."
Alaku's flight pattern, where she pilots a smaller aircraft up and down Ungava Bay, is one of the most gruelling for Air Inuit's pilots.
In some shifts, she will take off and land up to 14 times, linking places like Aupaluk - a village of fewer than 200 residents - to regional hubs like Kuujjuaq - an administrative capital with 2,800 people, a hospital and amenities similar to ones found in most southern cities.
In a few minutes, Alaku will board Haney's plane so she can babysit for her brother in Kuujjuaq that day.
"I'm a full-time pilot, part-time babysitter," she says.
"She's my little love," says Julie Goguen of her 4-month-old, Jamie. "I'm going to see the doctor (in Kuujjuaq) but I can't leave this one. Not for a minute."
10:04 a.m., Quaqtaq Airport
A police officer steps out of the aircraft and returns, moments later, guiding a prisoner by the arm.
"I don't know what he was arrested for, my job is just to get him to Kuujjuaq so he can be detained until his hearing (in Montreal)," the officer says. "That's all I can say."
He turns to the prisoner.
"All the way to the back, please."
"Thank you," the young man replies.
In a few moments, they're walking back up the aisle so the prisoner can use the washroom. They look less like opponents on opposite sides of the law than an old married couple - slightly annoyed with one another but also bound to each other.
A part of flying the Nunavik run means occasionally bringing prisoners south to attend hearings in Montreal, Quebec City or to the detention centre in Kuujjuaq.
Julie Goguen sports a thick parka as she boards the aircraft. Jamie, Goguen's four-month-old, is nestled in a pouch sewn onto her coat. She pokes her head out and looks wide-eyed around the cabin.
"She's my little love," Goguen says. "I'm going to see the doctor (in Kuujjuaq) but I can't leave this one. Not for a minute."
Air travel is a huge part of Goguen's life. Given that Air Inuit is owned by Makivik Corporation - a sort of Inuit co-op created by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement in 1978 - Nunavik residents can get discounts on up to four flights per year.
Goguen says she uses all of those discounts and tries to fly to Montreal a few times a year so she can visit her family there.
"That's just how it is now. There are Inuit in the south and the north," she says. "This is how we stay connected."
A baggage handler stands over the remains of a polar bear, wrapped in plastic bags.
11:34 a.m., Tasiujaq Airport
On the final stop before landing in Kuujjuaq, a pair of baggage handlers load an unusual package into the hold: the remains of a polar bear that wandered too close to town.
It sits wrapped in plastic, splayed between hockey bags and crates of mail, bound for Quebec City.
Neither of the handlers can say why it's headed to the provincial capital.
With climate change effectively shrinking their habitat, it isn't uncommon for bears to wander into villages. Locals try to avoid killing them when possible but polar bears can be extremely aggressive.
To live in the north, one of the handlers says, is to have a much closer relationship to the land and everything that lives off it. Often that relationship is of the predator, prey variety.
"You're not in the city anymore," one of the baggage handlers says. "Up here we don't play with our food."
12:20 p.m., Kuujjuaq Aiport
Haney walks into the employees lounge and brews a pot of coffee for her co-workers.
As she sits down to a cold chicken sandwich, someone from the airport hands her a clipboard.
"Human remains," the woman says.
Haney signs the document and gets back to her lunch. For its last three legs into Montreal, Air Inuit flight 820 southbound will carry a body so that it can be unloaded, delivered to the morgue and examined by the Quebec coroner's office.
There is no information about why it will need to undergo an autopsy. And perhaps, for the crew, it is better that way.
"Sometimes the coffin is really small and you know it belonged to a child," says Nolasco. "Those are hard."
Nunavik and its villagers are tied by blood, marriage and friendships that go back generations. A death in one village reverberates across the north.
"There is an incredible sense of community up here," Haney says. "To see the way people in a village care for one another in their grief, is ... it's not something you see in too many places."
Given the extreme weather conditions, accidental deaths are far more common in Nunavik than they are in the south. One study, by Université Laval, found that accidents account for 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with 3.0 per 10,000 in the rest of the province.
And then there is the suicide crisis.
Last year, Kuujjuaq was rocked by a wave of suicides that forced an emergency meeting with community leaders from across Nunavik and representatives from the Quebec government.
There is hope in the north but the legacy of residential schools, underfunded social programs and the forced relocation of Inuit from the land into settlements has left a deep wound in its wake.
"You can't help but see some of the problems and want to help and want to be a force for good," Haney says.
8:11 p.m., Trudeau International Airport
The Dash 8 glides into Montreal just as a blizzard makes one final push over the city.
It is the 15th time Haney will land the aircraft in under 36 hours - an exhausting feat for even the most experienced pilot. This time, she'll navigate the tail end of a storm that has delayed dozens of flights coming in and out of Dorval.
"I don't even want to think about how much snow is on my car," Nolesco says. "That's the real challenge."
In a few minutes, the crew will see the last dozen passengers off, clean the aircraft, finish their paperwork and go home to their families. Haney, who lives in the Eastern Townships, says she can't wait to kiss her two children goodnight and take a warm shower.
Lately, Haney says, she's been taking on less flying and focusing on a role in management at the airline. She wants to continue mentoring Indigenous youth and women who may not know that a career in aviation is possible.
"When I started out as a flight attendant, I didn't even realize becoming a pilot was an option," Haney says. "But you start working these routes and you fall in love with the job. I knew right away I wanted to be in aviation for the rest of my career.
"Now we're seeing more and more Inuit getting their pilot's licence, taking the steps to be a part of something greater than all of us. I'm proud to be a part of that.
"As a pilot, you're not doing anything heroic or special but you play a role in connecting these communities to the south and to each other. You look at yourself as a tiny part of this great big northern territory and you're humbled."

Full text: The aircraft rumbles over the sea, banking toward snow-capped cliffs as it makes its final descent toward Salluit.
After a day of easy flying, the crosswinds have come alive, drowning out the sky in an icy fog. But Melissa Haney guides the plane with a cool hand, calm in the knowledge that she's done this hundreds of times.
She's at the helm of a 1991 Bombardier Dash 8 - a plane designed to take off and land on short runways, hit a maximum speed of 515 kilometres an hour while carrying up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, 45 passengers and an assortment of salty snacks.
Even so, as it hovers along the Hudson Strait - where the winds can reach up to 180 kilometres an hour in the winter - any illusion of technology having mastered Quebec's northern frontier disappears.
"This isn't so bad," Haney says. "Sometimes it's so windy we couldn't land even if we tried. Up here, Mother Nature decides when we fly. The sooner you get used to that idea, the better off you and your crew will be."
"This job is special. You're not just flying a plane full of tourists to Mexico to party for a week," says Melissa Haney, the first female Inuk pilot to reach the rank of captain.
The Dash touches down in Salluit as dusk settles over the village, ending a day that began 12 hours, seven landings and 1,854 kilometres ago in Montreal.
As one of Air Inuit's captains, Haney's job is to connect Montreal to the north. A flight from the south can reunite families on the Hudson coast, bring in medicine to a remote Inuit village or drop a shipment of new hockey sticks just in time for a youth tournament.
Each year, there are about 7,000 Air Inuit flights to, from and between northern villages. They carry 150,000 passengers and over 12 million kilos in cargo across the sprawling tundra annually.
For the 12,000 Inuit who populate Quebec's north, the Montreal-based airline is an essential service connecting 14 Inuit villages over a landmass twice the size of England. It's also a lifeline to Montreal itself, where a community of roughly 600 to 1,000 Inuit live at any given moment.
The city's Inuk population is larger than many of the 14 northern communities. Now a grassroots movement is underway to have the federal and provincial governments formally recognize Montreal as an Inuit community.
In essence, to be Inuit in 2019 is to have a foot in both worlds, north and south.
Haney lives that duality.
Melissa Haney is often at the helm of a Bombardier Dash 8 - a plane designed to take off and land on short runways and carry lots of cargo. "Sometimes we take people to bury their loved ones or maybe there was a death in one of the villages and we let everyone off the plane so they can pay their respects."
Tuesday, February 12, 2019, 7:40 a.m., Trudeau International Airport
Betty Tuckatuck is headed north to bury her sister.
"I wish it were different, I wish I was just visiting," says Tuckatuck. "Instead I'm going to say goodbye to someone I love."
Tuckatuck doesn't know much about why her sister Marlene died and she wants answers. She says Marlene went to the nursing station in Kuujjuarapik last week, crippled by a pain in her gut.
Without a doctor in the village, she would have to be transferred to a hospital in Puvirnituq 530 kilometres up the coast or wait for a flight south to Montreal.
"She died on her bathroom floor," Tuckatuck says. "She was waiting for paramedics."
Tuckatuck has been splitting her time between Montreal, where she lives, and her job at the Glencore nickel mine near Salluit.
But today she's heading back to the village where, as a child, she learned to hunt, fish and survive on the icy shores of Hudson Bay. She sits next to her friend Mina and waits to board Air Inuit flight 802 northbound.
The airline began as a sort of pipe dream, an Inuit-owned service founded to connect villages scattered across the northern wilderness. In 1978, Air Inuit's fleet was a single-engine, six-seat bush plane designed to land on water.
Forty years later, the airline runs daily flights from Montreal up the Hudson coast, into Ungava Bay and back down to the city - employing Inuit pilots, air traffic controllers and baggage handlers across the north.
The company's emergence mirrors a demographic explosion in Nunavik. Between 1996 and 2016, the population in Quebec's northernmost region grew by 38 per cent.
During that same period, Canada's population experienced a net growth of just 1.2 per cent.
A young, vibrant Inuit population means more people travelling south to attend college, seek employment or simply try their hand at living in Canada's second-largest city for awhile.
Despite high school dropout rates around three times the provincial average, more Inuit are enrolled in post-secondary education now than at any point in Nunavik's history.
Meanwhile, a growing population means more flights to bring in teachers, nurses, doctors and engineers to help expand services in the north. But funding for this expansion hasn't kept pace with population growth.
Last year, Quebec's ombudsman released a scathing report on housing in the north, saying overcrowded living conditions are making it nearly impossible for Inuit children to succeed in school.
Growing pains notwithstanding, the north is becoming increasingly linked to Quebec's urban south. For someone like Tuckatuck, it's not uncommon to travel up and down the coast a dozen times in the same year.
There are no frills in the northbound gates of the Trudeau Airport, no $5 double espressos or duty-free shops selling Cartier watches to American tourists.
It is purely a functional space. Vinyl-covered seats face vending machines that dispense orange soda and candy bars to hunters dressed in rubber boots and snow pants.
Melissa Haney walks by the gate with a smile on her face, waving at a passenger.
"Hey Melissa!" she exclaims.
Haney is the first female Inuk pilot to reach the rank of captain. She earned her wings in 2017 and has become something of a celebrity in Nunavik. But to her passengers, many of whom remember her from her days as a flight attendant for the airline, she is known simply as Melissa.
"This job is special. You're not just flying a plane full of tourists to Mexico to party for a week," she says. "The other day, we brought a six-day-old baby back (up north) from the hospital (in Montreal)."
Many women still come south to give birth or if their baby is born premature.
"Sometimes we take people to bury their loved ones or maybe there was a death in one of the villages and we let everyone off the plane so they can pay their respects. It takes a little longer but we have to adapt to life in the north."
Camille Lapointe oversees the Dash 8's refuelling. She covers her face to shield it from the wind.
11 a.m., Kuujjuarapik Airport
Haney steps out of the aircraft and takes a deep breath.
"The air is different, it feels fresher, it feels sharper than down south," Haney says. "When you land from Montreal and open the plane door, it feels like you're in a different world."
Just a few hundred metres away, sheets of ice the size of football fields shift and crackle from the Hudson Bay into the sea.
Haney stands under the plane's left wing and places her hand on its propellers, inspecting each blade. The runways in Nunavik don't have the same smooth finish as the ones down south. The surface tends to be covered in gravel and landing on it presents the risk of nicking the Dash 8's propellers or fuselage.
"In many ways, we're a big airline but when we're out here, we do a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves," Haney says.
As Haney inspects the plane, her co-pilot Camille Lapointe oversees the Dash 8's refuelling. Lapointe covers her face with a scarf to shield it from the wind.
On the runway, workers unload crates of food that just arrived from the city, stacking boxes of Kellogg's breakfast cereal, V8 tomato juice and granola bars in a nearby hangar.
The air delivery of food, mail, medicine and essential goods to the north is part of a fragile supply chain that's constantly threatened by poor weather conditions. A whiteout can ground flights, passengers and their precious cargo for days at a time.
Haney recounts one of her first emergency landings. She was a bush pilot, flying hunters in from a camp near Salluit when fog settled over the tundra.
"We had to improvise and wound up finding an abandoned air strip about a mile outside Salluit," Haney says. "There was an old cabin and we settled in, warmed up and ate army rations for awhile."
One of her passengers took them on a trek into the fog and they wound up tracking a herd of caribou, hunting one and harvesting its meat.
"We ate from the land and it was just this really, this incredibly unique experience," Haney says. "When the fog cleared, we packed the plane and brought back enough meat to share with the community."
1:15 p.m., Inukjuak
The aircraft has reached capacity on the last stop before landing near the hospital in Puvirnituq.
Passengers shuffle onto the aircraft with manilla folders full of medical documents, stopping to chat up a cousin or neighbour along the way. Some recognize the flight attendant, Isabelle Nolasco, and they exchange greetings in Inuktitut.
While Haney and Lapointe navigate the skies, Nolesco is the lone flight attendant on board.
Some aspects of that job are indistinguishable from the duties of any flight attendant at a regional airline: safety demonstrations punctuated with graceful hand motions, stowing luggage like Tetris blocks and bribing small children with cookies.
But Nolesco is also trained to assist on medical evacuations for patients urgently requiring surgery in a Montreal trauma centre.
"If the patient is stable, we're generally the ones to take them south," says Nolesco, who has been with the airline for 20 years. "You might see a man who has two broken legs in the back of the flight. We're equipped to carry a baby in an incubator, really any patient that isn't in a life-threatening situation."
"Sometimes we do two, three medevacs a week. It's just a part of the job."
Baggage handlers unload cargo in an Inuit village near the Hudson Strait.
5:50 p.m., Ivujivik Airport
The night wind picks waves of snow off the coast and brushes them past the airfield.
Just as it begins to recede over the horizon, sunlight blends into the icy haze and cloaks the runway in a pale blue fog. For a moment, it looks as though the Dash 8 has landed at the bottom of the sea.
Lapointe stands on a stepladder under the aircraft's right wing, using her exposed hands to fiddle with gauges and the fuel pump. Meanwhile, a baggage handler shines his flashlight into the cargo to help the other two hustle boxes into an idling truck.
The wind is merciless, searing every trace of exposed skin.
"You have to look at it as an adventure, as something so few pilots get to experience," says Lapointe, now 28.
7:50 p.m., Salluit
Haney parks the company pickup in a driveway overlooking the airstrip and helps unload the crew's luggage from the truck into their staff house.
In some villages, Haney stays with friends or family but tonight - after a long day - she'll stay with the other crew members ahead of an early flight back to Montreal in the morning.
The airport in Salluit serves as the mid-point for Haney's loop around the north.
After stopping in seven villages along the Hudson coast, the crew will head back south on the George River route, landing in seven Inuit villages tucked along Ungava Bay, the iron mining town of Schefferville near Labrador, Quebec City and then Montreal.
Some flights head up the George River route from Montreal and back down the Hudson coast the following day.
Her journeys up and down the tundra are one of the ways Haney reconnects with her roots.
Haney was eight years old when her family moved south from Inukjuak. Most of the Inuktitut she could speak has been lost but her bond to the north remains strong.
"Back then, the quality of education you could get up north wasn't so great," says Haney. "So my mom took us south. Maybe it would have been different today. (Nunavik) is still a huge part of who I am.

In a few minutes, the crew will see the last dozen passengers off, clean the aircraft, finish their paperwork and go home to their families. Haney, who lives in the Eastern Townships, says she can't wait to kiss her two children goodnight and take a warm shower.
Lately, Haney says, she's been taking on less flying and focusing on a role in management at the airline. She wants to continue mentoring Indigenous youth and women who may not know that a career in aviation is possible.
"When I started out as a flight attendant, I didn't even realize becoming a pilot was an option," Haney says. "But you start working these routes and you fall in love with the job. I knew right away I wanted to be in aviation for the rest of my career.
"Now we're seeing more and more Inuit getting their pilot's licence, taking the steps to be a part of something greater than all of us. I'm proud to be a part of that.
"As a pilot, you're not doing anything heroic or special but you play a role in connecting these communities to the south and to each other. You look at yourself as a tiny part of this great big northern territory and you're humbled."

Full text: The aircraft rumbles over the sea, banking toward snow-capped cliffs as it makes its final descent toward Salluit.
After a day of easy flying, the crosswinds have come alive, drowning out the sky in an icy fog. But Melissa Haney guides the plane with a cool hand, calm in the knowledge that she's done this hundreds of times.
She's at the helm of a 1991 Bombardier Dash 8, a plane designed to take off and land on short runways, hit a maximum speed of 515 kilometres an hour while carrying up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, 45 passengers and an assortment of salty snacks.
Even so, as it hovers along the Hudson Strait - where the winds can reach up to 180 kilometres an hour in the winter - any illusion of technology having mastered Quebec's northern frontier disappears.
"This isn't so bad," Haney says.
"Sometimes it's so windy we couldn't land even if we tried. Up here, Mother Nature decides when we fly. The sooner you get used to that idea, the better off you and your crew will be."
The Dash touches down in Salluit as dusk settles over the village, ending a day that began 12 hours, seven landings and 1,854 kilometres ago in Montreal.
As one of Air Inuit's captains, Haney's job is to connect Montreal to the north. A flight from the south can reunite families on the Hudson coast, bring in medicine to a remote Inuit village or drop a shipment of new hockey sticks just in time for a youth tournament.
Each year, there are about 7,000 Air Inuit flights to, from and between northern villages. They carry 150,000 passengers and over 12 million kilograms in cargo across the sprawling tundra annually.
For the 12,000 Inuit who populate Quebec's north, the Montreal-based airline is an essential service connecting 14 Inuit villages over a land mass twice the size of England. It's also a lifeline to Montreal itself, where a community of roughly 600 to 1,000 Inuit live at any given moment.
The city's Inuk population is larger than many of the 14 northern communities. Now a grassroots movement is underway to have the federal and provincial governments formally recognize Montreal as an Inuit community.
In essence, to be Inuit in 2019 is to have a foot in both worlds, north and south.
Haney lives that duality.
Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019, 7:40 a.m., Trudeau International Airport Betty Tuckatuck is headed north to bury her sister.
"I wish it were different, I wish I was just visiting," says Tuckatuck. "Instead I'm going to say goodbye to someone I love."
Tuckatuck doesn't know much about why her sister Marlene died and she wants answers. She says Marlene went to the nursing station in Kuujjuarapik last week, crippled by a pain in her gut.
Without a doctor in the village, she would have to be transferred to a hospital in Puvirnituq 530 kilometres up the coast or wait for a flight south to Montreal.
"She died on her bathroom floor," Tuckatuck says. "She was waiting for paramedics."
Tuckatuck has been splitting her time between Montreal, where she lives, and her job at the Glencore nickel mine near Salluit.
But today she's heading back to the village where, as a child, she learned to hunt, fish and survive on the icy shores of Hudson Bay. She sits next to her friend Mina and waits to board Air Inuit flight 802 northbound.
The airline began as a sort of pipe dream, an Inuit-owned service founded to connect villages scattered across the northern wilderness.
In 1978, Air Inuit's fleet was a single-engine, six-seat bush plane designed to land on water.
Forty years later, the airline runs daily flights from Montreal up the Hudson coast, into Ungava Bay and back down to the city - employing Inuit pilots, air traffic controllers and baggage handlers across the north.
The company's emergence mirrors a demographic explosion in Nunavik. Between 1996 and 2016, the population in Quebec's northernmost region grew by 38 per cent.
During that same period, Canada's population experienced a net growth of just 1.2 per cent.
A young, vibrant Inuit population means more people travelling south to attend college, seek employment or simply try their hand at living in Canada's second-largest city for awhile.
Despite high school dropout rates around three times the provincial average, more Inuit are enrolled in post-secondary education now than at any point in Nunavik's history.
Meanwhile, a growing population means more flights to bring in teachers, nurses, doctors and engineers to help expand services in the north. But funding for this expansion hasn't kept pace with population growth.
Last year, Quebec's ombudsman released a scathing report on housing in the north, saying overcrowded living conditions are making it nearly impossible for Inuit children to succeed in school.
Growing pains notwithstanding, the north is becoming increasingly linked to Quebec's urban south. For someone like Tuckatuck, it's not uncommon to travel up and down the coast a dozen times in the same year.
There are no frills in the northbound gates of the Trudeau Airport, no $5 double espressos or duty-free shops selling Cartier watches to American tourists.
It is purely a functional space. Vinyl-covered seats face vending machines that dispense orange soda and candy bars to hunters dressed in rubber boots and snow pants.
Melissa Haney walks by the gate with a smile on her face, waving at a passenger.
"Hey Melissa!" she exclaims.
Haney is the first female Inuk pilot to reach the rank of captain. She earned her wings in 2017 and has become something of a celebrity in Nunavik. But to her passengers, many of whom remember her from her days as a flight attendant for the airline, she is known simply as Melissa.
"This job is special. You're not just flying a plane full of tourists to Mexico to party for a week," she says. "The other day, we brought a six-day-old baby back (up north) from the hospital (in Montreal)." Many women still come south to give birth or if their baby is born premature.
"Sometimes we take people to bury their loved ones or maybe there was a death in one of the villages and we let everyone off the plane so they can pay their respects.
It takes a little longer but we have to adapt to life in the north." 11 a.m., Kuujjuarapik Airport Haney steps out of the aircraft and takes a deep breath.
"The air is different, it feels fresher, it feels sharper than down south," Haney says. "When you land from Montreal and open the plane door, it feels like you're in a different world."
Just a few hundred metres away, sheets of ice the size of football fields shift and crackle from the Hudson Bay into the sea.
Haney stands under the plane's left wing and places her hand on its propellers, inspecting each blade. The runways in Nunavik don't have the same smooth finish as the ones down south. The surface tends to be covered in gravel and landing on it presents the risk of nicking the Dash 8's propellers or fuselage.
"In many ways, we're a big airline but when we're out here, we do a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves," Haney says.
As Haney inspects the plane, her co-pilot Camille Lapointe oversees the Dash 8's refuelling. Lapointe covers her face with a ski mask to shield it from the wind.
On the runway, workers unload crates of food that just arrived from the city, stacking boxes of Kellogg's breakfast cereal, V8 tomato juice and granola bars in a nearby hangar.
The air delivery of food, mail, medicine and essential goods to the north is part of a fragile supply chain that's constantly threatened by poor weather conditions. A whiteout can ground flights, passengers and their precious cargo for days at a time.
Haney recounts one of her first emergency landings. She was a bush pilot, flying hunters in from a camp near Salluit when fog settled over the tundra.
"We had to improvise and wound up finding an abandoned air strip about a mile outside Salluit," Haney says. "There was an old cabin and we settled in, warmed up and ate army rations for awhile."
One of her passengers took them on a trek into the fog and they wound up tracking a herd of caribou, hunting one and harvesting its meat.
"We ate from the land and it was just this really, this incredibly unique experience," Haney says. "When the fog cleared, we packed the plane and brought back enough meat to share with the community." 1:15 p.m., Inukjuak The aircraft has reached capacity on the last stop before landing near the hospital in Puvirnituq.
Passengers shuffle onto the aircraft with manilla folders full of medical documents, stopping to chat up a cousin or neighbour along the way. Some recognize the flight attendant, Isabelle Nolasco, and they exchange greetings in Inuktitut.
While Haney and Lapointe navigate the skies, Nolesco is the lone flight attendant on board.
Some aspects of that job are indistinguishable from the duties of any flight attendant at a regional airline: safety demonstrations punctuated with graceful hand motions, stowing luggage like Tetris blocks and bribing small children with cookies.
But Nolesco is also trained to assist on medical evacuations for patients urgently requiring surgery in a Montreal trauma centre.
"If the patient is stable, we're generally the ones to take them south," says Nolesco, who has been with the airline for 20 years. "You might see a man who has two broken legs in the back of the flight. We're equipped to carry a baby in an incubator, really any patient that isn't in a life-threatening situation."
"Sometimes we do two, three medevacs a week. It's just a part of the job." 5:50 p.m., Ivujivik Airport The night wind picks waves of snow off the coast and brushes them past the airfield.
Just as it begins to recede over the horizon, sunlight blends into the icy haze and cloaks the runway in a pale blue fog. For a moment, it looks as though the Dash 8 has landed at the bottom of the sea.
Lapointe stands on a stepladder under the aircraft's right wing, using her exposed hands to fiddle with gauges and the fuel pump. Meanwhile, a baggage handler shines his flashlight into the cargo to help the other two hustle boxes into an idling truck.
The wind is merciless, searing every trace of exposed skin.
"You have to look at it as an adventure, as something so few pilots get to experience," Lapointe says. 7:50 p.m., Salluit Haney parks the company pickup in a driveway overlooking the airstrip and helps unload the crew's luggage from the truck into their staff house.
In some villages, Haney stays with friends or family but tonight - after a long day - she'll stay with the other crew members ahead of an early flight back to Montreal.
The airport in Salluit serves as the midpoint for Haney's loop around the north.
After stopping in seven villages along the Hudson coast, the crew will head back south on the George River route, landing in seven Inuit villages tucked along Ungava Bay, the iron mining town of Schefferville near Labrador, Quebec City and then Montreal.
Some flights head up the George River route from Montreal and back down the Hudson coast the following day.
Her journeys are one of the ways Haney reconnects with her roots.
Haney was eight years old when her family moved south from Inukjuak. Most of the Inuktitut she could speak has been lost but her bond to the north remains strong.
"Back then, the quality of education you could get up north wasn't so great," says Haney. "So my mom took us south. Maybe it would have been different today. (Nunavik) is still a huge part of who I am.
"When you talk to people down south, they don't know much about how things are up here. They only see the social problems. And those are very real, but I get to see the beauty as well.
"When I'm up here, I get to go out on the land, I see family and my close friends. This job allows me to live in both worlds - the north and the south. And that's the reality for more and more people." Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2019, 7:45 a.m., Salluit Airport: control tower Yuliusie Papigatuk leans back in his chair and watches the sun rise above fjord. It softens the rocky edges with a pink glow.
On the runway, just a few feet below his desk, a team of baggage handlers load the Dash 8 ahead of its flight to Deception Bay.
Papigatuk looks out for Haney and the other pilots, to keep in touch with the network of control towers along the coast and watch weather patterns that might threaten their flights.
"We get weather in a flash up here," he says. "Sometimes the planes won't move for two, three days or even a week during the springtime. ... Once we get strong winds from the north, it'll drown out visibility and flood the runway.
"Sometimes we have to close the airport, the access road and use snowmobiles to get from our homes to here."
Papigatuk says he remembers the first time he saw Haney nearly 20 years ago. Back then, she was still a flight attendant with Air Inuit.
"There was a dog race in one of the communities, so I see this young woman standing on the plane, surrounded by sled dogs," he says. "There were just dogs everywhere and she couldn't help but smile."
Across the room, Elaisa Alaku scrolls through her phone as she listens to country music from the local radio station.
Today, she says, is the second anniversary of the day she earned her pilot's licence. Alaku flies Twin Otter planes up and down Ungava Bay for Air Inuit - carrying cargo, passengers and patients.
She says Haney was one of the reasons she chose to move south and attend flight school in St-Hubert.
"She's awesome," says Alaku.
"I only sort of remember my first flight: I could feel the adrenalin rushing through my body. It's windy and bumpy up there, there's low visibility sometimes, but when (the sky clears) it's the most beautiful scenery you could imagine."
Alaku's flight pattern, where she pilots a smaller aircraft up and down Ungava Bay, is one of the most gruelling for Air Inuit's pilots.
In some shifts, she will take off and land up to 14 times, linking places like Aupaluk - a village of fewer than 200 residents - to regional hubs like Kuujjuaq - an administrative capital with 2,800 people, a hospital and amenities similar to ones found in most southern cities.
In a few minutes, Alaku will board Haney's plane so she can babysit for her brother in Kuujjuaq that day.
"I'm a full-time pilot, part-time babysitter," she says. 10:04 a.m., Quaqtaq Airport A police officer steps out of the aircraft and returns, moments later, guiding a prisoner by the arm.
"I don't know what he was arrested for. My job is just to get him to Kuujjuaq so he can be detained until his hearing (in Montreal)," the officer says. "That's all I can say."
He turns to the prisoner. "All the way to the back, please." "Thank you," the young man replies.
In a few moments, they're walking back up the aisle so the prisoner can use the washroom. They look less like opponents on opposite sides of the law than an old married couple - slightly annoyed with one another but also bound to each other.
A part of flying the Nunavik run means occasionally bringing prisoners south to attend hearings in Montreal, Quebec City or to the detention centre in Kuujjuaq.
Julie Goguen sports a thick parka as she boards the aircraft. Jamie, Goguen's four-month-old, is nestled in a pouch sewn onto her coat. She pokes her head out and looks wide-eyed around the cabin.
"She's my little love," Goguen says. "I'm going to see the doctor (in Kuujjuaq) but I can't leave this one. Not for a minute."
Air travel is a huge part of Goguen's life. Given that Air Inuit is owned by Makivik Corporation - a sort of Inuit co-op created by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement in 1978 - Nunavik residents can get discounts on up to four flights per year.
Goguen says she uses all of those discounts and tries to fly to Montreal a few times a year so she can visit her family there. "That's just how it is now. There are Inuit in the south and the north," she says. "This is how we stay connected." 11:34 a.m., Tasiujaq Airport On the final stop before landing in Kuujjuaq, a pair of baggage handlers load an unusual package into the hold: the remains of a polar bear that wandered too close to town.
It sits wrapped in plastic, splayed between hockey bags and crates of mail, bound for Quebec City.
Neither of then can say why it's headed to the provincial capital.
With climate change effectively shrinking their habitat, it isn't uncommon for bears to wander into villages. Locals try to avoid killing them when possible but polar bears can be extremely aggressive.
To live in the north, one of the handlers says, is to have a much closer relationship to the land and everything that lives off it. Often that relationship is of the predator, prey variety.
"You're not in the city anymore," one says. "Up here we don't play with our food." 12:20 p.m., Kuujjuaq Airport Haney walks into the employees lounge and brews a pot of coffee for her co-workers.
As she sits down to a cold chicken sandwich, someone from the airport hands her a clipboard.
"Human remains," the woman says.
Haney signs the document and gets back to her lunch. For its last three legs into Montreal, Air Inuit flight 820 southbound will carry a body so that it can be unloaded, delivered to the morgue and examined by the Quebec coroner's office.
There is no information about why it will need to undergo an autopsy. And perhaps, for the crew, it is better that way.
"Sometimes the coffin is really small and you know it belonged to a child," says Nolasco. "Those are hard."
Nunavik and its villagers are tied by blood, marriage and friendships that go back generations. A death in one village reverberates across the north.
"There is an incredible sense of community up here," Haney says. "To see the way people in a village care for one another in their grief, is ... it's not something you see in too many places."
Given the extreme weather conditions, accidental deaths are far more common in Nunavik than in the south. One study, by Université Laval, found that accidents account for 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with 3.0 per 10,000 in the rest of the province.
And then there is the suicide crisis. Last year, Kuujjuaq was rocked by a wave of suicides that forced an emergency meeting with community leaders from across Nunavik and representatives from the Quebec government.
There is hope in the north but the legacy of residential schools, underfunded social programs and the forced relocation of Inuit from the land into settlements has left a deep wound in its wake.
"You can't help but see some of the problems and want to help and want to be a force for good," Haney says. 8:11 p.m., Trudeau International Airport The Dash 8 glides into Montreal just as a blizzard makes one final push over the city.
It is the 15th time Haney will land the aircraft in under 36 hours - an exhausting feat for even the most experienced pilot. This time, she'll navigate the tail end of a storm that has delayed dozens of flights coming in and out of Dorval.
"I don't even want to think about how much snow is on my car," Nolesco says. "That's the real challenge."
In a few minutes, the crew will see the last dozen passengers off, clean the aircraft, finish their paperwork and go home to their families. Haney, who lives in the Eastern Townships, says she can't wait to kiss her two children good night and take a warm shower.
Lately, Haney says, she's been taking on less flying and focusing on a role in management at the airline. She wants to continue mentoring Indigenous youth and women who may not know that a career in aviation is possible.

Josh Freed: The seven signs of spring in Montreal

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/josh-freed-seven-signs-spring-montreal/docview/2211745836/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: I saw my first real sign of spring last week, a Montreal urban version of the first robin. It was an outdoor terrasse on Peel St. - and my heart throbbed.
Since then flocks of terrasses have arrived, a heart-warming, seat-warming sign this endless winter has finally ended.
I got a similar warm shiver when city workers tore down the hockey rinks and put up park benches, picnic tables and Bixi stations, even if many still don't have bikes.
These are sure-fire signs of Montreal spring and we need them, after a five-month winter that began with a Nov. 16 blizzard( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/first-serious-snowfall-of-the-season-slows-montreal-traffic-bus-service ) and ended with another mid-April( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ).
OK, it's probably pouring as you read this, since weather sites have all posted a scary "RAINFALL ALERT!" (Beware of falling rain!)
But our town is finally reawakening in all its glory, grit and grime. So let's celebrate the seven signs of spring:
Sign 1: Two billion tons of black ice has finally melted, revealing 200,000 tons of gravel underneath, flung down by city workers all winter. It covers our city like a layer of moon dust, fused together with five months of cigarette butts, lotto tickets and candy wrappers, 500,000 plastic bags, and 650 trillion dead leaves.
Also, a winter's worth of dog poop left by owners who should be impounded instead of their dogs.
Sign 2: The Tam Tam drummers were out at Mount Royal last Sunday after a deafening five-month silence. I've never been happier to hear them, though there were only 100 people there, drumming away in parkas and mitts.
The crowds will get bigger every week while clothing gets ever more skimpy. If we didn't have winters, it would eventually be a nudist gathering.
Sign 3: Construction's in full spring swing, with so many road-blocked streets you'd think we're trying to catch spies.
Every second street is a forest of orange detour signs. A friend sent a photo of four detour signs at a Verdun intersection, all for highway 15 - all pointing different directions.
Even my GPS is confused lately, sending me down streets saying Rue Barré, then changing routes again and again, until my screen freezes on the word "re-rerouting".
I suspect my Google Maps app is desperately consulting Waze, while my Waze consults Google. Who can fault them? In Montreal all roads now lead to ruin.
Spring is also pothole season and this year boasts a record "bump"-er crop. We've all become "road scholars", studying each pothole carefully to avoid ones that can cost you a wheel, or worse.
Last week the city reported it's already filled 55,000 potholes( https://journalmetro.com/actualites/2302316/55-000-nids-de-poule-colmates-depuis-le-debut-de-lannee/ ). Only 99,999,945,000 to go.
Sign 4: Strikers and protesters are back on the streets, whether they're Bill 21 demonstrators, taxi drivers or angry unions.
There's a reason the student protests were dubbed Maple Spring. Our protests are the year's first outdoor gathering, in a Festival of Discontent.
Sign 5: There are downsides to spring too. Since April 1, the street-sweeping machines are back. So is the post-spring rite of setting your alarm to move your car to the other side of the street, along with all your neighbours.
Then we all circle the block playing "musical cars" where winners get spots and losers traditional $52 tickets. Ooops, make that $78 since the province just shockingly boosted the price( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cost-of-parking-tickets-going-up ).
It's enough to make me drive right to Laval for a free spot, then métro home.
Sign 6: The best spring gift is the extra light as the sun now sets at 7:45 p.m., instead of four hours after I wake up. It's been brighter ever since we returned to daylight saving - but switching our clocks may soon be a spring thing of the past.
European Union countries will all stop clock-switching in 2021, though each country will vote whether to stay on permanent "summer" or "winter" time.
It can't be long before that spreads here. I pray Montrealers eventually vote for daylight-saving - not daylight-craving time.
Sign 7: I just did my annual spring tour of The Main's shops to see who'd survived, or died. I was pleased to find more survivors than usual.
My favourite ramen resto had closed, but all the hip new clothing, tattoo and coffee shops that opened in recent years are still there after this long winter. Bravo!
Several new places are opening and to my amazement, three had signs posted saying "Help Wanted."
Montreal signs like that were once rarer than construction cranes, which were rarer than whooping cranes. But now they're just another mark of spring.
Several Main merchants have put out their "illegal" plastic chairs for aging customers to sit. Soon city inspectors will be ticketing them, while merchants take in the chairs on days inspectors regularly come by - in the most idiotic rite of spring.
I say three cheers for the chairs!
Meanwhile, ignore the RAINFALL ALERT!, the dirt, potholes, detours and parking tickets and focus on the bright side.
Soon you'll be wearing sandals, lounging on terrasses and festival-hopping. It won't be long before you're complaining again - about the heat.

Full text: I saw my first real sign of spring last week, a Montreal urban version of the first robin. It was an outdoor terrasse on Peel St. - and my heart throbbed.
Since then flocks of terrasses have arrived, a heartwarming, seat-warming sign this endless winter has finally ended.
I got a similar warm shiver when city workers tore down the hockey rinks and put up park benches, picnic tables and Bixi stations, even if many still don't have bikes.
These are surefire signs of Montreal spring and we need them, after a five-month winter that began with a Nov. 16 blizzard and ended with another mid-April.
OK, it's probably pouring as you read this, since weather sites have all posted a scary "RAIN-FALL ALERT!" (Beware of falling rain!) But our town is finally reawakening in all its glory, grit and grime. So let's celebrate the seven signs of spring:
Sign 1: Two billion tons of black ice has finally melted, revealing 200,000 tons of gravel underneath, flung down by city workers all winter. It covers our city like a layer of moon dust, fused together with five months of cigarette butts, lotto tickets and candy wrappers, 500,000 plastic bags, and 650 trillion dead leaves.
Also, a winter's worth of dog poop left by owners who should be impounded instead of their dogs.
Sign 2: The Tam Tam drummers were out at Mount Royal last Sunday after a deafening fivemonth silence. I've never been happier to hear them, though there were only 100 people there, drumming away in parkas and mitts.
The crowds will get bigger every week while clothing gets ever more skimpy. If we didn't have winters, it would eventually be a nudist gathering.
Sign 3: Construction's in full spring swing, with so many roadblocked streets you'd think we're trying to catch spies.
Every second street is a forest of orange detour signs. A friend sent a photo of four detour signs at a Verdun intersection, all for Highway 15 - all pointing different directions.
Even my GPS is confused lately, sending me down streets saying Rue Barré, then changing routes again and again, until my screen freezes on the word "re-rerouting."
I suspect my Google Maps app is desperately consulting Waze, while my Waze consults Google. Who can fault them? In Montreal all roads now lead to ruin.
Spring is also pothole season and this year boasts a record "bump"-er crop. We've all become "road scholars," studying each pothole carefully to avoid ones that can cost you a wheel, or worse.
Last week the city reported it's already filled 55,000 potholes. Only 99,999,945,000 to go.
Sign 4: Strikers and protesters are back on the streets, whether they're Bill 21 demonstrators, taxi drivers or angry unions.
There's a reason the student protests were dubbed Maple Spring. Our protests are the year's first outdoor gathering, in a Festival of Discontent.
Sign 5: There are downsides to spring, too. Since April 1, the street-sweeping machines are back. So is the post-spring rite of setting your alarm to move your car to the other side of the street, along with all your neighbours.
Then we all circle the block playing "musical cars" where winners get spots and losers traditional $52 tickets. Ooops, make that $78, since the province just shockingly boosted the price.
It's enough to make me drive right to Laval for a free spot, then métro home.
Sign 6: The best spring gift is the extra light as the sun now sets at 7:45 p.m., instead of four hours after I wake up. It's been brighter ever since we returned to daylight saving - but switching our clocks soon may be a spring thing of the past.
European Union countries will all stop clock-switching in 2021, though each country will vote whether to stay on permanent "summer" or "winter" time.
It can't be long before that spreads here. I pray Montrealers eventually vote for daylight-saving - not daylight-craving time.
Sign 7: I just did my annual spring tour of The Main's shops to see who'd survived, or died. I was pleased to find more survivors than usual.
My favourite ramen resto had closed, but all the hip new clothing, tattoo and coffee shops that opened in recent years are still there after this long winter. Bravo! Several new places are opening and to my amazement, three had signs posted saying, "Help Wanted."
Montreal signs like that were once rarer than construction cranes, which were rarer than whooping cranes. But now they're just another mark of spring.
Several Main merchants have put out their "illegal" plastic chairs for aging customers to sit. Soon city inspectors will be ticketing them, while merchants take in the chairs on days inspectors regularly come by - in the most idiotic rite of spring.
I say three cheers for the chairs! Meanwhile, ignore the RAIN-FALL ALERT!, the dirt, potholes, detours and parking tickets and focus on the bright side.

TFC, Sounders set for a showdown of unbeaten teams: Saturday's match should allow Toronto to gauge where the team stands before the schedule intensifies next month

Full text: Some 7 1/2 weeks into the season, Toronto FC is hitting the road for just the third time.
At the same stage last year, Toronto had been to Mexico and Colorado (both twice) and Montreal.
Coach Greg Vanney says there's good and bad to the travel discrepancy caused by the early exit from the CONCACAF Champions League.
"It's been a lot less adventurous," Vanney said.
The crowded schedule, tough competition and intense travel at the start of the 2018 season meant Toronto was battle-tested early on. This year, Vanney's squad has already had two bye weeks - one because of an international break and another to facilitate a Champions League game that ultimately never happened.
"I feel like we are just kind of getting going, whereas probably last year at this point you were almost ready to catch your breath a little bit because things were going so fast with so much travel associated with it," Vanney said.
"I like the buildup of things this year. ... I still would have liked to have seen us get into the later rounds of the Champions League just to see, as we settled in as a group, what that would look like but it wasn't to be," he continued.
"And I think we're taking advantage of the fact that we aren't flying all over the place and we don't have games every three days.
"It's given us the chance to settle in and get better day by day."
Toronto (3-0-1) will get a good gauge of where it stands on Saturday when it visits the Seattle Sounders (4-0-1) in a matchup of two of the four remaining unbeaten teams in Major League Soccer (the others are Los Angeles FC and Houston).
The teams have MLS Cup history, with Seattle winning in 2016 and Toronto emerging triumphant in 2017.
The Sounders were slated to play in Colorado mid-week but the game was postponed because of a blizzard warning in the Denver area. Seattle made the trip but, despite the travel, the postponement will likely help players nursing knocks.
Toronto's schedule intensifies next month. After four games in April, there will be seven in May with trips to Orlando, Atlanta, Salt Lake City and Vancouver.
"I think we're more prepared this year to manage that," midfielder Jonathan Osorio said of the coming schedule congestion. "We all know that's coming, but right now the thing that's in our head is Seattle on the weekend."
Saturday's match-up features two of the league's top offences.
Toronto is ranked second, averaging three goals a game, while Seattle is tied for fifth in the MLS at 2.20 goals a game.
"[They're] very, very attackingminded," Vanney said. "Relentless in their pursuit of goals right from the start of games, getting numbers forward. Dynamic ... getting teams on their heels."
It will present a different challenge from the defence-first approach of Chicago last week in a 2-2 tie in Toronto.
Peruvian international forward Raul Ruidiaz, who scored in each of his first three games for Seattle this season, is questionable (right heel contusion). Veteran defender Drew Moor (groin) will miss the game for Toronto while Brazilian fullback/wingback Auro is questionable (minor semitendinosus strain).
Moor's absence opens the door to Laurent Ciman and/or Eriq Zavaleta depending on which formation Toronto opts for. Vanney says the Seattle artificial turf will not affect his team selection.
While Toronto has only conceded five goals this season, the defending on the two given up against Chicago last weekend did not meet Vanney's approval.
Seattle is coming off a 1-0 win over visiting Real Salt Lake.

'I saw the transformer on my street explode'; Hydro-Québec crews busy restoring power to more than 143,000 customers

Full text: As a blizzard swept across southern Quebec Tuesday, technicians from throughout the province scrambled to restore power to more than 143,000 homes and businesses still in the dark as of 9:30 p.m.
The bulk of those Hydro-Québec clients live in Laval, Laurentian and Lanaudière regions - all of which were battered by freezing rain overnight Monday.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. just after 8 a.m. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said waitress Monique Lécuyer. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled among construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home, but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
There were more than 800 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.
Additional technicians came into the Montreal area from Sherbrooke and the state of Vermont, according to Hydro-Québec.
Across the island of Laval, police went door to door checking to make sure families were safe Tuesday, particularly in areas hardest hit by the outages: Auteuil, Fabreville and Duvernay.
There have been two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since the ice storm began. In one, a family of four was hospitalized after using a propane-fuelled barbecue to warm their home. The other involved only one person.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide inside both homes. Neither case was life-threatening, according to Urgences Santé.
Families crowded into the Carrefour Laval mall early Tuesday to drink hot coffee and get out of their cold homes. Some children sat with their smartphones plugged into electrical outlets, logging onto social media to catch up on the latest news and gossip. "It's better than being in class," said one highschool student from Chomedey.
Outside, a thick coat of ice bent trees and weighed down electrical wires. Busy intersections were left without functioning traffic lights, visibility was blotted out by snow and traffic slowed to a crawl along both sides of Highway 440. The storm also stalled mail delivery in and around Montreal.
Quebec's Public Security Minister, Geneviève Guilbault, said Tuesday she would be monitoring the situation closely.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hoped to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board closed all of their schools on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hoped to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board closed all of their schools on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the ??Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Full text: As a blizzard swept across southern Quebec Tuesday, technicians from throughout the province scrambled to restore power to the 230,000 homes and businesses still in the dark.
The bulk of those Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients live in Laval, Laurentian and Lanaudière regions - all of which were battered by freezing rain overnight Monday.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. just after 8 a.m. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said waitress Monique Lécuyer. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled among construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
Fallen branches littered the streets of Laval on Tuesday.
There were over 800 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.
Additional technicians came into the Montreal area from Sherbrooke and the state of Vermont, according to Hydro-Québec.
Across the island of Laval, police went door to door checking to make sure families were safe Tuesday, particularly in areas hardest hit by the outages: Auteuil, Fabreville and Duvernay.
There have been two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since the ice storm began.
In one, a family of four was hospitalized after using a propane-fuelled barbecue to warm their home. The other involved just one person.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide inside both homes. Neither case was life-threatening, according to Urgences Santé.
Families crowded into the Carrefour Laval mall early Tuesday to drink hot coffee and get out of their cold homes. Some children sat with their smartphones plugged into electrical outlets, logging onto social media to catch up on the latest news and gossip.
"It's better than being in class," said one high-school student from Chomedey.
Outside, a thick coat of ice bent trees and weighed down electrical wires. Busy intersections were left without functioning traffic lights, visibility was blotted out by snow and traffic slowed to a crawl along both sides of Highway 440.

Full text: As a blizzard swept across Montreal's North Shore Tuesday, technicians from across the province scrambled to restore power to the 250,000 homes and businesses still in the dark.
More than 230,000 Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions were still without electricity Tuesday afternoon after freezing rain battered the province Monday. A Montreal-area forecast showed no sign of the weather waning, with a mix of freezing rain and snow expected into the night.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said Monique Lécuyer, a waitress. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."

Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
There were over 700 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon, according to Hydro-Québec. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.
Emergency crews were brought to the Montreal area from Sherbrooke and the state of Vermont, according to Hydro-Québec.

Have a little heart for our city's angry cabbies; Protests messed up traffic, but Bill 17 and Uber are threats to their well-being

Full text: Pretty much everyone I know in this city has been smitten with Uber. They love the convenience. They love the app. They love the tracking device on their cells that watches their designated vehicle wend its way to their homes and enables them to know in just how many minutes it will arrive. They love deciding what type of auto - from basic to luxury - will retrieve them. And they love the cost - except when it's a surge period, like holidays, busy rush hours or blizzards. Come to think of it, that's pretty much a lot of the time here, but that still doesn't deter the faithful.
No question, Uber is an inspired business model for our high-tech times - old-school taxi drivers be damned. They are now viewed as dinosaurs on our brave new boulevards.
No matter. My heart goes out to our beleaguered cab drivers. Yes, they messed up traffic big time in their protest Monday. But consider, please, that's because they are being shafted big time, thanks to Uber and, doubtless, soon-to-come similar ride-sharing apps.
And now they have to deal with the provincial government's Bill 17, which could soon sound the death knell for their industry.
There are Montreal cabbies who forked out $200,000 and even $300,000 for taxi permits back when this was a viable industry. Permit prices have since come down, but until recently could still cost nearly $100,000.
Plus, taxi drivers pay premiums on everything from their licences to their insurance. They have had to undergo all sorts of tests on their knowledge of city streets. They have had to submit to security checks.
Uber drivers don't have to deal with most of these regulations and costs. Almost anyone with a valid driver's licence can work for Uber - even those who barely know the city.
(And please don't tell me that GPS will get Uber drivers through our gridlock and detours, because that's not always the case.)
Driving an Uber is a second job for many. Not so for most taxi drivers. Some have to work shifts of up to 16 hours a day to make ends meet.
And it shouldn't be overlooked that driving a taxi is one of the few employment options available to many newly arrived immigrants to Montreal. Over the years, I have encountered taxi drivers who were engineers and professors and pharmacists and even one notary who had to leave their countries of origin for various political and social reasons. Their qualifications couldn't pass muster here, so they became cabbies and accepted their lot. They poured their life savings and whatever else they could scrounge into a taxi permit, in the hope of supporting their families. And somehow, many had resisted the urge to become bitter.
Given the CAQ's stand on cutting back on immigration, not to mention its position on religious symbols, it's perhaps not surprising that there doesn't appear to be any great empathy for the plight of Quebec taxi drivers.
Last week, the CAQ tabled Bill 17, which would deregulate the taxi industry, but really plays much more into the hands of Uber and others who seek to get into this transit mode.
In a short-sighted bid to even the playing field, Bill 17 would remove some of the more costly aspects of driving a taxi and allow drivers to charge more variable rates - as is the case with Uber. The Legault government would seek to compensate the cabbies by giving them $500 million.
On paper, that might look fair.
It's not. Certainly not to those who have spent hundreds of thousands for permits that could become seriously devalued or even worthless if Bill 17 is adopted. And $500 million doesn't nearly compensate them.
The cabbies shouldn't hold their breath for the provincial government to back down. In spite of many protests, the CAQ has yet to relent on its stands on immigration and religious symbols.
And Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel said on Monday that the $500-million compensation package was "a final amount," and that cabbies should not expect even one cent more. Bonnardel plans to meet with taxi industry reps on Tuesday, to explain the advantages of the proposed bill. Right.
Not surprisingly, taxi drivers plan to protest until Bill 17 is withdrawn. That means many more traffic disruptions, which likely means public support for their cause will wane. And as it is, it's highly doubtful there will be much resistance to Bill 17 from the public, because even liberal urbanites have become Uberites. bbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein

Full text: Pretty much everyone I know in this city has been smitten with Uber. They love the convenience. They love the app. They love the tracking device on their cells that watches their designated vehicle wend its way to their homes and enables them to know in just how many minutes it will arrive. They love deciding what type of auto - from basic to luxury - will retrieve them. And they love the cost - except when it's a surge period, like holidays, busy rush hours or blizzards. Come to think of it, that's pretty much a lot of the time here, but that still doesn't deter the faithful.
No question, Uber is an inspired business model for our high-tech times - old-school taxi drivers be damned. They are now viewed as dinosaurs on our brave new boulevards.
No matter. My heart goes out to our beleaguered cab drivers. Yes, they messed up traffic big time in their protest Monday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/striking-taxi-drivers-slow-traffic-on-montreal-highways ). But consider, please, that's because they are being shafted big time, thanks to Uber and, doubtless, soon-to-come similar ride-sharing apps.
And now they have to deal with the provincial government's Bill 17( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-government-to-inject-500-million-into-taxi-industry ), which could soon sound the death knell for their industry.
There are Montreal cabbies who forked out $200,000 and even $300,000 for taxi permits back when this was a viable industry. Permit prices have since come down, but until recently could still cost nearly $100,000.
Plus, taxi drivers pay premiums on everything from their licences to their insurance. They have had to undergo all sorts of tests on their knowledge of city streets. They have had to submit to security checks.
Uber drivers don't have to deal with most of these regulations and costs. Almost anyone with a valid driver's licence can work for Uber - even those who barely know the city. (And please don't tell me that GPS will get Uber drivers through our gridlock and detours, because that's not always the case.)
Driving an Uber is a second job for many. Not so for most taxi drivers. Some have to work shifts of up to 16 hours a day to make ends meet.
And it shouldn't be overlooked that driving a taxi is one of the few employment options available to many newly arrived immigrants( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-denies-taxi-reforms-will-hurt-immigrant-drivers ) to Montreal. Over the years, I have encountered taxi drivers who were engineers and professors and pharmacists and even one notary who had to leave their countries of origin for various political and social reasons. Their qualifications couldn't pass muster here, so they became cabbies and accepted their lot. They poured their life savings and whatever else they could scrounge up into a taxi permit, in the hope of supporting their families. And somehow, many had resisted the urge to become bitter.
Given the CAQ's stand on cutting back on immigration, not to mention its position on religious symbols, it's perhaps not surprising that there doesn't appear to be any great empathy for the plight of Quebec taxi drivers.
Last week, the CAQ tabled Bill 17, which would deregulate the taxi industry but really plays much more into the hands of Uber and others who seek to get into this transit mode.
In a short-sighted bid to even the playing field, Bill 17 would remove some of the more costly aspects of driving a taxi and allow drivers to charge more variable rates - as is the case with Uber. The Legault government would seek to compensate the cabbies by giving them $500 million.
On paper, that might look fair. It's not. Certainly not to those who have spent hundreds of thousands for permits that could become seriously devalued or even worthless if Bill 17 is adopted. And $500 million doesn't nearly compensate them.
The cabbies shouldn't hold their breath for the provincial government to back down. In spite of many protests, the CAQ has yet to relent on its stands on immigration and religious symbols.

Josh Freed: Icy sidewalks wouldn't be a problem if you'd listened to me and heated them

Full text: I walked through downtown exactly like every other pedestrian there last week.
I waddled like a penguin across Ste-Catherine St. ice, then leapt gazelle-like across slush puddles at Peel St., then danced like a ballerina along a tiny strip of visible sidewalk.
I felt like an all-terrain vehicle, and only one thought screamed in my brain: "Where are our heated sidewalks?"
Sorry to rant about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/josh-freed-heated-sidewalks-an-idea-whose-time-has-come ) this issue( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/josh-freed-dreaming-of-snow-free-sidewalks-and-a-bustling-downtown ) again,( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/josh-freed-six-reasons-montreal-should-install-heated-sidewalks ) but there's recent reason to rant. Downtown and much of the city are disaster zones, elderly people are scared to step outside and many of us are walking on roads, not sidewalks - preferring our odds against cars rather than ice.
Mayor Plante keeps promising to clear our vast urban icefield, but that might eventually take dynamite.
You may remember city hall nixed former Mayor Coderre's plan to heat Ste-Catherine's sidewalks during the Great Downtown Reconstruction( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ). But this winter is a showcase for why we need them.
The city claimed heated sidewalks were too difficult and costly, but several cities I've visited in winter have long had them, from Oslo and Helsinki to Sapporo, Japan.
Even here in North America the tiny city of Holland, Mich., (population 34,000) has been heating its downtown sidewalks for more than 20 years, with a system called "Snowmelt."
Since Holland gets 193 cm of snow annually, similar to Montreal's 206 cm, I called their city hall to ask what Snowmelt's like.
"Fantastic!" said Holland's downtown development coordinator, Amy Sasamoto. "We just came through a polar vortex blizzard, but our downtown is totally ice and snowflake-free."
Holland started heating some sidewalks in the early 1990s to stave off the threat of a new mall - and its ever-expanding Snowmelt network is now so successful it's the mall that's failing.
"People love to come downtown to be outdoors in winter - kids, seniors, the handicapped, mothers with strollers, everyone!" Sasamoto says. "I love it because I'm a jogger and I wear running shoes all year round."
Holland adds new heated sidewalks to its grid during major repairs, installing underground hot water tubes that melt snow and ice. They recently topped five miles of heated sidewalks - enough to heat Ste-Catherine from St-Denis to Greene Ave. - and they even have several blocks of heated downtown road.
"We don't even plow those downtown streets anymore," says Holland's street superintendent, Scott Boeve. "Ice never forms because rain evaporates as it falls, and Snowmelt gets rid of slush pretty fast, too."
Adds Sasamoto: "Fewer people fall and get hurt, while shoppers don't track snow or salt into stores, so our merchants love it. There's just no downside."
Helsinki, Finland, also heats sidewalks with a hot water system, while Oslo uses either electricity or exhaust from factories. I loved them both because their downtowns were snow-free and pedestrian-filled in winter.
I've also talked to city engineers from Sapporo, where downtown sidewalks have been routinely heated for many years, even though they get 17 feet of snow to our seven.
Does this cost cities a fortune? Since the 1990s, Holland has spent about $12 million in all.
That's pricey for a small city, but a drop in the ice bucket for Montreal, which budgeted $160 million for snow removal alone this winter.
As in Norway, officials in Holland say heating sidewalks is cheaper than plowing - and they can't afford not to heat them.
So why did we abandon our own plan? The city tried a pilot project in Old Montreal's Place-Vauquelin and botched the job( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/completion-of-place-vauquelin-reconstruction-delayed-four-months ), so costs spiralled, as they do for everything in this town.
(Anyone want an overpriced Montreal composting plant( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/st-laurent-composting-plant-cost-soars-again-contractors-will-keep-revenue-from-citys-organic-waste )?)
Instead of learning from Vauquelin by consulting other winter cities, we threw out the baby with the ice water - and dashed our dreams.
Imagine Ste-Catherine as a snow and ice-free oasis this winter. Imagine the crowds swarming there to walk, instead of hiding in malls. Imagine the other downtown streets and commercial districts that would be clamouring for their own heated sidewalks.
In Holland, Snowmelt proved so popular that private citizens recently gathered $500,000 to expand it to a commercial zone outside downtown - and paid for it themselves!
It's too late to heat up the first phase of Ste-Catherine's renovation. We missed the ice-breaking boat. But there's plenty of time to reconsider Phase 2, as well as our planned McGill College Ave. plaza.
Mayor Plante is focussed on a Pink Line, a great idea for someday, but a far-off dream with highway-loving Premier Legault at the provincial budget wheel.
Yet a "Heat Line" cutting through downtown Montreal is a realistic project we can fund ourselves. If it was electric-powered, it might even appeal to Quebec as a Hydro "sidewalk" showcase.
Environment Canada predicts many more weather-swinging winters like this one, so let's start winterizing our city like we do our homes.
If Holland can do it, why can't we? Citizens of Montreal unite - and demand a heat line!
You have nothing to lose but your crampons!

Montreal puts ice breaking on hold as it goes back to snow removal

Full text: Montreal is suspending the de-icing of encrusted sidewalks and streets so it can begin removing the 12 centimetres of snow that fell on Thursday.
Facing a barrage of complaints from slipping-and-sliding pedestrians and drivers, Mayor Valérie Plante said the city had hoped to focus on de-icing after it finished hauling away the 40 centimetres of snow that fell on Feb. 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ).
Then it snowed again.
"Now I have to remove snow again tonight, which is fine - this is what a city has to deal with," Plante told reporters.
The latest snow-removal operation was set to begin at 7 p.m. Thursday.
Montreal has become a "punching bag" for people frustrated by snow and ice, Plante said. But many cities in the region also have sidewalks and roads in poor condition due to temperature swings and alternating snow and rain this winter, she added.
"I'm not trying to minimize the impact on Montrealers. I understand that they are frustrated if they leave their home and the sidewalk out front is icy. But people have to understand that most of the people who work on the snow are the same as those who work on the ice."
Plante said "everybody is doing their best and working really hard. And it's not like this year we cut the budget for snow. We're not trying to save money."
She added: "Of course some streets are not in the best condition because I need to manage with difficult weather conditions and human resources that I have to send here and there" to clear 10,000 kilometres of sidewalks and streets.
However, "the arterial network, the big arteries, both in terms of sidewalks and roads, I think generally they're in very, very good shape," Plante said.
City hall opposition leader Lionel Perez of Ensemble Montréal said "the root cause of much of the problem we're facing today" was the city's decision not to remove snow that fell in early December.
"It's inexcusable to have so many sidewalks that have so much ice on it," he said.
"We're not talking little patches. We've all experienced sidewalks that you literally can't walk on. People with limited mobility, the elderly, (are) literally being kept prisoners in their own homes and apartments."
He said "this is by far the worst winter in terms of icy sidewalks that people can ever remember," pointing to what he described as an unprecedented number of complaints on social media, including by some media personalities( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-week-after-snowstorm-icy-sidewalks-dog-montreal-mayor ).
Perez said Montreal should immediately launch a major operation involving "heavy equipment to break up the ice on the sidewalks to render them safe again. It's going to take a bit of time but they can't wait for the spring thaw. It's definitely going to require a special budget."
After a public uproar over icy sidewalks last year, the Plante administration made much of the purchase of "ice-crushers" - tractors fitted with metal rotors with spikes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) - that can grind up ice on sidewalks and streets. The city bought 10 for $215,000 and has decided to rent another 10 for the winter.
Are they worth the money?
"I never said it would be a miracle solution but it's one of the solutions," Plante said, noting some boroughs are still learning how and when to use the devices.
"It's just one of the different tools that we have and it will not be the last tool that we come up with. The weather is changing, climate change is not going to stop, unfortunately - we need to improve and change our practices."
But Perez described the ice-crushers as little more than "a public-relations exercise."
"We had a difficult situation last year in terms of icy sidewalks and the mayor said we've been using this in Ville-Marie (borough) for the last year and they're great," he said.
But Perez said a closer look at the optimal conditions for the ice-crushers shows that they aren't as helpful as they initially seemed.
He noted they can only be used on ice that is between one inch and two inches thick and they work better on surfaces that don't have many variations. "If you have too many garage entrances, for example, that also hampers efficiency," Perez said.
"So unless you're dealing with some kind of trail in a park, they're not going to be used much on sidewalks. The proof is they haven't been used much this year."

History Through Our Eyes: Feb. 20, 1954, potholes

Full text: Potholes continue to be the bane of Montreal drivers, making for an uncomfortable ride as they do expensive damage to cars. Municipal authorities blame them on our freeze-and-thaw weather cycles; citizens tend to suspect that the city's road construction practices are at least partly responsible.
As demonstrated by this photo from our archives - it is labelled Cedar Ave. and dated Feb. 20, 1954 - the problem has a long history.
As the puddles suggest, the city was experiencing an unseasonably warm spell, what we referred to in a report published that day as a "heat wave." (According to the Environment Canada website, the high Feb. 20, as recorded at McGill University, was 6.7 degrees C.) It was a Saturday. There had been a blizzard earlier in the week, and "1,200 men and more than 20 snow blowers" were still busy clearing snow and slush from major thoroughfares, we reported.
While what appear to be muddy snowbanks are visible at the side of the road, the street itself is littered not by snow, but by crumbling pavement amid the craters.
Two days later, after considerable rain on the Sunday, we wrote: "Four days of mild weather have Montreal streets running with water, and under the surface the pavement is breaking up in many sections." Cars were described as lurching through potholes while "broken asphalt litters the street like pebbles on a beach after a storm." That almost sounds poetic, but no doubt most Montrealers would have used more prosaic language to describe the condition of the streets, as indeed they often do now.

88% of Montreal's most recent snowfall has been cleared. But guess what?

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 66 per cent cleared, LaSalle at 70 per cent and Verdun at 75 per cent as of 10 a.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.
The weather statement from Environment Canada said the "core of precipitation" expected Wednesday night through Thursday morning is snow. However, Montreal and regions close to the border could see some freezing rain mixed in.
The high for Wednesday is expected to be minus-5 degrees Celsius, while the high for Thursday could be 5 C. Friday and Saturday should see-saw over the freezing mark, under sunny skies.

Full text: It's just another manic Monday in Montreal.
But in most of the rest of the country, it's a statutory holiday. In Ontario( https://ottawacitizen.com/sponsored/travel-sponsored/family-day-forecast-perfect-powder-day ), Alberta( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/family-day-in-edmonton-fun-events-for-the-whole-family ), British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, it's Family Day. In Manitoba, it's Louis Riel Day. In Nova Scotia, it's Heritage Day. In Prince Edward Island, it's Islander Day.
Whatever they call it, most Canadians are enjoying a reprieve from the daily grind with a provincially mandated break while we suffer another bout of the Mondays. Somehow that seems wrong.
Sure, Quebec likes to go its own way. We are a distinct society, after all, even when it comes to holidays. We alone celebrate St-Jean-Baptiste Day on June 24 as our Fête nationale. It makes a certain amount of sense to save up long weekends for the summer, when it's actually nice out. But the ROC has a long weekend in August that we do not. So it seems we're still losing out.
There are good arguments for a day off during the doldrums of February. Last week's snowstorm and subsequent snow day( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ) is a case in point for how badly Montrealers want and need a time-out from the schlepping, slipping, shovelling, scraping and shivering. The alacrity with which school, university and CEGEP were cancelled, when the blizzard had barely even begun, speaks to this eagerness for a little respite.
Though the overnight storm that dumped about 40 centimetres on Montreal predictably petered out by mid-morning, it didn't seem like a waste. Even if many parents were forced to work from home on the snow day, some managed to squeeze in a little fresh air to keep the kids from going stir crazy. In my neighbourhood, the parks were transformed into snow forts, people were skiing down the sidewalks and babies were being lugged around on sleds. Neighbours helped each other unearth their buried cars.
There was a sense of tranquility and patience. No one was rushing to get anywhere. There was nowhere really to go. Everyone seemed to be greeting the day with a collective shrug - and a sigh of relief.
Of course, not everyone can work from home on a hastily declared snow day, putting unfortunate pressure on some families. It's a poor substitute for a real holiday, which would allow many more people to take part.
It's true, March break is just around the corner( https://montrealgazette.com/health/family-child/things-to-do-mostly-outside-during-march-break-in-montreal-and-laval ), when schools close and more fortunate families might take ski trips or beach vacations. Yet the school system seems to acknowledge the importance of a breather right about now. Many Montreal schools have not one, but two pedagogical days this week. A little change from the daily routine is welcome for students and teachers alike.
So there's still something to be said for a day off in February, to hunker down with hot chocolate and get your Hygge on( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/recipes/six-oclock-solution-meatball-recipe-goes-straight-to-heart-of-hygge ), or lace up the skates and enjoy one of the outdoor activities that make winter not just bearable, but fun.
This winter, each week has seemed an eternity. Even if the days are getting longer again, many of us are still getting up and returning home in the dark. Snowstorms have been coupled with rainfall and freeze-ups that have made getting around a physical and mental chore.
Seasonal depression is a very real thing( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/seasonal-affective-disorder-mosaic/519495/ ), though poorly understood. And even mild cases - a feeling of lethargy rather than medical diagnosis - deserve to be taken seriously.
One balm for the winter blues( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-is-blue-monday-a-hoax-maybe-not-in-these-parts ) is physical activity, preferably outdoors. Unfortunately, we too often struggle to find the time for such pursuits. So a holiday in February might make time for many.
Of course, a holiday could also be a boost to the local economy and tourism industry if we're looking to add fuel to the fire. Did you take note of all those out-of-town plates in Montreal over the weekend? Many visitors from the province next door spent their Family Day weekend here.
Our own version could help Quebec's ski hills, Nordic spas and museums, too. We could even schedule our Family Day for a different date, to avoid crowds or just to be distinct. The exact timing doesn't really matter.
Nor does the name.
Whether we call it a mental health day or Hibernation Day or Get Outside and Play Day, the point is we're all in need of a rest to gather our strength, marshal our resolve and push through to spring - which is still a dim light flickering at the far end of the tunnel.

Full text: Catch up on what stories you might have missed this week in Montreal.
Parents of Quebec mosque killer Alexandre Bissonnette say his sentence is too harsh( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/parents-of-quebec-mosque-killer-alexandre-bissonnette-say-his-sentence-is-too-harsh )
Bissonnette received an automatic life sentence when he pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder last year. On Friday, Quebec Superior Court Justice François Huot determined that Bissonnette will have to serve 40 years of that life sentence before he becomes eligible for full parole( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-sentenced-to-40-years ). The Crown had requested Bissonnette, who is now 29, serve 150 years before he is eligible for parole, which would have guaranteed Bissonnette would be dead before he could appear before the Parole Board of Canada. On Monday, Bissonnette's parents, Manon Marchand and Raymond Bissonnette, sent a letter to media outlets stating they "consider this to be a very severe sentence."
Winter Laboratory looks at how Montrealers can enjoy a punishing season( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-laboratory-looks-at-how-montrealers-can-enjoy-a-punishing-season )
As Montreal hunkers down for what's predicted to be the worst snowstorm of the year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ), it may be heartening to discover there's a Winter Laboratory in the works to help Quebecers better appreciate what many look upon as their long season of discontent. While Montreal does well at large winter events like Igloofest( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/igloofest-old-port-music-event-puts-the-party-on-ice ), planners note it is lacking in widespread urban offerings that can help alleviate the winter blahs. Included among the key mood-lifting strategies are more small-scale public spaces for winter activities, adding refrigerated rinks, allowing outdoor or enclosed terrasses, and doing whatever it takes to combat slush.
A runner enjoys the winter scene, as he goes for an early morning run at Lafontaine Park on March 14, 2018.
CAQ government open to playing ball in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-government-open-to-playing-ball-in-montreal )
The Coalition Avenir Québec government is very interested in the possible return of Major League Baseball to Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baseball-commish-says-montreal-certainly-is-a-candidate-for-expansion ). But while the party says it is ready to spend taxpayers' money to bring back a team, it also insists the project would have to be financially viable, with revenues exceeding spending. "We are very open," said Chantal Rouleau( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/inside-the-caq-cabinet-francois-legault-names-13-women-13-men ), the minister responsible for the Montreal region, as she emerged from a cabinet meeting Wednesday. "We are in favour of the return of baseball to Montreal.
STM says it didn't have enough buses to go around in 2018( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-says-it-didnt-have-enough-buses-to-go-around-in-2018 )
The city's transit agency says hundreds of thousands of Montrealers have already been inconvenienced this year by its maintenance union's lack of productivity. "For the first five weeks of 2019, 430,000 customers were affected by cuts in service," Sylvain St-Denis, a supervisor at the Société de transport de Montréal's control centre, told a hearing at the Tribunal administratif de travail on Thursday. The STM asked the tribunal to intervene, claiming mechanics in its maintenance union are purposely working slower than usual because of a labour dispute, and that it amounts to an illegal pressure tactic.
A broken-down STM bus blocks part of a Montreal street in 2017.
CAQ election was more 'desire for change' than green light for party ideas, study says( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-election-was-more-desire-for-change-than-green-light-for-party-ideas-study-says )
A new study indicates the October election of the Coalition Avenir Québec government was more driven by Quebecers' desire for change than an endorsement of the party's often controversial vision and policies. In fact, the study concludes, 40 per cent of Quebecers who voted CAQ today oppose the new government's plans to slash immigration levels by 20 per cent even though the CAQ repeatedly says it thinks it has a strong electoral mandate to proceed. The study( http://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/february-2019/quebec-2018-les-raisons-du-vote/ ), published Thursday in the web magazine Policy Options, operated by the Institute for Research on Public Policy, includes fresh poll data produced by the Ipsos firm. The poll concludes the movement that carried François Legault to power was above all "circumstantial" and motivated by Quebecers' desire for a change of regime after nearly 15 years of Liberal rule.

Josh Freed: Embracing Snow Days does not make you a weather wimp

Full text: The weather predictions before Wednesday's snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ) sounded like terror warnings. There was talk of mega-blizzards, Snowmageddon and "snow bombs," while weather reporters sounded like sportscasters crying:
"Will we break the Montreal Olympic snow record for all time?"
By Tuesday night, schools had cancelled classes and CEGEPs and universities soon followed, declaring Snow Days.
An old-fashioned part of me rebelled: It seemed yet another sign we were all becoming weather wimps who increasingly hide from winter in our cars, malls, indoor hockey rinks and underground cities.
Only two days earlier, a U.S. paper had called me to talk winter and mentioned Toronto was declaring a Snow Day - and I'd scoffed at that city. Now we were doing the same.
"What next?" I thought. "Would we call in the army?"
However, when I stepped out of my house Wednesday morning( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), I reconsidered my feelings. I saw a street full of neighbours who looked like anything but weather wimps.
My block was a blinding white landscape, dotted with people frenetically shovelling out cars from waist-high mountains of snow. Many cars were so completely clumped in snow, I had to clear off several licence plates just to see which clump was mine.
Other people were plowing out walkways or helping neighbours push cars. The sound of spinning wheels, straining motors and window scrapers filled the air in a Symphony of Winter Survival Sounds.
Yet many people were in a surprisingly good mood. Some were parents relieved they didn't have to drive their kids to school in snow and traffic. Others had been inspired by Snow Day - and decided to play hooky from work.
As Snow Day went on, I saw other benefits. It was a warm, beautiful winter day, so kids were making snow angels in my park. Farther north in Rosemont, there was a lane party going on nicknamed "La guerre des tuques," where families celebrated winter with old-fashioned snowball fights, instead of whining.
Plateau-Mont-Royal had chosen to clean the Jeanne Mance Park bike path before most sidewalks, although no one was cycling. But at least people could jog and walk on it.
On the Main, at least half my local stores were closed, as shop owners took their own personal Snow Day. A lawyer friend said half his office's support staff never showed up - but the firm had to pay them for a Snow Day anyway.
But that created another dilemma. People who had struggled to come in felt they were working for nothing, and should have stayed home. In the end, the office gave double time to those who had made it - could this be a Canadian legal precedent for Snow Day pay?
One person enjoying a semi-Snow Day was my mailman, Maxim, who told me (next day):
"Snowstorms are usually impossible! You can't park, so you leave the truck a block away, then trudge through snow up to your knees with big stacks of mail. Many people don't clear their stairs, so you can't even deliver their mail and have to carry it back."
He says this was the first snowstorm when Canada Post told mail carriers to forget private residences and just deliver to companies and large apartments. Still, "everyone got their mail - only a day late."
So many people declared their own personal Snow Day, you could find a rush-hour seat on some normally jam-packed métro lines. With motorists off the roads, there was also a lovely silence as the snow seemed to muffle all sound.
Downtown was as quiet as a weekend morning. The best part was the fresh snow covered up downtown's black glacial ice we've been slithering on like crabs for weeks - so you could finally dump your crampons.
Once the snow melts and the ice re-surfaces, I have a great idea to prevent this problem in the future: How about those heated Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks that Projet Montréal nixed?
Late Wednesday, I left my house an hour early for my weekly tennis game, expecting nightmarish, dangerous traffic - but I got there easier and faster than ever since no one else was on the road.
It all had a sense of "je me souviens," reminding me of snowstorms of my youth when schools, stores and life shut down everywhere because there was no choice.
We didn't have the snow-cleaning equipment to quickly clear streets back then, or today's four-wheel-drive snow-busting vehicles, so the city just stopped still for Mother Nature's snow days.
Eventually, we developed today's arsenal of anti-snow technology and our new 24/7 mentality took over, where we take pride in keeping our city and schools running whatever the weather.
But I've suddenly become a convert and a fan of Toronto-style Snow Days. I think we should have more of them whenever it snows a lot - or even a little.
In fact, Monday is a holiday in most other provinces called Family Day, that Quebecers don't get.
Snow Day, anyone?

Full text: The weather predictions before Wednesday's snowstorm sounded like terror warnings. There was talk of mega-blizzards, Snowmageddon and "snow bombs," while weather reporters sounded like sportscasters crying: "Will we break the Montreal Olympic snow record for all time?" By Tuesday night, schools had cancelled classes and CEGEPs and universities soon followed, declaring Snow Days.
An old-fashioned part of me rebelled: It seemed yet another sign we were all becoming weather wimps who increasingly hide from winter in our cars, malls, indoor hockey rinks and underground cities.

It's smart to take weather warnings seriously; For those who could, staying home Wednesday was the right thing to do

Full text: Every Montrealer and their uncle felt the wrath of this week's snowmageddon one way or another, whether it was shovelling their way out of their home, trudging right up the middle of streets because sidewalks were impassable, or driving along the pothole-riddled, snowbank-lined roads.
I'll leave the bickering over the quality of snow removal to our city officials, except to note that anyone who lives in the West Island and drives downtown for work can see and feel the difference between the city of Montreal and the suburban municipalities.
As a parent and Montrealer, I have never been more preoccupied with weather alerts than I have been this year. Yes, some have been false alarms, but best to err on the side of caution.
This week's alert was the real thing, and by Tuesday, it seemed everyone was bracing for the onslaught.
My kids were jumping up and down when they heard the news that they were going to have a snow day Wednesday. I let out a sigh of relief because as crazy as it can get to have a hyper teen and pre-teen home while you're trying to work, there is nothing quite like knowing your kids are home safe while Mother Nature does her thing.
Not everybody is so fortunate as to be able to take time off from work if there is a weather advisory in effect, nor can every job be done from home, but when we hear about a major storm system moving in, with freezing rain warning or whiteout conditions, it's best to stay home if at all possible. There is no point arguing with someone who does not have a choice in the matter, but those who do have the opportunity but opt not to heed the warnings are merely being foolish.
A few weeks back, as I was leaving downtown late one evening after work, a dear friend messaged me and suggested I stay downtown and not risk driving back to the West Island because the weather was going to be particularly dangerous. I brushed aside the suggestion, and told her I appreciated her concern. After white-knuckling the steering wheel for the 90 minutes it took me to get home, I will think twice about doing that again. Later that evening, I noticed that several off-island Facebook groups were discussing whether to drive home, and a bunch of people were staying near the airport so as to cut short their commute.
Deciding whether to head out can be a life and death matter. I was saddened at the news that a dear family friend and longtime reader of the Montreal Gazette died last week in a multi-car pileup caused by poor weather conditions. She was returning home from the funeral of a relative in Ontario. We were devastated, and as news of her passing spread, the Montreal Pakistani/Indian community grieved the loss of this intelligent, eloquent woman who had given so much to those she loved.
I am amazed by the number of times I'll hear other parents driving across town to take their child to a sporting event during a storm or blizzard. Sports clubs need to cancel practices or games if there is a weather warning in effect. I've heard some say it's because they don't want to lose their deposit for the facility rental. We need to be more cautious when it comes to the safety and well-being of our children.
While we cannot control Mother Nature, we can control how much attention we pay to weather warnings. While we're blessed to have some of the best snow removal in the world (all jokes aside), we all need to do our parts to ensure the safety of ourselves and our families.

Full text: A massive winter storm that lashed Southern Ontario this week moved through Quebec and into the Maritimes on Wednesday, closing schools, restricting travel and shuttering many businesses and offices for the day.
Few areas were spared as activities across much of Eastern Canada were disrupted, from the Dennis Oland murder trial to outdoor events at Quebec City's winter carnival.
"It's been a long day," said Troy Arsenault, who fought a losing battle as he cleared snow from the steps in front of Fredericton's Beaverbrook Art Gallery Wednesday.
"It's our third time here ... the wind keeps blowing the snow right back to where we've cleared it."
Jill Maepea, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said much of New Brunswick was expecting close to 35 centimetres of snow from the storm by Wednesday night, with more on the way.
All of New Brunswick and P.E.I., and much of Nova Scotia and Southern Quebec were under similar winter-storm warnings.
Areas of western Nova Scotia also received heavy snow Wednesday morning, but weather in much of the province had changed over to freezing rain or rain by midday. Environment Canada said winds could also gust to 80 kilometres an hour and combine with freezing rain to make travel treacherous.
Schools and universities in almost all of the region were closed or delaying their openings, along with some government offices and businesses. The courts in Saint John opened as scheduled Wednesday morning, but closed at noon because of the blizzard, adjourning Mr.Oland's retrial in his father's killing for the day.
Airports in Fredericton, Halifax and Charlottetown were reporting dozens of flight cancellations, a day after the scene played out in Toronto where there were mass flight disruptions and widespread closings of schools, tourist attractions and non-essential municipal services. A "no-travel advisory" for New Brunswick highways was issued Wednesday.
Al Giberson, general manager of MRDC - the company responsible for the stretch of TransCanada Highway between Fredericton and Moncton - said snow was accumulating as fast as four to five centimetres an hour.
"The real challenge though is the heavy snowfall, and the wind that has come with it, has made visibility very poor. Driving conditions are very treacherous," Mr. Giberson said.
Much of Southern Quebec also remained under a winter-storm warning after about 30 centimetres of snow fell in Montreal, forcing the closing of schools and major travel disruptions.
In Quebec City, the weather was bad enough that even the winter carnival was forced to close its outdoor activity sites Wednesday. Organizers said the temporary shutdown was necessary to ensure the "safety of everyone."
Between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow were expected to fall in Quebec depending on the region, with strong winds reducing visibility on some roads to almost zero. Several highways were closed Wednesday morning, including Highway 20 in both directions between Lévis and Montmagny.

Full text: Montreal is getting back to normal after a major snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ) closed schools, clogged roads and sidewalks and convinced many workers to take a snow day.
The clean-up is underway.
Forty centimetres of snow fell between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère said.
During an average snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal. So far this season, with more than two months to go, the tally is 180 cm, according to Environment Canada statistics.
The intense storm led all public schools on Montreal Island to cancel classes Wednesday. CEGEPs and universities followed suit. They are all expected to reopen Thursday. Canada Post canceled mail delivery across Quebec due to severe weather.
Snow crews plowing roads and sidewalks were helped by the lack of students on the road and the fact that many workers heeded officials' calls to stay home or use public transit.
Danny Lee shovels the sidewalk outside his business on Metcalfe St. on Wednesday.
But Société de transport de Montréal buses were slowed by the sheer amount of snow on Montreal roads, leaving some commuters facing long delays. And many who opted for Exo commuter trains were thwarted by delays and mechanical breakdowns. Only one of Exo's six lines - Mont-St-Hilaire - was problem-free Wednesday.
The city of Montreal said workers spreading abrasives and plowing snow prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries.
Starting Wednesday evening, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles were to begin hauling away snow, an operation expected to take about a week.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration has been criticized for how it has handled snow and ice removal during a winter marked by wild temperature fluctuations and a wide variety of precipitation, from rain to freezing drizzle to freezing rain to snow.
Ensemble Montréal, the opposition party at city hall, says Montreal's poor planning is to blame for thick layers of ice found on some streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ).
On Wednesday, Plante said it will cost between $25 million and $35 million to remove the latest snowfall.
Eloi Morin takes a jump as he slides down the hill at Lafontaine Park on Wednesday.
The original plan had been to start the snow-removal operation on Thursday morning.
"We're going to start taking away all the snow (Wednesday night) because we didn't want to wait till (Thursday) morning," Plante said.
"We know a lot of people will be working tomorrow morning so if we can do as much as we can overnight, tonight, it's great. But of course it will take some time."
She said people should take the métro if possible, noting Wednesday's ride was smooth, likely because many children and their parents stayed home. Thursday's commute would undoubtedly be much busier, she said.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Wednesday morning that the province was coping with the storm and there were no deaths or major incidents.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads," Guilbault said.
Montreal's weather rollercoaster ride may continue in the coming days.
Environment Canada says more snow may fall Thursday, possibly followed by rain on Friday as the temperature shoots up above zero. The forecast for Saturday: sunny with a high of -3 C.

Full text: This was a live blog about the major snowstorm that hit Montreal on Feb. 12 and13.
3 p.m.: Thanks for following
That's it for today's live blog. Check in with montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) regularly for updates on the storm and its aftermath.
2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.
1:35 p.m.: Digging out
L'agente Chèvrefils se prépare à aller sur la route. Le déneigement des autopatrouilles fait aussi partie des tâches de nos policiers.#SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Ow3oCp0WFh( https://t.co/Ow3oCp0WFh )
- Police Montréal (@SPVM) February 13, 2019( https://twitter.com/SPVM/status/1095736053351309312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

10 a.m.: How to shovel and drive
Montrealers know snow. But some of us can use a refresher course in winter.
We have posted some handy and timely shovelling and driving tips( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-survival-guide ).
9:50 a.m.: Snow Day in photos

9:30 a.m.: No major incidents
Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

8:50 a.m.: Snow-loading starts tonight
Montreal just announced it will start loading snow in some parts of the city at 7 p.m. tonight. It is expected to take seven to eight days to haul it all away.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

Full text: This was a live blog about the major snowstorm that hit Montreal on Feb. 12 and13.
3 p.m.: Thanks for following
That's it for today's live blog. Check in with montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) regularly for updates on the storm and its aftermath.
2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

8:50 a.m.: Snow-loading starts tonight
Montreal just announced it will start loading snow in some parts of the city at 7 p.m. tonight. It is expected to take seven to eight days to haul it all away.
Watch where you park. The Info-Neige smartphone app does a pretty good job helping you track snow operations.

8:10 a.m.: Too much winter
Quebec City says its Carnaval is the biggest winter carnival in the world. But sometimes there's just too much winter. The weather is so bad in the provincial capital that some carnival sites have been closed.
Attention: L'organisation du Carnaval de Québec annonce, en raison des mauvaises conditions climatiques et en regard de la sécurité de toutes et de tous, la fermeture temporaire de ses sites (Cour Royale Loto-Québec et Camp à Jos présenté par Videotron). #carnavalqc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/carnavalqc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

9:30 a.m.: No major incidents
Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

10 a.m.: How to shovel and drive
Montrealers know snow. But some of us can use a refresher course in winter.
We have posted some handy and timely shovelling and driving tips( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-survival-guide ).

In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."

8:10 a.m.: Too much winter
Quebec City says its Carnaval is the biggest winter carnival in the world. But sometimes there's just too much winter. The weather is so bad in the provincial capital that some carnival sites have been closed.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

The STM also has a message for users in wheelchairs: "Due to the weather conditions, we suggest that you re-schedule your plans and travel another time."
Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself prepared for the snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas were expected to receive 40 centimetres. Strong winds were also in the forecast.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision: all announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is forecast to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snowstorm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city's snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels had been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home, just do that. And we encourage every job-giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible, of course."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has learned its lessons from past storms, including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"With a big storm in the works, I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, zero risk doesn't exist, but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/1095471975164715014 ) had called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So, as my colleague said, we hope people will stay home or adapt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: In Case You Missed It (#ICYMI) is a daily feature highlighting news in and around Montreal.
Students across the province are no doubt cheering the snowstorm that hit much of the province Tuesday evening, with forecasts predicting Montreal could receive as much as 40 centimetres along with high winds creating blizzard conditions through much of Wednesday. Many schoolboards have cancelled Wednesday classes. Meanwhile, Montreal city hall declared itself prepared for the snowstorm.
P.S. Planning to do some snow shovelling on Wednesday? If so, do yourself a favour: check out the tips in the video above, for safety's sake.
Pedestrians cross Peel St. in downtown Montreal at the beginning of a major storm Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019, that was expected to drop 30 to 40 centimetres of snow on Montreal overnight.

Still on the subject of snow, how about this: As Montreal hunkers down for what's predicted to be the worst snowstorm of the year, it may be heartening to discover there's a Winter Laboratory in the works to help Quebecers better appreciate what many look upon as their long season of discontent.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels had been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home, just do that. And we encourage every job-giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible, of course."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has learned its lessons from past storms, including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"With a big storm in the works, I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, zero risk doesn't exist, but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/1095471975164715014 ) had called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So, as my colleague said, we hope people will stay home or adapt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself ready for the major snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds were also expected.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision. All announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations were expected to begin Thursday morning.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snow storm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself will show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 in when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency coordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working tonight for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road tonight. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm expected to hit the city Tuesday and Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
At least one Montreal school board - Lester B. Pearson - announced Tuesday evening that all its schools will be shut Wednesday to students and staff. Its day care services and head office also won't open.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations are expected to begin Thursday morning.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight, in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers are expected to work Wednesday. They have ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snow storm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems tonight and tomorrow is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible tomorrow and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."

Guilbault noted an emergency coordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working tonight for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road tonight. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."

Full text: As Montreal hunkers down for what's predicted to be the worst snowstorm of the year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ), it may be heartening to discover there's a Winter Laboratory in the works to help Quebecers better appreciate what many look upon as their long season of discontent.
While Montreal does well at large winter events like Igloofest( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/igloofest-old-port-music-event-puts-the-party-on-ice ), planners note it is lacking in widespread urban offerings that can help alleviate the winter blahs.
Included among the key mood-lifting strategies are more small-scale public spaces for winter activities, adding refrigerated rinks, allowing outdoor or enclosed terrasses, and doing whatever it takes to combat slush.
The Winter Laboratory was launched in late January by three urban planning organizations - Vivre en Ville, Rues Principales and La Pépinière/Espaces Collectifs - to bring together local government, community organizations and the private sector to develop pilot projects and share ideas that can be used throughout Quebec.
"It's during this long season that social isolation is at its most pronounced, and inactivity, particularly among children, becomes a major public health challenge," Jérôme Glad, co-director of La Pépinière/Espaces Collectifs, said in a statement. "We need to create more spontaneous occasions in which to get out and move, in the heart of our neighbourhoods, so we don't lose the community spirit that elevates the quality of life of our cities."
With 148 days below freezing and 210 centimetres (seven feet) of snow each year on average, Montreal's winters are some of the harshest among international urban centres. Yet we lack urban spaces or designs featured in other northern cities that encourage people to go outside and embrace winter, seen as a chief element in alleviating the depression and isolation that often accompany the season.
Research conducted by PhD student Kari Leibowitz in the northern Norwegian city of Tromso concluded that one of the key means of combating winter gloom is changing one's mindset.( https://www.fastcompany.com/3052970/the-norwegian-secret-to-enjoying-a-long-winter ) Residents there take part in outdoor activities (particularly cross-country skiing), enjoy the coziness of a candlelit room, and attend numerous community events and festivals. Residents here can alleviate seasonal depression by getting out for a brisk walk (while avoiding icy sidewalks), resisting the North American temptation to gripe about the weather, and meeting with friends.
To encourage those types of activities and interactions, organizers of the Winter Laboratory published a guide, titled Winter City, with suggestions on how to make a city more winter-friendly.( https://vivreenville.org/notre-travail/publications/collection-vers-des-collectivites-viables/2019/ville-d-hiver.aspx ) Among the main suggestions:
Design park installations and outdoor seating areas to be used year-round, as opposed to just in the summer, adding elements like refrigerated rinks, lighting, and mini-terrasses where people can chat.
With more frequent freeze/thaw cycles, Montreal winters are characterized by street corner slush ponds that bring a negative view of public spaces. Minimize slush, particularly in popular pedestrian zones like Ste-Catherine St., by constructing sidewalk enlargements and raised pedestrian walkways, and putting more resources into clearing sewage drains.
Add benches or public terrasses in places that get the most sun, areas that have their own microclimates and generate warmer weather.
Increase the number of pedestrian-only streets to encourage walking areas and commerce, and reduce the number of streets that have to be cleared of snow.
Montreal has hundreds of "green alleyways" where spaces once reserved for vehicle traffic have become children's play areas and attractive walking zones. Focus on creating similar "white alleyways" to encourage play, and skating and sliding by building mini-rinks.
Make nature accessible. For example: the Norwegian forest area known as Nordmarka is easily accessible by Oslo's metro, and has cafés with viewing areas over fjords and countryside, and numerous winter sporting activities to take part in or watch, including cross-country skiing, luge and ski jumping and tobogganing.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm expected to hit the city Tuesday and Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight, in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations are expected to begin Thursday morning.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers are expected to work Wednesday. They have ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).

He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems tonight and tomorrow is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible tomorrow and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself will show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 in when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency coordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working tonight for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road tonight. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: After facing criticism for the way it has handled removing snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm that is expected to blow into the city Tuesday afternoon.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, said Tuesday.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration with previous snow-clearing operations this winter.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are covered with thick layers of ice that will make snow clearing more difficult.
He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Government officials and the provincial police force urged people to delay travel if possible during the storm.
The Sûreté du Québec said if driving, motorists should "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
At Trudeau airport, dozens of flights in and out of the city were cancelled or delayed on Tuesday afternoon.
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm. The Société de transport de Montréal said people show allow extra time for travel.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel wrote on his Twitter account that: "I am following the evolution of the storm that will move into Quebec over the next few hours. If possible, delay any travel and thank you for doing so. If not, adapt your driving (to road conditions)."
That message was echoed by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial force responsible for patrolling Quebec highways. In a statement posted soon after Bonnardel's tweet, the SQ urged motorists to "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
Meanwhile, Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm.
Bonnardel's warning, made at a little before 11 a.m., came as a winter storm warning for the Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#191837342337813415201902110504ww1070cwul ) entered its seventh hour. And even though the first lashes of snow weren't expected to be felt until 6 p.m., the effects of its passage east from Ontario were already being felt locally.
At Trudeau airport, several flights to Toronto and the U.S. Midwest were listed as delayed or cancelled, as were most of Tuesday morning's incoming flights from Toronto.
City of Montreal officials were expected to meet the press Tuesday morning to detail their plan to handle the expected pummelling from the storm system, which is expected to arrive in time for supper on Tuesday and dwell over the area until Wednesday evening, dropping about a centimetre of snow every hour during its stay. The storm will also include high winds that will blow whatever snow does accumulate into potential white-outs on the highways, adding to the urgency of Bonnardel's advice.

Full text: After facing criticism for the way it has handled removing snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm that is expected to blow into the city Tuesday afternoon.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, said Tuesday.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration with previous snow-clearing operations this winter.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are covered with thick layers of ice that will make snow clearing more difficult.
He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel wrote on his Twitter account that: "I am following the evolution of the storm that will move into Quebec over the next few hours. If possible, delay any travel and thank you for doing so. If not, adapt your driving (to road conditions)."
That message was echoed by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial force responsible for patrolling Quebec highways. In a statement posted soon after Bonnardel's tweet, the SQ urged motorists to "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
Meanwhile, Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm.
Bonnardel's warning, made at a little before 11 a.m., came as a winter storm warning for the Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#191837342337813415201902110504ww1070cwul ) entered its seventh hour. And even though the first lashes of snow weren't expected to be felt until 6 p.m., the effects of its passage east from Ontario were already being felt locally.
At Trudeau airport, several flights to Toronto and the U.S. Midwest were listed as delayed or cancelled, as were most of Tuesday morning's incoming flights from Toronto.
City of Montreal officials were expected to meet the press Tuesday morning to detail their plan to handle the expected pummelling from the storm system, which is expected to arrive in time for supper on Tuesday and dwell over the area until Wednesday evening, dropping about a centimetre of snow every hour during its stay. The storm will also include high winds that will blow whatever snow does accumulate into potential white-outs on the highways, adding to the urgency of Bonnardel's advice.

Beis says suburbs put Montreal to shame on snow clearing

Full text: Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis says Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante shouldn't be telling anyone how to go about snow removal operations.
Beis said his suburban borough puts the city centre to shame when it comes to snow clearing.
"Well, (Plante) can send her team to the West Island and we'll show them how to do it. You can quote that because it's ridiculous."
Beis was reacting to a letter Plante( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ) sent out to Montreal's 19 borough mayors last week, calling upon them to do a better job of clearing away the white stuff.
City officials came under criticism after a frigid January blizzard, combined with freezing rain, left city streets and sidewalks caked in ice.
Beis, who called the state of icy downtown streets a "war zone," bristled at Plante's letter.
"It's an insult we would receive something like this when they're only trying to cover up their own misfortunes in the city centre," Beis said.
Plante's letter told the borough mayors said she wouldn't accept inadequate results.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," Plante wrote. "My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory."
Plante later told reporters that she wanted to achieve the same snow-clearing standards in all parts of the city. "It's not about targeting and saying this one is good, this one is bad," she said.
Beis called the mayor's letter "strictly a PR move" to deflect criticism of treacherous road and sidewalk conditions in the city centre.
"We could give them lessons," he added. "Unfortunately the problem is they have no communication with us. They don't reach out.
"What they need to do is get in their car and drive around and see some of their neighbours before they throw out some orders like this.
"It's not only us, it's also the rest of the West Island. As I said on Facebook, the West Island cities can also be used as models because we get it right."
In 2015, Montreal's City Council, then under Mayor Denis Coderre, adopted a snow removal policy that standardized snow removal practices across its territory. Under the policy, snow loading operations are to commence at the same time in all 19 boroughs. The policy also sets out standards on snow clearance, spreading abrasives and snow loading.
Once the signal is given by the city centre to begin operations, ultimately the boroughs are responsible for removing snow and spreading abrasives on streets and sidewalks.
Beis admitted snow removal and de-icing by city crews can be difficult under extreme weather conditions.
"It's not always perfect because of the weather, but we certainly do a better job than some of our counterparts in the centre city. They can spew all kinds of nonsense by saying they have cars and (street) parking and whatever they want. But sidewalks don't have cars."
Beis said he was appalled by the messy road conditions while visiting a friend at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in the east end two weekends ago.
"I have to tell you it was a horror story over there. You couldn't even walk on the sidewalks and you couldn't park anywhere, and this is near a hospital.
"Downtown is the same thing, and neighbouring boroughs are the same thing."
Beis said these treacherous road conditions would be unacceptable to residents of Pierrefonds and Roxboro.
"If I had this in my community, I'd tell you I'd be out tomorrow.
"Like I've said many times, it's not perfect out here, but we know the recipe of what has to get done."

Full text: Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis says Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante shouldn't be telling anyone how to go about snow removal operations.
Beis said his suburban borough puts the city centre to shame when it comes to snow clearing.
"Well, (Plante) can send her team to the West Island and we'll show them how to do it. You can quote that because it's ridiculous."
Beis was reacting to a letter Plante sent out to Montreal's 19 borough mayors last week, calling upon them to do a better job of clearing away the white stuff.
City officials came under criticism after a frigid January blizzard, combined with freezing rain, left city streets and sidewalks caked in ice.
Beis, who called the state of icy downtown streets a "war zone," bristled at Plante's letter.
"It's an insult we would receive something like this when they're only trying to cover up their own misfortunes in the city centre," Beis said.
Plante's letter told the borough mayors said she wouldn't accept inadequate results.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," Plante wrote. "My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory."
Plante later told reporters that she wanted to achieve the same snow-clearing standards in all parts of the city. "It's not about targeting and saying this one is good, this one is bad," she said.
Beis called the mayor's letter "strictly a PR move" to deflect criticism of treacherous road and sidewalk conditions in the city centre.
"We could give them lessons," he added. "Unfortunately the problem is they have no communication with us. They don't reach out.
"What they need to do is get in their car and drive around and see some of their neighbours before they throw out some orders like this.
"It's not only us, it's also the rest of the West Island. As I said on Facebook, the West Island cities can also be used as models because we get it right."
In 2015, Montreal's City Council, then under Mayor Denis Coderre, adopted a snow removal policy that standardized snow removal practices across its territory. Under the policy, snow loading operations are to commence at the same time in all 19 boroughs. The policy also sets out standards on snow clearance, spreading abrasives and snow loading.
Once the signal is given by the city centre to begin operations, ultimately the boroughs are responsible for removing snow and spreading abrasives on streets and sidewalks.
Beis admitted snow removal and de-icing by city crews can be difficult under extreme weather conditions.
"It's not always perfect because of the weather, but we certainly do a better job than some of our counterparts in the centre city. They can spew all kinds of nonsense by saying they have cars and (street) parking and whatever they want. But sidewalks don't have cars."
Beis said he was appalled by the messy road conditions while visiting a friend at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in the east end two weekends ago.
"I have to tell you it was a horror story over there. You couldn't even walk on the sidewalks and you couldn't park anywhere, and this is near a hospital. Downtown is the same thing, and neighbouring boroughs are the same thing."
Beis said these treacherous road conditions would be unacceptable to residents of Pierrefonds and Roxboro.
"If I had this in my community, I'd tell you I'd be out tomorrow.

What they call in U.S. a national emergency we just call winter

Full text: Dear America: I've been following your "extreme weather" news coverage, and I know you've been in crisis - under assault from the polar vortex.
There were "whiteouts" in North Dakota, scary weekly snowfalls of 37 inches in Buffalo, and temperatures plunging to minus 23 F (minus -30.5 C) in Chicago with a "real feel" of minus 29 F (minus -33.8 C).
The New York Times calls it "The Big Freeze" - but frankly, it just sounds like another winter day in Quebec and Canada.
Here in Montreal, we've been going through rougher weather for weeks: an ever-changing smorgasbord of blizzards, followed by rainstorms, followed by freezing temperatures, murderous wind chills, treacherous ice.
But for us, it's just crummy winter weather, while for you it's a national emergency. U.S. governors declared national disasters, closing schools and universities for days. Iowa officials warned people to "avoid taking deep breaths, and to minimize talking" if they stepped outside.
Newspaper headlines across America shrieked it was "colder than Alaska" ... "colder than Antarctica" ... "colder than Mars."
Reading it all, I certainly felt some sympathy, since we Montrealers have been there often. But I did have mixed feelings. I confess that like many people here, I also got a certain satisfaction from knowing you were sharing our pain.
It's that unique Canadian joy of knowing others are as cold, or colder than us.
I call that feeling schaden-froid, my version of the German word schadenfreude, which means the guilty happiness you sometimes get from someone else's misfortune.
You may experience schadenfreude when your office rival has just been fired, or your ex-boyfriend's house has burned down, or you've just heard someone you don't like mispronounce the fancy German word schadenfreude.
In fact, I rarely get more response to this column than when things in my life go wrong, whether I lose my phone, drop my car keys down a drain or my balcony gets taken over by pigeons.
I've often said the worse my week, the happier I make my readers, as they experience schadenFreed. But schaden-froid is a unique and especially powerful emotion here in Canada during winter, when we all get a tiny bit of joy from other countries' cold.
It's nothing personal, America, just part of being a Canadian and especially a Montrealer, who lives in one of the coldest, snowiest cities on Earth.
After all, we know people elsewhere are always hearing about our winter weather and thinking: "Boy, I'm happy I don't live there!" So it's only natural for us to do the same when we get a rare chance.
But schaden-froid actually runs much deeper in our Canadian psyche. That's why when Canadians go away on winter holiday, they obsessively follow the weather back home, eager to see what they've escaped.
"Listen up everyone! It's minus 28 in Montreal today, with 43 centimetres of snow expected tomorrow," they'll announce gleefully to everyone on their Costa Rican beach. "Wow, I'm glad I'm not there, heh-heh."
Part of any good Canadian winter holiday is knowing what others at home are living through that you're not.
That's also why in Florida, the Weather Network gets huge ratings whenever there's a winter storm in the North. It's a million Canadian snowbirds (and New England ones) all dying to see what horrible weather they're missing.
That said, you can only take this sleazy emotion so far. People enjoying a little schaden-froid should always do it politely, and even secretly - keeping it between others in the same temperature zone as them.
No one wants to get an email photo of you sacked out on the beach, a margarita in your hand, while they're waiting for the 15 bus, in -22 degrees, while hanging onto the bus stop pole to keep from slipping on a five-inchthick slab of glacial sidewalk ice.
So don't be a schaden-showoff
- and keep your schaden-froid to yourself. In fact, if you're on an exotic vacation and sending photos, I'd prefer to see one of you caught in a tropical storm.
Besides, you'll get plenty of schaden-envy once you get home - and every last person you meet says: "Boy, you really timed your holiday well, It was as cold as Mars here, only worse."
But of course how couldn't you time your vacation well, when you took it during the middle of a Montreal winter? Yet for all my schaden-froid about the recent U.S. cold snap, I also feel some schaden-shame - a twinge of guilt for feeling good about their weather misfortune.
After all, I know people in the U.S. were freezing, or without power, or worse, while thousands of flights were cancelled.
I ask myself: How can I be so heartless, so petty, so shallow, so mean? My schaden-froid and my schaden-shame struggle like angels and devils on my shoulder - fighting for my soul.
Yet somehow my schaden-froid often wins and I suspect yours does, too. But if you want to know why, you'll have to read Freud, not Freed. joshfreed49@gmail.com

Full text: I've never paid much heed to Groundhog Day. No, not the Bill Murray movie, but the Feb. 2 "holiday" itself, when a cute little rodent pokes his head out of a hole and looks for its shadow to predict whether spring is coming sooner or later.
This year, I can't wait for Fred to pop up in Val-d'Espoir out in Quebec's Gaspé region( https://livestream.com/accounts/6944075/events/8537194 ) on Saturday. Because the arrival of February means January 2019 is finally, mercifully over. We're one day closer to the end of winter, no matter what Fred sees. (And to be honest, I'm not particularly optimistic about his forecast).
We just battled through the longest, darkest, most soul-destroying January I can remember. And I say this as someone who likes winter, doesn't mind the odd cold snap and revels in snowstorms. But the bone-chilling temperatures and the wild weather fluctuations of the last month nearly did me in.
The drastic swing from blizzard to polar vortex to freezing rain to rain to flash freeze within the space of mere hours has wreaked havoc on the human spirit and infrastructure alike.
Between the sting of wind chill and the constant fear of falling on the sidewalks, daily life has been downright dangerous. And I'm a reasonably healthy, fairly active, and fully mobile person. I can't even imagine how difficult things have been for the frail, the elderly or the homeless.
The cold claimed the life of Hélène Rowley Hotte, 93( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/montreal-woman-93-freezes-to-death-outside-seniors-residence ), the mother of former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe on Jan. 20. She somehow became locked outside her retirement villa in Montreal's east-end during a fire alarm and perished. An investigation into the tragedy is ongoing.
But the ice has led to casualties of its own, with record numbers of falls on slippery streets and sidewalks. Urgences Santé received an astounding 140 calls an hour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/after-snow-slush-and-flooding-montreals-street-clearing-makes-gains ), up from an average of 70 a day, after the deluge of rain melted the snowpack then rapidly froze into a solid mass with the consistency of concrete and the smoothness of a freshly flooded skating rink. The ambulance service took the step of imploring Montrealers not to go out, the conditions were so dire. Most of us would have been happy to comply, so strong was the urge to hibernate.
A week later, surfaces remain as slick and slippery as ever. The thick layer of ice seems impervious to all efforts to bring it under control. The disastrous weather has clearly complicated the city's snow-clearing efforts, making the task more challenging than usual.
But let's focus on Montreal's snow-clearing operations for a moment. Abysmal circumstances aside, they've been ... abysmal.
Citizens have been complaining. Mayor Valérie Plante sent a stern letter to the boroughs telling them to step up their game( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ). But it seems like it's the same story, year after year, no matter who's in charge or how extraordinary the weather might be.
How is it Montreal hasn't figured this out yet, after 377 years? We seem to have one response to making the sidewalks passable: salt the heck out them. But this week, that proved an exercise in futility. Mother Nature tried to give us a reprieve from the fury she unleashed a week earlier. A fresh coat of snow blanketed the city. But instead of packing it down into a cushioning layer to cover up the ice, we poured so many abrasives on it the snow dissolved into guck with the consistency of brown sugar and the treacherous glaciers beneath were re-exposed. We always seem to want to fight winter. Can't we try to work with it?
As for snow-clearing, why would crews be tackling René Lévesque Blvd., a crucial artery, during the morning rush hour? Why worsen traffic? Why?
Of course, Montreal is not alone in its misery. Much of North America is shivering under a glacial cold, with temperatures more frigid than Antarctica. Canada Goose parkas are being stolen at gunpoint in Chicago, General Motors has shut down production in Michigan to conserve power. Welcome to the age of climate change. It's not just global warming, but extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.
Good riddance, January! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
But will February be any better? Regardless of Fred's prediction, it looks like temperatures are going to rise to a seasonal -10 C over the weekend, with periods of snow forecast. By Monday night, however, it could all turn to rain. And back we will plunge into the nasty, messy, vicious cycle again.

Full text: I've never paid much heed to Groundhog Day. No, not the Bill Murray movie, but the Feb. 2 "holiday" itself, when a cute little rodent pokes his head out of a hole and looks for its shadow to predict whether spring is coming sooner or later.
This year, I can't wait for Fred to pop up in Val-d'Espoir out in Quebec's Gaspé region on Saturday. Because the arrival of February means January 2019 is finally, mercifully over.
We're one day closer to the end of winter, no matter what Fred sees. (And to be honest, I'm not particularly optimistic about his forecast).
We just battled through the longest, darkest, most soul-destroying January I can remember. And I say this as someone who likes winter, doesn't mind the odd cold snap and revels in snowstorms.
But the bone-chilling temperatures and the wild weather fluctuations of the last month nearly did me in.
The drastic swing from blizzard to polar vortex to freezing rain to rain to flash freeze within the space of mere hours has wreaked havoc on the human spirit and infrastructure alike.
Between the sting of wind chill and the constant fear of falling on the sidewalks, daily life has been downright dangerous. And I'm a reasonably healthy, fairly active, and fully mobile person. I can't even imagine how difficult things have been for the frail, the elderly or the homeless.
The cold claimed the life of Hélène Rowley Hotte, 93, the mother of former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe on Jan. 20. She somehow became locked outside her retirement villa in Montreal's east-end during a fire alarm and perished. An investigation into the tragedy is ongoing.
But the ice has led to casualties of its own, with record numbers of falls on slippery streets and sidewalks. Urgences Santé received an astounding 140 calls an hour, up from an average of 70 a day, after the deluge of rain melted the snowpack then rapidly froze into a solid mass with the consistency of concrete and the smoothness of a freshly flooded skating rink. The ambulance service took the step of imploring Montrealers not to go out, the conditions were so dire. Most of us would have been happy to comply, so strong was the urge to hibernate.
A week later, surfaces remain as slick and slippery as ever. The thick layer of ice seems impervious to all efforts to bring it under control. The disastrous weather has clearly complicated the city's snow-clearing efforts, making the task more challenging than usual.
But let's focus on Montreal's snow-clearing operations for a moment. Abysmal circumstances aside, they've been ... abysmal.
Citizens have been complaining. Mayor Valérie Plante sent a stern letter to the boroughs telling them to step up their game.
But it seems like it's the same story, year after year, no matter who's in charge or how extraordinary the weather might be.
How is it Montreal hasn't figured this out yet, after 377 years? We seem to have one response to making the sidewalks passable: salt the heck out them. But this week, that proved an exercise in futility. Mother Nature tried to give us a reprieve from the fury she unleashed a week earlier. A fresh coat of snow blanketed the city. But instead of packing it down into a cushioning layer to cover up the ice, we poured so many abrasives on it the snow dissolved into guck with the consistency of brown sugar and the treacherous glaciers beneath were re-exposed. We always seem to want to fight winter. Can't we try to work with it? As for snow-clearing, why would crews be tackling René Lévesque Blvd., a crucial artery, during the morning rush hour? Why worsen traffic? Why? Of course, Montreal is not alone in its misery. Much of North America is shivering under a glacial cold, with temperatures more frigid than Antarctica.
Canada Goose parkas are being stolen at gunpoint in Chicago, General Motors has shut down production in Michigan to conserve power. Welcome to the age of climate change. It's not just global warming, but extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.
Good riddance, January! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
But will February be any better? Regardless of Fred's prediction, it looks like temperatures are going to rise to a seasonal -10 C over the weekend, with periods of snow forecast. By Monday night, however, it could all turn to rain. And back we will plunge into the nasty, messy, vicious cycle again. ahanes@postmedia.com

Trouble ahead for the loonie, Canadian Tire stock goes on sale, and an investment opportunity with explosive growth: A roundup of investment ideas for active investors

Full text: The stunning rise in esports popularity reminds me of 2010s Facebook in the sense that, for the longest time, older generations and other non-users were aware that a growing segment of the populace was growing obsessed with it, but believed the trend was either irrelevant or a passing fad.
The growth in esports - essentially teams of video gamers playing against each other in front of a live and broadcast audience - has been undeniably explosive. CNBC reportedthat the finals of the League of Legends tournament held in South Korea in November attracted an audience of 100 million, only three million fewer than U.S viewers of the 2018 Super Bowl.
One of the teams in the League of Legends, Cloud9, is now valued at US$310-million by Forbes magazine after recently raising $50-million in financing. The nine teams across the world in the League of Nations have a combined worth of at least $100-million according to CNBC's report.
Even if the viewer numbers for the finals are inflated, the League of Legends is only one organization. The Overwatch League, owned by game producer Activision Blizzard, is also growing rapidly with a city-based team format. Robert Kraft, owner of the NFL's New England Patriots, recently paid $20-million to own the Boston franchise of the Overwatch League.
Despite having a similarly sized audience as NFL football, esports tournaments are not yet able to charge $5-million for 30 second advertisements like Super Bowl broadcasters can. But Mastercard Inc. recently signed a multi-year deal to become the global title sponsor of the League of Legends (the amount Mastercard paid was not disclosed).
Citi analysts recently cited studies indicating 143 million people watch esports at least once per month and another 192 million watched occasionally in 2017. The study estimates a 14-15 per cent compound annual growth rate in viewers for the foreseeable future. All told, revenue for esports is expected to grow at a 27.5 per cent annual pace to $1.4-billion by 2021.
Citi research included a list of companies set to benefit from the esports trend in their "Global Theme Book" for January which included NVIDIA Corp., Logitech International SA, Nintendo Co., Capcom Co. and Konami Holdings Corp. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak listed esports among the six trends driving profit growth for video game stocks. Mr. Nowak's top picks in the broader gaming sector are Take Two Interactive Software Inc. and Zynga Inc.
Domestically, there are few investing options, although Cineplex is attempting to grow its esports exposure after acquiring WorldGaming, an online gaming platform, in 2015

Stocks to ponder
Iamgold Corp.(IMG-T). Iamgold Corp. shares have soared as the investment community turns its gaze to the $2.2-billion gold producer as a possible takeover target. With operations in Canada, Africa and South America, Iamgold has been a long-time laggard among Canadian intermediate gold producers and recently released a disappointing production forecast for the year. But the Toronto-based miner's shares have risen strongly in the past week. Rachelle Younglai and Niall McGee report (for subscribers).
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.(SNC-T). Any investors pouncing on the beaten-up shares of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. in the hope that the Montreal-based engineering and construction company is going to be acquired at a nice premium should focus onwhat its stake in the 407 Express Toll Route might be worth. A rough estimate: It represents about $28.50 per share, according to analysts. That's 76 per cent of SNC's current share price, implying that the rest of SNC could be had for a song. David Berman takes a look at the stock (for subscribers).
The Rundown
This market isn't as cheap as it appears to be
Stocks are considerably cheaper than they were a few months ago, but not as cheap as many optimists would like to think. Investors should keep this in mind as they contemplate how much to bet on the market rebound continuing. The bullish case focuses on how inexpensive stocks appear in comparison with their expected earnings per share over the next year. For instance, Canadian stocks are near their cheapest levels in five years if you look at what analysts are expecting over the next few months. This is indubitably comforting. So is precedent on Wall Street. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, says it is highly unusual for the S&P 500 to fall two years in a row. Ian McGugan reports (for subscribers).
The lesson for investors as WSP Global surpasses SNC-Lavalin as Canada's top engineering firm
WSP Global Inc. has supplanted SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. as Canada's top engineering firm - at least for now - making one thing very clear to investors: Emphasizing exposure to developed markets is the right approach when some of the more far-flung areas of the world are causing real headaches for Canadian companies and their shareholders. The Montreal-based engineering firm generates about 90 per cent of its net revenues - or revenues after subtracting costs related to sub-consultants - through work on buildings and infrastructure in countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In other words, we're talking about jurisdictions such as Canada, the United States, Australia and Europe, where tyrants are confined to Twitter outbursts rather than corporate shenanigans. David Berman reports (for subscribers).
There are two ways dividend lovers can play Canadian Tire - and both are on sale right now
Here's what John Heinzl has bought at Canadian Tire or one of its sister chains such as Mark's or Sport Chek - in the past year: Five hockey sticks, one hockey helmet, multiple rolls of hockey tape, one set of windshield wiper blades, two parkas, one pair of binoculars, four furnace filters, one pair of swimming goggles, one inflatable air mattress, two fans and roughly six pairs of Nike or Adidas running shoes (my kids wear them out quickly). You'd think, based on these purchases alone, that Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd.'s shares would be soaring. Nope. The opposite. After posting a scorching five-year annualized total return of more than 19 per cent through the end of 2017, the stock lost 11 per cent last year. (All returns cited here include dividends.) It's been a similar trajectory for Canadian Tire's property arm, CT Real Estate Investment Trust. Even during banner year for REITs in 2018, when the sector was one of the market's few winners, CT REIT's total return was negative 16 per cent. So, has the Tire totally lost its tread? Is this the beginning of a long and nasty skid for the Canadian retailing icon? Hardly. If anything, the recent pullback may offer a good buying opportunity. John Heinzl explains his view (for subscribers).
Investors, beware: There may be some turbulence in store for the loonie
Street forecasts for credit markets paint a positive outlook for the loonie in 2019. But, in light of a recent series of weak domestic economic reports, investors may want to curb their expectations for the currency.Scott Barlow takes a look at the Canadian dollar's high sensitivity to relative yields - the government of Canada two-year bond yield minus the two-year U.S. Treasury yield. The oil price still matters in determining the loonie's value but over the past five years, correlation analysis indicates that yields have had a larger impact. Higher domestic bond yields relative to U.S. yields have served to support the Canadian dollar's value. (For subscribers).

Ask Globe Investor
Question: Where can I get reliable, detailed information on stock splits of TSX-listed companies since the 1980s? Some, such as the banks, have had several over the years.
Answer:Many third-party financial websites provide information on company stock splits, but the history is usually limited and you can't be certain whether the information is reliable. That's why I recommend that you go straight to the source and visit the investor relations section of the company's website.
All of the big banks provide their stock split history. Do a Google search for "Royal Bank investor relations," for example, and then look under "share information and stock splits." With some banks, you'll need to hunt around the website. Bank of Montreal, for instance, lists its stock splits history under "dividend information," but you have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to find it.
I checked a few other companies - Canadian Utilities Ltd., Fortis Inc. and Enbridge Inc. - and in all cases, information on stock splits was provided, along with the long-term dividend history.
I'm not sure why you're interested in stock splits, but you should remember that splits, in and of themselves, do not create shareholder value. When a company splits its stock two-for-one, investors have twice as many shares, but each share is worth half as much as before the split. So, all else being equal, investors are no further ahead.
The main purpose of stock splits is to increase trading liquidity and, in theory, make the shares more accessible to small investors who want to buy a "board lot" of 100 shares. But with today's trading systems, it's just as easy to buy 10 shares, 50 shares or 150 shares. That may be one reason that stock splits are not as common as they used to be. The last Big Five bank to split its stock was Toronto-Dominion Bank, in 2014, and before that, Royal Bank, in 2006.

Plante in 'panic mode'over poor snow-clearing, opposition says; Mayor tells boroughs to up their game as critics slam letter as PR exercise

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday she wrote to borough mayors to step up efforts on snow removal because service has not achieved the same standards in all parts of the city.
"It's not about targeting and saying this one is good, this one is bad," Plante told reporters, speaking of the letter she sent Tuesday to mayors of the city's 19 boroughs, calling on them to ensure that snow clearing operations achieve maximum results.
"That's what my call is about, asking the boroughs, 'Do everything you can,'and putting pressure on the borough mayors to say, 'You need to be sure that your people are on site, and adapting to the conditions'because in some cases it wasn't as successful as we wanted," she said.
Plante noted that while it's up to the city centre to decide when a snow-removal operation begins and ends, the boroughs are responsible for removing snow and spreading abrasives on streets and sidewalks.
It was the first admission by Plante that snow removal and de-icing have not been entirely satisfactory since Montreal was hit by a combination of blizzard conditions and sub-zero temperatures the weekend of Jan. 19-20, followed by rain last Thursday that froze, coating sidewalks with ice. The city halted snow removal and reassigned crews to spread abrasives on streets and sidewalks, deploying its fleet of eight icebreakers in central districts like the Plateau-Mont-Royal, Villeray and Rosemont.
On Monday, Plante defended the city's record on snow clearing and treating treacherous sidewalks, saying the cocktail of different weather in the past two weeks was not just an excuse, but "a reality."
But Opposition leader Lionel Perez said Plante was finally responding to criticisms he has been raising about treacherous conditions on city streets.
Perez tweeted Tuesday night that the letter is "a public relations exercise = panic" and that Plante sent it to the media at the same time as the mayors received it.
He noted that just a day earlier, Plante had reassured Montrealers that all was being done to make streets safe, but by Tuesday was acknowledging the need for improvement.
"Citizens are not fooled," he tweeted.
In the letter Tuesday, Plante cracked the whip on mayors by telling them to keep a close eye on snow removal and report any problems like equipment breakdowns to the central city immediately.
The next five days are a window of opportunity to improve the situation before the next major snowfall, she said. That could come Saturday, when Environment Canada is calling for snow, with a high of -8 C.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," she wrote.
"My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory," Plante wrote.
The city announced snow removal would resume on Tuesday evening. "The goal is to collect all the residual snow and complete de-icing operations on streets, sidewalks and bicycle paths, so that the network is completely cleared of all the remaining ice," it announced in a news release.
Opposition borough mayors denounced Plante's letter, accusing her of trying to dump the blame for poor snow removal on them.
"The mayor is clearly in panic mode after all the criticisms she's received in the past two weeks," St-Laurent Mayor Alan DeSousa said in a joint release by the opposition mayors.
"She wants to make it look as if she's doing something. But if she should blame anyone, it's her own administration," he said.
In 2015, the Denis Coderre administration harmonized snow-clearing procedures across the 19 boroughs with a goal to guarantee the same minimum level of snow clearance for residents in the 19 boroughs. mscott@postmedia.com

Time to move the car ... but to where? No-parking signs grace both sides of Dorion St., just south of Sherbrooke St., on Wednesday.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday she wrote to borough mayors to step up efforts on snow removal because service has not achieved the same standards in all parts of the city.
"It's not about targeting and saying this one is good, this one is bad," Plante told reporters, speaking of the letter she sent Tuesday to mayors of the city's 19 boroughs, calling on them to ensure that snow clearing operations achieve maximum results.
"That's what my call is about, asking the boroughs, 'Do everything you can,' and putting pressure on the borough mayors to say, 'You need to be sure that your people are on site, and adapting to the conditions,' because in some cases it wasn't as successful as we wanted," she said.
Plante noted that while it's up to the city centre to decide when a snow-removal operation begins and ends, the boroughs are responsible for removing snow and spreading abrasives on streets and sidewalks.
It was the first admission by Plante that snow removal and de-icing have not been entirely satisfactory since Montreal was hit by a combination of blizzard conditions and sub-zero temperatures the weekend of Jan. 19-20( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ), followed by rain last Thursday that froze, coating sidewalks with ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). The city halted snow removal and reassigned crews to spread abrasives on streets and sidewalks, deploying its fleet of eight icebreakers in central districts like the Plateau-Mont-Royal, Villeray and Rosemont.
On Monday, Plante defended the city's record on snow clearing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/next-snow-removal-will-start-as-soon-as-this-one-ends-plante ) and treating treacherous sidewalks, saying the cocktail of different weather in the past two weeks was not just an excuse, but "a reality."
But opposition leader Lionel Perez said Plante was finally responding to criticisms he has been raising about treacherous conditions on city streets.
Perez tweeted Tuesday night that the letter is "a public relations exercise = panic" and that Plante sent it to the media at the same time as the mayors received it.
He noted that just a day earlier, Plante had reassured Montrealers that all was being done to make streets safe, but by Tuesday was acknowledging the need for improvement.
"Citizens are not fooled," he tweeted.
In the letter Tuesday, Plante cracked the whip on mayors by telling them to keep a close eye on snow removal and report any problems like equipment breakdowns to the central city immediately.
The next five days( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-breezy-with-a-chance-of-flurries ) are a window of opportunity to improve the situation before the next major snowfall, she said. That could come Saturday, when Environment Canada is calling for snow, with a high of -8 C.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," she writes.
"My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory," Plante wrote.
The city announced snow removal would resume on Tuesday evening. "The goal is to collect all the residual snow and complete de-icing operations on streets, sidewalks and bicycle paths, so that the network is completely cleared of all the remaining ice," it announced in a news release.
Opposition borough mayors denounced Plante's letter, accusing her of trying to dump the blame for poor snow removal on them.
"The mayor is clearly in panic mode after all the criticisms she's received in the past two weeks," St-Laurent Mayor Alan DeSousa said in a joint release by the opposition mayors.
"She wants to make it look as if she's doing something. But if she should blame anyone, it's her own administration," he said.
In 2015, the Denis Coderre administration harmonized snow-clearing procedures across the 19 boroughs( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-unveils-its-new-snow-clearing-policy ) with a goal to guarantee the same minimum level of snow clearance for residents in the 19 boroughs.

Full text: A little more than a week after a blizzard dropped about 20 centimetres of snow on Montreal and region, Environment Canada on Monday issued a winter storm watch to a city that is already shivering from a minus-27 wind chill. The federal agency noted that in its warning "a Colorado low will track over the Great Lakes Tuesday and become a major storm Wednesday. Snowfall amounts could exceed 15 cm over these areas by Tuesday evening. In addition, visibility will be reduced to near zero in the blowing snow in the afternoon." The MétéoMédia weather network in Quebec is also forecasting an accumulation of snow on Tuesday that will vary from 15 to 20 cm, with the first flakes expected to fall early Tuesday morning.

Full text: Tap here for the most recent updates on the storm and its fallout. ( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-62aO )
Expect a wild weather ride over the next 24 hours.
On Wednesday, after about 10 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal, the temperature gradually rose and the snow turned to freezing rain in the evening.
It was expected to be followed by plain rain and even warmer weather, then yet more snow, according to Environment Canada's forecast.
The rain is to continue for much of Thursday when the high is forecast to reach 3 Celsius.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The mix of precipitation could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the city of Montreal's website indicated it has hauled away just over half of the snow that has fallen since Sunday whenabout 23 centimetres of snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) fell.
The freezing rain could force the city to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal," she told reporters. "But that's life and we have to deal with it."
She said "the city has to decide where to put the priority, and obviously if there is freezing rain, that means spreading salt and abrasives.
"So I can't tell you exactly what will happen. It's not a precise science. Snow removal and de-icing really depend on the weather and the ability of crews to act rapidly."
Wednesday's weather swing saw the temperature rise from minus-13 C at 8 a.m. to zero at 8 p.m.
More temperature fluctuations are expected in the coming days. Environment Canada is forecasting daytime highs of between minus-5 C and minus-15 C between Friday and Tuesday.
The recent temperature rollercoaster has caused problems for the $40-million light installation on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge. The system was not working for four days because of the dramatic temperature changes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lights-out-cold-snap-has-shut-down-jacques-cartier-bridge-light-show ).
After repairs, it was back in operation on Tuesday night.

Full text: Expect a wild weather ride over the next 24 hours.
According to an Environment Canada weather alert( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), snow will turn to freezing rain and then to plain rain, as the temperature rises to an unseasonably warm 3 Celsius. Then the snow will start again.
As of 5 p.m., with the temperature hovering around -7 C, snow was falling in Montreal.
But Environment Canada said it was expected to turn to freezing rain within a few hours.
Then, around midnight, with the temperature above freezing, rain was expected to start.
That rain is to continue for much of Thursday when the high is forecast to reach 3 C.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The weather could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the city said just under half of 23 centimetres of snow that fell on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) had been hauled away.
The freezing rain could force the city of Montreal to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal, she told journalists after giving a speech to entrepreneurs at Place Bonaventure.
"But that's life and we have to deal with it," Plante said.
She said "the city has to decide where to put the priority, and obviously if there is freezing rain, that means spreading salt and abrasives.
"So I can't tell you exactly what will happen. It's not a precise science. Snow removal and de-icing really depend on the weather and the ability of crews to act rapidly."

Full text: Expect a wild weather ride over the next 24 hours.
According to an Environment Canada weather alert( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), snow will turn to freezing rain and then to plain rain, as the temperature rises to an unseasonably warm 3 Celsius. Then the snow will start again.
As of 4 p.m., with the temperature hovering around -9 C, snow was falling in Montreal.
But Environment Canada said it was expected to turn to freezing rain by about 5 p.m.
Then, at about 11 p.m., with the temperature above freezing, rain is expected to start.
That rain is expected to continue for much of Thursday when the high is expected to reach 3 C.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The weather could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the city said just under half of 23 centimetres of snow that fell on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) had been hauled away.
The freezing rain could force the city of Montreal to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal, she told journalists after giving a speech to entrepreneurs at Place Bonaventure.
"But that's life and we have to deal with it," Plante said.
She said "the city has to decide where to put the priority, and obviously if there is freezing rain, that means spreading salt and abrasives.
"So I can't tell you exactly what will happen. It's not a precise science. Snow removal and de-icing really depend on the weather and the ability of crews to act rapidly."

Full text: Here's what happened while there was a slight warming( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61RB ).
The city of Montreal said it had hauled away about one-quarter of the snow that fell on the weekend as of late Tuesday afternoon( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-removal-some-montreal-boroughs-are-faster-than-others ). he snow-removal operation began Monday at 7 p.m. and is expected to take about one week. Some boroughs are more advanced than others. Verdun leads the pack, having removed 59 per cent of the snow on its territory. Tied for last place are Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which stood at 18 per cent. About 23 centimetres of snow fell on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ). Montreal says approximately 2,000 vehicles are being used in the snow-removal operation.
Indoor temperatures at the Montreal General Hospital over the weekend and into Monday during the city's cold snap( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/temperatures-drop-inside-montreal-general-hospital-during-cold-snap ). The problems, which were felt in the emergency room, came after burst pipes caused heating problems. Staff distributed electric blankets to patients and installed portable heaters in the ER as the indoor temperature dropped to as low as 15 degrees Celsius. Two patients were moved to another room because of flooding caused by the burst pipes. The lack of heating affected Pavilions A, B and C. The heating was restored by mid-afternoon Monday to nearly all areas except the 5th and 6th floors of Pavilion B, where air remained trapped in the pipes of the water-based radiators. Gilda Salomone, a spokesperson for the McGill University Health Centre, said heating on those floors should be restored by Wednesday.
An arrest warrant has been issued for a northern Illinois man who police say allowed an 11-year-old relative to drive herself to school in a stolen rental car while he rode along. The Lake County News-Sun reports( https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-lns-child-driving-warrant-st-0122-story.html ) that employees at a Round Lake Park elementary school saw the girl pull up to the school's drop-off point on Jan. 9. She and a 9-year-old girl who was in the back seat exited the car. Police say 31-year-old Khafilu Oshodi of Round Lake then moved into the driver's seat and drove away. He's wanted on two counts of child endangerment and driving with a suspended license. Police Chief George Filenko says the drop-off area is very busy and the incident could've "resulted in any number of tragic scenarios" if the child lost control.

Montreal weather: More snow, freezing rain - and rain - on the way

Full text: As the city of Montreal clears away the snow that fell on the weekend, more precipitation is on the way.
Environment Canada is forecasting about five fresh centimetres of snow for Wednesday, probably followed by freezing rain and then rain.
"It's still early to get into details, but there's a good probability that we're going to see freezing rain - it could be late Wednesday afternoon or early evening," said meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Rain is then expected between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Parent said.
"It's a couple of systems that are merging together," he said.
"The snow that we're going to get on Wednesday is an approaching system over the Great Lakes, but there's a development over the Eastern seaboard and it's bringing the rain and warmer temperatures."
Highs of zero and -2 C are forecast for Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
Colder weather will return by Thursday night, when the low is expected to be -11.
About 23 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ).
The city of Montreal began removing snow Monday. The operation is expected to take about a week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ).

Full text: Heading in to work on Monday, Montreal commuters learned two hard lessons very early in the day: stay away from hills and don't even think about finding a parking spot.
Sunday's snowstorm might have been the coldest storm Montreal has seen in a century, almost exactly, as YUL Weather Records reports that on Jan. 16, 1920, we had a dump of 30.2 centimetres with a daytime high of minus-19.4 Celsius. In this latest storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ), Montreal saw 20 centimetres of snow with a high at 5 p.m. of minus-16 C.
Coldest snowstorm in almost 100 years possible tomorrow. Temperatures are expected to stay below -15°C with up to 25cm of snow. The last time that happened in #Montreal( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Montreal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) was January 16th, 1920 when we received 30.2cm of snow with a daytime high of -19.4°C.
- YUL Weather Records (@YUL_Weather) January 19, 2019( https://twitter.com/YUL_Weather/status/1086726509400940545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Monday morning, the city deployed road and sidewalk plows on major thoroughfares in an effort to get ahead of the inevitable traffic jam that would welcome motorists and public transit users.
But the glacial temperatures that heralded Monday morning - minus 21 Celsius with wind chill of minus-34 C - rendered the use of salt useless and forced the city to resort to using gravel as an abrasive.
Worse, the frigid air created patches of black ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) that rendered some well-travelled hills in the city particularly challenging.
While provincial and local police reported scores of fender benders over the course of Sunday's storm, Montreal police recorded a more serious incident early Monday when a motorist apparently failed to stop at a red light at the corner of Larrey St. and the service road of Louis H. Lafontaine Blvd. in Anjou.
The car collided with a snow plow that was crossing the intersection around 1:15 a.m. The driver of the car was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries while the driver of the plow was unhurt.
People push a car out of a snow bank during the first big snowstorm of 2019 in Montreal, Jan. 20.
Meanwhile, it appeared early Monday that the city had made good on its promise to clear streets as quickly as possible, with many major thoroughfares downtown completely plowed but at the cost of snowbanks appearing where parking spots used to be( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), creating another reason to leave your car at home.
The snow removal operation is scheduled to being at 7 p.m. Monday and last for most of the coming week. However, that operation may be complicated by a weather forecast as unpredictable as the city's road surfaces. While temperatures will remain well below zero Monday and Tuesday, Metéomedia's forecast for this week says those temperatures will rise to minus 3-C on Wednesday and hit plus 2 C - with rain - on Thursday before plunging back to minus 7-C on Friday.
Extreme cold and winter storm warnings were active for most of the rest of southern Quebec and Ontario. Environment Canada advises people to "cover up: Frostbite can happen in minutes."

Full text: Heading in to work on Monday, Montreal commuters learned two hard lessons very early in the day: stay away from hills and don't even think about finding a parking spot.
In the wake of a bitterly cold winter storm on Sunday that dumped more than 20 centimetres of snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ) on the Montreal area, the city deployed road and sidewalk plows on major thoroughfares in an effort to get ahead of the inevitable traffic jam that would welcome motorists and public transit users. But the glacial temperatures that heralded Monday morning - minus 21 Celsius with wind chill of minus-34 C - rendered the use of salt useless and forced the city to resort to using gravel as an abrasive.
Worse, the frigid air created patches of black ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) that rendered some well-travelled hills in the city particularly challenging.
While provincial and local police reported scores of fender benders over the course of Sunday's storm, Montreal police recorded a more serious incident early Monday when a motorist apparently failed to stop at a red light at the corner of Larrey St. and the service road of Louis H. Lafontaine Blvd. in Anjou.
The car collided with a snow plow that was crossing the intersection around 1:15 a.m. The driver of the car was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries while the driver of the plow was unhurt.
People push a car out of a snow bank during the first big snowstorm of 2019 in Montreal, Jan. 20.
Meanwhile, it appeared early Monday that the city had made good on its promise to clear streets as quickly as possible, with many major thoroughfares downtown completely plowed but at the cost of snowbanks appearing where parking spots used to be( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), creating another reason to leave your car at home.
The snow removal operation is scheduled to being at 7 p.m. Monday and last for most of the coming week. However, that operation may be complicated by a weather forecast as unpredictable as the city's road surfaces. While temperatures will remain well below zero Monday and Tuesday, Metéomedia's forecast for this week says those temperatures will rise to minus 3-C on Wednesday and hit plus 2 C - with rain - on Thursday before plunging back to minus 7-C on Friday.
Extreme cold and winter storm warnings were active for most of the rest of southern Quebec and Ontario. Environment Canada advises people to "cover up: Frostbite can happen in minutes."

Jack Todd: Forecast is more snow and continued hockey playoff hysteria

Full text: Oh, my. A snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ) and a seven- or eight-team Eastern Conference playoff race. It doesn't get better than this - unless you're sitting under a palm tree sipping margaritas from a coconut.
I've seen playoff races. We've all seen playoff races. But I don't know I've seen so many teams crowded into such a tight space so late in the season.
Saturday morning, it looked like this, following the Tampa Bay Lightning, who are so far out in front they can spend the rest of the season giving players time off and tuning up for the playoffs. For the rest, the race is so tight you can hardly get a shiv in its ribs:
- New York Islanders: 60 points
- Toronto: 60 points
- Washington: 59 points
- Columbus: 59 points
- Boston: 59 points
- Montreal: 59 points
- Pittsburgh: 58 points
The Buffalo Sabres are still in it as well, with 54 points in 48 games, but they have faded to the fringe of the race and need a hot streak to get back in it. The rest - oy!
The Islanders led the Metropolitan Division and Toronto was a solid second in the Atlantic, so both had a leg up on the rest. (And, yes, the irony of the John Tavares move from one team to the other has not escaped us. Nor has the fact Barry Trotz is one helluva coach, a fact that seemed lost on Capitals management after their Stanley Cup win.)
Going into Saturday night's game at home against the bottom-feeding Philadelphia Flyers( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/offence-sputters-as-flyers- end -canadiens-four-game-winning-streak ), the Canadiens had a chance to vault into the top of the bunch. But the Flyers are a different team with Carter Hart in goal and the Habs wasted their chance( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/in-the-habs-room-our-legs-started-getting-heavy-as-lowly-flyers-soar ).
Philadelphia Flyers' James van Riemsdyk moves in on Canadiens goaltender Antti Niemi in Montreal on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2019.
Disaster? Not quite - all the other teams in that bunch who were playing Saturday also lost. The Bruins, Blue Jackets and Penguins all went down as well, Pittsburgh by a 7-3 score to the Vegas Golden Knights with Casey DeSmith in goal and the Penguins as sloppy as they can get.
On paper, you would think the Penguins, Capitals and Bruins, all perennial contenders, are the teams from this group that can't miss. But the Penguins have lost four of their last seven, DeSmith has struggled lately, Sidney Crosby isn't quite the force of nature he has been, and nothing is set in stone.
So Monday morning, the standings look as they had Saturday morning, give or take a few games in hand. Toronto, Washington, the Isles, Columbus and Pittsburgh have all played 48 games, Boston 49 and the Canadiens 50. (The Sabres, four points back of Pittsburgh, had also played 48 games.)
Since winning the Stanley Cup in October, the Leafs have been treading water, more so since the much-ballyhooed signing of holdout William Nylander. Toronto is still one of the favourites, but the Leafs still have the problems they had before the signings of Tavares and Nylander: a suspect defence and goaltending that is not bad but something less than all-universe.
The Leafs hosted the Arizona Coyotes on Sunday night - an excellent way to get healthy in a hurry- but lost 4-2. The Caps also lost - 8-5 to Chicago - and the Islanders won 3-1 against Anaheim.
Six teams in the East now have betweeen 58 and 60 points.
The surprise is the Canadiens are in it at all - not to mention the Isles, who weren't contenders with Tavares, but were leading the division without him.
Perhaps we shouldn't call this a playoff race at all. With Buffalo the only outsider within striking distance, it's quite probable all seven teams will make it. The question then isn't so much getting a ticket to the dance, it's jockeying for position and home-ice advantage - and the name of the game is Avoid the Lightning.
The Bolts somehow managed to lose to the Leafs at home last week, but that's deceptive. They're as loaded up front as Toronto and they're stronger on defence and in goal. With the Predators struggling a bit and the hockey universe not quite willing to believe in Calgary, Tampa Bay is the team to beat.
Right now, the Habs are a good bet to draw the short straw and get yet another matchup with the Lightning, the fourth since 2004, unless the Sabres get hot and ruin the party, which is entirely possible.
That's the thing about what is essentially a 30-game season. Anything can happen. Over 82 games, the cream tends to rise, but over any short stretch (October, say) you never know.
In ways apart from the game on the ice, the Maple Leafs are by far the more frightening opponent. With fans in Toronto expecting Mike Babcock's team to breeze to its second cup in six months, the atmosphere in Hogtown will be morbidly hysterical - and you can multiply that by 1,000 if the Canadiens are the first-round opponent.
Given fans in Montreal start hitting the hysteria button in mid-August, that's a matchup only a masochist would crave. A masochist - or a hockey fan. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference.

Going into Sunday's games, Toronto, Washington and the Isles had all played 47 games, Columbus and Pittsburgh 48, Boston 49 and the Canadiens 50. (The Sabres, four points back of Pittsburgh, had also played 48 games.)
Since winning the Stanley Cup in October, the Leafs have been treading water, more so since the much-ballyhooed signing of holdout William Nylander. Toronto is still one of the favourites but the Leafs still have the problems they had before the signings of Tavares and Nylander: a suspect defence and goaltending that is not bad but something less than all-universe.
The Leafs, however, were to host the Arizona Coyotes Sunday night, an excellent way to get healthy in a hurry. The Caps and Isles were also on the Sunday schedule, so everything is subject to change.
Or not. That's the beauty of a playoff race.
The surprise is that the Canadiens are in it at all - not to mention the Isles, who weren't contenders with Tavares but were leading the division without him.
Perhaps we shouldn't call this a playoff race at all. With Buffalo the only outsider within striking distance, it's quite probable that all seven teams will make it. The question then isn't so much getting a ticket to the dance, it's jockeying for position and home-ice advantage - and the name of the game is Avoid the Lightning.
The Bolts somehow managed to lose to the Leafs at home last week but that's deceptive. They're as loaded up front as Toronto and they're stronger on defence and in goal. With the Predators struggling a bit and the hockey universe not quite willing to believe in Calgary, Tampa Bay is the team to beat.
Right now, the Habs are a good bet to draw the short straw and get yet another matchup with the Lightning, the fourth since 2004, unless the Sabres get hot and ruin the party, which is entirely possible.
That's the thing about what is essentially a 30-game season. Anything can happen. Over 82 games, the cream tends to rise, but over any short stretch (October, say) you never know.
In ways apart from the game on the ice, the Maple Leafs are by far the more frightening opponent. With fans in Toronto expecting Mike Babcock's team to breeze to its second cup in six months, the atmosphere in Hogtown will be morbidly hysterical - and you can multiply that by 1,000 if the Canadiens are the first-round opponent.
Given that fans in Montreal start hitting the hysteria button in mid-August, that's a matchup that only a masochist would crave. A masochist - or a hockey fan. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference.

Full text: A winter storm involving an unusual - and unpleasant - combination of snow, cold temperatures, and high winds struck Montreal on Sunday morning.
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ) issued a winter storm warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#71737450348731252201901190504ww1070cwul ) for the city and its surrounding areas, which warned that 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected.
Along with the snowfall, Montreal is facing strong winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-do-yourself-a-favour-and-stay-in-bed-today ) of 40 km/h, gusting to 70, which are expected to result in "extensive blowing snow."
They'll also contribute to a forecasted wind chill of minus 35 degrees Celsius. Three provincial ministers have issued a joint statement to alert citizens( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/situation-urgence/Pages/Tempete-hivernale.aspx ) to the frostbite risk.
Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent says this combination of snow, cold and wind rarely happens in Quebec. He notes that temperatures usually go up when it snows.
On the island of Montreal, 25 power outages affected 4,496 households Sunday morning. The West Island was particularly hard hit, with broken equipment causing a major blackout affecting thousands of homes in Pointe Claire and Beaconsfield starting at 5:50 a.m. Power is being gradually restored throughout the morning.
The Société de Transport de Montréal has rerouted some buses away from steep hills because of slippery conditions. Buses will not run on Ridgewood Ave., Beaver Hall Hill and Victoria Ave. The bus routes affected are Nos. 11, 35, 36, 61, 75, 124, 168 and 711.
The Ministry of Transport is reminding Quebecers to be careful on the roads because abrasives are much less effective when it's so cold outside.
The Sûreté du Québec is calling on drivers to exercise caution and avoid driving if not necessary.
Until the weather improves, Environment Canada is counselling Montrealers to put off non-essential travel.

Full text: Oh, my. A snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ) and a seven- or eight-team Eastern Conference playoff race. It doesn't get better than this - unless you're sitting under a palm tree sipping margaritas from a coconut.
I've seen playoff races. We've all seen playoff races. But I don't know I've seen so many teams crowded into such a tight space so late in the season.
Saturday morning, it looked like this, following the Tampa Bay Lightning, who are so far out in front they can spend the rest of the season giving players time off and tuning up for the playoffs. For the rest, the race is so tight you can hardly get a shiv in its ribs:
- New York Islanders: 60 points
- Toronto: 60 points
- Washington: 59 points
- Columbus: 59 points
- Boston: 59 points
- Montreal: 59 points
- Pittsburgh: 58 points
The Buffalo Sabres are still in it as well, with 54 points in 48 games, but they have faded to the fringe of the race and need a hot streak to get back in it. The rest - oy!
The Islanders led the Metropolitan Division and Toronto was a solid second in the Atlantic, so both had a leg up on the rest. (And, yes, the irony of the John Tavares move from one team to the other has not escaped us. Nor has the fact Barry Trotz is one helluva coach, a fact that seemed lost on Capitals management after their Stanley Cup win.)
Going into Saturday night's game at home against the bottom-feeding Philadelphia Flyers( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/offence-sputters-as-flyers- end -canadiens-four-game-winning-streak ), the Canadiens had a chance to vault into the top of the bunch. But the Flyers are a different team with Carter Hart in goal and the Habs wasted their chance( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/in-the-habs-room-our-legs-started-getting-heavy-as-lowly-flyers-soar ).
Philadelphia Flyers' James van Riemsdyk moves in on Canadiens goaltender Antti Niemi in Montreal on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2019.
Disaster? Not quite - all the other teams in that bunch who were playing Saturday also lost. The Bruins, Blue Jackets and Penguins all went down as well, Pittsburgh by a 7-3 score to the Vegas Golden Knights with Casey DeSmith in goal and the Penguins as sloppy as they can get.
On paper, you would think the Penguins, Capitals and Bruins, all perennial contenders, are the teams from this group that can't miss. But the Penguins have lost four of their last seven, DeSmith has struggled lately, Sidney Crosby isn't quite the force of nature he has been and nothing is set in stone.
So on Sunday morning, the standings looked as they had Saturday morning, give or take a few games in hand. Going into Sunday's games, Toronto, Washington and the Isles had all played 47 games, Columbus and Pittsburgh 48, Boston 49 and the Canadiens 50. (The Sabres, four points back of Pittsburgh, had also played 48 games.)
Since winning the Stanley Cup in October, the Leafs have been treading water, more so since the much-ballyhooed signing of holdout William Nylander. Toronto is still one of the favourites, but the Leafs still have the problems they had before the signings of Tavares and Nylander: a suspect defence and goaltending that is not bad but something less than all-universe.

Full text: A vigorous cold front has moved over Montreal, Environment Canada says, and with that could come snow squalls.
Weather changes quickly in these conditions, the federal meteorological agency says, "from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres." The watch also covers Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil.
The late-morning temperature of 1 C over Montreal Island was expected to dive to minus-22 C with a windchill of minus-32 C overnight.
Meanwhile in the Ottawa region, according to the Twitter feed of YOW_Weather, "an intense cold front could bring some thundersnow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/frostquakes-and-thundersnow-absurd-winter-weather-beyond-the-polar-vortex ) to the Ottawa region around noon, just before the temperature drops dramatically. The last time the airport reported thundersnow was Feb. 12, 1997."
A winter storm that will dump at least 30 centimetres of snow is expected to break over Quebec beginning Saturday, and the wallop is expected to be particularly brutal along the St. Lawrence Valley.
In its weather forecast posted Tuesday night, the MétéoMédia weather network predicts 40 cm of snow will fall on Montreal and Quebec City by Sunday, while nearly 50 cm will accumulate farther east.
MétéoMédia warns also that the snowfall could be accompanied by high winds that would create blizzard conditions. And temperatures are expected to remain frigid, staying well below -10 C.
The closest the forecast gets to a silver lining is the prediction that, should the storm front sweep through the province a little farther to the south, the minimum accumulation of snow would be 20 cm rather than 30.
Environment Canada, meanwhile, is forecasting snow for the region late Saturday and on Sunday with a predicted high of -13 C.

Allison Hanes: Kids, cars and cold - the three go together in winter

Full text: No matter how much we may want to, giving up our cars is easier said than done in Montreal - especially for families with children.
And perhaps no time of year underscores the dearth of better alternatives more than the dark depths of January.
Getting around with kids in winter is a slog. We wake before sunrise and return home after sundown. When the sun does shine, the temperature usually plunges. Taking children outside requires bundling them up until they resemble the Michelin Man. But taking them inside again means either sweating it out or stripping them down - and then carrying around armloads of parkas, pants, hats and mitts.
You can imagine the fun, then, of taking a toddler in a snowsuit on public transit. Even if you've got a stroller in which to stow all the extra layers, there's no guarantee you'll be able to get it up and down the stairs to the métro, since so few stations have elevators. It also may be tough to squeeze it aboard a crowded bus.
Car shares? A few have child seats in the trunk, but is it a bucket seat or a booster? Is it rear-facing or front-facing? What's required by law changes according to the age of your child. If you bring your own, you have to tote it with you, plus add time for installation to your outing. The same goes for taxis.
More and more families are choosing cycling as an option when there's no snow on the ground. Some pedal along with multiple kids loaded on rear carriers, the active transport version of the station wagon, while wheelbarrow-like bakfiets( https://www.bakfiets.com/ ), ubiquitous in Amsterdam, are increasingly appearing on Montreal streets. But winter cycling is for the hardy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-cycling-in-montreal-is-an-exercise-in-snowy-frustration ) as it is. The iffy status of snow-clearing on bike paths makes biking with kids in winter for the truly intrepid.
That leaves walking. Rain or shine, heat wave or blizzard, that's my preferred method of getting to and from work/school/daycare. Dress for the elements, swap the stroller for the sled if there's snow accumulation, and it's quite manageable if you're lucky enough to live within striking distance. It might even be faster than the bus if you factor in time lost waiting and potential delays. But sidewalks that are icier than many skating rinks( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-montrealers-are-slip-slidin-away-on-icy-sidewalks ) can make being a pedestrian with kids perilous indeed. You certainly have to tread more carefully if you have an infant strapped to you in a carrier, or if you have a small hand to hold.
And all bets are off once the weekend rolls around. A packed itinerary of children's activities in disparate and far-flung locations across the city makes a car trip unavoidable in the face of the reduced Sunday transit schedule.
Is it any wonder, then, that Quebecers are buying more cars, driving bigger vehicles and logging more kilometres on the road?
That was one big takeaway from the latest inventory of the province's greenhouse gas emissions,( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-the-war-on-the-car-is-the-war-on-climate-change-in-quebec ) published in December. It certainly explains why Quebec is behind in reaching its reduction targets and underscores the urgency of action to curb our dependence on vehicles. The role of urban sprawl aside, these statistics also expose some inescapable sociological truths about the harried pace of modern life.
Even in Montreal, where it's arguably easiest to forgo the family vehicle, going car-free is not without obstacles.
Oh, sure, it's certainly possible. Le Devoir published a feature on Monday( https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/transports-urbanisme/545431/quand-les-familles-moderent-leur-transport ) talking to Montreal families who ditched their personal automobiles. However, those profiled all noted that it took careful planning and concerted effort to stick to their decision. We should all applaud their determination - and listen carefully to their experiences.
Since transportation is a significant and rising source of emissions in Quebec, tackling traffic is primordial. And if we want to keep families in the city and stop the exodus to the 'burbs, making it easier to navigate Montreal year-round is equally essential.
Many couples who don't have vehicles get one when baby makes three, for dashing to the doctor with a sick infant or to make the most of those narrow windows between naps. Of course, cars have their downsides in winter, too, since children in car seats cannot be safely buckled in wearing their snowsuits. Repeatedly dressing and undressing a kid to get to and from the car, then into and out of the child seat, is a chore in itself - and one that becomes especially onerous on frigid days.
But for far too many, it's still the least worst option.

Full text: Kingdom of the Blind
BY LOUISE PENNY MINOTAUR, 386 PAGES
There is a point where I've run out of superlatives, and this is it. Louise Penny is the best mystery novelist in Canada. If you doubt that, just sit down and read Kingdom of the Blind, her fourteenth Chief Superintendent Armand Gamache novel, and be swept into the perfect village in the grip of the perfect storm. Here, the drama is in the atmosphere and the descriptions.
Penny always opens her novels with a bang and this one is a beaut. Under glowering clouds and the promise of snow, Gamache is summoned to a ramshackle farmhouse that belonged to Bertha Baumgartner, a deceased woman who claimed to be a baroness but who worked as a domestic. His invitation is from a dead lawyer. Eventually, another invitee arrives, Myrna, who runs the Three Pines bookstore. Why are they here? Gamache surveys the abandoned house and recalls the children's nursery rhyme about the crooked man who walked a crooked mile, found a sixpence, brought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse, "and they all lived together in a little crooked house." What mystery is here?
The crooked house and its eventual collapse is the main mystery, but fans know to expect several lines of suspense in a Gamache book. The action leads back, first, to the idyllic village of Three Pines. A particularly harsh Quebec winter is building to a blizzard. As the temperature drops to -35, and the drifts build, the villagers gather at the local inn for comfort and companionship. They know that the beauty of the countryside in snow is also a killer. This contrast of beauty and death is always the soul of Penny's books. But the recurring characters, particularly Ruth Zardo, the cranky poet and her foulmouthed fowl friend the duck, never lose their ability to charm and also add to the plot. As well, they enable Penny to keep her delightful Three Pines fresh, book after book.
Along with the baroness's crooked house, which collapses and kills a man, Gamache has more on his plate. Regular readers will remember that in his previous outing, he managed to breakup a large international drug cartel; however, a shipment of drugs used as a diversion disappeared and Gamache was blamed. Many of the drugs have been rounded up, but he's still on suspension from the Sûreté du Québec, so that investigation continues as well.
Plot lines converge when Gamache makes a trip to Montreal.
If Three Pines is exquisite, clean beauty, the city is a squalid place of excrement, puke and crime.
Gamache is confronted by open prostitution in the daylight and a failure of law enforcement. Does he even want to return to this world? Another conflict between beauty and duty.
The fallen world and the pure light of reason are Louise Penny's place in mystery fiction. Her plots are complex and modern. Her characters, whether whimsical or desperate, have depth. They have actual heft in the story. And, of course, she's a master of Canada in print. Yes, we are nice and we have charm and we band together in the harshness of our climate, but there is a true passion here and that's what really sets Penny apart and makes her the best. Fourteen books in a series is all too often the beginning of a slide for authors who tire of the place, the people or the plot lines. Penny appears to have only begun to write.

Full text: It seemed like the bright yellow markers from my snow removal contractor had only just appeared at the end of my driveway when the white stuff began to fall. At the first growl of the tractor engine my daughters ran to the window to watch our plow driver Hoover up the snow and blow it off to the side.
"When I grow up, I want to do that," my nine-year-old sighed.
I was a little surprised. But as she explained why, I began to understand. The plow driver helps people for a living, she said. The work is important and meaningful. Also, driving a tractor looked like fun.
One of the great privileges of sharing your life with little people is the way they can help us see the world with fresh eyes.
With snow in the forecast for most of the next two weeks, I wanted to take a moment to show a little gratitude to the women and men who will be out working through flurries and fierce blizzards so life doesn't have to stop when it storms.
It's hard and often thankless work, with long and uncertain hours. And it's the kind of service that is easy to take for granted when it's done well. Most of us only think about the plows when the drifts deepen and we start to wonder why our roads and driveways aren't clear yet.
Well, I suppose we can't all be the first to have our driveway plowed. I am grateful I get to pad around the house in fuzzy slippers instead of stomping outside to go shovel the driveway every day before leaving on errands.
I count myself lucky to have inherited a reliable and responsive snow removal contractor. When we bought our home, we just carried on using the same service the sellers had used. It's harder when you're unhappy with the service you have, or if you're moving into a home where the previous owner preferred a DIY approach.
If you're in the market for snow removal, there's no way around it: you need to talk to your neighbours. Unlike other services, snow removal contractors tend to work in very specific areas. Likely your only options are the companies that have staked out territory on your block, so screw up your courage to knock on some doors. Likely your neighbours will be happy to either rant or rave about the service and pricing they get from their contractor.
When it comes down to it, the quality of your town and home's snow removal service has a lot to do with how happily you can make it through Montreal's long winters. When the weather outside is frightful, the plow drivers'hard work lets us enjoy the seasonal pleasures that make winter delightful.

Blizzard warning fizzles, drizzle now in forecast for Montreal

Full text: Environment Canada warned on Monday that by the time it was over on Wednesday there could be 25 centimetres of snow on the ground( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/beware-says-environment-canada-snowfall-could-be-fast-and-flurrious ).
But by Tuesday morning the light, wet snowflakes that had begun to fall hours earlier were gone, the temperature was slightly above freezing, and by the time it's all over on Wednesday, the forecast now says we'll see a mix of snow and rain.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada's snowfall warning, issued Monday for the Montreal area, had disappeared as quickly as the remnants of Tuesday's snow flurries.
However, the rest of Quebec remains braced for more serious accumulations over the course of Tuesday.
A total of 10-15 centimetres are expected to fall on Sherbrooke by Wednesday while about 12 centimetres are expected in the Trois-Rivières area.
The Quebec City region meanwhile is expecting between 15-20 centimetres as well as whiteouts caused by wind gusts of up to 90 kilometres and hour. But the winter wallop( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ) seems poised to hit hardest in the Charlevoix region, where 20 to 30 centimetres of snow are expected Tuesday afternoon. The region is expected to receive a further 15 to 25 centimetres Tuesday night and another 10 to 15 centimetres on Wednesday.

Full text: The Montreal area's first serious taste of winter began at a little after midnight( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/it-starts-at-midnight-snowfall-warning-issued-for-montreal-area ) and by 7 a.m. had added close to seven centimetres of frustration to the morning rush hour.
While traffic on main thoroughfares in the city was moving somewhat slower than usual, slippery road conditions led the Montreal police department to warn motorists to adapt their driving habits( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) to the realities of winter and Société de transports de Montréal managed commuters' expectations by acknowledging that delays in bus service could be expected.
Snow removal crews were clearing main streets as a priority, although by 7:30 a.m. many sidewalks had yet to be plowed, including those in the downtown core.
By noon, Montreal police were reporting that while several traffic accidents appeared to be linked to weather conditions, none were serious and no injuries were reported.
However provincial police, while recording essentially the same situation on provincial highways, had to deal with a more spectacular incident Friday morning after a school bus carrying 30 elementary school children apparently lost control and flipped onto its side while negotiating a ramp leading off of northbound Highway 15 in St. Jérôme. While two children were taken to hospital as a precaution, there were released soon after.
The rest of the passengers were picked up by a second school bus and continued to their destination.
While police suspect weather and road conditions may have been factors in the incident, they intend to question the driver about the circumstances leading up to loss of control.
On Thursday night, the city of Montreal announced that it had 1,000 pieces of snow removal equipment ready to deal with the up to 15 centimetres of snow expected Friday. Officials noted that on average no more than 18 centimetres of snow falls during the month of November and urged Montrealers to use public transit Friday.

Full text: Shovelling, driving, power-failure survival guide
Shovelling can be bad for your back - and your heart.
Shovelling
Shovellers have more to fear than ill-timed city snow plows undoing hours of work.
The combination of physical exertion and cold weather can increase the risk of a heart attack, especially in inactive people and those with heart disease.
"Scooping heavy, wet snow raises your heart rate quickly," the Heart and Stroke Foundation warns. "Add in cold temperatures that raise blood pressure and increase the likelihood of developing blood clots, and it can be deadly."
If you load your shovel with five kilograms of snow every five seconds, you'll have moved almost 1,000 kg of snow after 15 minutes. That's hard on the heart and the back.
Here are some shovelling tips( https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/snow_shovelling.html ) from the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety:
. Pace yourself( http://blog.heartandstroke.ca/2016/01/shovel-smart-this-winter/ ). Take frequent breaks and drink warm, non-alcoholic beverages.
. Push snow rather than lift it.
. If you must throw snow, only pick up as much snow as you can easily lift. Then, rather than twist at the waist, turn your feet toward the direction at which you're aiming.
. Avoid overheating; wear thin, breathable layers.
. Don't shovel on a full stomach. Digest your meals first; otherwise, shovelling could put an extra strain on your heart.
. Stop shovelling if you experience sudden shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, light-headedness, nausea, dizziness, or severe headache and immediately seek medical attention.
Shovels should:
. Be light (about 1.5 kilograms or 3 pounds), and sturdy.
. Feature a handle that reaches the users's chest to reduce forward bending.
. Include a shaft with a bend.
. Have the right blade for the job at hand. A large push-style shovel will let you move more snow but may lead you to lift heavy loads. Smaller blades are best for lifting and throwing snow.
Slowing down on snow and ice will give your tires more time to grip the road.
Driving
Before you drive in wintry weather, consider these tips from CAA-Québec and Transport Canada:
. Remove all snow( https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/safevehicles-safetyfeatures-winterdriving-index-693.htm ) from your vehicle's hood, roof, windows and lights. Clear windows of frost and fog.
. Get a tune-up( https://www.caaquebec.com/en/storage/graffiti-some-tips-for-prevention-and-cleaning/winter-driving-tips/ ), including an inspection of electrical components, as well as air-intake, fuel, exhaust, ignition, cooling system and windshield wipers.
. Slow down on snow and ice. Your tires will have more time to grip the road. Give yourself extra travel time in bad weather.
. Avoid using cruise control on slippery roads.
. Always turn the steering wheel slowly to retain control.
. Front-wheel skids are often caused by excessive speed on a turn or the wheels locking up. If you find yourself in a front-wheel skid, gently ease up on the accelerator or brake pedal and steer in the direction of the turn while looking in the direction you want to go.
. For rear-wheel skids, turn the front wheels in the direction in which the back end has started swinging, while looking in the direction you want to go.
. Be alert for deceptive conditions. Invisible black ice can form when the temperature hovers around zero, especially on bridges, overpasses and underpasses. In rural areas, road conditions can change quickly from dry to snowy or ice-covered.
. Leave more space than normal between your car and the one ahead of you to give yourself time to respond if an emergency arises.
. Prepare an emergency kit for your trunk. It should include a shovel, a snow brush, a scraper, traction aids, booster cables, windshield-washer fluid, a reflective vest, a battery-free flashlight, basic tools, a first-aid kit, a warm blanket and some non-perishable snacks.
Hydro-Québec says storms, snow, freezing rain and winds are some of the main causes of power failures.
Home emergency kit
Authorities suggest you prepare a home kit with basic supplies( https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/yprprdnssgd/index-en.aspx ) that can help you take care of yourself and your family for 72 hours in case of an emergency such as an extended power failure.
Heavy snow and freezing rain can take down power lines, though Hydro-Québec says power outages are actually more common in the summer.
What should your emergency kit include?
Here are some basic( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/be-prepared-for-power-outage/index.html#conseils ) supplies suggested( http://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/family-safety-plan/emergency-kit.html ) by Public Safety Canada, Hydro-Québec and Quebec's public-security department.
. Water (at least two litres of water per person per day).
. Food that won't spoil, such as canned food, energy bars and dried foods.
. Manual can-opener.
. Crank or battery-powered flashlight (and extra batteries). Replace batteries regularly.
. Warm blankets.
. Battery-powered radio (and extra batteries) to monitor the situation.
. First aid kit (bandages, gauze sterile pads, scissors, tweezers, safety pins, antiseptic, pain medication).
. Other items such as prescription medication, infant formula and equipment for people with disabilities.

First snow
The first snowfall (2 cm on the ground) typically happened by Nov. 29 in the years between 1871 and 1910. Between 1971 and 2010, the first snow on the ground was normally recorded on Dec. 12. This year it happened on Nov. 21.

Rogers Cup: Abanda last Canadian to fall; rain wreaks havoc on schedule

Author: Hickey, Pat

Full text: The last vestige of Canadian content in the Rogers Cup women's tennis championships disappeared Wednesday when third-seeded Sloane Stephens of the U.S. defeated Montrealer Françoise Abanda 6-0, 6-2 in second-round action.
Stephens, who was making her hardcourt debut this season after a shocking loss to Donna Vekic at Wimbledon last month, wasn't at her best. But the American needed only 80 minutes to get the win, which included an eight-minute washroom break for Abanda between sets and a brief delay dealing with a light drizzle.
Abanda said afterward she had the wrong strategy for the match.
"If I had to play it again, I would try to impose my game from the start," Abanda said. "I was too defensive. I really let her push me too much. But I think with more experience I would do differently. I didn't have enough experience."
"It was the first time (I've played a top-five player), but she plays against the top-10 players every week. I don't," Abanda said. "I'm not in the same position. It was a good match for me to have more experience. Next time I will know how to manage the match better."
"It was a good match for me to have more experience," Montreal's Françoise Abanda, 20, said of her loss to American Sloane Stephens a the Rogers Cup on Wednesday.
Stephens was overly kind in her appraisal of Abanda.
"I think she's a great player," Stephens said. "Honestly, she's young. Obviously she needs more experience, playing more at this level. But I think that just comes with time. It happens to all of us, so it's not anything to be too worried about. She'll continue to get better as long as she listens to her coaches, does everything that everyone is supposed to do: work hard, have fun. I think she's on the right track."
Stephens said she was glad the rain held off, but said there was another problem to overcome.
"I think what was kind of weird about it, there are, like, piles of bugs on the court after (the rain)," said Stephens. "That was really disgusting. But they're, like, gnats. Did you see? It was so weird. It rained, then they came out of nowhere. It was like a blizzard of bugs. That was probably the most disgusting thing I've ever encountered. That was harder than, like, the actual drops of rain. I felt that everything that was, like, dropping on me was a bug. Yeah, not fun."
The rain did fall in the evening, halting play and creating a logistical nightmare for organizers.
Thursday is always the busiest day of the tournament with 16 players battling for the eight quarterfinal spots. Four of those 16 spots are still empty and that means top-seed Simona Halep, Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka are among those who might be forced to play two matches in one day.
If you wanted to see Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber, you had to arrive early Wednesday and not blink.
Alizé Cornet of France defeated the fourth seed from Germany 6-4, 6-1 and the result shouldn't have been a surprise if you looked at the players' schedules. Kerber was playing her first match since winning on the grass at Wimbledon, while Cornet has been busy. She won the Swiss Open on clay - defeating Eugenie Bouchard in the semifinals - and also played in Moscow. And while Kerber had a bye in the first round, Cornet had a match to become accustomed to the courts.
"I think it's my first top-five win of the season (and) what a top five," Cornet said. "She just won Wimbledon. She has had an amazing season so far. I'm really glad and really proud that I could win today. It also shows me that I can play good on every surface. Clay is my favourite one because I grew up on this surface, but I can be also very efficient on hard court.
"It gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the U.S. swing, because it's a long one," Cornet added. "You have to be on top for four weeks. It starts pretty well for me, so I'm happy."
Maria Sharapova hasn't played since losing in the first round at Wimbledon, but she appears to be in top form. She needed only 76 minutes to beat the 12th seed, fellow Russian Daria Kasatkina. Sharapova has lost only five games in two matches.
Things should get a little tougher for the former No. 1 Thursday. Next up for Sharapova is sixth-seeded Caroline Garcia of France. Sharapova enjoys a 4-2 lifetime edge over Garcia, but the Frenchwoman won their most recent match this year on the clay at Stuttgart.
Ninth-seeded Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic lost to Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-2. This was only a minor upset because Bertens is No.18 in the rankings.
Bertens was joined in the round of 16 by countrywoman Elise Mertens, the 14th seed. Mertens had a letdown in the middle of her match, but finished strong to beat Shuai Zhang of China 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-0.
Ashleigh Barty of Australia, the 15(th) seed, defeated Alison van Uytvanck of Belgium 7-6 (7), 6-2.

Full text: Montrealers spend much of the year longing for the dog days of summer to keep us going through the deep freeze of winter.
So when the city sizzles through an oppressive hot spell, many of us just shut up and sweat it out, since summer is as fleeting as it is occasionally unbearable.
But last week's punishing heat wave, when the mercury soared about 30 degrees Celsius and stayed stuck there for seven days, was a wake-up call for citizens of this winter city.
For starters, it was a tragedy, blamed for claiming more than 70 lives across Quebec, 34 of them in Montreal. From what we know, most of the dead were the elderly, sick and vulnerable, who didn't have air conditioning and often expired in excruciating fashion and alone, some found only days later because of the smell emanating from their sweltering homes.
It was a stark reminder that summer isn't all fun and games. It has a dark side we don't often see when we experience it elsewhere as gleeful tourists, or during the relatively few days a year the sun typically beats down on Montreal. We've had hints of this before, namely the sultry summer of 2010, when more than 100 died. But last week's smothering heat was an urgent warning, a harbinger of a hotter future for which Montreal is ill-prepared.
According to data recently published by the Prairie Climate Centre at the University of Winnipeg, Montreal - along with much of the rest of the country - must brace for more prolonged hot spells, the likes of which we endured last week. The Climate Atlas of Canada allows the public to take stock of the potential impact of human-caused climate change in their own backyards.
The data on Montreal shows that the average annual number of very hot days (when the temperature rose to 30 C or greater) was a manageable eight between 1976 and 2005.
But an analysis projects that the total could jump to a mean of 24 each year between 2021-50 and 50 per year from 2051-80 if carbon emissions continue at their current rate.
The same scientific analysis suggests the number of 30 C and hotter days would be reduced slightly in a low-carbon scenario, if emissions are kept in check.
But either way, Montreal ought to be bracing for such heat waves to become longer, more intense and more common.
This comes as heat records worldwide are being shattered this year.
And yet, Montreal is woefully ill-equipped to handle the havoc summer could throw our way. Some hospital wings and longterm care homes don't have air conditioning, as patients recovering from surgery at Notre-Dame Hospital found out the hard way. Some brought their own fans or had to cover themselves with wet towels.
A few hot days last September underscored the fact that very few schools have air conditioning. This may be unsurprising in central Montreal, where many school buildings are old, crumbling and in need of renovation. But not all new schools are constructed with AC, either - which is short-sighted, in light of what we know about the local effects of global warming.
Cities around the world are taking stock of and planning for the fallout from climate change, from higher sea levels to wild weather. Part of this is preparing for and working to avoid disasters, like the flooding we saw in parts of the Montreal region last spring, or the wildfires that scorched Fort McMurray in 2016.
The other part of it is developing policies, protocols and regulations to make cities more resilient, so they can withstand various climate-related phenomenon to begin with. From zoning that protects natural assets like wetlands, investments in green space, and updated building codes that take into account the future needs of residents, such critical measures are required to mitigate what lies in store.
The city of Montreal adopted its first five-year climate adaptation strategy in 2015 to tackle many of these issues head on. But when it comes to the resources and the basic means for dealing with heat, we're starting from way behind. Sending firefighters door to door and imploring the public to check on their neighbours is a crisis response. That's not going to cut it long-term, when broiling summers become the norm.
In Montreal we know winter.
We know wind chill and flurries, ice storms and blizzards. We know snow plowing, salting and de-icing. In other words, we have the experience, the know-how, infrastructure and the accompanying budgets to handle almost anything winter throws at us.
But as last week's events clearly demonstrate, we now must treat summer with the same seriousness. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: "You might think I'm lying ..."
Sam Smith( http://samsmithworld.com/ ) has a showman's smile, but it's an honest smile. So when the English pop/soul powerhouse told his Bell Centre audience Tuesday that his 2015 performance at the venue( http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/words-and-music/concert-review-sam-smith-stays-true-to-himself ) was "the best show I've ever done in my life," you were inclined to believe him even before his pre-emptive protest. This is someone who can exclaim "this room is f-ing huge" with believable wonderment even when his itinerary is packed with f-ing huge rooms. Because it's just not possible to fake the enthusiasm Smith brought to every song, monologue and arena-sweeping wave in his crowd-pleasing return engagement.
Crowd-pleasing, but not pandering. This was as classy and subtle as arena pop blowouts get, with Smith's whisper-to-falsetto swoop and conversational cheer the central attractions. His crack band was tightly rehearsed but let the arrangements breathe, in contrast to a sometimes overbearingly slick presentation at that 2015 show. And big-budget set pieces were mostly limited to the artful triangular stage and a geometric backdrop that separated and blossomed. Even when confetti fell for the climactic and characteristically controlled Stay With Me, it was more of a dusting than a blizzard.
Smith's arrival itself was quiet, the star appearing seated without fanfare in near silhouette as cathedral choristers gave gravitas to Burning. He quickly shook off the heartache, his face lighting up for One Last Song's street-corner soul and the buoyant I'm Not the Only One. The latter's striking a cappella intro was equalled by an uncommonly delicate piano-and-voice ramp-up to Lay Me Down; both numbers sparked joyous sing-alongs that elevated the performances without drowning them out.
Smith's warmth ensured that he sang to everyone at all times, even though the innovative stage design meant he had his back to a good chunk of the audience at any given point. His interactions with the backup singers and musicians managed to look both choreographed and spontaneous; when he talked about all the work and the joy that went into the show, you believed him.
Pigeonholed as a wounded romantic, Smith offered more variety than he gets credit for. The backdrop turned neon to match Omen's clubland pulse, before Nirvana's gospel uplift and the unapologetically bombastic 007 theme Writing's on the Wall. Latch was stripped and slowed down; Money on My Mind escalated from a gentle guitar backing to dance-floor release. (It says something about the eclectic arrangements that country-pop singer Cam's engaging support set didn't seem incongruous.) One of the few constants was Smith's steadfast smile.
The "love is love" anthem Him was a resonant showstopper, the black-and-white screens smashing to colour as Smith waved a rainbow flag to what may have been the loudest cheer of the night, at least until Too Good at Goodbyes closed the main set with the crowd picking up the vulnerable heaven-bound chorus.
"You've done it - this is better than last time," Smith proclaimed before he exited the way he entered. And once again, you believed him.

Full text: "You might think I'm lying ..."
Sam Smith( http://samsmithworld.com/ ) has a showman's smile, but it's an honest smile. So when the English pop/soul powerhouse told his Bell Centre audience Tuesday that his 2015 performance at the venue( http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/words-and-music/concert-review-sam-smith-stays-true-to-himself ) was "the best show I've ever done in my life," you were inclined to believe him even before his pre-emptive protest. This is someone who can exclaim "this room is f-ing huge" with believable wonderment even when his itinerary is packed with f-ing huge rooms. Because it's just not possible to fake the enthusiasm Smith brought to every song, monologue and arena-sweeping wave in his crowd-pleasing return engagement.
Crowd-pleasing, but not pandering. This was as classy and subtle as arena pop blowouts get, with Smith's whisper-to-falsetto swoop and conversational cheer the central attractions. His crack band was tightly rehearsed but let the arrangements breathe, in contrast to a sometimes overbearingly slick presentation at that 2015 show. And big-budget set pieces were mostly limited to the artful triangular stage and a geometric backdrop that separated and blossomed. Even when confetti fell for the climactic and characteristically controlled Stay With Me, it was more of a dusting than a blizzard.
Smith's arrival itself was quiet, the star appearing seated without fanfare in near silhouette as cathedral choristers gave gravitas to Burning. He quickly shook off the heartache, his face lighting up for One Last Song's street-corner soul and the buoyant I'm Not the Only One. The latter's striking a cappella intro was equalled by an uncommonly delicate piano-and-voice ramp-up to Lay Me Down; both numbers sparked joyous sing-alongs that elevated the performances without drowning them out.
Smith's warmth ensured that he sang to everyone at all times, even though the innovative stage design meant he had his back to a good chunk of the audience at any given point. His interactions with the backup singers and musicians managed to look both choreographed and spontaneous; when he talked about all the work that went into the show, you believed him, but he didn't mention all the evident joy that went along with it. He didn't have to.
Pigeonholed as a wounded romantic, Smith offered more variety than he gets credit for. The backdrop turned neon to match Omen's clubland pulse, before Nirvana's gospel uplift and the unapologetically bombastic 007 theme Writing's on the Wall. Latch was stripped and slowed down; Money on My Mind escalated from a gentle guitar backing to dance-floor release. (It says something about the eclectic arrangements that country-pop singer Cam's engaging support set didn't seem incongruous.) One of the few constants was Smith's steadfast smile.
The "love is love" anthem Him was a resonant showstopper, the black-and-white screens smashing to colour as Smith waved a rainbow flag to what may have been the loudest cheer of the night, at least until Too Good at Goodbyes closed the main set with the crowd picking up the vulnerable heaven-bound chorus.
"You've done it - this is better than last time," Smith proclaimed before he exited the way he entered. And once again, you believed him.

Full text: From flooded neighbourhoods to drivers stranded all night on a highway in a blizzard, Montreal has had its share of events that show what happens when a community is not prepared for emergencies.
Mayor Valérie Plante said on Monday the city now has a strategy for dealing with extreme weather and other unforeseen events, from train derailments to terrorist attacks. "We're very well prepared, that's for sure," Plante said at a press conference at city hall where she unveiled Montreal's resilient city strategy.
In 2014, Montreal was the first city in Canada to join 100 Resilient Cities, a movement pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, she noted.In addition to emergencies, the strategy also addresses poverty, inequality and aging infrastructures.
Actions so far have included promoting awareness of emergency preparedness, setting up the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence, identifying emergency shelters across the city, promoting urban agriculture and revising urban planning to mitigate flood risks.
Plante noted that while the city is better prepared for weatherrelated emergencies, other catastrophes like terrorist threats are harder to plan for.
The city, she added, lacks jurisdiction over some aspects of emergency planning, like rail transportation, to prevent disasters like the 2013 Lac-Mégantic derailment that killed 47 people when a freight train carrying crude oil derailed near the Maine border.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Frank Zampino preliminary inquiry begins( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/frank-zampino-preliminary-inquiry-begins )
The preliminary inquiry began on Monday for Frank Zampino, the former No. 2 politician at Montreal city hall, and others who are accused of participating in a system of awarding municipal engineering contracts in exchange for kickbacks in the early and mid-2000s.
The hearing, which is under publication ban, is to continue on Friday. The media are not permitted to report any evidence heard at the hearing because of the publication ban.
Zampino was chairman of the city executive committee and right-hand man to three-term mayor Gérald Tremblay from 2002 to 2008.
Zampino was arrested by Quebec's anti-corruption squad, UPAC, in September along with former political fundraiser Bernard Trépanier, former Montreal civil servant Robert Marcil and five former heads or employees of engineering consulting firms.
One of the engineers, Yves Théberge, formerly of CIMA+, has since pleaded guilty.
They were arrested under a branch of a broader investigation into municipal corruption in Montreal, dubbed Fronde.
The accused face one charge each of municipal corruption, fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. Zampino and Marcil each face an additional charge of abuse of trust by a public officer.

Daughter of Mom Boucher faces new charges( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/daughter-of-mom-boucher-faces-new-charges )
The daughter of former Hells Angels leader Maurice (Mom) Boucher was arrested by the Sûreté du Québec on Saturday, a little more than a month after she was sentenced to house arrest for being in possession of cash generated by a major drug-trafficking ring linked to the biker gang.
Alexandra Mongeau, 28, appeared before a judge Monday afternoon at the Longueuil courthouse where she faces two charges alleging she was driving while impaired in Candiac. She was ordered to remain detained for a bail hearing to be held on Tuesday.
On May 11, Mongeau pleaded guilty to being in possession of cash collected by drug dealers who were part of a network that sold drugs in eastern Montreal. According to a summary of facts read into the court record, Mongeau was paid a cut (referred to as rent or taxes) of the profits on drugs sold in the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough between 2011 and 2015. Her cut worked out to $1,000 per month and came from traffickers who sold drugs like cocaine in neighbourhoods her father ruled over when he was the leader of the Hells Angels in Montreal during the 1990s.

Full text: Also: A Montreal couple is preparing a human-rights complaint over alleged racial profiling by police
Good morning,
These are the top stories:
What we know so far about the arrest of Peter Dalglish, the renowned Canadian accused of having sex with minors
On April 7, Dalglish, a leading international advocate for combating child poverty, was arrested at gunpoint in Nepal. The 60-year-old has spent decades working with children's organizations and received the Order of Canada in 2016. Two boys, ages 12 and 14, who were in Dalglish's house when he was arrested have told police of his alleged sexual contact with them, a father of one told The Globe. Speaking from behind bars, Dalglish has denied any improper contact; his lawyer says he will plead not guilty (no charges have been filed yet).
Dalglish's arrest has raised questions about his past humanitarian work: One international school in Thailand, which had already placed him under investigation last year, has removed him from its board of directors. And another school in Nepal says it banned him from its premises years ago over his alleged conduct toward children.

North Korea, nuclear arms and the Trump summit
On the weekend, Kim Jong-un said North Korea would suspend missile and nuclear tests. Kim also said the country's underground nuclear test site will be closed. However, he did not address the country's existing stockpile of missiles or nuclear weapons.
Donald Trump, meanwhile, rejected concerns that his effort to arrange a meeting with Kim has given the North Korean leader too much leverage. In a tweet, Trump said "we haven't given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization." However, North Korea has not committed to denuclearization - it only told South Koreans that is something it's willing to discuss. Experts say Kim's concessions may be part of an effort to reduce sanctions while eventually securing recognition as a nuclear power.
A Montreal couple is preparing a human-rights complaint over alleged racial profiling by police
The pair were each fined $444 for making too much noise while walking along a busy street at 10 a.m. While Brian Mann, a 31-year-old white man, was talking with police, Tayana Jacques says she was grabbed, thrown against a car, searched and handcuffed without explanation (Jacques, 34, is of Haitian descent). Mann says other officers then arrived on scene and wrestled him to the ground and pepper sprayed him. Jacques says she was detained in a car where police grilled her about drugs. "They wouldn't believe I have a good job and kept telling me I look like a drug addict," she said. Montreal police declined to comment.
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson apologized to the Chinese community for historic discrimination
Robertson apologized for past policies and regulations, including a ban on Chinese-Canadians from voting in municipal elections between 1886 and 1948. The city had also advocated for the head tax on Chinese immigrants, while city practices also attempted to segregate them in schools, swimming pools and other public areas. Robertson said the city will pursue initiatives to strengthen relations with Chinese-Canadians, including educating Vancouver residents about past injustices.
Playoffs: Raptors-Wizards all tied up; Leafs prep for Game 6
The Toronto Raptors fell apart in the second half to give the Washington Wizards a 106-98 victory yesterday. The series heads back to Toronto tied 2-2 after the Wizards won both of their home games.
In NHL action, the Toronto Maple Leafs are getting ready for another make-or-break game tonight at the Air Canada Centre (7 p.m. ET). The Leafs eked out a 4-3 win over the Boston Bruins on Saturday to extend the series to a sixth game. The Bruins are up 3-2.
The other Canadian playoff team, the Winnipeg Jets, advanced to the second round after defeating the Minnesota Wild in five games. They'll play the Nashville Predators next, with the series winner going on to the Western Conference finals.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
What happened at the Liberal convention
Justin Trudeau used his speech to take aim at the Conservatives and their leader: "It may be Andrew Scheer's smile, but it's still Stephen Harper's Party ... The same policies, the same politics of fear and division," he told supporters in Halifax on the weekend. Party members prioritized resolutions to create universal pharmacare and decriminalize the possession of small amounts of all drugs. Trudeau, though, said that while his government wants to enhance pharmacare, they won't move toward decriminalization.
John Ibbitson writes that, in the lead-up to the next election, Trudeau must confront three major challenges: NAFTA, Trans Mountain and border crossings. "Failure on any one of them could fatally undermine public confidence in the Liberals' ability to run the country." (for subscribers)
MORNING MARKETS
Stocks slip
Global stocks slipped on Monday as investors braced for a blizzard of earnings from the world's largest firms, while keeping a wary eye on U.S. bond yields as they approach peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past. Tokyo's Nikkei lost 0.3 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5 per cent. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 was down marginally by about 6:05 a.m. ET., with Germany's DAX and the Paris CAC 40 down by between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent. New York futures were also down. The Canadian dollar is weaker this morning, down to almost 78 US cents. Oil eased on rising U.S. borrowing costs and the prospect of further output rises after another increase in the weekly rig count, although the overall picture for crude remained bullish.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
The red flags ahead of Canada's marijuana legalization
"Most obviously, it isn't clear that [Bill C-45] is well-designed to reach one of its stated objectives, which is to reduce the harm that use of unregulated marijuana consumption is doing to adolescent minors, who are most at risk from the effects of prolonged consumption on the brain. Unless the government is operating under the quixotic assumption that minors will simply stop consuming the drug, their access to it will still largely come from the illegal sources that they are presently using to procure it. Sure, the fact that their older brothers and sisters (and perhaps even their parents) may have access to legal pot may mean that some of them will be able to access the drug by raiding family members' stashes. But by and large, the people most at risk will still be dealing with suppliers operating in the illegal market." - Daniel Weinstock and Andrew Potter, co-chairs of the coming conference Legalizing Marijuana in Canada: Policy Challenges
Why the survival of democracy depends on a strong middle-class
"The veracity and very survival of democracy depends on a strong, prosperous middle-class - one that is able to hold government accountable. According to research by Adam Przeworski, a professor of politics at New York University, in countries with a per-capita income below US$1,000, the life expectancy for a democracy is only around 12 years. ... The link between income and stable democracies is, at a certain level, intuitive. After all, at the heart of democracy is an economic contract between citizens who consent to pay taxes and a government that, in exchange, safeguards the security and welfare of the nation by providing public goods such as education, health care, infrastructure and national security. In essence, any economic challenge that threatens the middle class places this contract - and ultimately, democracy - in peril." - Dambisa Moyo, economist
Canada can afford a guaranteed basic income. But should it?
"Poverty has been a central government preoccupation in Canada since the 1940s. "Wars" have been launched against it, but it has never been vanquished. Almost five-million Canadians live below the poverty line; the child poverty rate was 17 per cent in 2017. What if the answer were as simple as sending a monthly government cheque to people who can't make ends meet? Though the idea was tested in Manitoba in the 1970s and is currently the subject of a three-year pilot study in Ontario, the notion of a guaranteed income still raises an endless series of questions. One of the biggest is cost. Last week, the Parliamentary Budget Office pegged the net annual cost of implementing Ontario's "negative income-tax" plan nationally (more than seven-million people would qualify) at $43.1 billion." - Globe editorial
LIVING BETTER
Here's what kids think you should know about Facebook security
In the wake of Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data, we asked three tech-savvy teens to share their top privacy tips. One is to be aware that anything that goes online can possibly stay online forever. Another piece of advice is to be cautious about how much information you're sharing. For example: Don't constantly update your status to divulge what you're doing or where you're going. Go here for more tips.
MOMENT IN TIME
Bavaria launches its Beer Purity Act
April 23, 1516: Barley, hops and water: Under the series of late-medieval regulations known as the Reinheitsgebot (or "purity order"), the German Duchy of Bavaria forbade its brewers from using any ingredients but those in making their beer. Introduced on April 23, 1516, the purpose was twofold: First, to ensure that unscrupulous brewers would no longer adulterate their products with unsafe ingredients - soot, sawdust and poisonous herbs were not uncommon - in a time when even small children drank beer daily (because plain water was frequently contaminated). Second, to keep the price of bread affordable (because brewers often used wheat or rye to make their malts, driving up the cost of grain for bakers). The ingredients list was officially expanded to four in the 19th century, after Louis Pasteur discovered the role of yeast in fermentation. With the unification of Germany in the 1870s, Bavaria successfully insisted that the law become national. Although the Beer Purity Act was effectively struck down in a 1987 European Union ruling, the 502-year-old ordinance remains a source of pride among many Germans, not to mention a handy marketing tool for breweries who use Reinheitsgebot as a shorthand to promote the purity of their product. - Christopher Harris

Full text: For my 50th birthday last year, I planned a fun-filled trip for my family over spring break. My destination was Mexico - specifically Tulum, with its great restaurants, unbeatable beaches, cool vibes and even cooler margaritas.
I soaked up every sunny second of that trip, discovered mescal, had some terrific tacos and even got a tan.
The only downside was discovering that my two teenage kids had hit that age where they were too old to spend the day on the beach making sandcastles and too young to partake in the nightlife. And while I was happiest doing absolutely nothing, those pesky kids kept wanting to do things.
"Next year," I thought, climbing down into yet another cenote, "those sulky teenagers will choose the vacation spot." And because I held a grudge about them shunning my Mexican getaway, this year I halved the budget for the annual family vacay. "No problem," they said, "we want to go to New York."
"New York ... New York ...," I thought, with Sinatra's iconic performance invading my subconscious.
I couldn't think up a single reason not to go. We could drive there, I could find a bargain hotel, we could check out some great restaurants, maybe cough up for a Broadway show or two, and window-shop, museum-hop and people-watch in what is probably my favourite city on Earth.
"OK, kids," I said, "let's start planning!" New York is a great road-trip destination; when you think about it, it's about as far away as Toronto - and who wants to vacation in Toronto? Though I have no problem driving seven hours to places like Métis-sur-Mer in the Lower St. Lawrence, I always thought New York City would be a frightening drive. But it was about six hours for us (the border crossings were close to deserted). Around four hours into the trip to Manhattan, you'll reach Saratoga Springs, which happens to have one of the best bakeries in North America, Mrs. London's Boutique Bakery (464 Broadway; mrslondonsbakery. com). It's ideal for lunch, or to pick up sandwiches to go.
Coming into New York is easier by day: things can get a bit tricky around the New Jersey Turnpike. Once you arrive, I'd recommend driving directly to the nearest parking lot, since taxis and the subway are the smartest modes of transport in and around Manhattan.
Expect to pay about US$50 a night for parking, but think of what you'll save on flights.
Of course, there's always the train, but the 11-hour Amtrak trip from Montreal is the definition of tedious. As for the bus, count on a good nine-hour trip. Flights are under an hour, but a round trip costs around $300. So driving is pretty hard to beat.
Budget Airbnb listings in New York are surprisingly scant, unless you're up for lodging far from downtown. We stayed at the centrally located Gregory hotel, where I managed to get a good deal.
As for what we did: walking, eating and Broadway shows. Here are some highlights: BROADWAY Of course, the entertainment options in New York City are endless, but with kids, a Broadway musical is a natural choice.
You'll pay a heavy price to see one, but there are ways to soften the blow.
We saw Hamilton, Come From Away and The Book of Mormon. Hamilton opened in 2015 and is still the hottest ticket on Broadway, but I managed to buy tickets for half price on the day of a blizzard. Lucky me, but no matter what the price, I highly recommend this musical. My kids called it life-changing, and I agree.
Come From Away is equally tremendous, telling the story of the people in Gander, N.L., tending to passengers of the 38 planes that were diverted to their town on 9/11. Canadians will especially enjoy this heartwarming show.
The Book of Mormon was cowritten by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, so don't expect political correctness.
The hilarious musical tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries in Africa. Not necessarily recommended for younger kids or, of course, Mormons.
You can go through the regular online rigmarole to purchase tickets, but you'll pay full price, which often comes in at around $200 per ticket. Ouch. Unless you want to be certain to see a specific show or sit with your friends or family, I'd throw caution to the wind and head to the TKTS discount booths, at Times Square and three other locations. Tickets are up to 50 per cent off there, but keep in mind these are same-day tickets only, and if you show up in the morning, only matinees will be listed. Lineups can be long at peak tourist times, but I had short waits. Even if you don't get tickets to the show you want, the alternatives can be pretty good.
MUSEUM The Tenement Museum (103 Orchard St.; tenement.org): Art aficionados will make a beeline for the majestic Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim, MOMA (the Museum of Modern Art) or, for American art, the Whitney Museum. And that's just for starters. But with kids in tow, I chose the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side. Focused on New York's immigrant history, it hosts walking tours featuring stories about the architects, artists and everyday people who shaped the neighbourhood, as well as the realities of tenement life on the Lower East Side in the early 20th century. Be sure to book tours ahead of time.
FOOD There are countless options for food lovers in New York, ranging from the top pick on the 2017 World's 50 Best Restaurants list, Eleven Madison Park (elevenmadisonpark.com) to the exquisitely French Le Coucou (lecoucou.com) and über-cool newcomer Frenchette (frenchettenyc.com) to arguably the world's best hotdog joint, Gray's Papaya (grayspapayanyc.com). When visiting with the family, though, my Michelin-star dining aspirations go out the window in favour of good times, great people-watching and even better food. When travelling, I prefer a light breakfast in favour of lunch, but brunch is a big deal in New York - and a good deal, too, at hipper restaurants like Momofuku Ssäm Bar (ssambar.momofuku.com) and the sophisticated and very foodie Estela (estelanyc. com). Ivan Ramen (25 Clinton St.; ivanramen.com): Ivan Orkin is known to many for his Chef's Table episode on Netflix (a favourite of my 13-year-old) and his terrific Ivan Ramen cookbook (Ten Speed Press, 2013). His restaurant is young and fun, and offers a diverse selection of ramen bowls. Favourites include the classic shio ramen and shoyu ramen, as well as specials like the triple pork ramen with pork belly two ways and whole wheat noodles. There's a superb selection of craft beers, and delicious appetizers like miso-roasted cauliflower and Japanese fried chicken with toasted garlic caramel and ranch sauce. This is the ideal spot for discovering new flavours while soaking up the cool ambience along with those great rye noodles. Atla (372 Lafayette St.; atlanyc. com): Located in NoHo, this is the casual New York restaurant of Enrique Olvera, the chef behind Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme in New York. Atla's cuisine is creative Mexican, and be warned: a meal here doesn't come cheap. But with such amazing cooking and such terrific ingredients, why should it? I licked every plate clean, as did my kids, who relished everything from the herbed guacamole to the Brussels sprouts tacos, along with the Milanese-style fish, prawns with serrano chili pepper aioli, yellowtail tiradito and fried pork belly with salsa verde. The churros and margaritas were the best I've tasted. This is Mexican cooking of the highest order. Next time, I'll go for the popular breakfast menu. Le Coq Rico (30 East 20th St.; lecoqriconyc.com): This very French restaurant is owned by famous chef Antoine Westermann and specializes in chicken. When I say chicken, I mean specific breeds, like Brune Landaise, Plymouth Rock and Jersey Giant. There's also guinea hen, duck, squab and all sorts of dishes made with eggs and offal including chicken livers and foie gras. Le Coq Rico is quite posh, but what drew me here was the chance to taste such fabulous birds and share, which is ideal for family dining. Other standouts include the spectacular fries, duck rillettes, fabulous desserts like the millefeuille and île flottante, as well as the cocktails. The roast chicken is delectable, and the service is beyond reproach. Chic, but in no way pretentious.
Don Antonio (309 West 50th St.; donantoniopizza.com): New York is a serious pizza city, and the offerings are endless. (Some of the best are across the bridge in Brooklyn.) Located in the theatre district just a few blocks from Times Square, Don Antonio makes one of the best Neapolitan pies in New York. There are dozens of options, be they traditional or creative, all prepared with homemade mozzarella and baked in a wood-fired oven. The wine list is pricey and the service can be brusque (they don't take reservations), but the pizza is superb and the location is ideal for a pre-show meal. Katz's Delicatessen (205 East Houston St.; katzsdelicatessen.com): Located a few blocks from the Tenement Museum, New York's most famous deli is a must-visit for Montrealers, if only to taste the difference between their pastrami and our smoked meat. Frankly, I prefer our spicier smoked meat, but the ambience at Katz's is hard to top, in an expansive space filled with locals feasting on meat-heaving sandwiches and half-sour pickles. A word of warning: you'll pay US$21 per sandwich, compared to $9.95 at Schwartz, but one can easily feed two. Movie buffs should look for the spot from the famous "I'll have what she's having" scene in When Harry Met Sally ..., in the middle of the room. Russ & Daughters (179 East Houston St.; russanddaughters. com): For just over a century, this institution has been owned and operated by four generations of the Russ family, and I can think of few food experiences that say "New York" quite like it. The shop may be small, but the offerings are huge. The smoked and cured fish is stacked high, the shelves are heaving with chocolate and cinnamon babka, and the raspberry rugelach is lined up next to New York's signature black-and-white cookies. There is pickled herring, caviar, halvah, chopped liver, latkes and gefilte fish galore. If you want to sit down to enjoy all this fabulous Jewish fare, head to the Russ & Daughters Café just a few blocks away (127 Orchard St.) or the Russ & Daughters restaurant and takeout counter at the Jewish Museum (1109 5th Ave.), where dishes are listed under "noshes," "boards" or "platters." Expect to line up for a seat during peak hours, but it's definitely worth the wait. (Cool fact: Montreal's Arthurs restaurant was inspired by Russ & Daughters.) Dominique Ansel (189 Spring St.; dominiqueansel.com): This SoHo bakery was the first shop in the empire of French pâtissier Dominique Ansel, inventor of the cronut, that pastry-sensation cross between a doughnut and a croissant. Lineups can snake down the street, and the small bakery is crowded, but there were no lines when I visited. The main draw is the cronut (flavours change often), which is worth a taste but is definitely on the sweet side. Ansel is famous for other creations, too, like his frozen s'mores and his latest, the kiwi sorbet bar. It's all a lot of fun, especially for kids. Too bad the service staff isn't friendlier. Magnolia Bakery (multiple locations; magnoliabakery.com):
Another New York institution, Magnolia started cupcake mania in the U.S., which was further boosted by the Sex and the City fans who lined up to devour Carrie Bradshaw's favoured indulgence. I ended up in front of the Magnolia at Rockefeller Center and thought, "Why not?" A big hit with the kids, the cupcakes are small, super sweet and absolutely scrumptious. Buy a few (vanilla and red velvet are faves), cross the street and take a break while admiring the skyscrapers. The City Bakery (3 West 18th St.; thecitybakery.com): Opened in 1990 by pastry chef and former TV producer/director Maury Rubin, City Bakery became famous for its modern take on classic French pastries. Rubin is known for his simple-chic tarts, pretzel croissants and fantastic hot chocolate. This is a great spot to unwind and indulge, and at lunchtime the buffet is filled with healthy soups, sandwiches and salads. Friendly staff and seriously delicious goods make this a top pick, especially for those looking for takeout, perhaps to enjoy in one of New York's many beautiful parks.

Museum
The Tenement Museum (103 Orchard St.; tenement.org( http://tenement.org/ )).

In a serious pizza city, Don Antonio is royalty.
There are countless options for food lovers in New York, ranging from the top pick on the 2017 World's 50 Best Restaurants( https://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners ) list, Eleven Madison Park (elevenmadisonpark.com( http://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/ )) to the exquisitely French Le Coucou (lecoucou.com( https://www.lecoucou.com/ )) and über-cool newcomer Frenchette (frenchettenyc.com( https://www.frenchettenyc.com/ )) to arguably the world's best hotdog joint, Gray's Papaya (grayspapayanyc.com( http://grayspapayanyc.com )).

I licked every plate clean, as did my kids, who relished everything from the herbed guacamole to the Brussels sprouts tacos, along with the Milanese-style fish, prawns with serrano chili pepper aioli, yellowtail tiradito and fried pork belly with salsa verde. The churros and margaritas were the best I've tasted. This is Mexican cooking of the highest order. Next time, I'll go for the popular breakfast menu.
Le Coq Rico (30 East 20th St.; lecoqriconyc.com( http://www.lecoqriconyc.com/ )). This very French restaurant is owned by famous chef Antoine Westermann and specializes in chicken. When I say chicken, I mean specific breeds, like Brune Landaise, Plymouth Rock and Jersey Giant. There's also guinea hen, duck, squab and all sorts of dishes made with eggs and offal including chicken livers and foie gras. Le Coq Rico is quite posh, but what drew me here was the chance to taste such fabulous birds and share, which is ideal for family dining. Other standouts include the spectacular fries, duck rillettes, fabulous desserts like the mille-feuille and île flottante, as well as the cocktails. The roast chicken is delectable, and the service is beyond reproach. Chic, but in no way pretentious.
Don Antonio (309 West 50th St.; donantoniopizza.com( http://www.donantoniopizza.com/ )). New York is a serious pizza city, and the offerings are endless. (Some of the best are across the bridge in Brooklyn.) Located in the theatre district just a few blocks from Times Square, Don Antonio makes one of the best Neapolitan pies in New York. There are dozens of options, be they traditional or creative, all prepared with homemade mozzarella and baked in a wood-fired oven. The wine list is pricey and the service can be brusque (they don't take reservations), but the pizza is superb and the location is ideal for a pre-show meal.
Katz's Delicatessen (205 East Houston St.; katzsdelicatessen.com( https://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/ )). Located a few blocks from the Tenement Museum, New York's most famous deli is a must-visit for Montrealers, if only to taste the difference between their pastrami and our smoked meat. Frankly, I prefer our spicier smoked meat, but the ambience at Katz's is hard to top, in an expansive space filled with locals feasting on meat-heaving sandwiches and half-sour pickles. A word of warning: you'll pay US$21 per sandwich, compared to $9.95 at Schwartz, but one can easily feed two. Movie buffs should look for the spot from the famous "I'll have what she's having" scene in When Harry Met Sally ..., in the middle of the room.
Le Coq Rico specializes in specific breeds of chicken, such as Brune Landaise.
Russ & Daughters (179 East Houston St.; russanddaughters.com( http://russanddaughters.com/ )). For just over a century, this institution has been owned and operated by four generations of the Russ family, and I can think of few food experiences that say "New York" quite like it. The shop may be small, but the offerings are huge. The smoked and cured fish is stacked high, the shelves are heaving with chocolate and cinnamon babka, and the raspberry rugelach is lined up next to New York's signature black-and-white cookies. There is pickled herring, caviar, halvah, chopped liver, latkes and gefilte fish galore. If you want to sit down to enjoy all this fabulous Jewish fare, head to the Russ & Daughters Café just a few blocks away (127 Orchard St.) or the Russ & Daughters restaurant and takeout counter at the Jewish Museum (1109 5th Ave.), where dishes are listed under "noshes," "boards" or "platters." Expect to line up for a seat during peak hours, but it's definitely worth the wait. (Cool fact: Montreal's Arthurs restaurant was inspired by Russ & Daughters.)
Dominique Ansel (189 Spring St.; dominiqueansel.com( https://dominiqueansel.com/ )). This SoHo bakery was the first shop in the empire of French pâtissier Dominique Ansel, inventor of the cronut, that pastry-sensation cross between a doughnut and a croissant. Lineups can snake down the street, and the small bakery is crowded, but there were no lines when I visited. The main draw is the cronut (flavours change often), which is worth a taste but is definitely on the sweet side. Ansel is famous for other creations, too, like his frozen s'mores and his latest, the kiwi sorbet bar. It's all a lot of fun, especially for kids. Too bad the service staff isn't friendlier.
Magnolia Bakery's cupcakes started a craze.
Magnolia Bakery (multiple locations; magnoliabakery.com( https://www.magnoliabakery.com/ )). Another New York institution, Magnolia started cupcake mania in the U.S., which was further boosted by the Sex and the City fans who lined up to devour Carrie Bradshaw's favoured indulgence. I ended up in front of the Magnolia at Rockefeller Center and thought, "Why not?" A big hit with the kids, the cupcakes are small, super sweet and absolutely scrumptious. Buy a few (vanilla and red velvet are faves), cross the street and take a break while admiring the skyscrapers.
The City Bakery (3 West 18th St.; thecitybakery.com( http://thecitybakery.com/ )). Opened in 1990 by pastry chef and former TV producer/director Maury Rubin, City Bakery became famous for its modern take on classic French pastries. Rubin is known for his simple-chic tarts, pretzel croissants and fantastic hot chocolate. This is a great spot to unwind and indulge, and at lunchtime the buffet is filled with healthy soups, sandwiches and salads. Friendly staff and seriously delicious goods make this a top pick, especially for those looking for takeout, perhaps to enjoy in one of New York's many beautiful parks.

Full text: Last winter, reporter Christopher Curtis travelled to the small community of Salluit in northern Quebec. This is Part 5 of his seven-part series This Is Salluit.
SALLUIT - When the village gathers to celebrate, Michael Cameron tends to stay home.
It's not that Cameron is some sort of grinch. In fact, his default facial expression suggests he's constantly struggling not to grin.
Cameron says he doesn't like being in large crowds because of the things he has seen as a paramedic in Salluit. Of the 12 locals who took the community's first medical technician course in 2003, only Cameron remains on duty.
And in that time, he has seen things that make him appreciate the quiet moments with his wife and kids.
"I'm starting to come out of it, but it's been like this for about 10 or 15 years," Cameron said. "I've had a child die in my arms. I've seen gunshot victims, suicides, murders. At times, you're trying to be the one that's ... you're still working on the victim, but you know it's too late.
"To be the one to tell a father his two-month-old died in an accident. To be the one who they hug - whether it's a good call or a tragic one - when it's all over. It can be a lot to carry in such a small community."
In remote Salluit, the relationship between life and death is at the core of even the most banal day, Cameron says.
If you want to live here, you have to hunt. If you're going to hunt, you need to stay alive in the elements. And no one, not even the most experienced navigator, is immune to nasty weather.
Beyond his duties as the town's game warden and its chief paramedic, Cameron is the coordinator of Salluit's search-and-rescue team. Two years ago, he led an expedition to find a man who had wandered to the edge of town during a whiteout.
"He'd gone for a walk to get spring water and the weather turned on him," Cameron said. "He tried to brave the storm but got tired, lay down, fell asleep and never woke up again. We found him near the gravel pit at the end of the road over there."
Another young man, Steven Yuliusi, took off on his snowmobile on New Year's Eve and never returned. Cameron says he lost control of the vehicle and drove over the edge of a 30-metre gorge.
The fall destroyed his snowmobile, but somehow Yuliusi survived it.
"He was just 10 kilometres outside of town. He knows the area so he started limping home," Cameron said. "We tell our kids to never leave their machine if something goes wrong. Well, sure enough, we found his snowmobile in the ravine after just one day of searching, but it took us four days to find the body. He was three kilometres from the crash site."
A boat lies on the shore of the Hudson Strait in Salluit, the second-northernmost Inuit community in Quebec.
In the remote Nunavik region, deaths caused by accidents are more than three times the provincial average, according to a 2015 study by the Université Laval. On average, there are 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with 3.0 per 10,000 throughout Quebec.
In Salluit, assistant town manager Barbara Papigatuk says the inherent danger of living in such an unforgiving environment binds people together.
When someone ventures onto the territory and doesn't return, the village shuts down. Businesses close, government offices are put on hold and every able-bodied adult assists in the search-and-rescue operation.
That's what happened when Papigatuk's brother Frankie Ikey went missing in June 2011.
Nothing about that day suggested things would take a bad turn. It was sunny and mild, but there was still enough slush on the ground for Frankie to tow his boat to Deception Bay with a snowmobile.
He had taken his son Stas and friend Adamie Alaku seal hunting, something all of them had done dozens of times before.
Barbara Papigatuk, the assistant city manager in Salluit, lost a brother, his son and a brother-in-law to the sea: "We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
"There were other boats out on the water, but they came back. Not my brother," Papigatuk said. "My brother, his son and Adamie, my brother-in-law. I lost three family members in one day."
Papigatuk was 1,800 kilometres south, studying at Concordia University, when she heard the news.
"Frankie was my best friend. People used to think we were twins," she said. "When I found out he was missing, I had to get home."
The search parties were still scouring the northern coast when Papigatuk's flight landed in Salluit. The Canadian Rangers and locals navigated the waters in fishing trollers, calling out their names onto the Hudson Strait.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Forces flew aircraft low over the shoreline, scanning for any sign of life. Air Inuit also joined the operation, sending a plane to loop around the Labrador coast in case the boat had drifted into the Atlantic Ocean.
There had been a glimmer of hope, a few days in, when a camper said he heard one of the missing men on his CB radio. But in the end the military called off its search on June 15, one week after Frankie set out on the water. They never recovered any of the missing men's remains.
"I couldn't breathe for the longest time," Papigatuk said. "The fear of not knowing where he was or if he was dead or alive, it stayed for years. I'm calming down about it these days.
"I know he won't come home. I'm not an idiot, I know he's gone. But I do miss him. We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
Cameron lost a cousin to the sea about seven years ago. He went out in a canoe on a spring morning and never came back. In the end, the canoe washed up on shore, but Cameron never saw his cousin again.
"I always said before, to his wife and my wife, 'When he dies, I'm going to be there with him,' " Cameron said. " 'We're gonna die together,' I'd say. We always did search and rescue together, we always hunted together. It was sort of a saying for me. 'If one of us goes, we're both going.' But that didn't happen.
"It's like that in the North."
Two years ago, Cameron and his son were the first responders during a hunting accident that took the life of a teenage boy. He was with his cousin and they were playing with a rifle, unaware that a bullet was in the chamber when it discharged.
In the end, there was little Cameron or anyone could do to mend the child's wound.
Cameron doesn't talk about how the accident affected him. Instead, he says he worries about the child's parents and about the sweet kid who'll grow up with a sense of guilt no child should ever have to know.
"No matter who you are, whether you're a child or an elder, seeing these sorts of things, you can't just lock those memories away," he said.
There are, of course, stories of resilience and survival on the land. For every person lost to the wilderness, there are many more who were found or made their way home on foot.
A relative of Cameron's got stuck in a blizzard on his way back from Deception Bay one afternoon. To wait out the storm, he dug a shelter under his sled and kept warm.
By the time the sun came back out, he tunnelled his way out of a 10-foot snowdrift and used the reflection of his metal harpoon to signal for help.
"When you combine a person's instinct for survival with some of the knowledge that comes with living here, those are two very powerful things," Cameron said. "Like most people, I try not to go out alone. And even for a small trip, I always bring extra rations, a thermal blanket and candles in case I get stuck out there."
"To live here is to be a survivor. That's just how it is."

SALLUIT - When the village gathers to celebrate, Michael Cameron tends to stay home.

"I'm starting to come out of it, but it's been like this for about 10 or 15 years," Cameron said. "I've had a child die in my arms. I've seen gunshot victims, suicides, murders. At times, you're trying to be the one that's ... you're still working on the victim, but you know it's too late.
"To be the one to tell a father his two-month-old died in an accident. To be the one who they hug - whether it's a good call or a tragic one - when it's all over. It can be a lot to carry in such a small community."
In remote Salluit, the relationship between life and death is at the core of even the most banal day, Cameron says.
If you want to live here, you have to hunt. If you're going to hunt, you need to stay alive in the elements. And no one, not even the most experienced navigator, is immune to nasty weather.
Beyond his duties as the town's game warden and its chief paramedic, Cameron is the coordinator of Salluit's search-and-rescue team. Two years ago, he led an expedition to find a man who had wandered to the edge of town during a whiteout.
"He'd gone for a walk to get spring water and the weather turned on him," Cameron said. "He tried to brave the storm but got tired, lay down, fell asleep and never woke up again. We found him near the gravel pit at the end of the road over there."
Another young man, Steven Yuliusi, took off on his snowmobile on New Year's Eve and never returned. Cameron says he lost control of the vehicle and drove over the edge of a 30-metre gorge.
The fall destroyed his snowmobile, but somehow Yuliusi survived it.
"He was just 10 kilometres outside of town. He knows the area so he started limping home," Cameron said. "We tell our kids to never leave their machine if something goes wrong. Well, sure enough, we found his snowmobile in the ravine after just one day of searching, but it took us four days to find the body. He was three kilometres from the crash site."
A boat lies on the shore of the Hudson Strait in Salluit, the second-northernmost Inuit community in Quebec.
In the remote Nunavik region, deaths caused by accidents are more than three times the provincial average, according to a 2015 study by the Université Laval. On average, there are 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with 3.0 per 10,000 throughout Quebec.
In Salluit, assistant town manager Barbara Papigatuk says the inherent danger of living in such an unforgiving environment binds people together.
When someone ventures onto the territory and doesn't return, the village shuts down. Businesses close, government offices are put on hold and every able-bodied adult assists in the search-and-rescue operation.
That's what happened when Papigatuk's brother Frankie Ikey went missing in June 2011.
Nothing about that day suggested things would take a bad turn. It was sunny and mild, but there was still enough slush on the ground for Frankie to tow his boat to Deception Bay with a snowmobile.
He had taken his son Stas and friend Adamie Alaku seal hunting, something all of them had done dozens of times before.
Barbara Papigatuk, the assistant city manager in Salluit, lost a brother, his son and a brother-in-law to the sea: "We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
"There were other boats out on the water, but they came back. Not my brother," Papigatuk said. "My brother, his son and Adamie, my brother-in-law. I lost three family members in one day."
Papigatuk was 1,800 kilometres south, studying at Concordia University, when she heard the news.
"Frankie was my best friend. People used to think we were twins," she said. "When I found out he was missing, I had to get home."
The search parties were still scouring the northern coast when Papigatuk's flight landed in Salluit. The Canadian Rangers and locals navigated the waters in fishing trollers, calling out their names onto the Hudson Strait.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Forces flew aircraft low over the shoreline, scanning for any sign of life. Air Inuit also joined the operation, sending a plane to loop around the Labrador coast in case the boat had drifted into the Atlantic Ocean.
There had been a glimmer of hope, a few days in, when a camper said he heard one of the missing men on his CB radio. But in the end the military called off its search on June 15, one week after Frankie set out on the water. They never recovered any of the missing men's remains.
"I couldn't breathe for the longest time," Papigatuk said. "The fear of not knowing where he was or if he was dead or alive, it stayed for years. I'm calming down about it these days.
"I know he won't come home. I'm not an idiot, I know he's gone. But I do miss him. We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
Cameron lost a cousin to the sea about seven years ago. He went out in a canoe on a spring morning and never came back. In the end, the canoe washed up on shore, but Cameron never saw his cousin again.
"I always said before, to his wife and my wife, 'When he dies, I'm going to be there with him,' " Cameron said. " 'We're gonna die together,' I'd say. We always did search and rescue together, we always hunted together. It was sort of a saying for me. 'If one of us goes, we're both going.' But that didn't happen.
"It's like that in the North."
Two years ago, Cameron and his son were the first responders during a hunting accident that took the life of a teenage boy. He was with his cousin and they were playing with a rifle, unaware that a bullet was in the chamber when it discharged.
In the end, there was little Cameron or anyone could do to mend the child's wound.
Cameron doesn't talk about how the accident affected him. Instead, he says he worries about the child's parents and about the sweet kid who'll grow up with a sense of guilt no child should ever have to know.
"No matter who you are, whether you're a child or an elder, seeing these sorts of things, you can't just lock those memories away," he said.
There are, of course, stories of resilience and survival on the land. For every person lost to the wilderness, there are many more who were found or made their way home on foot.
A relative of Cameron's got stuck in a blizzard on his way back from Deception Bay one afternoon. To wait out the storm, he dug a shelter under his sled and kept warm.
By the time the sun came back out, he tunnelled his way out of a 10-foot snowdrift and used the reflection of his metal harpoon to signal for help.
"When you combine a person's instinct for survival with some of the knowledge that comes with living here, those are two very powerful things," Cameron said. "Like most people, I try not to go out alone. And even for a small trip, I always bring extra rations, a thermal blanket and candles in case I get stuck out there."
"To live here is to be a survivor. That's just how it is."

Full text: As a winter storm roared across the province last March, Pierre Thibault and Michaël Fiset ignored the advice of colleagues who urged them to ride out the dangerous blizzard at their office in Montmagny and not attempt to drive home.
Their decision would prove to be a fatal mistake.
About 10 hours after leaving the transportation company where they worked, police found the two men dead after the truck they were travelling in had become trapped in a high snowdrift northeast of Quebec City.
Both men died of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to a coroner's report released on Tuesday.
The two friends didn't take the blizzard warnings seriously enough, even though major highways in the area were closed and a gas station attendant had urged them not to travel, coroner Luc Malouin says in his report.
A Sûreté du Québec rescue operation was delayed for two hours because officers trained to drive the two snowmobiles at the Montmagny detachment weren't in the station when the men called for help. If the police officers had been deployed two hours earlier, they may have arrived on the scene while the two men were still alive, Malouin said.
"It's impossible to say if the police officers could have located the two men in time to save their lives, but it would have increased their chances," he wrote.
On the same evening, hundreds of motorists were trapped in deep snow on Highway 13 in Montreal.
The tragic incident began on the evening of March 14, 2017, as a bad storm made its way across the region northeast of Quebec City. Locals said it was one of the worst storms in years.
Fiset, 33, who drove a Ford F-150 with all-wheel drive, was confident that he could navigate despite heavy snow and high winds.
When they left the office of Transport Gilmyr around 9:24 p.m., Fiset planned to drop his friend off at his home in Berthiersur-Mer, about 13 kilometres away, before heading home to St-François-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud.
A few hours earlier, the SQ had closed Highways 20 and 132 because of whiteout conditions on the roads. The only other route home was Coteau Rd. in Montmagny, but that road had also been closed because of the storm.
Fiset decided to drive around the barrier and continued on his journey. At 10:43 p.m., he became stuck in a 1.5-metre-high snowdrift on Principale St.
Both men contacted locals they knew seeking help, but no one could venture out because there was zero visibility and they couldn't see across the street.
Thibault, 42, then made calls to the SQ and 911 at 11:18 p.m., saying they were stuck in the snow and needed assistance.
But before Thibault phoned police, Fiset walked to a residence about 34 metres away and borrowed two shovels to try to dig out.
Back at the SQ detachment in Montmagny, police were making plans to send out two snowmobilers to rescue the trapped men. But the departure was delayed because an officer qualified to drive the snowmobile was on patrol elsewhere and had trouble getting back to the office.
While police were trying to mobilize the rescue team, conditions in the truck were deteriorating.
Fiset made a second call to 911 at 12:05 a.m. and a third call at 12:51 a.m., saying Thibault was having an asthma attack and was having trouble breathing.
At 12:58 a.m., police informed Thibault the rescue team would be leaving shortly.
By 1:16 a.m., Fiset called police to say he was also having trouble breathing and that Thibault was now unconscious. It was the last call Fiset would make.
The SQ snowmobile team finally left Montmagny at 1:20 a.m. as the storm continued to intensify with howling winds and whiteout conditions.
About 30 minutes into the journey, the snowmobile drivers also became stuck in a snowdrift. The police officers continued their journey on foot and arrived on Principle St. at 2:15 a.m., but they could not find Fiset's truck because it was buried in the snow.
The officers then sought shelter in a home because they were so cold. They eventually found the truck in three metres of snow at 7:50 a.m. and needed a backhoe to reach it.
It was then that they made the grim discovery. Fiset was found dead outside the truck and his friend was dead in the driver's seat.
In his report, Malouin said every citizen is responsible for their own safety, adding that motorists can't always rely on emergency services to respond quickly in bad winter weather. He said Quebecers need to take severe weather alerts more seriously.
He also recommended that the SQ change its practices to ensure that officers who are qualified to drive snowmobiles are in the detachment during severe winter storms so they can be deployed quickly.
"Having snowmobiles to respond to emergencies is excellent, but if no one is available to drive them, they become useless," he wrote. kwilton@postmedia.com

Full text: A year since hundreds of people were stranded in their cars overnight on Highway 13 because of a blizzard, lawyers hoping for a quick out-of-court class-action settlement say negotiations have stalled, until the next round.
The provincial government is willing, but the City of Montreal said no, lawyer Marc-Antoine Cloutier said Wednesday.
In November, a Quebec Superior Court judge gave the green light to a class-action lawsuit against the city and province. Quebec's Transport Ministry, the Sûreté du Québec and the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) are also named as defendants.
Two thousand claimants are seeking $2,500 apiece in damages for a total of $5 million. Many were trapped in the cold without food or water for up to 14 hours, and some needed access to regular medication.
Those who ran out of gas also ran out of heat. They needed washroom facilities. Some families with children attempted to walk along the highway in search of help.
The government apologized, Cloutier said, but victims so far have received no financial compensation.
"One year later, it's time to put words to action and compensate victims who suffered harm," Cloutier said of people deprived of their freedom, dignity and safety.
Jacques Laramée, 65, said he is still traumatized by the events of the night of March 14. There was no indication that anything was wrong when he left his daughter's home in St-Jérôme at 4 p.m. for St-Constant to have supper with his wife.
Traffic slowed and finally ground to a halt along the storm-swept road, about four kilometres from the exit to Highway 20.
A diabetic who needs to take his medication, Laramée said he was concerned about his health, but there was no news about what caused the bottleneck on Highway 13 - nor how long he and hundreds of others would be stuck there.
He had no food and no water. He needed his medication. And he had to turn off the car to conserve gas.
The worst part was feeling powerless, he said. His stress mounted with each minute that passed, he said, choking with emotion.
A retired banker, Laramée said he has faced 14 holdups during his career, but getting trapped on the highway was worse.
"A holdup lasts 30 seconds, but this lasted 10 hours," he said. "That's 10 hours of not knowing what to do."
He now packs his car with a survival kit, including food and water, blankets and other essential items.
Troubles on Highway 13 began as traffic grew in the snowstorm and cars began to break down, some running out of gas. Then two trucks reportedly got stuck and blocked the highway completely.
Hundreds of 911 calls were reported.
Hours passed and the provincial transport department didn't send in plows. Some tow trucks couldn't get through, and most were already busy elsewhere on the roads. Finally, the fire department was called in.
A report by government investigator Florent Gagné largely blamed Quebec Transport and the Sûreté du Québec for a series of gaps in communication about what was going on, followed by poor management of the situation that night; it also said that a Roxboro company had failed to clear snow and spread abrasives.

Following Wednesday's storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ), which led to a number of afternoon highway accidents resulting in one death and several injuries, Friday's weather warning was followed by a few centimetres of snow and up to 4 cm more to come Saturday. Temperatures on Saturday are expected to hover around -5 C.
For Sunday, the updated freezing-rain warning is calling for 2-5 mm to fall, with a possibility of 10 mm more north of the St. Lawrence. Temperatures in the Montreal area are expected to range from -3 C during the day to an evening low of -10 C.
"Freezing rain will begin near the United States border around midday Sunday and spread toward the Montreal, the north shore and the Centre-du-Québec regions later in the afternoon," the updated freezing-rain warning stated.
Sun is expected on Monday with a high of -5 C and a low of -14 C and clear skies through the evening. After much the same on Tuesday, temperatures are expected to jump slightly above freezing, with highs of 3 C and 4 C on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
The snow and freezing rain will make walking and driving more challenging around southern Quebec throughout the weekend.
Check on the city of Montreal's snow-clearing progress at ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). At 3 p.m., it was reporting that 31 per cent of city streets had been cleared, down from earlier in the day due to additional snow.

Full text: After predicting more than 10 centimetres of snow Saturday and Sunday, Environment Canada's weather warning has changed slighting, targeting a prediction of 2-5 mm of freezing rain expected to fall Sunday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ).
Following Wednesday's snowstorm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ), which led to a number of afternoon highway accidents resulting in one death and several injuries, Friday's weather warning was followed by a few centimetres of snow and up to 4 cm more to come Saturday. Temperatures on Saturday are expected to hover around -5 C.
For Sunday, the updated freezing-rain warning is calling for 2-5 mm to fall, with a possibility of 10 mm north of the St. Lawrence. Temperatures in the Montreal area are expected to range from -3 C during the day to an evening low of -10 C.
"Freezing rain will begin near the United States border around midday Sunday and spread toward the Montreal, the north shore and the Centre-du-Québec regions later in the afternoon," the updated freezing-rain warning stated.
Sun is expected on Monday with a high of -5 C and a low of -14 C and clear skies through the evening. After much the same on Tuesday, temperatures are expected to jump slightly above freezing, with highs of 3 C and 4 C on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
The snow and freezing rain will make walking and driving more challenging around southern Quebec throughout the weekend.

Nunavut judge pens objection to time limits for criminal trials

Full text: A Nunavut judge has written a passionate objection to the Supreme Court's time limits for criminal trials, saying they do not respect Inuit culture or the geography of northern Canada.
Judges are usually bound by Supreme Court precedents. But Justice Paul Bychok of the Nunavut Court of Justice found a way around a Supreme Court ruling known as Jordan. In 2016, the Jordan ruling set time limits of 30 months for criminal proceedings in superior courts, but said cases could exceed the maximum in "exceptional circumstances." In a decision last week, Justice Bychok declared the entire territory of Nunavut an exceptional circumstance.
The Jordan ruling, he wrote, fails to consider the fact that judges in Nunavut must travel vast distances to hear cases in remote communities, that the territory's financial resources are limited and that delays related to weather or local cultural are often unavoidable.
"How, then, does one fit the square Jordan peg into the round Nunavut hole while doing justice to Nunavummiut [the people of Nunavut]?" he asked in his ruling on a man's request for his sexual offences case to be thrown out because proceedings had lasted more than 30 months.
"I do not believe the majority in Jordan intended trial judges to re-assert past colonialist attitudes and practices which ran roughshod over the Inuit. We live in a post Truth and Reconciliation Canada."
In July, 2016, the Supreme Court said a culture of complacency and delay dogs the criminal courts. It established time limits of 18 months for criminal proceedings (from charge to trial end) and 30 months in superior courts.
Ever since, judges, defence lawyers, prosecutors and the provincial governments that administer the justice system have scrambled to meet the timelines.
And in the next few weeks, the federal government intends to introduce legislation to speed up trial proceedings.
Justice Bychok was conducting the fifth trial of Lukasie Anugaa, who faced two charges of historical sexual offences from the late 1970s. Two jury trials had ended in mistrials and two did not proceed. In November, Justice Bychok rejected the request to throw out the charges over delay, and late last week issued his written reasons for having done so.
The proceedings in the Anugaa case lasted 54 months, and the judge blamed delay by the defence for 23 months of that time, leaving a total just beyond the Jordan ceiling. After subtracting time for exceptional circumstances - Nunavutspecific delay of 51/2 months - the judge found no unreasonable delay.
Justice Bychok was a federal prosecutor, originally from Montreal, who moved to Iqaluit in 2003 with his young family. In 2015, the Conservative government appointed him a judge.
In Nunavut, 38,000 people live in 25 remote communities scattered over more than two million square kilometres, he wrote in his ruling. Judges do a "circuit" of these communities. Based in Iqaluit, they travel regularly to each community over immense distances. (The court's travel budget was nearly $2.5-million in 2016-17, and flights can take up to seven hours, Justice Bychok pointed out.) Court dates are not easy to reschedule. Some small communities receive just three court visits a year, and one has just two. A blizzard may stop the four full-time judges from completing their circuit, meaning the next court session in some places could be as much as a year away.
The province has an unwritten rule that each litigant is entitled to one adjournment because travelling south for medical care is commonplace, Justice Bychok said.
Deaths and suicide "touch everyone" and court visits "sometimes are cancelled out of respect for the grieving."
And the territory has no money for new infrastructure or to increase the frequency of court visits, the judge wrote.
Adding an even greater edge to a lower-court judge's critique of the Supreme Court, Justice Boychok was sarcastic at times. Twice he referred to the 30 months as the "magic" ceiling or limit. In a footnote, he went even further, reciting the words of the four Supreme Court judges who dissented on Jordan: "wrong in principle and unwise in practice."
Justice Bychok's ruling - that Nunavut is an exceptional circumstance in Jordan calculations - is to be treated as "persuasive but not binding" by judges of his level, said Marian Bryant, the chief federal prosecutor in the territory.
In a phone interview, she declined to comment directly on the ruling, but said, "certainly this is an exceptional jurisdiction. You never get somewhere until you're there. And once you're in, you don't know if you're going back out."
Justice Bychok declined, through a court spokesman, to comment when contacted by The Globe and Mail.

Freeland says U.S. is taking 'zero-sum' view on trade

Full text: Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is accusing the "explicitly protectionist" Trump administration of wanting to use the renegotiation of NAFTA to slash trade between the United States and Canada.
In a broadside at her American negotiating partners two days after concluding the latest round of talks, Ms. Freeland accused Washington of taking an unrealistic "zero-sum" view of trade, said the U.S. is "never going to win" the race to bring back low-skilled jobs - a core tenet of President Donald Trump's economic strategy - and slammed politicians who use economic anxiety "as a political resource" to attack immigrants and trade deals.
"At the NAFTA table, [Canada's] overall goal is to say 'Let's modernize, let's update and let's find ways to trade even more together," the Foreign Minister told a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York Wednesday afternoon. "The U.S. ... administration is different. This is an administration that is explicitly protectionist and, in many areas, the objective quite explicitly is to shrink the trading relationship."
While Ms. Freeland's comments were effectively a summary of widely-held views within the Trudeau government, it is rare for a Canadian official to express them so openly. At NAFTA talks on Monday, for example, she was careful to refer to the U.S.'s tough protectionist demands merely as "unconventional proposals."
Ms. Freeland on Wednesday hit back particularly hard at the U.S. over its auto content demands, a core sticking point in the NAFTA talks. Washington is proposing that all vehicles made in Canada and Mexico contain 50 per cent U.S. content, on top of boosting the required amount of North American content in NAFTA-zone autos to 85 per cent from 62.5 per cent.
Canada proposed a compromise at talks in Montreal last week that would instead see the method for calculating North American content revamped to include high-tech work, such as software development. The U.S. rejected this approach, arguing it would not do enough to force auto makers to use more car parts manufactured on the continent.
Ms. Freeland said Canada "had a hard time engaging with [the U.S.] directly" on autos. She said Canada's proposals would encourage more high-skilled jobs in North America and include "credits" for auto companies to build or expand production of self-driving vehicles on the continent.
Without naming Mr. Trump, Ms. Freeland also slammed the brand of populism that forms the centre of his political message. "You have this real anxiety of people, and some political leaders in many countries around the world see that anxiety as a political resource," she said. "The easy way to harness it is to point fingers at outsiders.
To say 'It's the fault of that immigrant who speaks a different language and looks different from you,' or 'It's the fault of that bad trade deal and that bad country that's taking advantage of us.'" Ms. Freeland said Wednesday that Canada's strategy is to "find some creative ways that everybody gets a win."
"You can see this negotiation as a zero-sum game: One guy wins, one guy loses. We sincerely think a trade relationship is a win-win. We think a win-win-win is possible - otherwise, why would you trade if it wasn't good for both parties?" she said.
And despite the wide philosophical distance, Ms. Freeland said she would assume the U.S. has "positive intent" and push for a deal, even while preparing at least five contingency plans.
"We believe in preparing for the worst. We prepare for the blizzard," she said.
Ironically, given her remarkably candid comments, Ms. Freeland opened the event by invoking the confidentiality of NAFTA talks. When the event's host, former U.S. treasury secretary Jack Lew, asked how NAFTA talks were going, she replied: "I could tell you, but I would have to kill you."

Abstract: On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?

Full text: Thirty-eight minutes of panic( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/01/13/being-a-mother-in-hawaii-during-38-minutes-of-nuclear-threat-terror/?utm_term=.c342edf3cbd9 ) gripped the tropical paradise of Hawaii Saturday morning when emergency management authorities accidentally triggered an erroneous alert that ballistic missiles were racing toward the archipelago.
Terror has since turned to outrage over the false alarm among residents who legitimately feared their lives were ending. It has cast serious doubt on the credibility of the state's emergency systems. Authorities certainly owe Hawaiians some explanations - and perhaps an apology.
But one thing this fiasco should do, no matter where we live, is cause us to ask: Am I ready if disaster strikes?
The nuclear threat level hasn't been this high since the Cold War era, thanks to the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un. However the fallout from a nuke attack is only one kind of emergency we ought to be prepared for. From earthquakes to ice storms, floods to blizzards, major blackouts to toxic spills, too few of us have the necessary supplies, let alone the knowledge, to react in the case of even a minor crisis.
I include myself in this category. I arrived home with my children on Friday evening to a run-of-the-mill power outage. This incident was more inconvenient than urgent, but we were still bumbling around in the dark using my iPhone to locate candles, matches and a real flashlight.
On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?
How many of us have emergency provisions in our car should a vicious storm leave us stranded, like the one last March that trapped hundreds of motorists on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-happened-on-highway-13-during-the-montreal-snowstorm ) for hours overnight?
How quickly our memories fade. How swiftly cautionary tales are forgotten. We are predisposed to think the next major hurricane, tsunami, mudslide or wildfire will happen to others, never to ourselves.
But potential apocalypse lurks high and low. Garnering many fewer headlines than the Hawaii mayhem - but deserving no less of our attention here in Montreal - is a report issued last week by the Swiss Re Institute on the earthquake threat in Quebec.
The report, Earthquake Risk in Eastern Canada: Mind the Shakes,( http://institute.swissre.com/research/overview/expertise_publication/earthquake_risk_in_eastern_canada_mind_the_shakes.html ) found that though the fault line in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec City corridor is one of the most seismically sensitive in the country, we are woefully unaware - and unprepared. Only a tiny fraction - just 3.4 per cent - are properly insured for a tremor despite the fact 70 per cent of Quebec's population resides in this zone.
"According to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe model, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in the Charlevoix seismic zone near Quebec City could cause private residential property losses of up to $10.6 billion," noted the institute, which does research for the insurance industry. "And a repeat today of the magnitude 5.8 earthquake in the city of Montreal in 1732 would lead to even higher losses, estimated at $45 billion."
These findings echo an earlier, equally alarming, study by the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/ns/resources/studies/air-study ) in 2013 that estimated the total losses from a 7.1 magnitude quake in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec area at a staggering $61 billion. The IBC report pegged the probability of a major convulsion along the eastern Canadian fault line at 5 to 15 per cent in the next 50 years.( http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/EQ_brochure_EN-at-a-glance.pdf )
If so few of us are insured, it stands to reason nowhere near enough of us have taken precautions to increase our chances of surviving the big one.
Do you know the safest place to take cover if the ground starts shaking? How many days' worth of water and food do you have stockpiled? Do you have a manual can-opener or flashlight close at hand? Do you have a prearranged rendezvous point to meet up with your loved ones if you are apart when the earth rattles?
The Quebec public security department( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters.html ) provides tips on what to do in the event of all sorts of situations, including earthquakes.( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters/earthquake.html ) While it's not the role of authorities to stoke unnecessary alarm about impending disaster, surely civil security could do more to urge Quebecers to take stock of their advice ahead of time.
The terrifying 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), which examined the devastating scenarios for the Pacific Northwest if the precarious Cascadia Subduction Zone gives way, helped raise awareness among ordinary citizens about their own readiness levels( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes ).
Perhaps a scare like the one inflicted on Hawaiians, heart-stopping and inexcusable though it was, will have a silver lining. Though the state has been testing air raid sirens recently, many people realized in the throes of the chaos they had no clue what steps to take( https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/selfdecon_wash.asp ) in the event of a missile strike.
Let this be a wake-up call to all of us: expect the unexpected and prepare for the worst - now, before it's too late.

Full text: Don't get me wrong: I love winter. I really do.
I love swishing down the slopes, skating on frozen lakes and tobogganing on Mount Royal. I love catching snowflakes on my tongue and making snow angels, then curling up next to a roaring fire with hot chocolate while a storm rages outside.
I love winter so much my wedding was held in the dead of February. By choice.
But the grimmer parts of winter also get me down sometimes, no matter how hard I try to grin and bear it: waking and returning home in the dark; digging cars out of snowbanks; having to dress small children in multiple layers several times every day.
The last few weeks of wild weather( http://montrealgazette.com/gallery/gallery-wild-weather-grips-montreal ) have made this winter especially difficult to enjoy. From bomb cyclones to polar vortexes, Mother Nature has been throwing everything in her arsenal at us - and the hyperbolic names the meteorologists give to these phenomena only feed our anxieties. Then the headlines stoke our memories of natural disasters past. Has it really been 20 years since the Ice Storm?( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-storm-98-relived )
The last week alone has been enough to induce whiplash.
A week ago we woke up to freshly falling snow, turning Montreal into a winter wonderland.
By Thursday,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ) however, winter at its best had morphed into winter at its most wicked, with freezing rain turning sidewalks treacherously slick before the ice melted into yucky brown sludge. Corner snowbanks receded into glacial puddles that flooded intersections.
Julian Gammom, front, and Nicholas Hurtubise have a long way to go to free their car from the snowbank on de Maisonneuve Blvd. near Girouard Ave. on Sunday.
By Friday, it was 8 C and raining, as if a mercurial artist decided to erase an unsatisfactory canvas. Montreal was at its ugliest and greyest, a lunar landscape of dirty, shrunken icebergs.
Friday night into Saturday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) night, winter returned with a vengeance. Rain turned to freezing rain then to snow. We woke up to a blizzard that dumped a total of 36 cms on the city( http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=51157 ) while the thermometer plummeted to sub-zero.
A bit of déjà vu, perhaps? Or a Bill Murray-esque Groundhog Day?
Feel sorry for the snowplow drivers. No sooner had they wrapped up one operation from last week's precipitation, than they had to start all over again. The tractor that finally arrived Friday morning to scrape the last bits of crust off my street was like a study in futility knowing what was coming.
Urgences Santé practically begged Montrealers to stay home over the weekend. You could almost hear the pleading tone of the statement the paramedics issued on the eve of this latest storm.
Personally, I was only too happy to oblige. At least the timing of this lashing allowed many of us to hunker down and watch the nastiness from indoors.
It offered a delicious moment of hygge, the difficult-to-translate Danish concept of "cozy and comfortable conviviality."( https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy )Known as one of the world's happiest societies, the Danes somehow manage to ward off seasonal affective disorder, a.k.a. the winter blues, with saunas and glogg. Denmark, a Nordic country much like our own, seems to accomplish this by embracing winter's small pleasures head-on.
But I've recently come to the conclusion that there are two preconditions for enjoying winter: being in the country and/or on the weekend.
In the country, you can get outside in the crisp fresh air without having to worry about whether your sidewalk is plowed or where your car is buried or whether the bus will slide down a hill.
Of course, Montreal affords many opportunities for winter fun: I applaud those Verdun parents who built their kids an ice rink in their front yard. I love to see cross-country skiers gliding through parks. Tobogganing on Mount Royal is a blast. But all of that's easier to do on a Saturday.
During the week, winter in the city is hell.
On a Monday morning like this one, I feel exhausted before even leaving the house. Am I going to need an umbrella today or snowshoes? If I lug the little one to daycare on a sled because the sidewalks are impassable for a stroller in the morning, will there be enough snow left to drag her home again later? Will I have to shovel the front stairs again when I get home?
It's only the middle of January and already I'm worn down.
Perhaps the solution is to find ways to bring the fun of winter weekends into workaday life. Why not an urban snow trail, so the hardiest among us can ski or snowshoe to work? Why not turn a street into an ice rink so we can skate around town? It's sometimes slippery enough, anyway. How about building a snowmobile highway leading to the heart of the city?
It's either make winter fun on a day-to-day basis or take our cues from the bears and simply curl up in a ball until spring.

Abstract: Despite inclement weather spanning Friday's daylong downpour( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ), Saturday's dump of up to 30 centimetres of snow and Sunday's expected cold snap( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), not all Montrealers are hunkering down for a quiet weekend. After a large snowfall the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death.

Car buried in snow? On Saturday, the Montreal Children's Hospital issued a safety tip concerning carbon monoxide poisoning and idling cars. "In the past, the Montreal Children's Hospital has seen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after snowfalls and we want to prevent it from happening again. A child should never be left alone in an idling car. Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked. After a large snowfall the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death. Never leave your car running inside the garage even if the garage door is open."

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 until Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over its residents.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow were expected to continue through the night with a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesperson Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.
The Sûreté du Québec is urging Quebec drivers to stay off the roads while snow and blowing snow make driving hazardous. Here, a vehicle went off the road near Hudson on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
At Montreal's Trudeau airport Friday, more than two dozen flights scheduled to leave or arrive were cancelled.
The majority of those flights are to, or from, East Coast destinations like Halifax, Fredericton, New York and Boston.
Flight status can also be checked on the Aéroports de Montréal website, admtl.com( http://www.admtl.com/ ).
Pedestrians get blasted with blowing snow while walking on Rene-Levesque Blvd. in downtown Montreal on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
Meanwhile in the Maritimes, tens of thousands of people woke up in the dark Friday morning after a ferocious storm blasted through Atlantic Canada, flooding coastal roads, battering sailboats and downing trees with hurricane-force winds.
Nova Scotia Power says 125,000 customers were without electricity in an area that stretched from one end of the province to the other after winds gusting to 140 kilometres an hour whipped through the region late Thursday and into Friday.
In New Brunswick, more than 130 outages were affecting 11,000 customers throughout the province that was also hit with heavy snowfall, while P.E.I. was also largely in the dark.

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 till Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over citizens.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow are expected to last until at least 5 p.m. And that's when the temperature starts slipping, to a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesman Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards in Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 till Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over citizens.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow are expected to last until at least 5 p.m. And that's when the temperature starts slipping, to a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesman Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards in Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.

Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
The snow is expected to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday, though the blowing will let up this evening, according to Environment Canada. Saturday has a forecast high of minus-18 Celsius, Sunday minus-13 C, and Monday minus-4 C.

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 until Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over its residents.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow are expected to last until at least 5 p.m. And that's when the temperature starts slipping, to a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesman Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards in Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.

At Montreal's Trudeau airport Friday, a dozen flights scheduled to leave and 18 flights that were scheduled to arrive have been cancelled.
The majority of those flights are to, or from, East Coast destinations like Halifax, Fredericton, New York and Boston.
Thousands of flights were cancelled on Thursday as a "bomb cyclone" hit the northeastern United States and Canada. In New York, airports closed completely on Thursday afternoon.
While flights had resumed on Friday morning, there were still numerous cancellations.
Air Canada is warning customers that high winds may affect flights in and out of Montreal, a condition that's forecast to last until Saturday.
WestJet is advising travellers to check the status of flights to East Coast destinations before they leave for the airport.
Flight status can also be checked on the Aéroports de Montréal website, admtl.com( http://www.admtl.com/ ).
Pedestrians get blasted with blowing snow while walking on Rene-Levesque Blvd. in downtown Montreal Jan. 5, 2018.
Meanwhile in the Maritimes, tens of thousands of people were waking up in the dark Friday morning after a ferocious storm blasted through Atlantic Canada, flooding coastal roads, battering sailboats and downing trees with hurricane-force winds.
Nova Scotia Power says 125,000 customers were without electricity in an area that stretched from one end of the province to the other after winds gusting to 140 kilometres an hour whipped through the region late Thursday and into Friday.
In New Brunswick, more than 130 outages were affecting 11,000 customers throughout the province that was also hit with heavy snowfall, while P.E.I. was also largely in the dark.
The Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Full text: AT A GLANCE Andy Kim's Fourth Annual Christmas Show, benefiting the Starlight Children's Foundation, takes place Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Corona Theatre, 2490 Notre-Dame St. W. Performers include Ron Sexsmith, Hawksley Workman, Platinum Blonde, the Sam Roberts Band, Michel Pagliaro and Danny Michel. Host is Sean Cullen. The show is sold out, but additional tickets may become available for $33, through the venue and via evenko.ca.
Before getting down to pleasantries, Andy Kim has a question: "How is the (bleep)ing weather in Montreal?" Just divine, he is told. Sun is shining. Temperature is close to 20 C. Not a trace of snow on our streets.
"Right!" Kim shoots back over the phone.
Can't fool him. Though he is now based in Toronto, Kim was born here and has spent much of his life here. He knows what kind of arctic havoc can come to this city (and has come to this city in the days since the interview).
But there is a reason behind Kim's question: he will return to his hometown for Andy Kim's Fourth Annual Christmas Show, Saturday at the Corona Theatre.
This year's concert, which benefits the Starlight Children's Foundation, once again features a who's-who of the Canadian music scene: Ron Sexsmith, Hawksley Workman, Platinum Blonde, the Sam Roberts Band, Michel Pagliaro and Danny Michel. Actor/funny fellow Sean Cullen is host.
Kim's concern over the weather relates to the musicians, who will be coming from near and far for this event. As it is, they will all be performing pro bono for the cause, so the last thing they need to contend with is a blizzard - and fortunately, there isn't one in the forecast for this weekend.
It is a measure of the respect these musicians (and others who performed at previous Christmas shows) hold for Kim that they don't hesitate to come on board for the concert. And lest some suspect they might go through the motions on stage, doing seasonal classics, that is hardly the case. They have consistently let loose and kicked butt.
"These concerts are so emotional for me," says Kim, who just did his 13th Christmas show in Toronto. "I'm a huge fan of music. I'm still the kid who grew up in Montreal, who was in awe of musicians back then, and I'm still in awe now.
"When Sam (Roberts) wrote me a note to say he was going to bring his whole band with him, I was totally blown away. I'm excited every year to know that there are artists who I will call and who will graciously show up. I don't know how this generation of musicians comes together with mine, but I'm an extremely lucky and blessed guy, because no one has ever told me they're not into this."
In addition to the artists performing Saturday, Kim has had little trouble persuading the likes of Barenaked Ladies, Martha Wainwright, Broken Social Scene, Feist, the Strumbellas, Patrick Watson, Roch Voisine, Arkells, Tom Wilson and Bobby Bazini for concerts past.
Kim sets an excellent example.
Though his songs have sold over 30 million copies (including his chart-busters Sugar, Sugar and Rock Me Gently), he has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and Canadian Music Hall of Fame and has won all manner of awards, he is considered to be one of the most charitable performers in the country.
"One can't help but be moved and give back when visiting a hospital with sick children or anyone who is suffering. One year we did a show for a little-known children's disease, Sanfilippo syndrome (a severe deterioration of the central nervous system). It is a heartbreaking illness: the child is normal up to the age of six, then everything in their body makes a reversal and they generally don't live past 12 or 13.
"It's all about reaching out to those in need. It's about people, and it's how I grew up in a closely knit family who really cared about the community we lived in as well as others.
"When I call the artists about doing the show, I tell them this is not a career move. I tell them they're not going to sell more records or raise their profile. I've found that artists are always there to help. It's part of their DNA. It's as simple as that."
Kim is the first to acknowledge this is not a career move for him either.
He's not complaining: he still performs sporadically, be it for regular concerts or corporate gigs. His latest disc, It's Decided, was released to solid reviews in 2015. His songs have been covered by the likes of Wilson Pickett, Tom Jones and Bob Marley, and can be heard on the series Ray Donovan and Mindhunter.
"When I'm performing, I still always marvel at the interest people have in my music," Kim says. "I've never taken anything for granted in my life.
"At the same time, I still get so excited listening to the music of others. What I love about these shows is that these are eclectic lineups of musicians who play for eclectic audiences. Someone may come for Michel Pagliaro, but they'll also discover Hawksley Workman. I really don't worry about demographics. It's all about the mix of the music."
It's all about the season, too, for Kim.
"It still remains so special," he reflects. "One of my greatest childhood memories was going to the Jean Talon Market - a block away from where we lived - to get a Christmas tree every year with my mom and kid brother. My mom would carry the bulk of the tree home, including carrying it up three flights of stairs. It was magical.
"It brings me back to times of innocence in Montreal. There is really no place like Montreal - no matter what winter throws at the city. I'll always be a Montreal boy." bbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein

Full text: Only in Quebec could a transport department hold the citizens of its major metropolis captive for years while it complacently goes about its highway reconstruction program with seemingly incompetent remedial measures and no sense of urgency.
At best, its "mitigating alternatives" will serve only to reroute traffic to already heavily congested streets and neighbourhoods.
Remember, this is the same department whose "expertise" over the years has allowed the de la Concorde overpass collapse in Laval, the paralume collapse in the Viger Tunnel of the Ville Marie Expressway and, more recently, the unwanted "free overnight parking" fiasco on Highway 13 during a blizzard.
And yet, the provincial government - regardless of which party is in power - seems content to sit idly by while this seemingly untouchable lumbering beast goes about its business at taxpayers' expense.
Let's be honest: No commercial business would survive for long if it conducted itself with the lethargy, disdain and apathy with which Transport Quebec treats its clients - us.
Clearly, a housecleaning is needed. I wonder if anybody within the government has the temerity to act.

Full text: This story was first published on Nov. 30, 2008, in the Montreal Gazette.
"After sixteen years' faithful service as a fire horse, 'Tom,' a well-known horse of the Verdun fire department, is to be rewarded with a pension of easy work for the balance of his life."
The Gazette, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 1921
Tom was about 20 years old, and was showing his age. He - it seems churlish to refer to so well-loved an animal as "it" - was the oldest still in service with the Verdun fire department, and was no longer up to the rigours of hauling fire wagons pell-mell through the city's streets.
But he was not to be condemned to continued if less hectic toil in the streets of Verdun, much less consigned to the knacker's. By a resolution of Verdun city council, Tom was to be "sent to the corporation yard for use in the yard, with instructions to the employees of the yard to see that the horse is handled carefully and not abused, as this horse ... has proven himself a faithful animal."
Fire horses certainly were held in special regard. Raoul Gauthier, who would become fire chief in Montreal two years later, learned one day that a ladder truck from Station 16 had smashed into a tram. He rushed over to the station, at Rachel St. and Parc La Fontaine Ave. He wanted to know not if any of his men had been injured but if any horses had been. The men could be replaced easily enough, but not the horses.
Fire horses were not necessarily of one special breed, but were a breed apart for all that. They somehow had to combine the power of a heavy draught animal like a Clydesdale with speed approaching a racehorse's. Every year, the Montreal department's horse coper was sent to western Canada to see what he could buy.
Once acquired, the horses were carefully trained before being assigned to one station or another. There, they had their own stalls at the rear of the station. There, when an alarm came in, they stepped from their stalls a few feet and waited while their harnesses were quickly lowered from above and snapped into place. The so-called drop or swinging harness, an ingenious device in use in Montreal since the 1880s, did away with the need to keep the horses harnessed at all times.
Once hitched to their wagons, the horses dashed out of the station. One man held the reins while another clanged the bell as they raced through the streets to the fire. Sparks often could be seen where the horses' iron-shod feet struck the stone pavement.
Blankets were kept under the driver's seat, and if it was winter they would be spread over the horses' backs while the men fought the fire. If the blaze promised to take time to extinguish, the horses might be led to shelter at the nearest fire station.
Indeed, in one way the horses came into their own during the winter months. The fire departments of the various municipalities on Montreal Island began to acquire motorized equipment in the early years of the last century, but it could be problematic in winter. Haphazard snow clearing, especially in side streets or during a blizzard, saw to that. Horse-drawn fire wagons, their wheels replaced with runners, had an easier time getting through.
But as snow clearing and motorized fire trucks became more sophisticated, it was clear that fire horses would no longer be needed. Montreal's last were retired in 1936, at a colourful and indeed moving ceremony presided over by Mayor Camillien Houde.
Some horses, like Verdun's Tom, found retirement easy enough. Others faced long hours of work.
One retired horse found itself employed hauling a milk wagon. One day, after the milkman had got down at a Park Ave. address to make a delivery, one of Montreal's new motorized reels went racing by, its bell clanging loudly. That was all the ex-fire horse needed to hear. Even though it had been facing in the wrong direction, it wheeled about and charged after the excitement. The bemused milkman could only stand and watch as horse and milk wagon alike disappeared from view.
On another occasion, a former fire horse, still employed by the city but in the decidedly unglamorous work of pulling a garbage wagon, found itself a short way from a level crossing. A train was approaching, the engineer ringing its bell. The horse's ears perked up as it responded to the familiar sound. It charged - and was killed when it collided with the locomotive.

Vision care volunteers take flight - all the way to Nunavut

Full text: No fear of flying allowed. It's part of the job description.
For the last 11 years, optometrist Jim Donnelly, optician son Shawn and, a little later down the road, optician son Steffan, have been taking turns flying to Nunavut every three weeks to visit 14 communities and treat people with vision problems.
One optician plus one optometrist selected from a rotating roster spend two weeks in this northernmost territory of Canada for each visit. There's very little down time and a big part of the challenge is embracing the rigours of travelling from community to community in small aircraft commonly used to access isolated areas.
The ride can get bumpy. "We make it clear to optometrists who want to join us. No fear of flying allowed," Shawn Donnelly said.
"To reach the furthest community is an eight-hour flight and we land and take off eight times."
The Donnelly family has run Optique Donnelly in Pointe-Claire for 40 years. Jim Donnelly no longer owns the business, but he continues to practise one day a week to keep his licence active and he continues to travel to Nunavut - on a reduced schedule - to treat patients with diabetic retinopathy.
The 68-year-old spends winters in Florida, which is where a reporter reached him by conference call from Optique Donnelly last week.
"We see as many patients as possible. Non-stop, from morning to night," he said.
Lists of patients are complied by the local CLSCs and an interpreter is available to help when communication breaks down.
All three Donnellys have picked up some Inuktitut over the years.
"When I learn a new word, I'm so proud," Steffan Donnelly said. "And then I fly to the next community and they have their own dialect and don't understand me. The learning process is ongoing."
It was Jim and Shawn Donnelly who made the inaugural trip 11 years ago. The hospital in the region was looking to change its vision care staff and Donnelly was asked if he would consider taking over the responsibility. An optometrist connected to Optique Donnelly had been living and working in the region for a spell and had made solid connections with the population.
"I always wanted to travel and work," Shawn Donnelly said. "But this is more than a travelling gig. We're providing a service that is desperately needed."
The two experienced some resistance at the beginning. It took awhile to gain the patients' trust. Gaining trust was doable. Battling mother nature in the far north remains a no-win situation.
"The weather is our biggest challenge," Jim Donnelly said.
"When a blizzard sets in, there's nothing we can do and we're on a tight schedule. I hate like heck to miss (visiting patients) because of a snowstorm. What we do is not a caprice. It's an essential service. The diabetic population is increasing year to year." (Without proper care, vision loss is a real possibility for people with diabetes.)
"The working conditions can be less than ideal, with cramped examination facilities and bad lighting," Shawn Donnelly said. "And there is always something that breaks. I've become quite resourceful over the years - a bit of a MacGyver. I've fixed problems using a cotton swab. You can't be a princess and do this job. You need to be flexible, self-sufficient, stay calm under pressure and be a problem solver."
The two-member team takes along a stock of eyeglass frames so that patients can select the frames they like. The lens cutting is done in Montreal. Transporting the lens cutting machinery would be prohibitively expensive.
The terrain, the culture, the language and the more languid rhythm of life is completely different to life in Montreal, and over the years, the Donnellys have fallen in love - both with the location and its inhabitants.
"We arrive with our Montrealpace mentality, but we can't impose that pace. We have to adapt to their rhythm," Steffan Donnelly said.
The logistics involved to prepare for the trips are so extensive, they have a full-time employee - Carole Boisvert - whose work focuses only on that.
"She's our lifeline," Shawn Donnelly said.
Donnelly's third son, Kevin, did not enter the family business, but he helps with the marketing and set up the Optique Donnelly website - www.donnellyoptical.com. kgreenaway@postmedia.com

Full text: Has it been a year already? It seems like only yesterday Montreal was mourning the loss of its prodigal son, Leonard Cohen.
If the past 12 months have been a chance for our city to celebrate and commemorate the life of the inimitable singer, songwriter, poet and quintessential gentleman, en famille, on Monday fans will get an opportunity to share that love with the world.
Some very big names can be found amid the international and interdisciplinary roster of talent descending on the Bell Centre for Tower of Song: A Memorial Tribute to Leonard Cohen.
As a primer for the occasion, here's a look through the list of those involved and their connection to Cohen, along with scattered hints as to what songs they might perform:
Hal Willner (producer). Willner produced a 2005 tribute to Cohen at the Sydney Festival titled Came So Far for Beauty. The show featured performances by Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker, Beth Orton, Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Kate & Anna McGarrigle and Cohen's former backup singers Perla Batalla and Julie Christensen.
Sting. The former Police frontman teamed up with Irish music veterans The Chieftains for a swaying, wistful cover of Cohen's 1967 song Sisters of Mercy on the 1995 compilation Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen. Cohen's wistful waltz is rumoured to have been composed in Edmonton during a blizzard, inspired by a pair of hitchhikers he let sleep in his hotel room. "I always figured it was about a convent somewhere," Sting has said of the song. "It's not really about nuns at all. I think it's about a bordello."
Elvis Costello. In a 2009 interview with the Toronto Star, Costello was philosophical about the fact that Cohen had never been a guest on his TV talk show Spectacle. "I remember going to see Leonard Cohen (in concert) and thinking, 'He'll never be on Spectacle because he doesn't need to do it.'" "He need never do another interview for anybody, because (his) show is perfect, the most perfect show I think I've ever seen."
Ron Sexmith. The Canadian singer-songwriter has cited Cohen as a major inspiration. "Everything Leonard does feels so lofty and important to me - what he's saying, the weight of it," Sexsmith told the Music Makers and Soul Shakers podcast in June. Sexsmith has covered Cohen songs including Sisters of Mercy, Heart With No Companion and The Faith. In 2006, he performed So Long Marianne on an outdoor stage in Toronto with Cohen and Steven Page of the Barenaked Ladies.
Lana del Rey. In 2013, the L.A. pop-noir chanteuse covered Cohen's Chelsea Hotel No. 2. Then a few days after Cohen's death, on Nov. 11, 2016, she posted a tribute on Instagram (with an image from her Chelsea Hotel cover), saying, "I'd be lying if I said it didn't kind of break my heart that I never got to tell you how much you changed me. Not that it would've mattered to ya, it's just that other than Bob and Joan you were the only person I ever really felt spoke my language. I love you as a real fan and I always look for a little bit of you in all of my future friends. God bless."
Feist. The Canadian indie-pop queen offered a heartfelt cover of Cohen's Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye at this year's Juno Awards. Alone on acoustic guitar, accompanied by a pair of backup singers, she captured the song's lugubrious wistfulness in all its mystery. She also delivered a spirited cover of Closing Time in Sarah Polley's film Take This Waltz (see Seth Rogen, below).
Seth Rogen. The Canadian actor starred alongside Michelle Williams in Sarah Polley's 2011 relationship drama Take This Waltz, inspired by the Cohen song of the same name.
k.d. lang. There are seemingly endless covers of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, but k.d. lang's performance of the song at the 2005 Junos is tough to beat for its simplicity and soul-baring passion. She had included the song on her 2004 covers album Hymns of the 49th Parallel, and she got to sing it for the man himself in 2006, when Cohen was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. "There's something about the lyrics that transport you into a more meditative state," she told CTV News last year. "To me (it's about) the struggle between having human desire and searching for spiritual wisdom."
Courtney Love. You wouldn't think grunge rock royalty Courtney Love would have much in common with Cohen, but she performed his song Take This Longing at a Hole concert in 2010 and has covered The Future. "I grew up with Leonard Cohen records and going, 'I wish that was me he was writing about,'" she told Rolling Stone's David Fricke, following Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. "I wanted to be Suzanne, I wanted to live down by the river. ... I just wanted to be the girl in the Leonard Cohen song."
Damien Rice posted the song Back to Her Man as "An Homage to Leonard Cohen" on his website, following the singer's death last November. "A few years ago I had the honour of opening up for you in Ireland," he wrote. "After the concert, I noticed something curious. My mother, my sisters, my girlfriend and ex-girlfriend were all dripping with love for you. I found it humorous to imagine that after your show many women would be going back home and that their men were not, and would never quite be, Leonard Cohen."
Philip Glass. The American minimalist composer collaborated with Cohen for Glass's 2007 album Book of Longing, inspired by Cohen's 2006 book of poetry of the same name. Glass's song cycle had its world premiere as a performance at Toronto's Luminato Festival. "For me, this work is both a departure from past work and the fulfilment of an artistic dream," Glass said.
Wesley Schultz and Jeremiah Fraites of the Lumineers. Dig around on YouTube and you'll find a 2013 video of Lumineers lead singer Schultz and Langhorne Slim covering Cohen's Tonight Will Be Fine. In a 2014 Facebook post in honour of Cohen's 80th birthday, Schultz wrote, "I'm in awe of his writing. ... Leonard Cohen is a master of melodies and words."
Ballets Jazz de Montreal. The Montreal dance troupe holds exclusive rights for dance or circus shows based on Cohen's music for the next five years - a controversial deal that has left some other Montreal dance companies in the cold. Inspired by Cohen's repertoire, the Ballets Jazz's show Dance Me is at Theatre Maisonneuve, Dec. 5 to 9.
Patrick Watson. The heavenlyvoiced singer-songwriter joined fellow-Montrealers Li'l Andy and Little Scream in a rendition of Cohen's Democracy in a tribute at the Rialto Theatre in 2013.

What If September Heat Waves Become New Climate Normal?

Full text: Many Montreal parents have been in a panic this week about the conditions in their children's classrooms as the city sweats through a week of sweltering temperatures.
Indeed the heat wave - highs hit 31 C Tuesday, but it felt more like 40 C with the humidex - is extraordinary for late September. We just shattered the record set in the late '60s. And severe heat warnings usually reserved for mid-July are in effect.
But the temperatures themselves aren't really that unusual for, say, late June.
So while there is much concern about whether our children will wilt at their desks a few weeks after going back to school, it's not actually that different from what they normally experience when school is about to let out. (Although not this year, as June was rainy, cool and damp, while July and August were only marginally better.)
Still, there has been tremendous hand-wringing about what precautions schools are taking to help kids beat the heat and keep them hydrated. And there is much consternation in some households about why most schools are not equipped with air conditioning. Some parents in Montreal, as elsewhere in Quebec and Ontario where it's sizzling, have been pulling their kids out of class or keeping them home because of the heat.
Of course, nobody wants their kids to melt or suffer heatstroke. But I don't ever recall this level of frenzy over the dangers of blazing hot classrooms in late springs past - or this level of sympathy for students who attend summer school, for that matter.
Reasonable precautions are certainly being taken: parents being asked to send extra drinks for their children; schools stocking up on bottled water; staff encouraging students to use water fountains to slake their thirst; fans being turned up full blast to circulate the stuffy air; and teachers taking their classes outside for lessons - in the shade, of course. Students are also being encouraged not to overexert themselves at recess and to take breathers during gym class or sports practice.
It can't be that easy for the teachers to handle the torrid temperatures, either. But principals, coaches, staff and after-school program supervisors seem to be doing their best to keep cool and carry on.
Maybe we're so used to dealing with the wind chill that a heat wave in September seems like uncharted territory. It takes a blizzard on the scale of the howler that whipped Montreal March 15 to result in school closures, so accustomed are we to dealing with ice and cold.
Most Montreal schools aren't equipped with air conditioning because we've never typically needed it. Classes usually let up about the time the scorching days of summer arrive. Schools in hot climates like Florida or California might be equipped with AC, but Montreal schools have only ever required heaters.
But if scorchers in September become the new norm under the shifting weather patterns we are experiencing because of climate change, new measures might be called for. If, say, we get to the point where it starts hitting 30 degrees in mid-May and lasting through June, then perhaps Montreal schools will eventually have to be outfitted with air conditioning. Many of our schools, particularly in the core, are old, crumbling and in need of repairs, anyway. We may need to start installing cooling systems as a matter of course when major renovations take place if we are going to make our schools bearable year round in the age of global warming.
The tricky part is that climate change is playing havoc with weather systems, causing more severe storms and making it more difficult to forecast accurately. It's a crapshoot. But if we do start to see summer weather shift more predictably to September, maybe the school calendar will have to be adjusted in turn so that we can take advantage of the most favourable holiday conditions.
Because, to me, the worst part is that our kids are baking in their classrooms when they could be outside swimming, playing and enjoying themselves. I sure wish I were on vacation now rather than back in August when the rain put a damper on many of my plans.
The good news is, the heat wave is supposed to break by Thursday, when temperatures should drop back to seasonal. So we'll just have to chill out for one more day. By Friday, I predict we'll all be getting out our sweaters when the sun goes down and lamenting the end of our belated summer. And by Thanksgiving, we may well be complaining about the arrival of cold and flu season. ahanes@postmedia.com

Oh Summer, Are You Here To Stay?; It's thoughts of sun-kissed days that allow Montrealers to endure long, grey winters

Full text: Summer, is that you? Are you finally here? We've been waiting ever so patiently for you to come, to settle in, to stay a while. It looks as if you may have arrived now. You're a bit late this year. We'd started to worry.
Several times we've thought you'd appeared. There'd be a hot, sunny day - on a weekend, even. But then the clouds would roll in again, the temperature would dip and the skies would open and soak everything.
There have been days when the morning started out nice, only for a thunderstorm to crash through in the afternoon. There have been days that started with showers. We make plans indoors only to have the gloom lift and the sun would peek through by lunchtime. These mixed signals have left us ... confused.
Are you playing coy with us? Because that's just mean.
In a city like Montreal, where winter's icy blast lasts half the year, what gets us through all those blizzards is thoughts of you. Being able to leave the house with bare skin, the feeling of being sun-kissed and a little sweaty, the long days stretching into humid nights - those daydreams sustain us through the months of shovelling and shivering. We really wouldn't be able to handle it if you passed us by this year.
Your all-too-brief passage always leaves us wanting more. But this year, we've just been left wanting.
Oh, I know the experts say there's nothing remarkable about you this year, summer. The average daily high for July so far is 25.3C, according to Environment Canada. There have been only two, slightly off heating-degree days this month - meteorologist-speak for when the mean daily temperature is below 18 C. But somehow it still seems as if you're giving us the cold shoulder. What gives? As for precipitation, we've had 55 mm of rainfall in the first 17 days of July. In 2016, we got 74.2 mm during the entire month. Given that spring was so wet, bringing horrible floods and producing terrible mosquitoes, please, give it a rest. Enough is enough.
Is it something we've said or done? I know humans have been messing with the climate, despite the dire warnings.
That might be throwing you off. It certainly seems as if you've been unpredictable of late. The forecasters have had trouble reading you. There were weeks when they kept saying the sun would come out tomorrow, that you'd be here imminently. Then you'd just not show up.
How rude. But look, no worries. We're willing to let bygones be bygones. There's still time for you to let us bask in your glorious warmth for a while. July is half over, but better late than never.
So the Fete nationale is over. It went OK, weather-wise. Canada Day was a washout - and with the country throwing a 150th birthday bash for itself, too. Ouch. Francofolies and Jazz Fest happened before you fully materialized. But there's still a lot to look forward to.
It is our 375th birthday, after all. We've got lots of great things planned. And we could enjoy the party all the more if you graced us with your presence.
The annual construction holiday is almost upon us. Thousands of us are packing up and getting ready to head off on vacation next week. You could really help those of us sticking close to home to make the most of our time off.
And for those spending the summer in the city, a few rays could really improve our moods. It would feel so good to go for a swim, have drinks on a terrasse, stroll in the Old Port, read in a public square, picnic on Mount Royal, ride our bikes along the Lachine Canal, light up the backyard barbecue, relax in Balconville.
So, please, stick around. We welcome you with open arms, despite the long delay. You can extend your stay for as long as you like. Autumn won't mind. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: Dear Effie,
This letter is to say, come. You shouldn't wait any more. I know it now, and here's how I know it.
All starts a few days ago back in Montreal: so picture me, there I am in a big fancy building, like a train station but empty, and I'm eating cookies - they melt in the mouth from butter - and I'm hugging the tin, it's my last meal till I don't know. It's middle February. I thought Montreal was cold, but I didn't know from cold till - wait, first things first. Mr. Glenn had gave to me the cookies at Christmas, right off the shelf, he said, "Do you like shortbread?" I pictured miniature challa like Bubby used to make with the tail end of the dough, remember? So I said, "Sure, Mr. G, I love short bread." "Merry Christmas," he said and plunked it in front of me where I was standing behind the cash register: a red tin with a picture of a man in a skirt blowing into an octopus, and I said, "Merry back, Mr. G." Then I put it under the counter.
Mr. Glenn is Scottish. He is now out of business, thanks to the Chinese have bought his drug store for "half the tea in China," said Mr. Glenn. I don't know from tea, I know only I'm out of a job now and eating Christian cookies which, Got tsu danken, I have remembered from under the counter before I leave.
So there I am (like I said this is a few days ago, I'm not there now by a long shot) and I'm keeping warm in the fancy building up the street on account of I can't face my landlady, Mrs. Litvak whose solution to all my problems is marry her son. I'm thinking maybe I've run away from her. And I'm thinking, maybe I should run back. Once the blizzard dies down. Such a building this is. When I left Mr. Glenn's, I staggered up St Lawrence Street on my feet like lumps of ice, all the time I was feeling along the fronts of buildings so as not to slip onto the street and get sliced by a tram, every door I tried until I found one that wasn't locked or didn't open onto "PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY." And my luck, I'm suddenly in the Taj Mahal.
Marble staircase, chandeliers, a skylight far above me, I'm dizzy just looking up - but all empty.
On one wall a couple of wickets, closed, with the words "Billets" and "Tickets" in gold overtop, so I figure whether or not there's trains there's bound to be facilities, because now that I'm warm I have to pishn. And you know what's worse than frozen feet?
Thawing feet. Next to the wickets is a big door, so I limp over and try it. All my weight it takes but I push hard enough I half fall through and drop the tin with a clatter, which danken Got, it stays closed and I don't pick it up right away because I am not alone: I want the earth should open and I drop down to Sheol. A big bright roomful of people all turn and stare at me. Ladies and gentlemen seated on chairs in a semicircle around a what-do-you-callit, a stand, where a distinguished looking gentleman has just stopped whatever it was he was saying. On one side of him is a big flag hanging down from the ceiling, it's blue with a white cross and lilies like I've seen before in this part of town, and on the other side of him, a picture of Jesus wearing his thorns - he's looking straight at me, like he knows I've been eating his cookies.
The gentleman at the whatchamacallit smiles, says something to me in French, gesturing like I should take a seat. There's an empty one next to a girl about my age. She has the saddest face I have ever seen outside of the back of my own spoon. What's she got to be sad about, I'm thinking, as I stoop to pick up my cookie tin; nice dress, and those boots with real shearling at the tops, and that's probably her fiancé sitting next to her, a delicate blond yingl, he is. You look at a girl like that and you think, she's got parents who love her. I should know. I hate her. This takes two seconds, so amazing is the human brain.
The gentleman is waiting, I say "Excusez moi, Monsieur, but I'm in the wrong platz, I think."
There is not a sound; these people are high-class. He nods and comes out from around the podium - that's the word. He has neat grey whiskers and nice eyes - I wonder if he has a shop and could use a shopgirl, or even does he need a maid, or a Jewish daughter?
He holds the door open for me, and points up the marble staircase. I smile and nod like I know where I'm going, and walk up a few steps to please him. The heavy door closes behind him with like a polite sigh and I'm about to run back down the stairs and out into the blizzard again when I hear something from up above. A dull roar. A train, after all? I climb the marble steps up to the first marble landing. Another roar. People, a lot of them. A few more steps. Laughter. At the top of the staircase, another big lobby with chandeliers and inlaid patterns on the marble floor. And another big set of doors. What have I got to lose: my job? My family? I open the door a crack: Effie it's like I open onto the sun shining in the middle of the night. It's a theatre with a show going on - I've never been to one, but I've read every newspaper and magazine at Glenn's Drugs and Variety. Up there on the stage are people in robes, purple, yellow, white; they're in an old town square, from the Bible it looks, there's palm trees and a camel (not a real one) and the desert in the background. I'm feeling already warmer. There's music. Familiar. Sad, sad, sad music, it makes me feel so happy. Piano, clarinet, a lullaby sung by a mother... It is not possible, I am dreaming, she is singing...in Yiddish. I'm dead. I died in the blizzard, cut in two by a tram, and my soul has gone to the cold empty place forever because of the Christmas cookies. On the other hand, like I said it's pretty warm in here. And full. Packed with audience, now my eyes have adjusted I see also, Effie, it's not just nice, it's grand. Like an opera house in Warsaw, velvet seats, fancy boxes like little boats, and way over the stage saucy cupids.
All around the ceiling the same blue flowers like on the flag downstairs, and everywhere gold.
Well, you are in Warsaw, Effie, and instead of running back, I've gone further into this krazy kountry, and I want you should come here too. Last year, when I left for Canada I believed just as much as you that you should stay and wait for a message, but Effie, lot of times there's no messenger. And that's the message. I am right now waiting for a train, and I want I should finish this letter and put it in the postbox before I can change my mind for what I'm going to do next, which it is too late for me anyway.
So, there I was, just a couple days ago, standing in the back of the theatre with the audience I'm laughing and crying, because it's water in the desert, Effie, watching those actors up on the stage in their robes like from Moses, showing us how brave and noble and gorgeous we used to be and maybe still are, it gave me such a yearning like I couldn't wait to find someone to rescue! I forget I'm existing until the velvet curtains close and the lights come on, and I'm in a crowd of - for sure, over a thousand - Jews! I'm hearing not a word of English or French even, just Yiddish, and the accents, you would not believe. Effie, they're from everywhere, but you know how when we finally got to Warsaw and we'd run into a Jew from Belz otherwise known as the Middle of Who Cares? But we'd greet each other like long lost family, that's what it felt like in that theatre. There was a man there who looked exactly like Tante Freyda if Tante Freyda were a rabbi. And I saw Mama - okay, but she looked exactly like Mama, okay, enough.
So ya, ya, I know already there's a multitude from our people here in Montreal, but multitude schmultitude; this was a celebration, men, women, children everyone together, even Hasidim, not like at synagogue with us all separate, not like at work, work, work, which is all anyone ever does, except pray, pray, pray, this was a theatre! And guess what?
That girl I saw downstairs? Her father and mother and their friends have built it - this I find out from her later, yes, Frenchies have built this, Catholics to boot, but where do the Jews come in?
From Kiev and Moscow and Minsk and a hundred shtetls no one's ever heard of, okay, okay, to answer the question for really: Jews pay the rent. Effie, we are good tenants, God willing they don't evict us like from everywhere else, but that man downstairs, he knew I was Jewish, and he was nice (I know, I know...).
Where was I?
In the theatre. The Monument National. That's French for the National Monument. (They call it "national" but they mean Quebec which is just a province but they think it should be its own country or at least get more respect, which what is not to understand?) So the lights come on and everyone claps and I let the crowd carry me out to the lobby - I hide the Christian cookies in my coat, and already I'm thinking, "well that was wonderful, but this is Montreal 1896, not Jerusalem from Bible times, and a maydel cannot live by shortbread alone, I need to find a job."
But the crowd doesn't flow down the stairs, instead they fan out, some to the refreshment counter, some to - not a moment to soon - the facilities.
I wait in line, shifting back and forth on wet feet. One by one the stalls empty and one by one the ladies and women and girls, we take our turn, but one stall at the end stays closed; inside, a pair of beautiful boots with shearling tops, which I know because I'm maybe not the only one to wonder what's with the lady stalling in the stall, but I'm the only one to peek.
The last flush, I'm washing my hands, I hear a bell and I figure, the show's starting up again, but do I go? Neyn. I wait, because even more than dancing and singing in the Holy Land, I want to see if I'm right about who's in those boots. Why? you ask. So do I. Answer: Kismet. (I see your eyes rolling from here, Effie, but wait...)
It's her all right. The Katholische Frantsoyzishe from downstairs, her with the fiancé and the, yes, boots that say "somebody loves me." Already I'm turning to go catch the second act, but wait, she's crying. I see this before she shuts the stall door again when she realizes she is not alone after all. I say, "What's the matter?" She says back something in French. I say, "Come again?" She has a little English, I have a little less French.
She comes out of the stall. I offer her a cookie. She eats one.
Then another. All the while talking, all the while eating the cookies. She eats them all. My last meal.
Long story, less long: She is pregnant. It's him, the blond. He should ought to be her fiancé except he suddenly won't marry her on account of he's got a vocation. A what? She explains: he's been called to be a priest. Personally, by God. Supposedly it's a bigger sin for him to ignore this call, than it is for him to have up and left her farshtupft. This, all in the bathroom, meanwhile I'm missing the show, which if I want to come back later I'll have to pay next time.
At first, when she told him she was in the family way he got tickets on the train west along with a "Claim" he bought from out a newspaper advertisement - a little patch of permafrost, just this side of Siberia where they would live miserably ever after. But suddenly he saw the light, and he's joining the seminary tomorrow - what they call the priest school.
So tomorrow she's got to tell her parents that she's in trouble and they'll send her to the nuns.
Where to the nuns? She just repeats "To the Nuns" as if that's a place on a map everybody's heard of. I say, what's to stop him getting on that train himself? She looks shocked like it never crossed her mind - but she reaches inside her dress and comes out with a brown envelope. Fifty dollars! Plus, two train tickets, and - get this - a piece of paper like a school diploma, it's called a Certificate of Claim. She's saying, "He gives me all to show his bonne foi." I'm thinking, "Run, Ruchel!" I can be out the door and hail a taxi before this girl can Hail Mary, I'll cash the tickets, and hop a boat back to Effie. This shtupped-up Catholic has no claim on me, what with us going all the way back to the salon downstairs with the picture of Jesus and the flag of the promised land of Quebec. Her with the nice parents - that was her Papa with the whiskers, and her Maman is going to see to it that women get to vote (and pigs should fly) - so what if she has to put up with a few nuns, what about me? I'm too young to die and go to bed with Shmuel, I'm going back to Warsaw, me and Effie we'll make hats like we always said, and one day an old woman will hobble into our shop and say, "...Effie?...Ruchel?" And we'll say, "Mama, thank God! Where were you?" It takes two seconds in my brain to think, I should rob this Frenchie maydel, but it's two seconds too many because it gives her time to say, "Mademoiselle, why do you not wearing boots?" I say, "I am wearing boots."
"Boots of winter," she says.
"Oh," I say. "You mean my furlined calf skin boots? I must've left them back in Moscow, but you know how things slip your mind when you're getting expelled."
She stares. I say, "My name is Rachel."
She says, "Je m'appéle Adéle.
Then she takes off her beautiful boots and gives them to me -won't take no. Effie, the boots are to the feet what butter is to the mouth.
So on one hand, the shortbread mitzvah is paying off large, but on the other, I can't rob her now.
I wonder, if I give her my littlebit-used hanky, will she give me that tortoiseshell comb in her hair? But the more we talk the more I see she isn't stupid, just rich. She asks from my family and I tell her about you. She asks why you have stayed in Warsaw, and I tell her the reason. I have never told no one else, just her who I have known for five minutes (maybe it's my warm feet have gone to my head.)
It takes us most of the second act, but we make a plan to rescue each other: her from the nuns, me from Mrs. Litvak and by the time we slip back into the theatre to catch the grand finale where Shulamith marries her hero (never mind he jilted her and brought a curse on his kids), Adèle's brown envelope full of freedom is safe in my cookie tin, and she has tucked it inside her fur muff.
Back out on St Lawrence the snow has stopped, the tram slides by, every window a yellow light like a tiny theatre where each passenger is acting in their own story. Everyone has got a story, Effie, right? And so long as even one other person knows that story, it counts. Way overhead you've never seen a blacker sky, or a brighter. It's something about cold; it makes shiny the sky like a black diamond, with stars so sharp they hurt, but it's a good hurt. We walk through the Chinese Quarter where you never see anyone but men, till we get to the train station on Windsor Street - talk about a palace - and I'm ready to stop the kidding around, already I'm bending to give her back her boots and say goodbye because, let's face it, we're oil and...whatever it is can't mix with oil, or maybe I'm vinegar and she's... the other thing; point is, we've had some fun, now it's time for her to go to the nuns and for me to marry Shmuel. At this she looks surprised. She says, mostly in French, but it's easy to catch her drift, that she thought we were going to rescue each other but she'll get on the train without me and I can keep her "maudites bottes." She bangs through the big doors. I follow, running across the (second in one night!) marble floor. "Hey!" I holler, "Gimme back my cookie tin!"
Short story, more short: By the time the train is moving with a cloud of steam and stink like Leviathan moving its bowels, I am one of those faces between the curtains of the windows and my story has taken an unforeseen turn. That's my window, fourth from the end; I'm the one waving. To Adéle.
See, no sooner did she talk me into climbing aboard then she stopped in her tracks. Did she see a ghost? A nun? I looked around, but everywhere just regular people boarding the midnight train to the rest of their lives. It was that she couldn't do it to her mother, to her father - just disappear. "What about your baby?" She patted her stomach, "Je le garde." "They won't let you."
"They don't stop me now."
"Adèle, I thought we were going to rescue each other." "Rachel, we do." She pronounced French my name so it rhymed with hers. She held out her hand, like I should come with her for the rest of my life, but my brain said, if I do that, I'll be like Effie in Warsaw, waiting... I went to open the cookie tin to give her back the envelope but she shook her head. She hugged me. I said, "Merci."
By the time the train comes out of forest and onto prairie two days later I am lonely, a little scared maybe, the prairie is like an ocean, so big this country, but I say, "Ruchel, you crossed an ocean already by yourself, this is just one more ocean." Still, every mile takes me farther from you, Effie, and from Mama... At least my feet are warm in the boots of Adèle, warmer still with dollar bills stuffed round my ankles - but not the Certificate of Claim, that I keep in the red cookie tin.
This certificate I have plenty time to study during two days of forest. Goes something like this: "By the Authority of The Government of The Dominion of Canada and Her Majesty Queen Victoria, the bearer of this Certificate of Claim is hereby granted lawful possession of..." It's for a piece of land way north at a place called Rabbit Creek - some bisel pissle off a big river called Klondike.
Whoever owns this piece of paper owns what they find there, including, gold. Gold, Effie. I figure the red tin has already turned cookies into money, so I put the Claim certificate in there for good luck and hold it on my lap.
Out the window it's still flat like you would not believe and emptier even than Russia; except, turns out it isn't. This I find out, thanks to a church lady who's got five little children with her. They get on in a town with a frozen river and I think, "We're here!" I hop off the train, run into the station. But no. We are in a town called Winnipeg. I hop back on.
They all squish into my compartment, the church lady and the five little kinder. Strange thing: it's middle winter but the lady has a bamboo fan on her wrist, it hangs there, closed, I'm wondering how hot can it get on this prairie in February? These little children you can tell right away they're not hers, black hair cut short, boys and girls both, all in clothes from hard new cotton but with skin coats, fur turned inside. They have darkest eyes like shaynsteh black gems, very tanned-like skin but I don't see a smile and pretty soon I know why: she hits them cross the hand with the fan every time they make a peep in their language - raw their knuckles - except for the oldest, a girl, maybe nine years old, her the lady hits on the ear but the kid never flinches, and it's like she never takes her eyes off my cookie tin either. I want to say, "Sorry, no cookies in here," but I don't want to get mixed up.
Whack. Quarter mile later, whack - you get the picture. I say, "Excuse you me, Ma'am, you maybe shouldn't ought to whack too hard." Church lady smiles, says, "Miss, I can assure you I'm not hurting them, they're from the Reserve." And I wonder, what is this place where children feel no pain? Talk about a promised land. So I ask, the Reserve, is this a province or territory? (I'm up on these things, thanks to I looked at the map in Winnipeg station - which is how I found out also how far Klondike is. Far.)
Turns out it's neither, and there's isn't just one Reserve, there's loads... For Indians. I ask how they got here from India, she says they didn't, and the rest I can't make head or tail but it reminds me: You know how at home there was the Pale of Settlement and it was every year the Czar would shrink the borders where we can live? So I wonder if maybe pogroms will come here too. But she says they're the "the luckiest savages in the world," she's taking them to live at a fancy new school where they'll grow up and get saved. I say "That's wonderful. But maybe probably their parents will miss them?" I was thinking how Mama and, when he was alive, our father, would feel if we have been taken like that; at least you and I got to run from Moscow together, at least Mama knew where we were going. And then I thought how someone must know what happened to her, why don't they at least send word... And I thought how carrying even a bad message is a mitzvah.
Meanwhile the church lady is saying, "They don't have the same family feeling we do." We makes me feel guilty because I must've let her think I'm Christian; until I realize it's maybe enough for her that I'm not an Indian. Whack.
When she falls asleep, I want to say to the oldest one, the girl, "Come with me," and reach my hand, but that would be kidnapping. I close my eyes to stop seeing hers. When I wake up it's still flat outside, and white, the sun is still too bright and the church lady's still snoring. So it can't have been long, but the girl with the eyes is gone, and so is my cookie tin with the Claim inside.
I spring up so fast, church lady snorts awake, I say, "She took my cookies." Church lady pulls herself to her feet, the other little kids act like nothing's happening.
I charge up one way the aisle, church lady not so fast down the other, hanging onto the tops of seats, like on a ship in a storm - the train, it rocks even though the land is flat and almost I fall. I get to the end of the car, there's a door with a small high window, all frost and steam, I scratch clear a patch and see the girl.
She is standing, her back against the next car, holding on tight to the red cookie tin, there is nothing else to hold onto out there. She maybe thought she could get through that next door and hide and eat all the cookies she thinks are inside. I don't know if she can see me, but she's staring straight at the window like she knows she's got to get back inside somehow. But I know from heavy doors. It's one thing to push, it's another to pull when you're on the outside between two moving cars.
I push, it's stuck, I push, it opens, I just about fall, Effie, the tracks, the snow, so loud so fast under my feet, I don't look, I look straight ahead at this girl, what is she made from? I reach out my hand. She holds out the cookie tin with the Scotchman and his musical octopus - he's far from home, no castles out here. I shout, wave my hand to say, "No, give me your hand!" She understands and reaches her free hand, I take it. So. My hip is holding open the door to our carriage, the handle jabbed in my pelvis for safe-keeping. So. She needs to come to me, across the coupling.
However it was she got to the other side, now she has to come back. She takes a step - Effie, it's just a piece of paper, but I had this meshugeh notion I would go up to that new promised land and find gold. I'd go back to Warsaw, you and I would open our hat shop, we'd find Mama - I open and close my other hand, so as to say to the girl, "give me both of yours" because it's the only way. She lets go the red tin, it disappears under the train like it never was. I get both her hands, and now she puts one foot on the coupling and I'm going to pull her, we're going to fall back hard and safe inside. But she looks up, like she sees something over my shoulder. She lets go my hands, turns like to jump back over the coupling but - she's gone. Like she never was.
I can't understand it. My whole lifetime might not be long enough to make enough time for that to have happened. Effie.
I turned around, and it was the church lady behind me.
They don't stop the train. The lady doesn't tell the conductor.
"There is no point inconveniencing the other passengers when there is nothing to be done." She takes from her purse a notebook. "Are you writing to her parents?" "Her people are illiterate, dear." "Who is going to tell them?" My voice sounds strange, like if the frozen window beside me could speak. Lady sighs, makes a mark in the notebook with a pencil. The other children stay perfectly quiet.
When she gets up to go to the facilities I take the notebook from her purse. The children watch me do this. A heading at top of the page says the name of a place. Under it, a column of five numbers. One is crossed out. When I see the door to the facilities opening at the end of the carriage, I put back the notebook.
The children must know something bad has happened because not only does the girl never come back, the lady never has to whack them all the way to the place where they get off and where I am now. Brandon. This is where their school is, but I am not following them there. I am waiting for the train back to Winnipeg, to where they first got on.
Effie, we will open our shop.
But I want it should be not in Warsaw, but on St Lawrence Street in Montreal and we call it, Le Chapeau National. It is time for you to leave Warsaw. Mama is not coming back. I know this now. Come to this big country, Effie. Canada is a whole lot of countries rolled into one, so many stories. Mama is dead.
My train is coming, you can see here from 20 miles. Like a desert, but with snow.
I am going to go find the place written in the lady's notebook where it must be the children came from. When I get there I will look for parents of a girl about nine years old, who are missing her. I will tell them what happened.
The name of the place is Cross Lake. I want you should know this, in case.
Your loving sister, Ruchel
Ann-Marie MacDonald is the author of three novels - Fall On Your Knees, The Way the Crow Flies, and Adult Onset - and several plays, including Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet).
Author's Note: The Monument National is a grand theatre that graces St Laurent Boulevard in Montreal. Owned by the National Theatre School of Canada, it is a rich resource for artists across disciplines. By the time I graduated from NTS in 1980, I had performed many times on the vast stage that Sarah Bernhardt trod before me, and I had put on makeup and wigs in the old dressing rooms under the stage that she was said still to haunt. It was not until the Globe and Mail asked me for a story, however, that I came to understand how powerful a role the Monument National has played in our Canadian story.
It was built by the Association Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal and, located at the great divide between French and English Montreal, intended as a monument to the French Canadian nation; hence its name. But by the time construction was complete and the doors opened in 1893, Montreal had changed. Waves of Jewish immigrants had transformed the quartier, and other groups soon followed. The Association not only took it in stride, they made strides. Via their magnificent Monument, they promoted French Canadian culture, women's rights, played host to students of art and technology, and as a generous landlord, supported Chinese Opera, and North America's most important Yiddish Theatre outside New York. The Monument has been a synagogue, a vaudeville house, a concert hall for the likes of Edith Piaf, and in 1919 the Canadian Jewish Congress was founded there.
In 1993, the 100-year-old Monument National underwent a big renovation. And one night, something interesting happened: the stage collapsed - the vast stage I had "trod." It fell directly onto the dressing rooms below - the dressing rooms where I had painted on a variety of faces. It happened in the wee hours, when no one was there. So no one got hurt.
Thank you, Miss Bernhardt.

Full text: Our fair city has been much in the news over the last few weeks in the U.S. No, not for the unexpected blizzard that left more than 300 cars stranded on Highway 13 for over 12 hours while the powers-that-be were caught unawares. And, no, not for our 375th anniversary celebrations with its granite stumps atop Mount Royal.
Nope. It seems while many have been caught up in the ongoing reality show that is The Donald, others have been tuning into the world of Montreal special-ed teacher Vanessa Grimaldi, 29, who has become the first Canuck ever to win The Bachelor.
Nick Viall, a 36-year-old software-sales exec from Wisconsin, selected Grimaldi over a group of women, including a Floridian who still had a nanny in her 20s. The couple got engaged on the finale episode of the show March 13, when Viall presented Grimaldi with the symbolic last rose.
Grimaldi and Viall have since been making the rounds on the TV talk-show circuit, including visits to the sets of Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Kimmel.
As is usually the case with anything related to reality shows, there has been some skepticism regarding this romance. Some have noted an element of awkwardness in their post-engagement TV appearances.
It's understandable. Talk about a whirlwind affair: the couple met and got hitched over a two-month period. (Although the last episode aired only two weeks ago, it was actually taped in November.) Also, this marked the fourth appearance for lonely heart Viall on a romance show - he had been on The Bachelorette twice as well as on Bachelor in Paradise. Clearly a realitycompetition addict, Viall is also set to do some major strutting on Dancing With the Stars - but with another partner.
All of which has some cynics wondering if the Grimaldi/Viall romance is the real deal, or simply a plot to generate publicity for the series until the two are out of the spotlight and later decide to go their own ways.
So, at the urging of inquiring minds, Grimaldi was tracked down in the wilds of Wisconsin, where she and Viall were touching base with his parents.
"We are currently engaged," Grimaldi stated unequivocally in a phone interview. "We are definitely not being paid (to toe the party line). I guess there is some skepticism because it's been an unusual outcome. Most of the time, people put on a happy face and kind of avoid making (promises).
"But we decided to be honest about it. Things haven't been perfect, but we're very committed and we love each other, and we're taking one step at a time."
By not being perfect, Grimaldi refers to the fact that much of the relationship had been of the long-distance variety. He is based in L.A., while she was here, teaching students with learning disabilities at the Galileo Adult Education Centre in Montreal North.
"We only had the chance to see each other three or four days at a time every two or three weeks (while shooting), and that was tough," she says. "Watching back the episodes (with the other women Viall was dating) wasn't easy, but Nick was very honest with me about the entire process.
"Going into all this, I was very skeptical about the whole process. I had been dating some interesting men over the last couple of years, but there had always been something missing. But with Nick, it was an automatic click. I remember waking up with him in Finland, and we just felt like we had been doing this for a while. No one watching this at home will ever understand how emotionally invested you can get so early on, and that's what happened with me."
True confessions: Grimaldi had never watched a single episode of The Bachelor before going on. A friend had submitted her for consideration, but Grimaldi didn't think someone from these parts would ever be selected.
"I really didn't take the interview for the show that seriously. But once I got the call and found out Nick was The Bachelor - he was the only one I would have gone for - I was into it."
Her tight-knit family, not surprisingly, was quite concerned, all the more so since Grimaldi previously had a long-term relationship that left her devastated when it ended.
Also, the prospect of Grimaldi bolting town has left family members uneasy.
"I'm in the process of figuring out whether I'm moving. I'm in L.A. now, supporting Nick while he's on Dancing With the Stars - and I'm 100 per cent on board with that. But anything is possible. No marriage date has been set yet. We're just enjoying being engaged and getting to know one another better."
Grimaldi is currently setting up a Montreal charity initiative, No Better You, "to empower and raise awareness for special-ed students."
Although on teaching hiatus now, she will be back in Montreal in May to watch her Galileo students perform in a play.
Viall, next to Grimaldi during the interview, gets on the phone and insists he has her back, too: "Vanessa is pretty much the full package for me." bbrownstein@postmedia.com Twitter.com/billbrownstein

Can Quebecers still count on police to serve and protect?; Public confidence in those sworn to uphold the law has taken a big hit in recent weeks

Full text: Let's review the events of last week in Quebec law enforcement, shall we? It began with the prosecutors staying charges against three dozen alleged Mafioso after a six-year investigation because the RCMP didn't want to reveal in court how it intercepted their supposedly encrypted BlackBerry messages.
It ended with the Bureau des enquetes independantes being called in to investigate how 18-year-old Daphne Boudreault was stabbed to death, allegedly while being accompanied by a Mont-St-Hilaire police officer to retrieve her belongings from the home she'd formerly shared with her former boyfriend.
Freed mobsters and police unable to protect women who fear domestic violence - these are events that might leave Quebecers feeling a little uneasy in the best of times. But wait, there's more.
Two weeks ago, the Surete du Quebec failed to respond in a timely manner to 300 motorists trapped on Highway 13 overnight during a blizzard.
Two trucks blocked the highway because of the deep snow starting around 6:30 p.m. the night of March 14 and refused to be towed. The SQ, which is responsible for policing the major Montreal expressway, didn't show up to order the trucks' removal and it didn't activate a plan to evacuate the stranded motorists until 4:30 a.m.
Two senior officers have been placed on desk duty pending an examination of what went wrong.
Meanwhile, the SQ is leading a multi-force investigation of a corruption scandal dogging the Montreal police force. Allegations of warring factions, abusive probes of officers by the internal affairs department, fabricated evidence and intimidation has resulted in the suspension of three senior officers.
A public inquiry will begin soon into revelations both Montreal police and the SQ spied on journalists, failing to give them the ability to protect their sources and imperilling the watchdog function of a free press in a democratic society. But we're still not finished. Add to this a litany of complaints about racial profiling, mainly from black men, including six Montreal police cars being called to issue a $48 ticket to a guy holding an ice cream cone for the terrible crime of daring to look too happy.
And let's not forget another forthcoming public inquiry looking at systemic racism against indigenous people.
This was struck in the bitter aftermath of an examination of allegations First Nations women had been sexually abused by SQ officers in Val D'Or.
A special team of prosecutors determined there were no grounds to lay any charges (although two officers were charged in relation to events in faraway Schefferville decades earlier).
We can't paint all law-enforcement agencies and officers with the same brush.
But we also can't dismiss these disparate cases as isolated incidents. Strung together, this list paints a chilling picture of the state of public security in Quebec.
They involve several major police forces, span Quebec and touch some basic functions. Taken together, these events raise serious questions.
Without being alarmist, chief among them is whether Quebecers can count on police when they most need them.
Certainly there are many dedicated police officers who risk their lives daily to keep Quebecers safe.
These lapses no doubt test the morale of the rank and file. And in no way should they detract from the fine job individual officers are doing.
But something seems to be rotten. Is it poor training? A toxic culture? A leadership vacuum? It's tempting to call for an inquest into what is at the root of all this - except there are probes galore going on: one force looking at another; administrative inquiries by the public security department; and those two commissions that will get the ball rolling shortly. It's hard to keep track of them all. Perhaps what's really needed is one independent expert to review all the findings and make recommendations for long-term reform.
Public trust is eroded each time there incidents like the abovementioned occur.
Confidence in law enforcement is essential to maintain public order. It is also crucial to the integrity of the entire justice system. Until we get some answers, Quebecers have reason to feel insecure about public security.

In Montreal, talk of U.S. president trumps potholes; And that's leading to many sleepless nights and neuroses among some of the masses

Full text: No doubt about it now. A wall will definitely be built along the Mexico-U.S. border, according to some boisterous tipplers at a downtown bar.
Why? The stolen jersey worn by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the team's Super Bowl win over the Atlanta Falcons in February was recovered in the suburban Mexico City home of Mauricio Ortega, an ex-exec with the newspaper chain Organizacion Editorial Mexicana.
So? Connect the dots, grasshopper. Brady is Donald Trump's Golden Boy, and, apparently, the QB is wild about The Donald. So, too, for that matter is enigmatic Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who sent Trump a rather glowing missive prior to the U.S. presidential election.
In the Trumpian universe, this act of jersey larceny committed by a Mexican perp pretty much cements the creation of the wall. The Donald can only be pushed so far.
Save for the occasional interruption induced by unexpected blizzards in March and potholes all the time, Trump chatter pretty much dominates at bars, bar mitzvahs, weddings and family dinners around town.
Certainly, Montrealers have always had an interest in American politics - because it affects us on so many levels - but this obsession here with Trump's foibles has taken on levels of hysteria not seen since the days of Tricky Dicky Nixon and Watergate.
You know something is up when those who had so vilified Dubya are now singing his praises as an up-and-coming artiste.
Super Bowl Sunday festivities used to be relatively civil affairs among the gang of reprobates with whom I regularly eat and drink and lose brain cells. Not this year. Most weren't rooting for a favourite team. Most had no affinity whatsoever for the Atlanta Falcons, but desperately wanted them to win - all because of the Brady/Belichick/Trump connection.
The rage in the room was palpable when the Patriots made a late-game comeback. Tears may have even been shed. It was nuts - although the beer didn't help.
This weekend, my fellow reprobates will be engaging in another traditional TV ritual, checking out the NCAA March Madness basketball tourney.
In years past, the gang would root for long shots or teams with the most Canadians or teams never coached by another Trump diehard, the mercurial Bobby Knight. But this year, one of our group, the Chinatown One (so named, not for being incarcerated for acts of political defiance, but rather for punching out his stationary vehicle while he was in an altered state years ago), is rumoured to be researching the political allegiances of players and coaches from Butler and Baylor.
Before a recent Habs game, conversation among two young couples at a ribs joint adjacent to the Bell Centre had nothing to do with the firing of Michel Therrien or suspect play of defenceman Alexei Emelin. Nah.
One of the women was asking when the game would be over, so that she could rush home to watch CNN coverage of Trump's wiretap charges against Barack Obama and allegations of Russian collusion in the U.S. election. She even fessed up she had become more glued to TV news than to The Bachelor. Shocking.
The two guys were more concerned about Canadian business suffering if Trump were to re-do NAFTA. One also worried that some day the newly elected president might wake up in a particularly truculent mood and "bomb Bulgaria or some other country" for no particular reason.
The two couples also concurred that they have once again become rabid fans of Saturday Night Live, and try to be home for 11:30 in time to catch, perhaps, Alec Baldwin doing Trump or Melissa McCarthy morphing into Sean Spicer.
It's no accident Saturday Night Live is enjoying its best ratings in years - up there with those glory days of John Belushi, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner et al.
No accident, either, that the late-night shmooze shows of Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah and Bill Maher have also become must-see TV. They must all give thanks to The Donald.
But while Trump's actions and tweets are a boon for satire, they are also leading to too many sleepless nights and neuroses among some of the masses. In a recent Op-Ed piece in the Gazette, Montreal psychiatrist Gerald Wiviott coined a name for this condition: Trump Adjustment Syndrome.
Good news: There may be a cure. One of the hotter YouTube videos sweeping the city - and continent - is a faux spot for this affliction: "Do you find yourself feeling depressed, hopeless, suffering from insomnia, panic attacks and irritability, arguing with friends and family, yelling at your computer screen and (having) the constant urge to pull out your hair? If any of these symptoms sound familiar, you may be suffering from T.I.A.D., or Trump-Induced Anxiety Disorder."
According to the ad, there is an antidote: "Impeachara," a pill that will convince you The Donald has already been impeached.
Of course, there are side effects: "Elation and the ability to focus on work and family again."
There's also a warning to Americans: Take it soon, "before you lose your health insurance."

Full text: Hell hath no fury like Quebecers scorned - especially if that criticism is unfair, exaggerated or being levelled by someone perceived as an outsider.
Andrew Potter, the recently appointed director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, learned this lesson the hard way after Maclean's magazine published his piece "How a snowstorm exposed Quebec's real problem: social malaise."
In it, Potter, the former editor of the Ottawa Citizen, surmised that the debacle that stranded more than 300 motorists on Montreal's Highway 13 overnight during last week's snowstorm was in large part due to "a mass breakdown of the social order" and "an absence of solidarity."
If this weren't already asking for trouble, he suggested this transportation blunder occurred because Quebec is the kind of place where restaurants offer two bills, depending on whether a diner is paying with cash or by "a more traceable mechanism;" where garages, contractors, family doctors and ultrasound clinics all "insist on cash"; and where "bank machines routinely dispense fifties by default."
But it got worse: Potter then went on to lament Quebecers' lack of friendship, civic engagement, volunteerism and general sense of trust. Ouch. Besides wondering where the hell Potter eats and banks, Quebecers - francophones, anglophones and allophones alike - justifiably took umbrage. Social media went berserk.
Premier Philippe Couillard called it "a very poor quality article based on prejudices." Opposition leaders echoed those sentiments. Nothing unites the solitudes or the National Assembly like a gratuitous attack.
Potter quickly retracted his main assertions and apologized for insulting Quebecers.
"A political writer's first duty is to reflect his community back to itself," he said in a statement. "Quite obviously, I failed. When people you read and respect tell you they don't recognize their society in your description, it signals a failure of empathy and imagination, and it is time to take a step back." The mea culpa is welcome. But just as it's necessary to get to the bottom of what went wrong on Highway 13 last week, it's worth dissecting what went awry with Potter's column.
The first and most glaring problem is the narrative that the highway imbroglio was a symptom of "an almost pathologically alienated and low-trust society."
On the contrary, reports indicate people stuck on the highway banded together as much as circumstances permitted to weather the blizzard. And the public outcry over the abandonment of those marooned motorists does not display widespread indifference, but rather a strong concern for the well-being of others.
Quebec may lack for many things, but a sense of solidarity is not one of them. No other province has as many protests that bring people to the streets in great number so often, whether it's against a war, for saving the planet, to denounce social programs or to fight tuition hikes. Does the Maple Spring ring a bell? More serious an offence was the trafficking in tired old tropes of Quebecers as reckless, feckless and corrupt. And for an academic of such stature at one of this country's top universities, it also shows a shallow understanding of who Quebecers are and what makes them tick.
If there were any grains of truth in Potter's reflections, his admitted hyperbole undermined his credibility.
It's not that Quebecers can't take criticism.
But too often they get bashed in ways no other Canadians would tolerate were the tables turned - and then dismissed as thin-skinned crybabies.
Past smears include the Vancouver-based writer in the Washington Post maligning Quebecers for being "more racist" after the shooting of six worshippers at a Quebec City mosque, Maclean's previous cover story labelling Quebec "the most corrupt province" and former Globe and Mail journalist Jan Wong's assertion that the 2006 Dawson College shooting was a byproduct of alienation from the "decadeslong linguistic struggle."
Quebec has its faults and its foibles, its cleavages and its contradictions - and Quebecers are the first to admit them. Quebecers love to hold power to account and to assign blame when someone screws up.
But when they feel the criticism is off base, when it targets the whole rather than those who hold responsibility, when it pierces the heart of the collective identity, Quebecers will unfailingly forget what divides them and circle the wagons.

Montreal storm freezes up politics, punditry: In blizzard's wake, two ministers face heated criticism, while a McGill academic seized the opportunity to analyze Quebec at large

Full text: Almost seven days after the last snowflake of a huge winter storm, Montrealers are still sorting out what caused a 300-car, 12-hour traffic jam on a freeway, has a truck driver facing mischief charges, put three civil servants and two provincial ministers in the hot seat and has even rattled the ivory towers of McGill University.
With inquiries under way, Transport Minister Laurent Lessard and Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux emerged Tuesday for what has become a daily flogging by the Quebec press. In the latest session, it was learned the ministers went to bed on storm night believing only 30 people were stranded.
It was still not clear who dropped the other zero.
"There were problems on the ground and in communicating," Mr. Coiteux said. "There was confusion. There was a lack of leadership. We're sorry for the faults in our operations. Our goal is that it never happens again."
Last week, as the Eastern Seaboard of the United States braced for a storm that never came, Montreal was hit with 40 centimetres of snow and strong winds - the biggest blizzard of the season but the kind normally taken in stride in Canadian cities.
On a stretch of Autoroute 13 running through an industrial area between Montréal-Trudeau airport and a rail yard, a snowclearing company in charge of the highway was slow to react to the late-winter storm.
Soon, transport trucks could no longer grip the road, causing an immense traffic jam. Police in cruisers got stuck at the back of the snarl and made repeated calls for help that never came.
Drivers fruitlessly called 911. A few commuters walked out, but 12 hours later, on Wednesday morning, most were still huddled in cars near the heart of Canada's second-biggest city, waiting for a tow.
Around that time, Mr. Lessard strolled toward a meeting - only to be confronted by journalists who had better information than the minister. He soon became irritated and walked away, prompting Premier Philippe Couillard to emerge an hour later to do damage control.
Meanwhile, in Montreal, the fire department finally sent out trucks to rescue the stuck commuters - as well as a bus equipped with a desperately needed toilet.
It's still not clear what happened, but two officers in charge of the sector for the Sûreté du Québec have been placed on desk duty. An official with the Transport Ministry, which owns and operates the highway, has also been relieved of some duties. And on Sunday, a truck driver accused of refusing to let his truck be towed was arrested and told he could face a charge of mischief.
Meanwhile, attempts are under way to get beyond snowfall and bureaucratic bungling to explain what it really means - a type of sociological commentary most commonly practised in, and on, the province of Quebec.
Andrew Potter, the director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, wrote in Maclean's magazine that the crisis was rooted in the social alienation afflicting Quebec. He cited as evidence the Québécois instinct to pay for things such as soup and winter tires under the table and to avoid social interaction, volunteerism and charitable donations on a larger scale than the rest of Canada.
Some of the points are true, but many critics - including the Premier - are not convinced the province is "an almost pathologically alienated and low-trust society" or that incompetent plowing, towing and emergency response constituted a "mass breakdown in social order," as Mr. Potter wrote. In fact, stranded commuters acted in an exemplary fashion, sharing water, snacks and warm vehicles with those running low on fuel.
Mr. Potter was roundly condemned as a Quebec basher in the politico-media echo chamber, which is another style of commentary unique to the province. McGill University took the trouble to distance itself from Mr. Potter. This outraged academics, who jealously guard their freedom to be wrong.
Still, Mr. Potter issued a retraction, admitting to "rhetorical flourishes that went beyond what was warranted." In other words, maybe it was just a big blizzard and another botched snow-clearing job.

Full text: Oh, how Montrealers snickered some 18 years back when former Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman conscripted the Canadian Army to wage war against a most stubborn enemy, Mother Nature. Yup, tanks rolled through the streets of T.O. to deal with the ravages of two heavy snowstorms.
Regardless, chaos was largely averted, and no shots were fired - other than a few errant snowballs. And, far from being shamed, Lastman has since stuck by his decision and said he would do the same all over again.
And, oh, how some Montrealers - this cynic, anyway - snickered last Monday when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency, on the basis of reports that the Big Apple could be inundated with the blizzard of the century and receive up to 60 centimetres of snow. Schools were cancelled for the following day and aboveground train transport was shut down.
CNN had bundled-up reporters stationed in the heart of Central Park, ready to take a weather beating for the greater good.
Alas, somewhere between 10 to 15 centimetres fell in New York, and one CNN reporter claimed the freezing rain was hard on his face and getting into his eyes. Sad. But chaos was averted in New York, as it was in Philadelphia and Boston, whose mayors made similar choices in keeping citizens off the streets last week. Of course, here in Montreal, we never overreact. We're tough. We live to smite the snow. Or we used to. Not so much anymore.
Perhaps we should have overreacted to weather reports, because we were utterly unprepared to deal with what transpired last Tuesday.
CNN may not have reported that Montreal was on the verge of getting hit with the storm of the winter and century, but local weathercasters were aware and were letting inhabitants know.
Apparently, our transport officials and police were on a different frequency, perhaps catching Seinfeld re-runs.
If 300 vehicles had been stranded on New York City's Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive - as was the case on Highway 13 - why CNN top-dog Wolf Blitzer himself would have been parachuted onto the scene to report first-hand and even cease commenting on alleged wiretaps of the Trump Tower or Ivanka's line of shmatas.
It's worth noting that de Blasio had 2,400 sanitation workers and 1,600 snowplows at the ready last Monday to deal with the storm that never really was.
So how is it that after all these years Montreal could be so caught with its long johns down? How is it that a couple of stuck trucks can cripple a major highway for 12 hours? How is it that the cops can't take definitive action? Miraculously, no one perished, but that was due to sheer good fortune and nothing more.
The excuses are classic. Apparently, politicians and transport officials claim they knew nothing about the Highway 13 catastrophe until the following morning.
This highway falls under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, yet Transport Minister Laurent Lessard and Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux admitted to being unaware of the situation. Really? I happened to have been thousands of kilometres out of the country last Tuesday, but thanks to that Internet machine, I was brought instantly up to speed on weather conditions and the parking lot that was Highway 13.
Social media was abuzz with horror stories, and yet our transport minister - and CNN - were out of the loop. Hmmm ... So what about taking this tack the next time we hear about a storm threatening to come our way: have the salt spreaders and snowplows at the start line as the first flakes begin to fly; have the cops out in force to take charge; have the schools cancelled; and, oh yeah, have someone send wake-up calls to our transport and public security ministers.
And so what if they snicker in Toronto or New York about how Montreal has over-reacted to a potential snowstorm. It beats the alternative all to hell. bbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein

Full text: A 73-year-old woman died Friday morning after being struck by a snow-removal vehicle in a St-Michel supermarket parking lot.
According to Montreal police, the woman was walking in the parking lot around 10:40 a.m., near the intersection of Jarry St. and Pie-IX Blvd., when the vehicle struck her.
She was brought to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
The driver, a 48-year-old man, was treated for what police described as a violent nervous shock.
The Montreal police force's collision squad is investigating to determine the cause and circumstances of the death. The incident comes midway through a massive snow-clearing operation following a blizzard that left about 40 cm of snow on Montreal.

Full text: Whoever said getting there is half the fun? Surely few among the 150 passengers on a Grand Trunk train that had left Montreal's Bonaventure Station the evening of March 9, 1869, bound for Toronto.
Among the passengers was Myles Pennington, a Grand Trunk executive. He recorded in his diary that as the train departed, "there seems every prospect of slipping through to Toronto between snow storms." How wrong he was.
Trouble soon began. Snow started falling, and by dawn outside Brockville a blizzard was raging. The going became tougher and, just five kilometres short of Gananoque, the train shuddered to a complete halt.
Snow-clearing was not very efficient in those days. A train might have a kind of plow, like a giant cowcatcher, bolted to the front of the locomotive; but there were no rotary snowblowers, and in any event, locomotives a century and a half ago were far less powerful than today's behemoths.
This meant that, as winter dragged on, packed snow built up immediately to either side of the tracks, sometimes as high as 12 feet. The resulting canyon was ready-made for holding new falls of snow, and left little room for this snow to be pushed aside.
Not long after Pennington's train was stopped, a freight train came up from behind. Its engine was uncoupled and attached to the rear of the passenger train.
"And now commences a hard struggle of pushing behind and hauling in front," Pennington wrote, "and for two hours this is kept up with men all the time plying the shovel to keep the wheels clear. ... The two locomotives puff and scream and their driving wheels fly 'round but no progress is made, and the work is at last abandoned."
The passenger locomotive was then uncoupled from the rest of the train and, by itself, was somehow able to batter its way west, carrying the conductor in search of help. The passengers settled in to wait. There was no dining car, but some found odd bits of food in their bags: a few apples, perhaps, or a sandwich. "One gentleman finds an ancient meat pie, the relics of a lunch provided for a former railway expedition, and, though it looks hard and dry ... still is cut up, divided and pronounced an excellent morsel."
Several intrepid passengers bundled up and struggled through the storm to nearby houses. Thanks to the generosity of these farm families, they were able to return with more provisions. One man even had a jug of hot tea: "How he has kept the tea hot is a puzzle to all on board."
By evening snow was still falling. The passengers did their best to sleep, though some were disturbed by "all kinds of tunes upon the nasal organ" - that is, "the stentorian snore of the next neighbour."
The second morning, the conductor returned by sleigh with a large stock of food. He related how a relief train had been sent out from Kingston but had itself come to grief west of Gananoque. Later that day, however, three locomotives did break through to the stranded train and managed to pull it back to Kingston. "Here the Grand Trunk Company, with great liberality, has provided a free dinner for all the passengers, and full justice is done to it." Were their troubles over? Not yet. In the wee hours the following morning, the passengers were awakened to the news that two locomotives had derailed up ahead, near Grafton, Ont. They all were obliged to disembark and trudge single file through the snow past the derailment to a train waiting on the other side, "meeting ... another similar procession on march to take possession of the cars just vacated by us."
They eventually reached Toronto around 11 that morning. What ordinarily was a 16-hour journey took them fully 62 hours.

Full text: Nobody woke them up.
In the varied lexicon of explanations that have been trotted out over the years to explain a foulup, Quebec's politicians came up with an entirely new one for why they failed to act this week and 300 people were left shivering on Highway 13 Tuesday night in a blizzard.
But history shows if the parliamentary system is unforgiving of ministers who make mistakes - traditionally the buck always stops at the top - it's even more cruel to those who do nothing.
And as the week at the National Assembly wrapped Friday and a winter storm evolved into a political storm, the hallway chatter was about how many days are left before Laurent Lessard gets shuffled out of the transport portfolio.
The dismay in Premier Philippe Couillard's face Thursday, as he was forced to cough up an official apology to Quebecers told the story. Nobody can remember such an act of contrition from a premier in many, many years.
At his side, like two school boys caught smoking in the washroom, were Lessard and Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux, the other minister in the hot seat.
It was hard to size up what was on Couillard's mind. Moments earlier he had stepped into the mix, calling in the government's main firefighter, Florent Gagne, a former head of the Surete du Quebec, to unravel the events. It's being called an external investigation. Was that a Couillard vote of nonconfidence in his men? He described the opposition calls for Lessard and Coiteux's heads as partisan politics but agreed the situation was not normal.
"They (Lessard and Coiteux) were not informed, period," Couillard said. "They woke up in the morning and nobody had called them. It's part of the situation (to be investigated)." Pausing for effect, Couillard referred to what happened as a major "foul-up."
"There is no other word for it," Couillard said.
Today there are still more questions than answers about what happened. How was it that two tractor-trailer drivers were able to refuse towing in the middle of a blizzard and clog up such an important roadway. Why didn't or couldn't the Surete du Quebec force them out? How did 300 people wind up trapped in their cars, in the middle of a big city, with full wireless access? With so much warning about the storm, which dumped 40 centimetres of snow on the island, why was Transport Quebec caught flatfooted? The union representing employees says they were calling for reinforcements but got none.
In the end, it took 10 hours for the highway to be closed to traffic in the crisis, allowing more and more vehicles to pour in. So far, two heads have rolled: Anne-Marie Leclerc, a deputy minister in charge of civil emergencies, and the SQ officer in charge of highway operations.
La Presse reported Friday that Leclerc, a 17-year veteran in the ministry, is in reality the first scapegoat. As was the case for her minister, Montreal's big high-tech Transport Quebec centre, which monitors the roads, never warned her either about the gravity of the situation.
Politically, however, things are very clear. Lessard and Coiteux take the hit.
A Leger-TVA-Journal de Montreal found 83 per cent of Quebecers believe Lessard failed to do his duty, 60 per cent think he should have foreseen the impact and 48 per cent believe he should resign.
Seventy four per cent are dissastified with Coiteux's performance.
Lessard and Coiteux have learned the hard way the perils of not at least appearing to be in charge in a crisis. The man who comes out looking the best is Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre who would have ridden to the rescue on a fire truck if he could have in this election year.
Lessard has discovered something his predecessors have over the last 10 years and that is that the minister does not actually run the ministry. With its "leave the driving to us," philosophy, it's the ministry that runs the minister, telling him or her where to show up to cut the ribbons opening highways.
Lessard's inability to control events reveals the opaque nature of Transport Quebec, often criticized for its "culture of secrecy"; described as a beastly place to work where intimidation tactics and turf wars have been well documented.
One former deputy minister, Dominique Savoie, is on the record as saying she did not take orders from anyone. In one surreal moment this week, the Parti Quebecois and Coalition Avenir Quebec opposition parties took turns heaping praise on the one man who actually tried to clean up the ministry, Liberal MNA and former police officer Robert Poeti.
The Journal de Montreal revealed the bureaucracy is so thick, it takes 94 steps to decide whether something is an emergency.
Yet it's Lessard - who was at home watching the news on television as the crisis unfolded before deciding things were OK and going to bed - who comes across as having fumbled. Coiteux, the opposition reported, was seen dining at the Concorde Hotel restaurant on the Grande Allee as the blizzard roared outside. In both cases, they believed their ministries had things under control.
In the provincial capital, nobody is surprised about Lessard. The former mayor of Thetford Mines, he is not known as a decisive, takecharge kind of guy. The happy-golucky captain on a ship without any officers is how one media outlet described him.
While popular in rural ridings for his folksy style, he has a habit of shooting himself in the foot, too. On Wednesday morning when reporters at the press gallery approached him to ask if he was satisfied with Transport Quebec's response to the storm he snapped back that they were asking their questions too loudly.
A few moments later - after the strategy wonks in the premier's office got wind of the shambles unfolding in the hallway - Couillard himself emerged to express the first snippet of empathy and understanding for victims.
It was great theatre with Couillard waving his personal mobile phone in the air asking how it was that people trapped in their cars did not get any kind of reassurances that help was on the way. It was Couillard to the rescue. Quebec premiers, in fact, have a solid track record when it comes to rising to the occasion in times of crisis. Couillard was praised for his response to the Quebec City mosque shootings in January. Former premier Pauline Marois deftly handled the Lac-Megantic tragedy.
They have learned to never underestimate public opinion - especially when voters turn to the government for help.
History proves they are right to appear caring and in control.
The popular Netflix series The Crown recently re-created the 1952 incident in which a thick pea soup of fog enveloped London and then-prime minister Winston Churchill's initial response was blase.
He paid a price. In the aftermath of the fog it was revealed about 4,000 people had died. Many others suffered long-term breathing problems.
By Friday, with the reality of our storm now clear, the number of storm-related deaths in Quebec stood at six.
And the government's star was tarnished. pauthier@postmedia.com

Full text: Max Pacioretty has a good shot at winning the Maurice Richard Trophy this season as the NHL's top goal-scorer, but he should already win a Good Guy Trophy for what he did on Wednesday.
The Canadiens had a day off Wednesday following a 4-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks at the Bell Centre Tuesday night and after a massive snowstorm dumped more than 40 centimetres on Montreal and the surrounding areas. The snow made driving dangerous - even on suburban side streets on the South Shore. That's where Lawrence Huang lost control of his car Wednesday while out with his girlfriend.
"I had a little accident ... I drove into a snowbank," Huang recalled in a phone interview Thursday night. "I got stuck there for a good 30 minutes trying to shovel the snow out from the side of the car."
While Huang tried to dig his car out of the snowbank, another car stopped and a tall man wearing jeans, a blue jacket and a grey tuque with a pom-pom on top got out and started walking toward him carrying a black-and-yellow shovel. It was Pacioretty.
"A couple of cars had passed by - not five, six or seven cars, it's more like one or two ... some (people) exaggerated the story," Huang said about a story that went viral on social media. "Still, not to take away what Max did."
Turns out Pacioretty is as good with a shovel as he is with a hockey stick. The captain leads the Canadiens with 33 goals and heading into Thursday's games was tied for third in the NHL, three behind leader Brad Marchand of the Boston Bruins and two behind the Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby. The last Canadiens player to lead the NHL in goals at the end of a season was Guy Lafleur when he scored 60 in 1977-78.
After some digging and a helping push from the 6-foot-2, 215-pound Pacioretty, Huang's car was finally out of the snowbank.
Huang said he recognized Pacioretty as soon as the captain started walking toward him with shovel in hand.
"He's really tall," Huang said with a laugh. "He came over and said: 'Do you need any help?' "I've seen him a couple of times before, but I've never had a chance to talk with him because I always wanted to respect his privacy, even though I'm a big fan of his," Huang added. "That was the first time we ever had a little chat. He's a great guy ... an awesome guy." What did they chat about? "The conversation was pretty short," Huang said. "I just told him he was having an incredible season ... a little chit-chat and that was about it. Definitely, he's very nice and very humble. And from our little chat I could tell that he carries himself very well, extremely humble, even though he's one of the top scorers in the league. He doesn't let that change him."
Was Huang surprised one of the most famous people in Montreal would stop to help dig a stranger's car out of a snowbank? "For sure," Huang said. "But I think in any case that was the right thing to do ... it doesn't matter if you're a celebrity or a normal human being. I think anybody in that situation would offer to help ... it just turned out to be Max. He did the right thing and I have to give him thanks for that." Huang didn't ask Pacioretty for an autograph or anything like that after his car got out of the snowbank, but he did get a nice surprise from his girlfriend, who had been in the car with him.
"She was taking pictures of us doing the work," Huang said. "I didn't even know that she took those pictures, but a good thing she did."
Pacioretty posed with Huang for another photo after the work was done - with the pom-pom tuque still on his head and the black-and-yellow shovel in his hand.

Full text: It caused five deaths, stranded hundreds of motorists overnight, shut down schools and universities, flooded basements in Quebec City and dumped 47 centimetres of snow on downtown Montreal. But was this week's storm a recordbreaker? Hard to say, according to Environment Canada.
"It's a rare storm, but I can't say if it broke a record. It was definitely an exceptional storm," said Marie-Eve Giguere, a meteorologist at the Montreal weather office.
Local variations in snowfall, and the fact that snowstorms can stretch over several days, make it difficult to compare weather events from different years, Giguere said.
But one thing is for sure: this week's blizzard ranked up there with the so-called "storm of the century" of March 3-5, 1971.
"It was very similar, except 1971 was just north of the St. Lawrence River," Giguere said.
The 1971 storm unleashed 43 centimetres of snow on Montreal, with high winds, like Tuesday's storm. However, that storm was centred just north of Montreal, while Tuesday's was concentrated in a swath of southern Quebec from Montreal's South Shore to the Bois Francs region near Victoriaville, she said.
The record snowfall in Montreal was Dec. 27, 2012, with 45.6 centimetres.
But weather experts rank storms by their impact rather than just statistics, Giguere said. For example, the 1998 ice storm is remembered for the massive blackout that left millions in the dark for up to several weeks, or more in some cases, paralyzing businesses and causing the government to deploy the army.
This week's storm also "had major impacts," Giguere said, pointing to the fatalities, traffic chaos and closures.
Even within Montreal, there were significant variations in this week's snowfall, with 38 centimetres at Trudeau Airport Tuesday and Wednesday, compared to 47 centimetres downtown, she noted.
Hardest hit was St-Hyacinthe, 60 kilometres east of Montreal, with 75 centimetres of the white stuff, followed by St-Hubert, with 73 centimetres, and Beloeil, with 68.
North of Montreal, Mont Tremblant got just 15 centimetres, while the Lanaudiere region got 10-20 centimetres.
Winds of 70 kilometres an hour in Montreal caused blowing snow and low visibility, making roads hazardous.
In the Lower St. Lawrence region, east of Quebec City, winds reached 120 kilometres an hour, although snowfall was less than 30 centimetres, Giguere said.
With temperatures returning to near normal in the next week, when daytime highs will hover near zero, we won't be seeing green lawns again anytime soon, she said. mscott@postmedia.com twitter.com: JMarianScott BY THE NUMBERS 45.6 cm - The snowiest day in Montreal on record was Dec. 27, 2012, when a record amount fell on the city.
42.8 cm - The amount of snow at Dorval in the "storm of the century" on March 4, 1971.
38 cm - Total accumulation on March 14-15 in Dorval 43 cm -Total accumulation on March 14-15 downtown.

Full text: As Montreal surrendered to a March blizzard, some hardy souls braved the elements to raise funds for the city's homeless.
Volunteers couldn't have picked a better - or worse - time than this week to raise awareness about the challenges faced by those who eat and sleep with one eye open on the streets.
Started at the University of Alberta in 2005 and now observed at more than 20 universities across Canada, Montreal's 5 Days for the Homeless ends on Friday.
Some volunteers spend one night on the street, while others - like Seymour Ward - jump in for the long haul.
Ward signed up for a Mondayto-Friday shift, even if the howling winds that whipped past the corner of Mackay St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., where she and a few others hunkered down under blankets, made it feel like minus 18 C.
"It's wind burn," she cheerfully said of her apple-red cheeks.
Toughing it out in frigid weather gives volunteers street cred, and Ward said the public's response to the initiative has been positive.
"Usually we get a good response, especially when the weather is like this," the Concordia University finance grad explained.
Money was being collected in plastic bottles from passersby outside the university's Hall Building, and all funds will be donated to local organizations and shelters that help the homeless, including Dans La Rue and Chez Doris.
Ward was well-prepared for the harsh weather, donning six layers of clothing under her army-grade coat.
"It's really about keeping your hands and feet warm and dry," she offered as advice. Ward became involved in the initiative seven years ago through her friendship with Josh Redler, a Concordia student at the time, who kick-started the movement here in 2008.
"What this does, as Josh likes to say, is this turns sympathy into empathy," Ward said.
"So you actually really have an idea what (the homeless) go through."
Ward enjoys getting to know local homeless people, whom she says seem to approve of the initiative.
"They're very supportive. In the years I've done it, I've never had a negative reaction," she said.
Ward was joined by Elias Lolei, another former Concordia student who first got involved some five years ago.
"My plan was to come during the day, just for that day, then go back home," he said.
"But when I saw the energy and how passionate people were, I bought a sleeping bag and that was it."
While eating and sleeping outdoors helps create awareness about homelessness, Lolei said, days are much lonelier than nights on the street.
"It's lonely when there are a million people around you and they ignore you. That's the hardest part - being ignored."
Cecile Arbaud, executive director for Dans La Rue, said the organization is grateful for the support of 5 Days for the Homeless Montreal.
"We're always touched when young people choose to give back in support of other young people who are living a very different reality," Arbaud said.
A homeless man who was panhandling during the storm said he was grateful for the support.
"It's a good idea. It helps," he said. "But to stay warm, you have to keep moving." jmeagher@postmedia.com

Quebec launches storm inquiry; Motorists who were stranded on Highway 13 launch class-action suit

Full text: With opposition calls for heads to roll and angry victims launching a class-action suit, Premier Philippe Couillard has launched an inquiry into how 300 motorists ended up stranded overnight Tuesday on Highway 13 during a blizzard.
And Couillard has formally apologized to people who were traumatized or injured as a result.
"I wasn't happy yesterday," Couillard said Thursday at a news conference. "I am less happy today because I see the shortcomings in how people should have worked together.
"Faced with such a foul-up, and there is no other word for it, I want to apologize to people who were left feeling insecure, injured and to the families of victims. Yes, we were faced with an exceptional situation, but the response did not reflect it."
The apology, a rare event from a head of government, comes as the Couillard's team tries to douse the political fire over Transport Quebec's handling of the blizzard.
But the crisis only grew hours later when lawyers representing trapped motorists fired a missile at the government, announcing they are launching a class-action suit against the government on behalf of 500 persons they say were affected.
Represented by Deveau et Trudel, Johnston & L'Esperance, the lawyers announced they will seek $2,000 for each person trapped for hours in their cars.
In their legal brief, filed in Superior Court Thursday, they argue those trapped "were prisoners in their vehicles for hours and hours, in cold weather, and with limited, if non-existent, information."
They all suffered "discomfort, stress and anxiety."
The move came despite Couillard's reassuring announcement that he has named a former deputy minister of transport, Florent Gagne, as head of a formal external inquiry into the events.
Gagne's mandate is two-fold: establish the chain of events and evaluate the level of coordination of all the actors.
His report will be made public with possible discussions before a committee of the legislature, Couillard indicated.
And in the meantime, the two ministers in the hot seat, Transport Minister Laurent Lessard and Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux were in full damage control Thursday as the extent of the foul ups under their watch come to light. Lessard, who has been accused by the opposition of dozing as motorists were freezing, acted first, announcing he has suspended his deputy-minister for civil protection in Quebec, Anne-Marie Leclerc.
In theory Leclerc should have been the person to hit the red alert button that would, among other things, have brought in more troops to help clear the road and co-ordinate a rescue mission on the highway, which is under provincial control.
Standing beside Couillard at a news conference, Lessard continued to argue he was never informed of the magnitude of the event. He said he was home watching the news like everyone Tuesday evening with the understanding his ministry had things in hand.
Both Lessard and Coiteux said they were not informed of the magnitude of the problem until the morning after.
ENOUGH RED FLAGS But Lessard said what is clear now is that as of 10 p.m. Tuesday there were enough red flags on the field to spark a civil protection operation designed to rescue people and not just "clear the snow."
That explains Leclerc's suspension.
"At the ministry of transport, they don't usually apologize but, for the first time, we are going to apologize to the population affected because they were prisoners (in their cars) for a long period when they were entitled to better treatment," Lessard said.
Lessard said Quebec will also look into how to cancel the subcontract with the private company responsible for snow clearing, Roxboro Excavation.
Coiteux said if there are people in government or the police who didn't do their job, there would be sanctions. As it is, the more he learns about what happened inside the government machine, the more disappointed he is.
"I will not defend the indefensible," Coiteux said. "This was not acceptable."
At about the same time as he was speaking, Surete du Quebec spokesperson Guy Lapointe announced in Montreal that the official in charge of the operations on Highway 13 has been relieved of his duties.
The provincial police force has launched its own inquiry into the Highway 13 debacle, Lapointe said. He would not provide a chronology of what happened that night because of the provincial government investigation.
But we know hundreds of 911 calls came in over the evening.
Coiteux said he wants to know why the SQ let so much time go by before contacting Montreal's firefighters for an evacuation of the trapped people once it became clear Transport Quebec could not clear the road or remove the tractor-trailer trucks that sparked the jam at around 6 p.m. as Montrealers were headed home in the blizzard.
On Thursday, Coderre said he still doesn't understand why the transport ministry didn't tell city officials earlier that hundreds of people needed to be rescued from the highway.
A request for the city of Montreal to help with the rescue came only at 3:39 a.m. Wednesday, Coderre said. At that point people had been stranded for hours.
Coderre said that in a civil-security operation, different levels of government have different roles. Montreal, he said, fulfilled its responsibilities by sending firefighters in. The stupefication was generalized. Parti Quebecois public security critic Pascal Berube noted that while Transport Quebec surveillance cameras were sufficiently monitored for the ministry to post an image of a snowy owl that went viral on the Internet "are we not able to see what's happening on the highways? There are cameras everywhere."
Earlier, both PQ Leader Jean-Francois Lisee and Coalition Avenir Quebec Leader Francois Legault held news conferences calling for Lessard's head.
HEAT KEPT ON TRANSPORT MINISTER They did not let up during the morning question period - keeping the heat mainly on Lessard who, in the heat of the moment Wednesday, snapped at reporters pestering him with questions.
"The hour is grave," PQ transport critic Alain Therrien fired across the floor.
"This minister was twiddling his thumbs. He won't even say where he was that evening. We know where he was. He was in bed."
Lessard has insisted the mess was not due to a lack of employees on duty.
There were enough, he said, but they were not deployed correctly.
But the union representing Transport Quebec workers, the Syndicat de la fonction publique du Quebec (SFPQ), said the ministry did not add troops to the workforce despite repeated warnings of the pending storm.
SFPQ president Christian Daigle told reporters Thursday there were four or five Transport Quebec patrollers on the scene and they advised their superiors as early at 8 p.m. that trouble was looming.
They specifically asked for reinforcements to help shut down access roads to the highway. pauthier@postmedia.com

Full text: "Milk," she said, before collapsing into a snowbank.
It was supposed to be a jaunt to the store but in the midst of a blizzard that paralyzed sections of the city Wednesday, the errand escalated into a Homeric quest across Pointe-St-Charles.
The woman poked her cane into the snow and limped along Liverpool St. before finally giving up. She was swaddled in a parka and headscarf, just a few metres from Depanneur Chez Bert when she hunched over to catch her breath.
"Milk. I need a bag of milk, please," she told a passerby. "Can't go any further."
"Two per cent or whole?" the man replied.
"Two per cent," she said, extending a $5 bill to the stranger.
He stepped into the building and promptly returned with a four-litre bag of milk. She thanked him, rebuffed his offer to walk her home, picked up her cane and trudged back toward the windy street corner.
Outside the city centre - where high winds and snow stranded hundreds of commuters along the highway overnight - the storm brought life to a halt. Entire school boards cancelled classes Wednesday, hundreds of flights were grounded and many workplaces told their employees to stay home rather than brave the elements.
But in and around downtown, the weather appeared much less disruptive. It even seemed to bring out the best in its residents.
At Lafontaine Park, dozens of children relished a rare weekday without school. "Watch me, mom, watch me!" one girl screamed, before jumping onto a plastic saucer and gliding down the hill. Her ride stopped just short of the frozen pond near Rachel St.
"Usually, you only find out about school being closed the morning of and it kind of throws your whole day off," said Julie Robert, who took her daughter to the park Wednesday morning. "But we knew about this ahead of time. So we turned our alarm clocks off and just took our time this morning."
Robert sent a series of text messages to her fellow parents in the Plateau and they all met at the top of the hill - carrying toboggans, snowsuits and a rowdy brood.
"At every street corner you had people joining our little convoy," Robert said. "In the last five years our kids have gone to this school, we've never seen anything like this. If you don't have to shovel out your car, it's really cool, it's an adventure for the kids."
Just south of downtown in Pointe-St-Charles, Ludovic Ratelle frantically cleared a path around his car. Ratelle is on holiday this week but he had one very important job on Wednesday morning.
Because his wife is 39 weeks pregnant - and due at any moment - he had to keep the vehicle on standby outside her parents' home on Mullins St. Ordinarily, Ratelle would be working on a snowplow team for the city of Montreal but today his responsibilities have been narrowed down.
"The timing of this storm isn't great, I must admit," said Ratelle, as he flashed a nervous smile. "We live off-island but we're delivering in Lasalle. We're staying with the in-laws while we wait for the baby to come. So for now my job is to be prepared, shovel out our car, the father-in-law's car and the brother-in-law's car. It's a good day to be off work."
A few blocks south of Ratelle, in a laneway off Paris St., one man furiously blazed a trail into the white mass. He wielded a rusty snowblower, alternately pulling and pushing its handles as though he were breaking in a wild horse.
For a few minutes, he was completely absorbed in the task of clearing a path for his neighbours' vehicles. He stopped only to wipe the frost from his beard and wave to a pedestrian.
"This is perfect, I get to spend the morning outside, breathing that cool winter air," he said, as the machine kicked up a small cloud of exhaust fumes. "I never get to use this baby anymore, I'm like a kid on a day like today."
On nearby Charlevoix St., a column of tractors and snowplows rode the bridge across the Lachine Canal and into St-Henri. Maggie Collis and her dog Brannagh stood by the water, watching the armoured vehicles roll by.
She says she can't remember where she parked her car.
"It's buried somewhere on the side of the street, I'll find it," she said, laughing. "I feel bad for the plow guys, though, they just keep passing and passing and it just keeps snowing.
"Some people hate this but I love winter. When it's sunny and the light reflects off the snow, you can't beat that. Same with the night sky, it's so clear this time of year, it's like being in the country. You can actually see constellations."
While Collis walked back toward Charlevoix St., Brannagh alternated between hopping above the snow and rubbing her face into it.
For Marie, who lives in a social housing unit in Little Burgundy, the storm did little to test her piety. The elderly woman rose early, bundled up and limped across the frosty sidewalks to attend 9 a.m. mass at the Saint-Irenee de Lyon church on Atwater Ave.
"I prayed for those who could not pray this morning," said Marie, who did not want her last name published. "I didn't pray about the weather, there are more important things to worry about in this world than a little snow." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text: In March 1971, a blizzard dumped 43 centimetres of snow on Montreal in a single day, the equivalent of 500,000 truckloads. Powerful winds downed power lines; sectors of the island were without electricity for as long as 10 days. A Habs home game was even cancelled, something that hadn't happened since the influenza epidemic of 1918. In Quebec, it was referred to as the Snowstorm of the Century.
Then, shortly after New Year's Day in 1998, we were struck by an even larger meteorological catastrophe. The "North American Ice Storm" claimed 35 lives and caused $5 billion+ of damage.
Weather is one of the most common themes in my Montreal Gazette cartoons, after political subject matter. These cartoons provoke passionate reactions from readers. Because Montreal can be a town of extremes, including temperatures, many of the city's activities are determined by weather cycles.
Nevertheless, Montrealers take some pride in being able to handle these extremes as well as, or even better than, any other city. After dealing with the January '98 Ice Storm, Montrealers were absolutely gleeful the following year when Toronto's mayor Mel Lastman called in the army to do battle with a mere metre of snow! In contrast to the severe temperatures of January and February, June and July are probably Montreal's best months. August is a time to rest up, preferably by some lake or even the ocean. In September, the most industrious of months, we all get busy with a lot more work and less play. In October, we forgive the slight cooling in the air because of the stupendous autumn colours - and the return of hockey. And then, is it any wonder that we hold the aptly named Grey Cup in November, the last major Canadian outdoor sporting event before winter hibernation? Of all the cartoons I've drawn on the subject of weather for The Gazette, this is the one readers seem to recall the most. Let me tell you why I drew it: It was for those mornings - perhaps a dozen between November and March - when I would look out the window and just couldn't deal with the idea of digging out my car again. I thought that I might simply phone my editors and say: "Reprint the battery cartoon, will you?" But they were never there. They were always late, digging out their own damn cars! So, what else to do but get on with it - shovel myself out, go to work, and draw another cartoon ...
On April 5, Terry Mosher's new book will be published. From Trudeau to Trudeau: Fifty Years of Aislin Cartoons has an introduction by Bob Rae. Also, Montreal's McCord Museum will present an Aislin retrospective from April 7 to Aug. 13.

Derek Seguin'S Roaring 40S; Montreal comic is finally getting the respect he deserves, celebrates with a new recording

Author: Brownstein, Bill

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/derek-seguins-roaring-40s-montreal-comic-is/docview/1875762425/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: At Toronto's JFL42 in 2015, Seguin took on seven other highly rated standups and won SiriusXM's Top Comic competition for Canada, which came with a $15,000 cash prize as well as a TV spot at the 2016 Just for Laughs fest here and a one-man show at the 2016 edition of JFL42. The title of Newfie Octopus, which came out in 2013, refers to his rollicking romance with his current mate, who does hail from Newfoundland but has only the regulation number of appendages. [...]Seguin, with his tour manager, is four-walling this tour - financially underwriting everything from promotion to renting the venues. Seguin says his self-awareness in dealing with aging, relationships and kids has helped him strike a chord with audiences. There's a lot of gross stuff on my body that I share with audiences, and they are able to relate to it and, most importantly, to laugh at it, too." [...]I was very free to do whatever the hell I wanted.

Full text: On his latest disc, 43.0 - Warning: May Contain Nuts, Derek Seguin does his fair share of hysterical protesting about dealing with life in his 40s. But the fact remains that since turning 40, the Montreal comic's professional life has turned around dramatically.
After plying his trade for nearly 15 years, Seguin is now getting the respect he deserves, both at home and around the country. He is, without question, one of the most successful and indemand wits in the land - not to mention one of the funniest.
At Toronto's JFL42 in 2015, Seguin took on seven other highly rated standups and won SiriusXM's Top Comic competition for Canada, which came with a $15,000 cash prize as well as a TV spot at the 2016 Just for Laughs fest here and a one-man show at the 2016 edition of JFL42.
A regular on CBC Radio's The Debaters, Seguin has long been a crowd favourite, but his luck really began to change four years ago. That's when he stole the show at a Just for Laughs gala with his mating rituals. In 2014, he brought the house down repeatedly at the fest's Nasty Show series, wherein he vividly recounted the joys of the birthing process.
Half francophone, half Irish anglo, he brings both elements into play with material reflecting his roots, delivered bilingually - but hardly in a politically correct manner.
Seguin officially launches 43.0 this week at his favourite stomping ground, the Comedy Nest, before beginning a tour of Eastern Canada.
"I'm actually 44 now," Seguin says while hanging out at the Nest. "It shows how long it takes to put together an album and get it out there."
This is Seguin's second disc. The title of Newfie Octopus, which came out in 2013, refers to his rollicking romance with his current mate, who does hail from Newfoundland but has only the regulation number of appendages.
Seguin takes it to another gut-splitting level on 43.0. He does some classic ranting about everything from Santa Claus's slave labour force to taking in Disney World with his three kids. He has a field day with allergies to nuts, gluten and eggs. "How can you be allergic to eggs?" he asks his daughter. "You were one seven years ago!" And don't talk to Seguin about school bake sales, given the obstacles posed by the aforementioned allergies and his inability to make a kiwi cake. And don't talk to him about lengthy summer school breaks, either: "I really need my kids to go back to school soon, so I can love them again."
Seguin decided to cut this disc due to popular demand.
"Apparently, some people, if they like the show, like to walk away with a little thing in their hands that they can touch and then listen to," he explains. "This way I can raise a little bit of extra money for myself, and I can share one-third of profits with various charities" - among them, the Gord Downie Fund and AMI-Quebec.
After his Comedy Nest gigs, Seguin takes his act on the road for the first leg of his tour: 10 stops through New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Ontario.
"If I don't lose my shirt and don't end up working at McDonald's or having to sell pressurewashing vinyl-siding equipment as I once did - and not very well, at that - I'll do a second leg through Quebec, other parts of Ontario and Western Canada," he says.
"I'm very, very scared, because I have to pay for everything. Before this, all I had to do was answer my phone, show up to the club, talk ... and go home with money. Now I have to send deposits to theatres, pay designers, print posters, set up websites, do the social media and rent the theatres."
In short, Seguin, with his tour manager, is four-walling this tour - financially underwriting everything from promotion to renting the venues. This has become a common practice among entertainers on this continent. Indeed, Sugar Sammy has followed this formula, and the dividends have been impressive.
"I just pray there won't be any blizzards in Moncton, where only three people - who happen to live in the theatre - show up," Seguin cracks. "But the good news is that I appear to be hitting my stride - just before I retire and get my senior's pension.
"Really, though, I do feel so lucky that comedy is my job and that I can make a living from it, despite the stress related to this tour. I've never worked more, and the paydays have never been as good."
His post-tour dance card is filling fast. He has been booked to do the Halifax and Winnipeg comedy festivals, and JFL will doubtless come calling as well.
Seguin says his self-awareness in dealing with aging, relationships and kids has helped him strike a chord with audiences.
"Now I look in the mirror and I'm shocked: How did I let myself go? What the hell has happened to me? When did this hair grow on my back? There's a lot of gross stuff on my body that I share with audiences, and they are able to relate to it and, most importantly, to laugh at it, too." But age begets wisdom as well. "The reality is that the older I get, the harder I try. Audiences are familiar with my material, so I have to come up with new stuff all the time. I can't phone it in. And I can guarantee if someone were to come see me three days in a row, not (two) of those shows would be the same.
"Five years ago, I was really a nobody. And nobody really cared about my act. As a result, I was very free to do whatever the hell I wanted. But now I have the pressure of my recent past success, and I so desperately want everyone to have even more fun than the last time they saw me. That's really stressful, but that's what this business is all about if you want to stay on top." bbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein

Full text: It can take days for Montreal to dig out from a blizzard.
While inner-city streets often become clogged after a major snowfall, most suburban roads are cleared relatively quickly.
With less traffic and fewer vehicles parked on West Island streets, snow plows can clear the streets quickly compared to city boroughs like Plateau-Mont-Royal and Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Damede-Grace.
As of Feb. 15, 171 centimetres of snow had fallen on Montreal, eclipsing last year's winter total of 169 cm.
Snow clearing and removal efforts have tested municipalities across the island, but some are more effective than others.
The city of Pointe-Claire uses teams of both private and public workers to clear its streets and sidewalks.
"To ensure effective snow removal throughout our territory, we have a private contractor serving the industrial sector, while our employees clear snow in the residential sector," said city spokesperson Marie-Pier Paquette-Seguin.
"This means that operations can be carried out simultaneously and performances can easily be compared."
Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle said snow clearing is one of the "major services" it provides to local citizens.
"I must admit though, it is simpler (here) than in Montreal because we have a no-parking law in the winter for overnight. So when there is a storm we start working around midnight, between midnight and 2 a.m. depending on the storm, and we can rapidly go through our city."
He said the municipality deploys about eight to 10 trucks to clear snow from approximately 125 kilometres of roads and another 30 km of sidewalks.
Bourelle said towing parked cars is not a common occurrence in Beaconsfield. "If we have to, we'll have it towed, but it's not a major problem for us."
Bourelle said his city has had to use heavy graters this winter because of icy conditions.
"All of us are facing a new reality because of climate change," he said.
"There is a lot more rain and freezing rain, mixed with snow. I don't need to tell you it makes for very icy streets. And on some streets you end up with a layer of ice and we've had to use graters to remove the ice, which makes it more challenging."
By mid-February, Bourelle said Beaconsfield's crews had already spread as much salt on its roads and sidewalks as all of last winter. "We're over 1,500 tonnes now," he said. "That's about the limit we would normally use for the whole winter."
Andrew Duffield, head of public works for Beaconsfield, said the city has a "White Road Policy," which calls for a strategic use of abrasives.
"It means we prioritize the road conditions on our arteries and collectors, hills, curves and sidewalks by spreading salt and abrasives as required. And on our secondary and tertiary roads we apply salt and abrasives at the stop signs but not through out the length of the street," Duffield said.
"This allows us to greatly reduce the amount of salt we use, and the impact on the environment. In the event, of an ice storm like we experienced over the holidays, we apply salt and abrasives throughout our entire road network."
Bourelle said Beaconsfield residents have come to expect effective snow clearing.
"We have very demanding residents so we have to be very good at it. Otherwise we'll hear about it from our citizens," he said with a laugh. jmeagher@postmedia.com

With MLS numbers rivalling the CFL, Canadian soccer is entering a new era

Full text: The MLS is now sporting numbers that rival the CFL, and should press that popularity even further before it lapses
? We live in ahistorical times. Thankfully there is photographic proof of the golden age.
It was 1979, and the downtown of a major Canadian city was choked with fans celebrating the Vancouver Whitecaps' North American Soccer League triumph in the now-defunct Soccer Bowl.
"Five years before, we were playing in front of friends and family, then it was Giants Stadium and 100,000 people in the streets," said Bob Lenarduzzi, a Canadian soccer great who played in that 2-1 triumph over the Tampa Bay Rowdies.
They were heady times for the beautiful game in North America, Pele and Franz Beckenbauer were winding down their careers with the New York Cosmos. The Toronto Blizzard and the Montreal Manic were filling stadiums.
Everything was great, until suddenly it wasn't.
"Five years later, we were done," Lenarduzzi said. "It was lightning in a bottle."
There is contemporary evidence of a soccer resurgence in Canada. This time no one is taking anything for granted.
Hockey and baseball may continue to bestride the pro sports landscape, but Major League Soccer is now on a more or less even footing with the CFL. The Canadian MLS markets - Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal - have surpassed our brand of the gridiron game in terms of attendance and fan enthusiasm.
This weekend's Grey Cup isn't exactly a tough ticket, in contrast with last Tuesday's playoff game between the Montreal Impact and Toronto FC. The Impact had little problem selling all 61,004 seats at the decrepit Olympic Stadium.
It would be shock if Toronto's BMO Field, also the site of the 104th Grey Cup, isn't packed for the return leg of the final. It's not likely pizza shop freebies will be required to make it happen.
The renewed interest and spiking viewership surely has to do with recent successes on the field, but there is a trend line, and it favours association football more than the three-down kind.
How did this happen?
It's the antithesis of an overnight success.
Soccer has been the top participation sport in this country for decades (Canada is the among the world's top 10 in terms of registered players). The challenge has always been to translate that into support for domestic professional teams and the national sides.
The numbers suggest it's finally happening.
"I think you're seeing a new generation of fans develop, it's a younger crowd, a different crowd than hockey or football," said Peter Montopoli, the general secretary of Canada Soccer, the sport's national governing body.
Montopoli argues the roots of what we're seeing today go back to the 2007 FIFA under-20 World Cup - although he wouldn't quibble with going back a little farther: the 2002 FIFA under-19 women's world championship, an event that introduced Canada and the world to Christine Sinclair, perhaps the finest player this country has ever produced.
The final, held in Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium, featured Canada against the United States and attracted nearly 40,000 fans.
The subsequent bid to hold the U-20 World Cup provided the impetus to build BMO Field (Canada Soccer was a key funding partner). The event, which coincided with TFC's inaugural MLS season, drew 1.2 million people across Canada.
"Without that tournament there's no stadium," Montopoli said. "And I don't know where MLS would be."
Toronto became the first Canadian MLS expansion team in 2007 - the same year the league instituted a designated-player rule and David Beckham took his talents to the L.A. Galaxy.
It was the culmination of a five-year plan to revive the league, which lost $350-million in its first 10 years of existence and was propped up by NFL owners Lamar Hunt and Robert Kraft, as well as L.A. Kings owner Phil Anschutz (whose longtime protégé, Tim Leiweke, deserves at least some credit for setting TFC up as a powerhouse).
One of the paradoxes of North American soccer development is there are huge numbers of hardcore fans. The difficulty has been to convince those who grew up on a diet of Serie A, the Premiership or the Bundesliga to support the local team.
"Your first club is your first club, and you'll never change ... the difference is kids today can identify with clubs and teams from this country," Montopoli said. "Their reference points are Canadian."
Lenarduzzi, now president of the Whitecaps, said his club has paid particular attention to cultivating the supporter culture that is in some ways unique to soccer, and spends a lot of time tending to the grassroots.
"In the 70s the rallying cry was that soccer was going to be the sport of the 80s and 90s, that it was just going to keep growing on its own. That was a mistake," Lenarduzzi said.
The key contribution of MLS, he continued, has been its "slow-growth" agenda.
Beyond the success of their first teams, Canada's pro teams are also churning out a new crop of homegrown prospects.
All three MLS clubs have Canadian-born senior players - most also play in the national side - but more than that their academy systems are paying dividends.
Earlier this month Canada Soccer announced a 30-player roster for its 14-and-under Excel program, all but three are on the books with Canadian pro sides (the others are attached to U.S. teams).
Montopoli is fond of saying the development of soccer has involved a four-pronged strategy: participation (such as youth involvement), professionalization (including at the club level), performance (success) and properties.
"If the teams aren't successful, you're not generating the interest. Period," he said.
It's a similar theme to that put forward by Impact head coach Mauro Biello, who suggested before last week's game that what drives fan interest, beyond big names and glitzy television, is very simple.
"Fans see very ambitious clubs that are committed to doing everything they can to win," he said.
The case for soccer's surge is not merely anecdotal.
According to Forbes magazine's most recent valuations, the average MLS club is worth $185-million (U.S.). TFC is worth more like $245-million.
Lower-division clubs such as FC Edmonton and the Ottawa Fury (run by the same group that owns the CFL's RedBlacks) don't operate on quite the same scale, but have built loyal followings and compete in the annual national club competition.
More people are watching soccer on television as well. Canada's three MLS teams have similar numbers to the NBA's Toronto Raptors, about 200,000 viewers a game (though the Raptors have more of them).
The audience figures for soccer haven't yet eclipsed the CFL, whose ratings improved in 2016 but are still lower than 2010. But last week they came close.
According to the overnight Numeris ratings, which are provided by a third party and are not considered final, the viewing audience for last weekend's CFL's division finals averaged out at just over 1.2 million, a slight drop over last year.
Last Tuesday's Impact-TFC tilt had a smaller audience, just over one million; it was nearly double the previous record audience for an MLS playoff game.
On the paid attendance front, MLS gates are increasing while the CFL's are in steady decline.
This year, the leagues had nearly identical per-game averages (the CFL was slightly above 24,000, MLS was slightly below), but TFC, the Impact and the Whitecaps each out-drew the CFL team in their market.
The two largest crowds for a Canadian sporting event in 2016 were both for soccer - at the Olympic Stadium last week and the 54,798 who watched the men's World Cup qualifier against Mexico at B.C. Place.
The three Canadian MLS teams turned in the circuit's largest year-over-year attendance growth and 2016 was a record year for the league, the sixth-largest soccer league in the world by attendance.
Soccer doesn't yet enjoy the regular television exposure and appointment-viewing that football, hockey and baseball do, but the international calendar, along with the nine-month MLS season, means soccer is seldom far from public view.
The past decade has usually featured one or two notable moments a year to keep fans' attention.
You've had Sinclair leading the national women's team to Olympic medals (bronze in London and Rio, the first podium finishes in a Summer Games team sport in a couple of generations) and a couple of World Cups, and the men's team playing in international qualifying, or clubs in CONCACAF Champions' League games - Montreal reached the final in 2015, Vancouver is in the quarter-final stage for 2017.
All that's missing is the senior men's team playing in the World Cup for the first time since 1986. After missing out on Russia 2018, Montopoli said they are determined to be in Qatar in 2022.
After that, the aim is to hold the global showcase.
"Canada has hosted every other world soccer event," he said. "We believe it's our turn."

Full text: As Chasse-Galerie makes the move to the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, its tiny birthplace offers a surprising comedic revival of Claudia Dey's Beaver
Chasse-Galerie
Beaver
C is a hell of a lot of fun. Based on a French-Canadian legend about a flying canoe, and a deal with the devil, Tyrone Savage and James Smith's irresistibly irreverent musical comedy debuted at the tiny Storefront Theatre last holiday season - and now is back in bigger, swanker digs at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, thanks to Soulpepper.
As well as having many more seats, there's now a better selection of whisky to swig along with the four female lumberjacks who are the main characters in this version of the tale - and so dangerously fond of that particular liquor that they risk their souls for a night drinking it in Montreal. These , as they call themselves, begin the show stuck far in the hinterland trying to meet their timber quota on New Year's Eve, dreaming of moonshine and Montreal.
Religious Alex (Tess Benger) pines spiritually for Jaune, the woman she wants to settle down with and marry, while neurotic Lea (Nicole Power, from CBC's ) and earthy Michelle (comic powerhouse Kat Letwin) both long for the loins of a randy, red-haired bartender named Michel-Paul. ("I like my women like I like my whisky," the two-timer says, when he eventually appears. "Alcoholic.")
Toba (Shaina Silver-Baird), the most sensible of the bunch, has no lover in Montreal - and so is the only one to truly resist when the devil (writer and director Savage, pantomiming it up) shows up at their cabin offering up the services of a flying canoe to transport them there to shout .
The deal the women agree to is this: If they can make it through the night without swearing or touching a cross, their night of fun comes with no eternal consequences.
Last year, I had a definite favourite of the four in Letwin. This time around, she's still the quickest and the crassest and willing to go about anywhere for a joke - whether it's to be found in the script or not - but there's a better balance between protagonists. Benger is a wonderful mix of devout and demented, Power's enjoyably quirky, and Silver-Baird's sturdy as the straight woman eventually revealed to be the heart of the show.
The true triumph of , however, is the very tuneful score by James Smith (who also plays piano in the show and has a small, charming cameo).
Much of it is in the tradition of French-Canadian folk - allowing for a show-stopping, floor-stomping fiddle battle between one of the women and the devil at the climax. Smith has also composed country tunes, drinking chansons - and did I detect a little homage to Quebec prog-rock bands like Harmonium in some of the more sophisticated songs?
Smith has a knack for the instantly catchy. I walked out humming a song called (those are all the words to the chorus) and woke up the next day with another with unprintable lyrics in my head.
I'm not entirely sure why this revised remount of felt more complex musically, but more convoluted dramatically. In part it may be that what was a wonderful discovery in an itsy-bitsy, indie theatre now has expectations to live up to. Tyrone's script, adapted from an earlier collectively created one, could definitely benefit from further honing: A framing device slows things down, while a new subplot involving an angel named Uriel doesn't quite make sense. It's still a great lark, however - and the score hints at more.
Across town where got its start, another Storefront show full of funny, female characters is taking up space - a revival of Claudia Dey's that feels absolutely necessary. Set in Timmins, Ont., this 2000 play by the playwright-turned-columnist-turned-designer follows a 12-year-old named Beatrice (Chala Hunter) and her differently functional family after the girl's mother dies. Forgotten at the burial in a blizzard, Beatrice wanders in the snow - her absence unnoticed, at first, by a colourful collection of female relatives bickering and boozing at the wake.
got negative reviews when it premiered at the Factory Theatre - a mere one star from these pages. Director Brendan McMurtry-Howlett's simple, spare revival here makes that seem surprising. Dey's writing (later refined in shows such as ) is rich and funny, with an array of memorable working-class characters who seem larger than life one moment, entirely and touchingly recognizable the next.
There are a host of gem-like performances in this low-budget production. Stratford and Soulpepper vet Carmen Grant is a thin sheet of ice ready to crack as the religious, teetotalling Nora; Katie Swift is bewitchingly bizarre as a firebug feminist named Dorris Delistlo; and PJ Prudat, her hair styled like 1990s Shania Twain, is a disarming mix of sweet and sour as the ghost of Beatrice's mother - who just wanted to sing country tunes at the bar. (An aspect of the play that links it to the poetic/profane work of Michel Tremblay and Tomson Highway.)
I fell particularly in love with Jimi Shlag as Silo - Beatrice's alcoholic father, hopeless, lost, yet brimming with love for his daughter. His scenes with fellow barfly Cowboy (the superbly sad sack Waawaate Fobister) play out like hoser high art.
No doubt, has a sprawling structure - an unwieldy first act, followed by a short one that leaps far into the future, to the wedding day of Beatrice, now known as Beaver. It might work better as three acts. But it weaves its own offbeat magic just the way it is.
The Storefront may have seemed a bit like a clubhouse when it first opened, but these days - with successful shows spanning two ends of the city - it feels more than worthy of wider attention.

Full text: Iconic Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen passed away late Thursday at age 82
Leonard Cohen, the Montreal-born singer-songwriter whose music, poetry and prose inspired generations of artists, has died. He was 82.
Cohen had spent the past few years actively recording, releasing three albums since 2012, including , co-produced by his son Adam Cohen, just three weeks ago. His brand of narrative, in song, poetry and prose, captivated others around the world in both obvious and complex ways - famously, his song was a flop upon release, yet became a contemporary classic because of a cover version of a cover.
Cohen's narratives turned him into an unofficial beacon for Canada, drawing attention to the country's artists and writers. Through his music, poetry and novels, he became one of Canada's foremost masters of storytelling, even as he spent much of his life abroad. Here, Cohen's collaborators, colleagues, and acolytes recall the artist's lasting legacy.
Adam Cohen, son and producer : "My father passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records. He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humour."
k.d. lang, musician : "An elegant practitioner of the senses. Fully engaged in the realm of desire and yet fully dedicated to the spiritual. The quintessential Renaissance man who will never be matched."
Listen: Five remarkable Leonard Cohen songs

From the archives: Leonard Cohen: Life of a ladies' man
Robert Kory, Cohen's manager : "I was blessed to call him a friend, and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit first hand, was a privilege and great gift. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come."
Michael Ondaatje, author : "He was a hero for our generation and for the next - stepping bravely into new forms, a great writer who then became a great songwriter. We drank a toast to him tonight at the Tulip."
Amy Millan, musician : "His spirit will haunt my beautiful city, lucky for us. ... He was the great seducer, wasn't he? His voice was like foreplay."
Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer, author of All the Broken Things : "Leonard Cohen was the perfect soundtrack to my morose teenage years. I felt safe and known in his calibrated light darkness. He wrote lines like ‘I forgot to pray for the angels' and ‘Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water' - laconic lyrics that provided a loving antidote to the oppressive Catholic paradigm into which I was indoctrinated. He used words to exalt them and I was a goner listening to them, over and over until I was too tired to get up and pull the needle over onto the scratched-up album, until I had to sleep. So sad to say goodbye. Rest in peace, poet."
Michael Timmins, musician, Cowboy Junkies : "We grew up in the same town, Montreal. And even though his age placed him more in my parents generation, he defined the youthful energy of Montreal in the '60s and '70s: respectfully contrary, with one foot in the old world and one in the new, sophisticated and urbane. This modest, gracious Jewish gentleman whose poems and songs tried to work through the paradoxes, the beautiful victories and the terrible defeats of life and love, taught us what it was to be cool. He came backstage after one of our shows in L.A. in the late 80's with the most strikingly beautiful woman on his arm. The next day at our show, somewhere down the coast, two-dozen yellow roses showed up with a note; ‘Thank you for your music and hospitality - Leonard.' Many years later he sat in the first balcony at Massey Hall where, along with our peers and contemporaries, we saluted him in song. But my favourite memory takes place outside a concert hall in Vancouver after he had just been inducted in to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. My wife and I were trying to hail a cab. Beside us was a dapper-looking older man (he would have been close to my current age) standing alone, waiting for a cab or his car. It was Leonard Cohen. I went up to him and introduced myself. He held my hand for an extra beat and slowly intoned, ‘Cooool band.' So long Leonard, you taught us well."
Gordon Lightfoot, musician : "I am deeply saddened by the passing of my contemporary, colleague, fellow Canadian and my dear friend Leonard Cohen. He loved music and his music affected millions of people around the world. He will be greatly missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his family as they grieve this tremendous loss."
Marissa Stapley, author of Mating for Life : "It was 1987, my parents had just divorced, and I was spending weekends with my dad, who was living with my aunt in Pickering. We'd listen to music when we were driving from Stouffville to Pickering: mostly Paul Simon's , and Jennifer Warnes's . I didn't know at the time that these were the songs (poems, really) of our national treasure Leonard Cohen. I only knew that the songs were stories, and that there was a lot more to them than my nine-year-old mind could understand. I'd puzzle over lines like ‘I'm aching for you baby; I can't pretend I'm not. I need to see you naked, in your body and your thought.' But it was the song that especially appealed to me. ‘I'm guided by a signal in the heavens/I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin/I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons/First, we take Manhattan/Then we take Berlin.' I imagined a woman and a man, running through an airport, all in black leather, saving the world in some way. I made up a story. And this is why I became on author, because of these stories in songs, because once these stories started writing themselves in my mind, they never stopped.
Two years ago, my mom and I went to see Leonard Cohen at the Air Canada Centre. We had a bird's-eye view of him, from up in the rafters in the only seats we could get. But he was vivid, there on the stage in his suit and fedora, shining under the spotlight like no star we had ever seen. Earlier in the night, he had jogged onto the stage with the energy of a young man. He crooned, he rasped, he muttered. He read poetry under that spotlight, all alone. He stepped aside so the beautiful women who sang with him could sing alone, could take the spotlight themselves. We both agreed by the end of the show that if he asked, we'd marry him in a second. Past midnight, we were starting to yawn and joking that an 80-year-old man had more stamina than we did. When I wrote my mom last night to tell her he had died, she replied, "After that night, I was sure he'd live to be a hundred." He was immortal on that stage, and he will be immortal through his words - but still, if only he really were. Farewell, Leonard."
Joel Plaskett, musician : "Mystery, romance, drama. A unique and truly incredible songwriter. I can't think of Montreal without thinking of Leonard Cohen and I can't think of Leonard Cohen without thinking of Montreal. His music and poetry embodies everything I love about the city."
Alix Hawley, author of All True Not a Lie In It : "I heard Leonard Cohen by way of parents' radio, by way of Jennifer Warnes's cover album, and later, by way of Jeff Buckley. It was always the words that gripped me, no matter whose voice they came in, no matter how old I was. ‘Mysterious and fertile, they seemed to grow right out of the dark. And Jane came back with a lock of your hair/She said that you gave it to her.' As a child, I had dreams about this Jane, and though I could never picture her, I would have listened to anything she told me. I still would. In Cohen's own tar-paper voice, the words are darker, as he said we wanted it. Think of him singing ‘I have tried in my way to be free.' No line is a throwaway. That chain of monosyllables and heavy pauses is a set of prints carefully stamped on blackness, leading somewhere, saying he was here."
Séan McCann, musician, Great Big Sea : "Leonard Cohen was a man who deeply loved this world and was not afraid to say it. As a songwriter, he taught me how to see and touch and feel and taste. He saw the divine in the secular and vice versa."
Jacob McArthur Mooney, author of Don't Be Interesting : "I had the quintessential childhood experience, as a son of Canadian baby boomers, of having one book of poetry in the house growing up and of having that book be Leonard Cohen's. It was the 1969 from McClelland & Stewart. I first read it on the bus to school in Grade 8 and then for about a four-year stretch it was a kind of personal totem; I took it everywhere. I remember going to a church event and holding it in my hand, waiting for some fellow traveller to spot me and strike up a conversation. To me, the image of Cohen and the image of that beaten-up book are inseparable. As a poet, much of what Cohen brought to Canadian literature - cosmopolitanism, ritual, an olive branch to popular culture - he brought by himself and with precious few allies. That iconoclasm is underappreciated. My favourite Leonard Cohen poem is . My favourite lines in it are ‘Goodbye, articulate monsters/Abbott and Costello have met Frankenstein.' Given the context of this week, I like to think of them as his last words, though I suspect they weren't."
Steve Jordan, founder of the Polaris Prize : "His work, so precise, inspired so many from so many walks of life it's not possible to envision anyone reaching those heights again. He will also go down in history as the only person to come up with a rhyme for orange. Door hinge."
Michael Winter, author of Into the Blizzard : "I was 15 and my sister Kathleen had come home from university for Christmas. She had the album and she played it one night. We both thought it very important. Then we got to the last song, , and we burst out laughing at the line, ‘I lit a thin green candle, to make you jealous of me.' We realized Leonard had ventured this deep in creating a serious album of confession, but couldn't hold it any longer, and was offering us a clue as to how ridiculous his predicament was. Last Christmas, 35 years later, I found the album hiding behind a curtain in my father's house. My parents were born the same year as Leonard Cohen, a fact my mother enjoyed and that gave me the notion that Leonard could be my spiritual father. I gave the album to a friend who had a turntable. But she couldn't play it, the vinyl was warped. I have to admit that's how I'm feeling today: a little warped, a little bent out of shape. But a bend is good for art; bend makes new. Though I may be wrong."
Shane Carter, president of Sony Music Entertainment Canada : "Leonard Cohen left an indelible legacy and his artistry will be cherished around the world."
Adam Lewis Schroeder, author of All-Day Breakfast : "As a teenager I read a lot of horror novels and Marvel comics. I gave no thought to writing, or even reading more widely, until our English teacher, Wayne Emde, passed out photocopies of what I realize now were the classics of Leonard Cohen's oeuvre. A line like, ‘Giving me head on the unmade bed / While the limousines wait in the street' is remarkable today, but at 16 it showed me how alive and immediate writing should be. We watched a ‘70s video of Cohen in a bell-bottomed suit, strolling barefoot through downtown Montreal; then we wrote poems, and though mine was a smartass piece about how Leonard was looking to contract hookworm, it was the first time I wrote in something like my own voice. The era of writing that has been the rest of my life started then. I sang in a band that played before Jeff Buckley (okay, senseless bragging) and my copy of is warped from the tub. Leonard Cohen has gone, in such a foul week for the world, but by his example we might preserve; ‘I will place my/paper hat on my/concussion and dance.'
Jared Bland, publisher of McClelland & Stewart : "Leonard Cohen was one of the of the great artists of our age: a poet of transcendent beauty and wisdom, a novelist of moral urgency and insight, and, of course, a peerless singer and songwriter. His work, in all its forms, touched our hearts, informed our lives and made our world better. It is almost impossible to imagine a world without his singular voice. His presence will never be forgotten. His profound art will endure."
Natalee Caple, author of In Calamity's Wake : "When I was about 11, and had just been moved from Montreal to Scarborough, I was so lonely. My family went to the Pickering flea market and my dad gave me two dollars to buy myself something - like a candy - and we split up for 45 minutes (that way my parents could move around without my misery beside them). There was a guy with a box of records for two dollars each. I flipped through and saw a picture of a man who looked a bit like my dad on the cover and knew he was from Montreal. I bought the record and took it home. There was a scratch over the whole record except for the song and I played it over and over.
Through my teens, I borrowed the school library's copies until a particularly sour librarian told me, ‘That's enough,' even though my name was the only one on the little envelope in the back. Later, I scoured used book stores and tried writing like him, but with my own content, the objects and confusions of my life, and I learned a lot about patterns and imagery. In my 20s I turned against him, I felt betrayed when I realized how much of his portraits of women were about sex and desire - I saw the misogyny that is there. I was done with excuses about confessions of ladies' men. I appeared on a radio show talking about getting over Leonard Cohen.
In recent years, his openness about depression and mental illness moved me and his work continued to develop really right until the end. I missed him and I listened to him again and saw a man being as open as he could be and staying engaged with culture and giving what he could and knowing and speaking and owning his own failures. As an adult having accumulated failures, I could see again how his face still looked like dad's had aged into the same face and I thought how precious, how fragile, my Leonard Cohen."
Judy Collins, musician who first recorded Suzanne in 1966 : "He came to my apartment, and on the first day we just talked. ... He thought he had a terrible voice. When we parted that night, I said, [a mutual friend] says you've written some songs. Do you want to come by tomorrow and sing them? He came by the next day and he said to me, ‘I can't sing and I can't play the guitar, and I don't know if this is a song.' And then he played me Suzanne. In '67, when the song was very, very big. ... I said Leonard, you must come with me to this big fundraiser I'm doing. It was a big show; Jimi Hendrix was on it. He'd never sung [in front of a large audience] before then. He got out on stage and started singing. Everybody was going crazy - they loved it. And they stopped about halfway through, and walked off the stage. Everybody went nuts. ... And they demanded that he come back. And I demanded; I said, ‘I'll go out with you.' So we went out, and we sang it. And of course, that was the beginning. I am best friends with his oldest friend, Nancy Bacal, who is the one who sent me an e-mail on Tuesday morning, the morning of the election, which said, ‘He's gone. Friendship is everything. Call me; I love you.'"
Emily Schultz, author of The Blondes: A Novel : "Here's the story of a Leonard Cohen CD and a ménage à quatre that could only happen in a college town in the 1990s. My now-husband, Brian, was on a date with a woman who had previously broken up with the man I was living with at the time. The man had given her a CD: . She then passed the CD to Brian telling him, ‘It's weird and dark. Like you.' A few months later Brian gave me the CD before he moved out of town. I listened to when I was alone in my shared apartment, and wondered why he and I weren't together. It only took a couple years before we were. Isn't love complex?"
Bruce Cockburn, musician : "A beautiful romancer of the darkness in our souls. Hands down, the best wordsmith in contemporary song. Sail on, Older Brother!"
Art Bergmann, musician: "November 11, just before 11 a.m., I heard a recent recording Leonard Cohen made of the poem . Even in this, his wisdom is palpable; on the line, 'We are the dead,' he stops for a deep pause, and then finishes. I have been in deep reflection on Leonard since his recent album and song . With all that is happening recently, the line, "A million candles burning for the help that never came/You want it darker" still stunned with its brutal wisdom. I love that he knew how much work was involved in crafting his art and was reluctant - he called it laziness, hah! - to start down the path of new works that would take years sometimes to complete. But you should quote him, not me: "And there's a mighty judgment coming but I may be wrong/You see, you hear these funny voices in the tower of song."
Rose Cousins, musician : "He didn't waste a word. I deeply appreciate his contemplations from within and out of the throes of love and struggle. He hit the highest highs and the darkest dark - equal parts humble human and mystical creature. I feel so thankful that he's left so much of himself with us."
Rufus Wainwright, musician : "Like for most of us, for me he dwelled in a higher strata inhabited by some living but mostly passed icons who seemed to have this direct line to the galaxy, whilst at the same time knowing exactly when to take out the trash. Formidable in both the sacred and the mundane. But fortunately I now covet these few personal moments, I'm pretty sure it's about seven in total (a sacred number of course!) And credit them with grabbing hold and shifting the direction of the restless path my life has always taken. It was never a fundamental shift, just a kind yet brutally strong nudge towards where I really ought to be heading. I would have liked to have had more time to ask him more questions, and certainly now in this pathetic dinghy, adrift in a violent sea, we all need help in manoeuvring a truly busted rudder through a series of magnificent typhoons. But it's okay, it's all in the music. Farewell, Leonard, we need you now up there as much as we did down here. Love always, Rufus.
Patrick Leonard, co-producer and co-writer for Cohen's final three records: "We started with about 7 or 8 years ago now. There was a surplus of things that built up over the years that weren't quite finished. There were always new things coming up. But there was a method about getting things finished, and having them find musical homes.
He could say, ‘Could you take these three things and move them toward the finish?' He'd give me a lyric, and I'd write a song. The ability to have music written so it wasn't so much of a concern helped him move quicker. Getting songs written and records made was arduous to a poet. He just kinda went, 'I'm not that interested in the tunes any more.' And he still wrote some great tunes, but that was not the concern.
Five days ago, I sent him another R&B groove. There's five or six songs that were ready to be finished. There's another record that could have happened. It sounds crazy, but yes, there was. I think maybe that was my biggest value to him was that I could help him get these things finished, so that the poetry got out. Because he wrote every day, all day, and every night, all night."

Abstract: Fifty years after a million passengers filled the metro on its first weekend in operation - oohing and aahing over the cobalt blue trains and soaring stations with their colourful mosaics and stained-glass - Legault's passion for the underground transit system he helped create is undiminished. At $213 million ($1.6 billion in today's dollars), the initial 26-station subway was one of the world's least expensive to build, mainly because of its narrow-gauge trains, which allowed smaller tunnels.

It was built on time and on budget, and with an elegance and savoir faire that elevated a utilitarian means of transportation to a work of art. Half a century later, the distinctive architecture of each station remains. So, too, does the metro's unrealized potential. Even today, the underground network fails to reach wide swaths of the city it was designed to unite. Marian Scott and Jason Magder report. The idea of a metro on tires came from Paris. The idea of the subway as a showcase for art and architecture came from Moscow. But when the Montreal metro opened on Oct. 14, 1966, it was a uniquely local creation.
"I wouldn't call it a Quebec product, or a Canadian product. I would call it a Montreal product. It was really done by Montrealers," said Guy Legault, the city's assistant director of urban planning during the first phase of metro construction from 1962-67.
Fifty years after a million passengers filled the metro on its first weekend in operation - oohing and aahing over the cobalt blue trains and soaring stations with their colourful mosaics and stained-glass - Legault's passion for the underground transit system he helped create is undiminished.
"The metro is the most beautiful example of an urban institution. The metro glorifies the city. It's a gathering place. It's a place where people come together. The metro is extraordinary," said Legault, 84, who oversaw the architectural plans for the initial network.
Widely regarded as the greatest achievement of Mayor Jean Drapeau's 30-year reign (from 1954 to 1957 and 1960 to 1986), the tire-shod subway has become an indispensable feature of the city it has transformed in myriad and profound ways.
"It's difficult to even conceive of what we would be like if the metro had never been built," says Matthew McLauchlin, creator of the website metrodemontreal.com.
A court interpreter and social work student, McLauchlin, 34, launched his website on the metro on Oct. 14, 2001 - his birthday as well as that of the subway.
"I think that there's something about a metro system that really puts it at the heart of the experience of any city," said McLauchlin. "It's really striking to me that so much attention had been paid to the esthetics of something that so many people use every day," he said.
"I was also struck by how much of it went unperceived and so my website always has been an effort to get people to take a second look and really appreciate what they pass by every day," McLauchlin added.
The metro reshaped and reinvigorated downtown Montreal, breathing new life into public transit in an era when the car was king. It led to the 32-kilometre underground city, where Montrealers shop and stroll, sheltered from cold and blizzards.
As hard as it might be to believe today, in a city notorious for corruption and construction delays, it was built economically and remarkably quickly - coming in on time and on budget. At $213 million ($1.6 billion in today's dollars), the initial 26-station subway was one of the world's least expensive to build, mainly because of its narrow-gauge trains, which allowed smaller tunnels.
And it did all that with an elegance and savoir faire that elevated a utilitarian means of transportation to a work of art.
"The French-English difference? Here it is," raved Canadian Magazine, then a weekend supplement in the Montreal Gazette and other newspapers, praising the stylishness that set the metro apart from the Toronto subway, whose stations looked like "big, sterile 'bathrooms.'"
"The Montreal metro is a subway with a difference, featuring among other things rubber-tired blue coaches and wild mosaic stations of which no two are alike," reported United Press International.
"An unexpected malady" swept the city in the week after the metro opened, Canadian Press wrote.
"It's Metro Love or 'l'amour immodere du Metro,' as a Montreal Transportation Commission official calls it," said CP, reporting on the capacity crowds milling in the new subway.
While cities like Stockholm and Lisbon are renowned today for their stunning subways, Montreal led the western world in making the metro an architectural showcase. At the time, only the Soviet Union, where Moscow's magnificent subway stations are veritable
palaces of the people, had taken such a decorative approach. "We were among the first to conceive of the entire station as an esthetic experience," McLauchlin said.
Half a century later, the distinctive architecture of each station remains Legault's proudest achievement. As second-in command to then-urban planning director Claude Robillard, it was he who came up with the idea of a different architect to design each station (with some doing two or more widely separated stops).
"Bringing in architecture was a mark of progress," Legault says.
"We were no longer provincial people. We weren't people who patted ourselves on the back just because we were able to move earth and rock. We had taken it up a notch."
When Drapeau and his righthand man, Lucien Saulnier, were elected on Oct. 24, 1960, plans for a subway had been on the drawing board for more than 50 years.
The flamboyant Drapeau, for whom no grandiose vision was too extravagant, and the practical, efficient Saulnier were the dream team that would finally turn the proposal into reality.
"Saulnier made all the difference and reined in the unbridled enthusiasm of Mayor Drapeau," Legault said.
Contrary to popular opinion, Saulnier, not Drapeau, was the father of the metro, he said.
"There are some urban legends about the metro that have to be cleared up. In fact, we owe the metro not to Jean Drapeau, but to Lucien Saulnier," he said.
Enamoured with glamorous projects that would put the city on the world map, Drapeau was initially reluctant to commit to the metro. He was an ardent proponent of freeways, seeing public transportation - including tramways, which had been eliminated from Montreal's streets by 1959 - as a relic of the past. But Saulnier, a small businessman raised in the Villeray district, was a firm believer in public transit. He had agreed to become Drapeau's running mate in the 1960 election on the condition they build a subway if elected, Legault said.
"There's no doubt that when the metro project became popular, Drapeau, who never missed an opportunity, rallied behind it and became its promoter. People think it was Drapeau's idea, but that's wrong," he said.
Another popular myth is that the metro was built because of Expo 67, Legault said.
In fact, construction of the metro was already underway when Montreal was awarded the 1967 world's fair in late 1962, after Moscow backed out.
However, Expo did affect the plans, eliminating a line that would have run under Mount Royal to Cartierville and Montreal North and adding the yellow line to Ile Ste-Helene and Longueuil.
Construction started on May 23, 1962. The initial network - nearly 40 per cent of today's 68 stations - was completed within five years, in time for Expo.
The metro was ideally suited to the city's densely populated neighbourhoods, built before the advent of the car, Legault said.
"To build a subway, you need a certain population density," he said.
"Montreal is one of the rare cities in North America that has a very high population density (in the centre), " he added.
"The metro is not a type of construction you can easily do in a suburb."
Saulnier was a meticulous manager who kept costs under control, Legault said. "It was expertly managed. The construction of the metro was carried out on schedule and within the budget - something that no longer exists in Montreal," he said.
While it cost $1.6 billion in today's dollars to build the initial network, the STM paid $1.2 billion for 468 new AZUR metro cars, and is spending another $1.2 billion to adapt the metro system for them.
For know-how, rather than turning to the United States or Toronto - which had opened its subway in 1954 and had 38 stations by 1966 - Drapeau looked to Paris, whose metro had recently pioneered trains with tires as opposed to noisy steel wheels.
"I think that in Drapeau's mind, the idea was to seek out expertise in old Europe, where they have experiences and a culture that are different from the Americans," Legault said.
While the mayor's preference for French expertise would later end disastrously when he hired architect Roger Taillibert to design the Olympic Stadium, a white elephant that left taxpayers saddled with a $1.5-billion debt, the idea of a metro on tires was a winner.
Montreal saved on tunnelling costs because the metro's narrowgauge cars could run in a smaller tunnel that didn't require support beams between tracks, and could handle steeper grades than traditional steel rails.
By tunnelling underground instead of digging trenches for the metro as in Toronto, planners were able to leave densely populated inner-city neighbourhoods intact, Legault noted.
Instead of running subway lines directly underneath major commercial arteries like Ste-Catherine and St-Denis Sts., they were located a block away to avoid disrupting businesses. "It would have destroyed Ste-Catherine St. (to build the metro directly underneath)," Legault said.
Thus, the Green Line runs under de Maisonneuve Blvd. - a street created in 1966 by joining Western, St-Luc, Burnside, part of Ontario and de Montigny Sts. - while the Orange Line runs under Berri St.
While subways in other cities exit to the sidewalk, that wasn't an option in Montreal because the sidewalks are narrower and the weather is worse, Legault said.
Modernistic metro entrances, or "edicules," became a familiar part of Montreal's streetscapes. In the downtown core, metro stations sparked highrise construction, as buildings were added atop them.
The underground city is another byproduct of the metro - one that planners foresaw and promoted, Legault said. The push to connect major downtown buildings by underground passages coincided with the opening of Place Ville Marie in 1962 - whose underground shopping mall was the city's first. "To connect that to the metro was Nirvana," he said.
Today, with no new metro construction since 2007, when the subway was extended to Laval, it's hard to conceive of planning and executing a project of such magnitude as the metro in just six years. Part of what made it possible then is that fewer players were involved, said Benoit Clairoux, a historian at the Societe de transport de Montreal (STM) and author of Le Metro de Montreal: 35 ans deja (Hurtubise, 2001).
"At the time, it was incredibly simple. The city of Montreal decided to build a metro, one that would be almost exclusively on its territory, and that it would pay for itself, in theory, anyway. (Westmount helped pay for Atwater Station and the Quebec government paid for later extensions.) When you're the one who's doing the building, you're the one who decides and you're the one who pays, it goes fast," he said.
But the story of the metro is an unfinished one whose early promise may never be fulfilled, said Dale Gilbert, a metro historian and postdoctoral fellow at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique's Centre Urbanisation Culture Societe.
Designed for a densely settled city, which managed the original construction in-house, it is a mode of transportation ill suited to and prohibitively expensive for sprawling suburbs, which grew exponentially during and after the period after the metro opened.
"In the beginning, Jean Drapeau was in control. He paid 100 per cent of the costs and in his mind, it was a metro for Montreal, for Montrealers," Gilbert said.
In the 1970s, expansion plans degenerated into decades of political bickering, funding shortfalls and stalled extensions. Metro extensions became controversial as costs exploded and different municipalities and levels of government got involved.
Accusations flew that Montreal's metro-on-tires had been a poor choice because it cannot run above ground, a cheaper way to serve a sprawling metropolis. Montreal's regional transit authority butted heads with the Quebec government over a proposed metro extension to Mirabel airport - leading to a deadlock that caused the government to declare a moratorium on future metro expansion in 1976.
Fifty years after the metro opened, it still fails to reach wide swaths of the city it was designed to unite, including Montreal North and much of Notre-Dame-de-Grace.
A $5.5-billion private-public lightrail project for the Montreal region currently proposed by Quebec's pension fund, the Caisse de depot et de placement, would not be well integrated with the metro, connecting only at Central Station, a 10-minute walk to Bonaventure metro, noted Craig Townsend, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment at Concordia University.
Without political will from the Quebec government, there is little hope for improvement, Gilbert said.
"The explosion of costs, moratoriums and the provincial government's hesitation all contributed to the fact that today we find ourselves with a metro system that never realized its full potential. " jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/JasonMagder mscott@postmedia.com twitter.com/JMarianScott

Full text:   On his memories of Montreal: "We did a Christmas tour. It was the biggest blizzard/whiteout that Canada ever had. I'm trying to remember if it was Montreal or Toronto. The train had to stop so they could unfreeze the tracks. I was appearing at a punk rock club, and if we showed up, they had to pay us. It was illegal to go outside, but when we got there, all the punks were there. My memories are of blizzards and fairly lewd male strip clubs."
When he realized he was different: "I was reading about beatniks and I wanted to be one. I knew something was the matter with me, but I didn't know where to go until I read about bohemia. I'm still looking for it - except in Baltimore, which is the only place cheap enough to be bohemian in."
On the influence of Ingmar Bergman: "Bergman had nudity, vomit - all the things I embraced. I was going to see Bergman on LSD; I don't think a lot of people did that. And watching foreign movies and (splatter pioneer) Gordon Lewis's horror films. All of these things influenced me to create a new genre, putting exploitation movies in art theatres."
On the value of humour: "All my movies are about being non-judgmental. From Hairspray to Pink Flamingos, it's the same. Humour is the Trojan Horse I snuck my ideas in with. My films are about outsider takes on society."
On casting Ricki Lake in Hairspray: "She was Tracy, literally. I just loved her excitement and her joy, and her unselfconsciousness about being a fat girl. She could really dance. Only three or four girls applied for the part. We couldn't find anybody. After that, for Cry-Baby, hundreds of girls showed up. It was a stampede of fat girls. I'm proud of that."
On art: "I collect contemporary art. Art is another way to make people angry and make people laugh. People always say they hate contemporary art, because they're too stupid to look at it. They say, 'I could do that.' Well, you didn't, dumbbell, and it just sold for $2 million, so you better get painting.
"I remember I bought a little Miro print for a dollar at the Baltimore museum. The other kids said, 'Why?' So I put it up and thought, 'God, think of the power this has.' People say the (Andy Warhol) soup can killed abstract expressionism and minimalism. Each movement that came out infuriated people. Art's job is to wreck what came before."

Full text:   As we all know, hockey fans are rational human beings, fairminded to a fault, and able to see the big picture without petty provincialism.
National Hockey League players, similarly, are all about the well-being of the game, hold no grudges and never make decisions based on factors as crass as salary, climate, taxation or the median hotness of women in a given city's nightclubs.
Also (full disclosure here), the task of interpreting results of this 2015-16 Postmedia hockey poll of players and fans has fallen to a scribe who has divided his career among Edmonton (22 years, five Stanley Cups), Toronto (seven years, zero Cups) and Vancouver (11 years, also bubkes).
This doesn't mean he hasn't spent weeks, even months, in hotels and rinks and ballparks and drinking establishments in Calgary and Winnipeg, Montreal and Ottawa, thereby qualifying him to venture semi-informed opinions. Just saying ...
First, the fan poll: Favourite/least favourite Canadian-based team: We combined these two because the results are hilarious. The Toronto Maple Leafs are No. 1 in both categories, meaning they're the top love/hate club among Canadians. The Winnipeg Jets rank last in both, meaning most respondents have no feelings about them, either way. The Jets are just sort of ... there. But the answers, understandably at present, indicate a lot of "meh" toward Canadian teams in general.
Next Canadian team to win the Cup: This was a nail-biter between Edmonton among those with endless faith in the inevitability of No. 1 draft picks, and Montreal among those with endless faith in Carey Price. I might have gone for (h) it'll never happen again.
Norris Trophy winner: Too close to call. Sens' Erik Karlsson, clearly the class of the East, will probably win again because everyone loves points and high risk/reward, and are a little unclear about what else defencemen are supposed to do. Give me Drew Doughty, the 200-foot player and two-time Cup champ, any time, but I also understand living in the East and being in bed by the time the Western guys drop the puck. (p.s., in another year, the winner might be the Predators' Roman Josi.)
Vezina Trophy: Caps' Braden Holtby, landslide.
Calder Trophy: The voters love Connor McDavid, though he's missed nearly half the season for the Oilers. Obviously they're projecting what he'd have done if he'd stayed healthy, and aren't crazy about runaway rookie points leader Artemi Panarin of Chicago being five years older. Hart Trophy: Patrick Kane built an insurmountable lead, and will cruise to it.
Who wins the Cup: The fans went with the Washington Capitals, who will win the Presidents' Trophy (always risky), but not by much over the semi-dynastic Blackhawks. L.A. was the only other team given more than a 10 per cent chance.
Now for the questions the players also answered ... Most over-rated: Penguins' little ball of cotton, Phil Kessel, was the overwhelming choice among players, but fans ranked him second behind Montreal litmus test P.K. Subban. Then again, the fans also voted in numbers for Kane, Jonathan Toews, Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin, and Erik Karlsson, to name just a few, so maybe they're not entirely impartial. Dirtiest: In the player vote, Boston's Zac Rinaldo won by a snout over fellow rat Brad Marchand, who's gone somewhat straight since he started scoring like mad. But once again, the fans begged to differ, picking Marchand in a runaway, 32 per cent to just over 8 per cent for runner-up RaffiTorres, who's not even in the league.
Biggest pain in the butt to play against: Clearly, there were too many barbed-wire shirts for the players to focus on just one. Corey Perry, Ryan Kesler, Zdeno Chara, Marchand ... so much irritation, so little time. The fans had no difficulty, though, again choosing Marchand. Possibly a lifetime achievement award. They picked Habs' Brendan Gallagher second.
The poll is considered statistically accurate to within 50 percentage points, which means if you asked again after a win or a loss or a blizzard or a slow night at the Roxy, answers might be totally different.

SURVEY RESULTS
Over the last week, 1,000 people completed our NHL survey online. Here's a look at how fans see things:
1 Most over-rated player Winner: P.K. Subban (10.2%) Runner-up (tie): Phil Kessel, Sidney Crosby (8.7%) 100+ players received at least one vote
2 Dirtiest player Winner: Brad Marchand (32.0%) Runner-up: Raffi Torres (8.4%)
3 Biggest pain in the ass Winner: Brad Marchand (22.6%) Runner-up: Brendan Gallagher (7.6%)
4 Who made the biggest impression this year? Winner: Connor McDavid (27.9%) Runner-up: Patrick Kane (11.8%)
5 Favourite Canadian-based team Winner: Leafs (21.4%) Runner-up: Senators (19%)
6 Least favourite Canadianbased team Winner: Leafs (33.8%) Runner-up: Canadiens (23.8%)
7 Canadian-based team that will win the Cup next Winner: Oilers (27.7%) Runner-up: Canadiens (26.4%)
8 Norris Trophy?
Winner: Drew Doughty (40.2%) Runner-up: Erik Karlsson (40%)
9 Vezina Trophy?
Winner: Braden Holtby (65.3%) Runner-up: Corey Crawford (9.3%)
10 Rookie of the year?
Winner: Connor McDavid (42.5%) Runner-up: Artemi Panarin (24.6%)
11 Hart Trophy?
Winner: Patrick Kane (37.5%) Runner-up: Sidney Crosby (24.6%)
12 Who will win the Stanley Cup?
Winner: Washington Capitals (31%) Runner-up: Chicago Blackhawks (26.4%)
(Ultimate longshot? 0.1% of you voted for Edmonton, Ottawa or Toronto. We considered that a spoiled ballot. Or a soiled ballot.)
POSTMEDIA NHL PLAYER POLL
We polled NHL players across the country over the last four weeks on some important questions as the season winds down - like who's the most over-rated player in the league? We changed up some of the questions for our second annual Postmedia NHL Player Poll, but some remained the same. Once again, all players were promised anonymity and we polled those on both Canadian teams and visiting teams.

Mild weekend could spare snow crews

Abstract: The mild temperatures forecast could also be a boon for the city of Montreal's finances, because the city may not have to send out snow removal equipment for this storm.

Full text:   Don't despair: the dumping of snow predicted for the Montreal region won't be around for very long.
Environment Canada meteorologist Andre Cantin said he's confident the Montreal area will get at least 10 centimetres of snow on Thursday, starting in the early morning and ending early afternoon. He's more confident than he was for the last major snowfall predicted back on March 2, which didn't turn out to be the blizzard that was expected.
By Thursday morning rush hour, about four centimetres are likely to fall, making for a potentially slippery commute. The snow will turn to freezing rain and then straight rain starting about 3 or 4 p.m., Cantin said.
The rain will continue all day Friday. Thursday's high is forecast at -2 C, and Friday's high is expected to reach 7C. The warming trend will continue through the weekend, with temperatures predicted to reach near 10 C on Sunday and 7 C on Monday.
"By the end of the long Easter weekend, most of the snow will melt," Cantin said.
The storm is good news for skiers, and may extend the season for some hills in the region. The lower Laurentians will see 15 centimetres fall, while areas further north will get more. Mont-Tremblant could get up to 30 centimetres, Cantin said.
The mild temperatures forecast could also be a boon for the city of Montreal's finances, because the city may not have to send out snow removal equipment for this storm.
City officials will see how much snow has fallen and then take a look at the predicted temperatures to decide whether to cart away the snow from this storm, said Philippe Sabourin, a spokesperson for the city. Under the new city-wide snow clearing policy, the central city decides whether all the boroughs will start a snow removal operation. Such an operation costs about $17 million, according to the city's website.
"As soon as 2.5 centimetres have fallen, the plows head out, but it's too early to say now whether a snow removal operation will take place," Sabourin said.
He explained the city may just push the snow to the sides of the streets and let Mother Nature melt it away. "It will depend on how much snow falls, and how much of that actually stays on the roads," Sabourin said.

Boom Goes Rick Miller; One-man show taps history's greatest hits, from the A-bomb to Apollo 11

Full text:   Considering that for the past several months, Rick Miller has been performing more than 100 voices nightly, including throat raspers like Janis Joplin and Louis Armstrong, his voice is holding up pretty well. Talking over the phone, Miller comes over loud, clear and full of enthusiasm for BOOM, his touring one-man show, which arrives at the Segal this Sunday, reaches its 200th performance on Tuesday, covering just about every significant global event and hit song between 1945 and 1969.
The BOOM of the title has several meanings. First, it's the sound of the atom bomb that marked the end of the Second World War. It's the population explosion set offby the coming of peace. Somewhat less obviously, it's also a nod to Apollo 11, which, according to Miller, had an aphrodisiac effect across North America.
"There was a certain mini-baby boom that happened after Apollo 11," explains the Montreal-raised Miller (who was last seen here performing in Venus in Fur at the Centaur). "Bobby Kennedy had just been shot, Detroit was on fire, Prague was burning. It was a messy time. Then with the moon landing, it felt like perhaps communism was not going to win, and there was an element of hope."
One of the results of that NASA-inspired baby boom was Miller himself, which provides the show with a neat cut-off year, 1969. "Yes, it's all about me, isn't it?" he laughs, ironically acknowledging that this epic 25-year history all leads up to his own nativity.
But this personal aspect to the show also stops it from being a mere nostalgia trip and provides connective tissues to the wealth of impersonations and the blizzard of news clips projected onto the "time capsule," as Miller calls the remarkable cylindrical edifice that spirals around him throughout the show.
"I use three main characters to connect the material. One of them, Maddie, is more or less the story of my mother, though I should note, for when she reads this in the Gazette (she still lives in Montreal), it's been adapted. Then there's my father, who lived through World War Two in occupied Vienna. The other is an African-American draft dodger who comes across to Canada."
Miller explains that it was his father's stories that inspired the show. "He was telling me stories that I'd never heard before, because he's been archiving a little bit of his story for his family. I asked myself how come I don't know this stuff, these stories of having a swastika in his Grade 2 classroom or being made to be part of the Hitler Youth. And he said, well, you never asked or you never listened. So, I thought I'd ask and listen more."
Miller is hoping that BOOM will inspire a similar curiosity about the past in his audiences, especially those at the younger end. The stage component, he insists, is only a part of the experience. His close involvement in the Kidoons network of websites and the educational website Encyclopedia Canada is allowing him to involve the audience in a two-way flow of information.
"We now have around 150 stories that we've recorded from audience members after the show. They've expanded on things that I've only touched upon. I love it because it makes BOOM feel like an ongoing conversation as opposed to a piece of entertainment that you consume."
Clearly, Miller has more lofty ambitions than attracting yet more applause for his remarkable skills in mimicry: He first found fame through his rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody ("25 of the most annoying voices in the music industry"), as well as his worldwide hit MacHomer, which saw Macbeth retold through Simpsons characters. In fact, he bristles ever so slightly when, after he references the current U.S. political circus, I happen to ask if he has added Trump to his repertoire of voices.
"I tend to use imitations in the service of my plays," he insists. "Not all my plays have them. I make, I think, interesting imitations in the theatre, which help me create the experience. But, overall, it's not my job to be an impersonator."
If at first sight BOOM looks like a cross between a "jukebox musical" and a nostalgic news digest of the baby-boomer era, an equally apt comparison might be the work of Robert Lepage - who mentored Miller from the time he was an architecture student in Montreal - not least in the way it uses personal stories to explore patterns in history and geopolitics.
"I'm always trying to make sure the audience is hearing not just yesterday but today," Miller says. "I'm interested in looking at the way politics and culture merged together at that time, where every cultural gesture - how you wore your pants or your skirts, how you cut your hair - almost became a political act. It had to do not only with the number of baby boomers coming of age, but also technology that at first was distracting them and then connecting them to deep issues. I see that link now when I see my kids with their screens all the time. They're amazing tools of distraction, but they can also connect
and empower, just as TV brought people together against the Vietnam War."
There's docudrama coming to Centaur later in the year, too. The newly announced 48th season has Annabel Soutar (whose Fredy is still playing at La Licorne) bringing the English premiere of her ecological show, The Watershed. Speaking of La Licorne, two recent hits from that most adventurous of francophone theatres are also getting anglophone premieres at Centaur, with Francois Archambault's You Will Remember Me (Tu te souviendras de moi) in April, and Chlorine (Chore) guesting in the Brave New Looks slot in October.
Tableau D'Hote's multi-METAwinning production of Tremblay's Hosanna will also make a welcome return in a guest spot next year. Other highlights of the season include the Broadway hit Constellations, directed by Peter Hinton, Pulitzer Prize-winner Clybourne Park, and the "is-itreally-a-Jackson-Pollock?" art comedy Bakersfield Mist.

In Quebec, snowshoeing is a cultural keystone

Full text: Sure, walking in the snow works fine, but strapping on your raquettes is an important part of Quebec's history
I grew up in Alberta, where waist-high snowdrifts are common, but I never once saw anyone clambering over them on snowshoes. For that, I had to move to Montreal - though when I first saw a snowshoer striding along the shore of the St. Lawrence near my place in Verdun, he was moving over the same well-tramped path that I was managing just fine with my winter boots.
When a strenuous activity that used to be necessary is done for fun, it becomes a sport. Snowshoeing is one such pursuit, though when it's done on terrain that makes the shoes' webbed surface unnecessary, the sport aspect yields somewhat to a more symbolic value. I could see at a glance that that lone Montreal snowshoer was not just doing a winter sport. He was performing part of his culture.
So were those who snowshoed up Mount Royal one night last month, during an annual 2.5-kilometre march from which the ostensible purpose was to raise money for Mount Royal Park. But Les tuques bleues, as the event is called, also continues a tradition of "charcoal and moonlight" meets that stretches back to the 1840s, when snowshoers could spend much of a night tramping over the mountain, stopping at inns for food and booze along the way.
The name Les tuques bleues refers to a key item in the uniform of the old Montreal Snow Shoe Club (MSSC), which was led by powerful anglophones such as Lord Stanley, known today mainly for a silver cup he donated for a hockey game. Showshoeing was much more popular than hockey in Stanley's day, both as a social activity and for racing. People speed-walked or sprinted in their , or even ran over hurdles. In 1916, the standing record for the 100-yard dash on snowshoes was 11.75 seconds, only a couple of seconds slower than the world record for running in footwear that wasn't a metre long. A robust gambling scene sprang up around the sport, in spite of the MSSC's boast that its activities kept young men "safe from the sins and temptations" of city life.
Last month's Les tuques bleues was part of the winter festival Montréal en lumière. The connection seems doubly apt, since clubs such as the MSSC also drove the early development of carnivals and winter concerts. The winter-carnival culture that's so well-established in Quebec today might never have come about if the province had skipped its romance with snowshoeing and gone straight to hockey mania, as eventually happened. Hockey won in part because the whole society was moving toward commodified leisure, in which getting a ticket to watch something became more important than doing your own activity.
Snowshoeing also had a profound indirect effect on filmmaking in Quebec. In 1958, a National Film Board team led by Michel Brault went to Sherbrooke to shoot footage for a three-minute film about a big meeting of competitive snowshoe clubs. Brault shot 10,000 feet of film, almost all of it hand-held footage, even though he was lugging a 19-pound Arriflex camera. According to film historian André Loiselle, when Brault showed his raw work to his anglophone supervisor, he was told, "You can't do anything with this. It's just good for stock footage!"
Undiscouraged, Brault and editor Gilles Groulx secretly shaped the Sherbrooke footage into a 15-minute documentary that became the single most influential film in Quebec cinema. Brault's immersive shooting technique and pointed shot selection heralded the arrival of what became known internationally as "direct cinema." They were the basis for much of what subsequently came out of the NFB's francophone unit, and became the default aesthetic for many early Quebec feature films, including Brault's own (1967).
is still enormous fun to watch, and easier than ever to find - it streams for free on the NFB website. The events it captures with affection and irony take place in a social space free of self-consciousness. Everyone has a defined role, and a uniform to wear while doing it, whether tramping hard past barking dogs or twirling a baton with a showshoers' marching band. But under the well-ordered surface, the occasion seethes with anarchic brio, amped up by Marcel Carrière's unruly sound montage.
"We wanted to find the snowshoers' Dionysus," Brault said, and he succeeded during the closing dance scenes, when the camera fixes on a wild-eyed man whirling and dancing while blowing a harmonica. But the film's greatest single moment may be a wide shot of a train cutting the parade in two. It rushes through the pageantry like a herald of the Quiet Revolution that was about to rip apart the certainties of Quebec's Duplessis era.
Montreal has been sparse for blizzards this winter, but after one decent snowfall I took a pair of brand-new metal snowshoes out for my first-ever trek. I tramped up and down the low slopes by the St. Lawrence, between the trees and through weeds taller than myself. It felt good to be able to walk anywhere, over almost anything. Snowshoeing may be the closest thing in pedestrian life to feeling like a monster truck. It kind of made me want to storm Mount Royal by moonlight, with a blue tuque and in good company, and with something strong to drink along the way.

Full text:   At least it snowed in the hills.
Skiers will be happy to know that the Laurentians received 30 centimetres on Wednesday morning as heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions spared Montreal.
With up to 20 centimetres forecast for the city on Wednesday morning, there were fewer than 10 that actually fell by rush hour.
The blizzard warning for Montreal was lifted in the early hours of Wednesday. The revised forecast called for accumulation of just 10 centimetres for Montreal for the day, down significantly from the more than 20 centimetres predicted on Tuesday. That's not considered to be a major winter storm according to how Environment Canada categorizes weather events.
"For Montreal, the trajectory of the low-pressure system was a tad further north than expected," said Marie-Eve Giguere, a meteorologist with Environment Canada. "So that brought ice pellets mixed with snow. It really decreased the snowfall amounts and made for better visibility than expected."
Driving on highways was actually better than normal for a Wednesday morning rush hour, as there were fewer cars on the road, both because of severe weather warnings, and because it is spring break week for many schools.
But while driving conditions were much better than expected on roads and highways in Montreal, that was not the case further east and north. "It's particularly bad in the Laurentians and the Quebec City region," said Surete du Quebec Sgt. Helene Nepton. "We're seeing snow drifts that are pretty significant. The snow plows come, and a few minutes later, it's like they were never there."
She said a few cars spun out, but there were no serious accidents or injuries Wednesday morning.
The Mauricie region, which includes Trois-Rivieres, the Laurentians and the Quebec City region all still had blizzard conditions on Wednesday morning, Giguere said. She explained that a blizzard is not related to the amount of snowfall. Rather, it warns of reduced visibility because of snow and wind for more than four hours and a wind chill colder than minus-20C.
Wednesday's conditions caused some travel delays, especially at Trudeau Airport where several early morning flights to Toronto were cancelled Wednesday.
The skies are expected to clear for Thursday, with sunny days ahead from Thursday until Sunday, but it will be colder than normal for this time of year. Giguere said highs near -10 are forecast for Thursday and Friday. It will warm up to minus-6 on Saturday, and get close to the freezing point on Sunday, and temperatures well above zero are expected next week. The city of Montreal announced it will begin snow removal operations, with all boroughs expecting to begin clearing snow by 7 a.m. Thursday. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist

Maker of Assassin's Creed video game turns to Canadian investors to fend off takeover bid

Full text: The video game maker is in the crosshairs of media giant Viviendi SA
? Video game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment SA, maker of the series, is seeking the backing of Canadian investors to help fend off a creeping takeover in France from media giant Vivendi SA.
Ubisoft officials, led by founder and chief executive Yves Guillemot, confirmed they're meeting this week with a dozen potential investors in Montreal and Toronto in an attempt to build support for the company's founders and current management. Canada is already key for Ubisoft as a major game-development site, with Montreal home to its largest global studio. Now its financial community is being asked to play a role as well.
Mr. Guillemot and his four brothers started Ubisoft in France's Brittany region and own a minority stake, expanding it more than 30 years to become one of the world's top five video game publishers. They're trying to push away Vivendi and its billionaire chairman, Vincent Bolloré, who has amassed a 15-per-cent stake in Ubisoft in recent months and made an unsolicited takeover offer worth some 500-million euros ($750-million) for another Guillemot brothers-run gaming company, Gameloft SE.
The hostile bid on Gameloft is the first step in Vivendi's larger ploy to force talks with the Guillemot family and take over Ubisoft, analysts at European investment bank Bryan, Garnier & Co. have said.
At stake are more than 3,000 Ubisoft jobs in Montreal, Quebec, Toronto and Halifax, and hundreds of millions in capital invested since the company opened its first studio in Canada in 1997. Quebec has the most to lose, with Ubisoft representing a pillar of its multimedia industry.
Although it's unlikely Vivendi would shut down Ubisoft's Canadian studios outright, the assets would be better protected if Ubisoft remained independent, Mr. Guillemot told The Globe and Mail on Thursday. Ubisoft enjoys a decision-making and operational agility that it wouldn't have under Vivendi, and can forge better partnerships with global media players such as Warner Bros. instead of being forced to work with Vivendi's properties, the CEO said.
"We want to increase the number of Canadian shareholders in Ubisoft to have better control over the capital," Mr. Guillemot said, adding he's approaching investors with longer-term investment horizons who have a feel for the company's history and corporate culture. "We feel it's a good defence."
Ubisoft would welcome an investment by the Quebec government, Mr. Guillemot said, adding he met with Premier Philippe Couillard recently in Davos, Switzerland. Backing from Ottawa would also likely be welcome. Ubisoft has also met with investors in London.
Whether the effort to rally shareholders will be enough if Vivendi steps up the battle remains to be seen.
Mr. Guillemot and his brothers together own about 9 per cent of Ubisoft's equity and 16 per cent of the voting rights. Major shareholders Blackrock and Fidelity, which together own about 15 per cent of the company, side with the brothers, he said.
Mr. Guillemot said he believes he needs the support of 50 per cent or more of the votes to block Vivendi from making board changes during the next annual shareholders meeting scheduled for September.
Vivendi spokesman Simon Gillham did not return a message seeking comment.
The company appears determined to get back into gaming after unloading its stake in industry leader Activision Blizzard.
But it faces a monumental obstacle to making a Ubisoft takeover work in the years that follow: If it can't coax the Guillemot brothers into a friendly deal, it runs the risk of losing not only them but employees loyal to them in an industry that depends on creative talent.
"I think it's hard for Vivendi," said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, noting hostile takeovers in the media space are more the exception than the rule. "You really run the risk that the best people will walk out the door."
Earlier this month, Mr. Guillemot's team outlined a new three-year plan for Ubisoft that will see the company aim to boost annual revenue by 60 per cent to €2.2-billion by the end of 2019. It also believes it can achieve an operating profit margin of 20 per cent and free cash flow of about €300-million in that time frame.
"To achieve these goals, Ubisoft will employ a similar strategy as its larger competitors - fewer, bigger titles, especially multiplayer games that can drive more high-margin digital revenue," Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea said.

For most Montrealers, this is the winter of our content; We're also an aging population of older, frailer ice-terrified wimps

Abstract: [...]even there people are snowshoeing and sledding on artificial snow that's now being trucked in from St-Bruno, because it's too warm to even make snow in Montreal.

Full text:   Welcome to the winter that wasn't.
Montreal has become a nosnow zone, more reminiscent of April than February. Last week, some downtown cafe-terrasses were open and busy, with no heat lamps.
Our city feels like it's moved to Toronto or Washington for the winter - even the Big Apple has had more snow than us.
Our outdoor skating rinks are just puddles, an astonishing sight in mid-winter. Could that be the explanation for the Montreal Canadiens' staggering slump - a winter-city team suddenly teleported to the climate of the Carolina Hurricanes - robbed of its northern strength?
Our Syrian refugees must be stunned, sweating under their 25,000 thickly-knit, sub-zero tuques - and donated arctic parkas.
They were psychologically prepped to spend three months in a freezer, but last week Montreal was only slightly cooler than Beirut.
It's not just Quebec. Recordhigh temperatures have closed the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, and cancelled famed dogsled races in the Arctic, as Canada experiences the warmest, most snowless winter in its history.
I've managed to downhill ski, cross-country and snowshoe in the Laurentians, but I've also biked in Montreal many days when the streets were snowless and the weather mild. It's like life in Vancouver.
The best news is we're saving a bundle on snow-clearing. Our annual budget is $155 million, so there must be a fortune left over - what can we spend it on? If it gets any warmer how about opening our playgrounds and swimming pools a little earlier - like next week?
The most revealing part of our missing winter is how few people I've heard complaining. Some hearty souls genuinely miss the freezing cold, but for most Montrealers, this is our winter of content.
Meteorologists have given us permission not to feel guilty, by blaming the freaky weather on a super El Nino - not Warmaggedon. But it's hard to ignore that 15 of the last 16 winters have broken all-time records for warmth - enough to give anyone a chill.
The truth is we Quebecers are losing our passion for winter. Yes, the Fete des Neiges has been crowded with winter-lovers in Jean Drapeau Park. But even there people are snowshoeing and sledding on artificial snow that's now being trucked in from St-Bruno, because it's too warm to even make snow in Montreal.
What next - will we have to fly in snow from Iqaluit?
Igloofest is also going strong at the Old Port, though they have to remake their igloos and ice bars every night - inside a refrigerator.
Surveys report 25 per cent of Quebecers still "love" winter, but the rest of us have a conflicted relationship with it. We love snow on ski hills, country trails and someone else's rooftop. We love snow on Christmas Eve, especially if it's gone by New Year's Day.
But we've started to see routine cold winters as an enemy. A typical winter weather forecast rarely mentions anything as innocent as a "snowfall." It's filled with blizzards, cold fronts, black ice, wind chill, freezing drizzle and warnings like: "Sidewalks are expected to be icy and slippery, turning to dangerous and treacherous. Roads are hopeless, traffic is impossible and a southern vacation alert is in effect."
What happened to us? We grew up in a country famed for its winter spirit, in fierce weather we barely gave a second thought.
In part, our disenchantment is because we live in modern big cities where winter brings traffic jams, accidents, wind tunnels, slush puddles, snow plow sirens, and towed-away cars - all blessedly absent this year.
We're also an aging population that feels the weight of winter more - a nation of older, frailer ice-terrified wimps who can't see a snowstorm without dreaming of a snowplow.
La Presse columnist Alain Dubuc wrote Maudit Hiver, a book about winter that adds a deeper modern cause to our fading winter soul. He says with Quebec's Quiet Revolution, francophones began rejecting many symbols of the past: the church, traditional families and rural life - along with its brutal country winters.
So Gilles Vigneault's epic "Winter Is My Country" is now an outmoded mythology - replaced by "Winter is Mi-ami."
This year, Miami's come a little closer to us. Environment Canada's senior climatologist, David Phillips, says this is the warmest winter ever recorded, so its effects are unknown.
Things can always change overnight - but Phillips fears this winter won't be cold enough to kill offpests and insects that carry disease in spring. He worries about hordes of grasshoppers, plagues of deer tics spreading Lyme disease, and who know what else - alligators in the swamps of the Laurentians, sharks and piranha in the warming St. Lawrence?
Even you winter-haters out there might want to pray for some blizzards and minus 30 days, to make sure we get our usual Montreal summer, with the usual mosquitoes - not the Zika kind. Joshfreed49@gmail.com

Full text:   "Everything moves real slow when it's 40 below ..." - Sam Roberts, The Canadian Dream
The online world was captivated last week by a dramatic image out of Montreal. A snowy owl swooping through the sky was captured on Jan. 3 by a CCTV camera located at the intersection of Highway 40 and Sources Blvd., in the West Island. Quebec Transport Minister Robert Poeti took to Twitter and Facebook on Thursday to share the images of the majestic creature, soaring high with wings aloft.
This carnivorous hunter - which happens to be the official bird of Quebec - comes at the viewer in a series of slow-motion images as it looks for a place to perch.
The backdrop: a frozen, stark, urban landscape with empty black highways and strip malls. It makes for a stunning visual. The photos have since gone viral online and been shared millions of times all around the globe.
Winter warriors of Montreal: behold your standard bearer.
You know who you are. Those of you who brave the elements every year when the mercury dips below zero, who are out cross-country skiing every morning or biking to work against the Arctic winds when blizzards sweep through the city. All you folks who go winter camping and ice fishing on the weekends, and play hockey on the outdoor rinks until late into the night, frostbite be damned! My heroes. I salute you.
Just so that we're clear, I love getting out in the winter as much as the next person. I enjoy the activities it has to offer. I will happily suit up in my long johns and parka to go sledding with my kids on Mount Royal or skating on the pond at Parc St-Viateur. I love breaking out the snowshoes to get out to our log cabin in the Laurentians. But if I'm honest, most of the time my impulse during these cold months is to cocoon indoors. One of my favourite snowstorm pursuits is to climb under a stack of heavy blankets and read novels by candlelight while listening to ice pellets lash against the windowpane. I read until my eyes are heavy. When I can't keep them open any longer, I give myself permission to doze offcontentedly. Bliss. I mean, honestly. Who wants to go outside in that kind of weather? When the temperature drops and the snow is piling up outside, I am of the firm belief that there is nothing better than battening down the hatches and gathering around a crackling fire with friends. (Consider this my lament for Montreal's persecuted wood burning fireplaces.) A pot of tea and the physical weight of a good book are my mid-winter anchors.
(By the way, the Danish - who experience the same kind of long, dark winters we have here in Canada - have a great word for the feeling I've just described: Hygge, pronounced "hoo-ga." Apparently, there is no direct English translation, but I'm told it translates loosely as feeling cozy, cared for and being part of a warm social atmosphere. Some have even suggested that hygge is an etymological relative of the word "hug" in English. How great is that?) Anyhow, maybe it's my penchant for wanting to stay inside and cozy during the winter that explains why I'm so charmed by Montreal's snowy owl and the attention it's getting all over the world. More than one online viewer of the images suggested that they looked like a scene from one of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Magical. Otherworldly.
But Montrealers who take Quebec author and songwriter Gilles Vigneault's celebrated lyrics to heart ("mon pays ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver!"/My country is not a country, it is winter) might also see this snowy owl as a spontaneous reminder of the whimsy and wildness that thrive here in our own northern place.

Full text:   December showers bring January flowers - recent Montreal winter rhyme.
Unseasonal greetings, everyone. Our weirdly tropical December, November, October and September have made weather the hottest topic in town.
Christmas is supposed to come gift-wrapped in swirling snowdrifts, frosted windshields and the wail of tow trucks dragging your car away. It's supposed to make you feel that: "The weather outside is frightful, But the fire is so delightful." Instead it's as warm as Labour Day.
So far there's been no "snow glistening," or "sleigh bells jingling," or cash registers ringing up big winter clothing sales, since we're all dressing for early fall.
There's been no skiing or skating, because people are still skateboarding and golfing. In fact, I've been taking my last bike ride of the year up Mount Royal regularly for the last 30 days.
There are two ways to view our eerie warm weather, depending on your personality type:
TYPE 1 - APOCALYPSE-NOW: If you're a Type 1, it's easy to see signs of approaching doom everywhere. Spring daffodils are blooming in England, roses are blossoming in New York and lush green grass is thriving in your Montreal backyard.
Our city's squirrels have spent so many weeks stuffing themselves silly for hibernation they look fat enough to explode.
TYPE 1 fears we are seeing a Dickensian "Ghost of Christmas Future" - a glimpse of Montreal in 20 years as climate change increases, making every winter this warm, or warmer.
They envision a bleak, snowless time when our rivers are drying up - and there are swamp tours run in the St. Lawrence Everglades Forest to see the parrots and alligators.
A time when droves of refugees from flooded Florida arrive each day, seeking safety in shacks built on the high ground of Mount Royal - and there's talk of building a wall to keep them out, under Prime Minister Trudeau the Third.
A time when skiing and hockey are only memories, replaced by desert beach volleyball and camel-racing in the Lake St. Louis Gulch.
Type 1 just can't enjoy this winter's warm weather, without feeling irresponsible. Yet there's another kind of person who feels that complaining about a warm winter is unnatural for a Canadian. They are: TYPE 2 - PARADISE FOUND: These snow-weary Canadians have had enough of the white stuff, especially after last winter's Snowmageddon. They feel guilty, but happy.
They say things like: "I know the warm winter is bad for the planet, but it feels good to me. ... No, I'm sorry. I apologize - I shouldn't have said that. I know its wrong, very wrong. Only it feels so wonderful!" Many of them did miss having a White Christmas - but only yesterday. Today they see many benefits of a warm winter.
With no snow falling, the City's saved a bundle on snowclearing while the rest of us save on home heating. People are mostly in a good mood - no one's complaining about icy sidewalks and poor snow removal.
Our roads are so snow and ice-free we may not even get our usual crop of spring potholes to complain about.
There's not even any reason to book a winter holiday in Florida, since the last week's weather brought Miami to Montreal - where Canadian money is still accepted at par.
Type 2 knows there's something about this winter that's creepy - but they'd rather worry about it later.
In fact this winter, the weatherman is in their camp. According to meteorologists our warm winter isn't much due to global warming.
It's mainly caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation - a warming phenomenon in the Eastern Pacific that hits every five years. Only this year they're calling it "the Godzilla of El Ninos."
Snow and ice may have gone missing here, but they've showed up in Texas, Mississippi and California - while Calgary and Vancouver ski slopes are buried in snow.
We've traded places with Vancouver this year - but it's only fair for them to occasionally share the pain.
Whatever type you are, seize the moment while it lasts. On Dec 17, 2011, I began a Gazette column this way: "This December feels more like October. The streets are filled with people in fall clothing, sneakers and shorts. I've been barbecuing outdoors and biking on Mount Royal - along with hordes of winter joggers usually hiding at the gym."
One day later, winter arrived in a huge snowstorm and the mercury soon plunged to minus 29. So soak up the warmth before a sudden reverse oscillation polar de-vortex brings our winter boots out of hibernation and sends our squirrels into it.
Remember: the shortest day of the year is over and spring is only a heartbeat and several blizzards away.
Frankly, I'm dreaming of a Green New Year's so we can all party outside. But after that: Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow! Joshfreed49@gmail.com

Full text:   Bonjour/hi, Syrian refugees!
Welcome to our city and our country. You've had a week to adjust to the warm December weather, even if you don't realize how great it's been.
It's not just the climate that's warm. Quebecers have opened their homes, hearts and clothing closets to you. From N.D.G. to Trois-Rivieres, they've been feverishly knitting you hats for the "25,000 tuques campaign," while others attempt hand-knitted sweaters and ice scrapers. The Canada Council is providing you with free kids' books and $200,000 in museum, art and theatre tickets. I hope the Canadiens don't shower you with free season tickets or we might turn some of you into scalpers.
I know Toronto refugee agencies are giving advice on Canadian culture from "what's a double-double?" (two creams, two sugars) to "what's a toonie?" (two loonies). But here are some tips on life in Montreal:
WEATHER
You've gotten a break from our new PM's "sunny ways", which have heated up our environment and added to global warming.
You could easily have arrived in a howling blizzard or ice storm that tempted you to get back on the plane and take your chances with refugee camps, or civil war. You could have spent the last week helping shovel out your sponsoring family's car, or deicing their windshield, or flapping about in giant mittens that will feel like flippers at first.
Winter is our country, but if you're lucky it won't be this year.
POLITICS
You've had some lucky timing there too, as our new government has made you Syrian refugees an inspiring national symbol to replace our last government's symbols: winning more Olympic medals, building more prisons and putting up more pictures of the Queen.
You've come to the right place at the right time. In Trumplandia to our south, presidential candidates and governors are trying to defriend a quarter of the world's population and put up "No Muslims allowed" signs.
They want to give religion tests to new immigrants like you, presumably a two-step border identification process:
Ask if you're Muslim - and deport you if the answer is "yes."
If it's "no," give you a free bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich - then deport you if you won't eat it, along with some unlucky vegetarians.
But here, Canadians are eager to embrace you with compassion, partly to help - and partly to restore our self-image as a country where love trumps hate.
Our PM greeted you at the airport, along with opposition MPs, creating an international buzz that's made us the poster child for welcoming immigrants. We've gotten rave reviews in European and American media and high praise in a New York Times editorial saying "Canada's generosity and Mr. Trudeau's personal warmth ... can serve as a beacon for others."
So thank you Syrians - you're doing as much for us as we are for you.
SAFETY
Some of you may still be afraid to take out the garbage at night, but unlike your old country you can walk anywhere, anytime. There are no armed militia, snipers or zealots eager to measure a woman's hemline.
There's no army on the streets - we barely have one. There's no curfew, except last call at 3 a.m. and our mayor wants to make that 6. There's no ISIS trying to ice you - or us.
Our only danger at night is Montreal cyclists who dress entirely in black, while wearing earphones and texting. Our only legally sanctioned violence is at hockey games.
CITY LIFE
I've travelled through Syria so I know you're not impressed by our potholes, as yours were competitive - and that was before the bomb craters.
However our new city symbol is the orange cone you'll see lining every street, far outnumbering fleur-de-lis or maple leafs. Our cones are unpredictable, exasperating and chaotic - like our city - but you shouldn't have to worry about them until spring.
Our local landmarks are Mount Royal, the molehill we call a mountain, along with the St. Lawrence, whose bridge traffic jams are our only obstacle to weekend freedom. Our mayor is Coderre, our premier Couillard and eventually you'll learn to tell them apart.
LANGUAGE
Take your French lessons seriously: many anglos didn't and wound up living in other cities - and we want you to stay. But learn English, too. In fact, many English words are also handy when speaking French, like: Eniwe.
Tres cool. Bain fun. Bon weekend. "Un smoked meat, s'il vous plait!" P.K. Subban Overall, you've come to a great town where anglophones, francophones and xylophones have always solved our differences peacefully. We're a land of many immigrants, whether we came 500 years ago or drifted over later and stayed - but there's always room for more.
So welcome, bienvenue, ciao, l'chaim and Joyeux Noel. I'm sorry you just missed Hanukkah. Joshfreed49@gmail.com

An emotional pre-game salute to France

Author: Stubbs, Dave

Abstract: A moment of absolute silence, a quiet not heard in this full arena since the breathless salute last Dec. 9 to the late Jean Beliveau, was followed by the playing of La Marseillaise, the flag of France digitally rustling the full length and breadth of the rink; fans cheered as the anthem played, their camera-phones appearing as points of light by the thousands throughout the arena bowl.

Full text:   This would be an emotional evening at the Bell Centre, from before the puck dropped between the Canadiens' Tomas Plekanec and Colorado's Matt Duchene.
One of the two flag-bearers on Saturday, young hockey players who traditionally skate a lap around the Habs' end to precede the home team onto the ice, was carrying the blue, white and red flag of France, the other gripping the CH.
A moment of absolute silence, a quiet not heard in this full arena since the breathless salute last Dec. 9 to the late Jean Beliveau, was followed by the playing of La Marseillaise, the flag of France digitally rustling the full length and breadth of the rink; fans cheered as the anthem played, their camera-phones appearing as points of light by the thousands throughout the arena bowl.
Friday's horrifying attacks in Paris were still painfully fresh when the Canadiens saluted the nation with which Quebec holds a special, historic bond. It was the second time in 10 months that La Marseilleise filled the Bell Centre before a Habs game, the first a show of solidarity with a deeply scarred France last January following the murderous Charlie Hebdo shootings.
The Canadiens were unbeaten in regulation on home ice this season with seven victories alongside one overtime loss. And a look at the standings suggested the Avalanche, last in the Western Conference Central Division, seemed more like a flurry, no matter their modest two-game win streak.
Indeed, the Habs were a blizzard around the Colorado goal for the first 18 minutes, outshooting their visitors 18-8 in the first period.
But the Avalanche, having taken a 1-0 lead just 3:26 after the opening faceoff, slammed home two goals 13 seconds apart with time winding down, Nathan MacKinnon scoring both.
Has MacKinnon ever scored consecutive goals more quickly?
"Maybe in atom," he said, with a laugh, after the game.
It was no laughing matter for the Canadiens. At 3-0, the rout was on.
"No way we should have been up 3-0 in the first," Avalanche head coach Patrick Roy said, "but it happens."
Brendan Gallagher gave the Habs a breath of life midway through the second period, closing the gap to two goals, before Blake Comeau scored shorthanded on Montreal goalie Mike Condon, an ugly shot to the fivehole that sucked the air out of the Bell Centre.
"Scoring that fourth goal was really important to us," Roy said. "We were short-handed and Montreal had the momentum."
The Avalanche then scored a pair 3:05 apart midway through the third to send the fans streaming to the exits, the Canadiens losing their second straight for only the second time this season, the first coming in Vancouver and Edmonton in late October.
goalie Reto Berra wasn't seeing a few pucks. The Canadiens registered 40 shots, P.K. Subban leading the way with eight, Gallagher, linemate Max Pacioretty and defenceman JeffPetry taking six each.
Another 22 shots blocked en route to Berra and 13 more that missed the target show the Canadiens fired 75 times, compared with 40 by the Avalanche, 24 of which made it to the net.
On Sunday morning, Berra led the NHL in goals-against, with a 1.50 average, and a save percentage with .953.
"It's weird," Berra said later, speaking of sitting atop the league's goaltending mountain.
"Probably not," he added when asked whether he'd have believed anyone in September who told him he'd be leading two categories in mid-November. "It's an unbelievable feeling, it's hard to describe right now," said Berra, now 1-1 lifetime against the Canadiens.
In groin-injury relief of defacto No. 1 Semyon Varlamov, Berra has found a groove deeper than a Montreal sewer repair. His effort Saturday swelled the chest of Roy, who's played a decent game of goal or two in this city.
"In the first, they dominated us," the coach said of the Canadiens. "They had a really good first period (but) Reto was perfect. He made some great saves, kept us in the game and gave us a chance to take the lead. That's the role goaltenders can play in today's game. ... "I always enjoy coming back to Montreal," Roy said. "Do I make it bigger than it is? No. It's the two points that matter."
All the confident Berra is doing, he said, is "enjoying the moment" as his team claws its way up the standings.
Which is more than could be said Saturday for Condon, who was entirely human while not getting a lot of help on the back end. Late in the game, a few fickle leatherlungs in the cheap(er) seats tried unsuccessfully to organize a chant of "Car-ey! Car-ey!" It was a sarcastic jab at Condon, who admittedly was porous - four goals on 11 shots for a .636 save percentage - and his third-period reliever Dustin Tokarski, who yielded two on 13 shots coming cold offthe bench.
Condon has only been mostly superb since stepping into the skates of injured Carey Price, who's been out for two weeks with a lower-body injury.
Saturday's loss to Colorado, put in the context of the evening and the event that sadly and stirringly lifted its curtain, was two points not gained. It was nothing more. dstubbs@montrealgazette.com twitter/Dave_Stubbs

The wait was agonizing; A look back at that referendum night 20 years ago, when both sides could taste victory and the future seemed impossible to predict

Full text:   For 140 minutes, Canada held its breath.
A see-saw Yes-No battle raged through the evening of Oct. 30, 1995, capping a four-week campaign that began with the No side leading 60-40 and ended with polls showing a 50-50 split.
Tension was running high and the deep divisions would eventually spill into the streets, albeit briefly, with riot police breaking up confrontations between bitter Yes and celebrating No supporters on Ste-Catherine St.
But before the scuffles, before Premier Jacques Parizeau's infamous concession speech, before a chastened prime minister Jean Chretien addressed the nation from an Ottawa studio, before investigations into whether the No side cheated by funding a unity rally at Place du Canada and whether the Yes side cheated by rejecting valid No votes, there was the counting of the ballots.
And the waiting. Between the end of voting at 8 p.m. and the declaration of a winner at 10:20 p.m., most Quebecers were glued to their TV sets.
This is a look back at those tense hours, based on news coverage and interviews with former premier Jean Charest, at the time leader of the Progressive Conservatives and a prominent No campaigner; and Parti Quebecois MNA Jean-Francois Lisee, at the time an adviser and speech writer to Parizeau.
"The mood throughout the day was sombre, and even more so as we were watching the results," recalls Charest, one of the few No leaders who managed to galvanize voters during the campaign. "What I remember is how little people were talking; we just sat there and watched."
"We would whisper among ourselves because (Parizeau) had decided to be silent, to just take it in," Lisee says of the suite where Parizeau and his closest advisers awaited results that night.
PRELUDE: A HISTORIC DAY
It's sunny as dawn breaks in Montreal but it would soon become cloudy, as cloudy as the predictions for what would happen when the yea and nay votes were counted.
Two warriors - Jacques Parizeau and Jean Chretien - awoke that day unsure of their fates.
Parizeau because he had rolled the dice with the referendum call and had been forced to hand the initially struggling Yes camp to the more-popular Lucien Bouchard, without whom the eventual rise in the polls would have been impossible. Chretien because he had squandered a commanding lead in a life-and-death battle for the future of Canada.
The Yes side hoped the youth vote would take it over the top. The No side suspected shy federalists were reluctant to tell pollsters they were voting No but would come through at the ballot box.
As polls open at 10 a.m., the temperature hovers around 2 degrees Celsius. A few flakes would fall that day. But even a blizzard wouldn't have stopped voters. In total, 5,087,009 Quebecers were eligible to vote. Most would do their duty.
Parizeau voted in Outremont and spent much of the rest of the day holed up with advisers at his office at Hydro-Quebec headquarters in downtown Montreal, preparing for the night and the aftermath of a Yes vote. He recorded two 18-minute video messages - one in French, one in English - that would be broadcast in the event of a Yes. Two cameras had been ordered but only one was delivered, so Parizeau couldn't make a mistake as editing would not be possible - he had to shoot each of the messages in one take. In them, he told the world how he would create a new country.
Parizeau also gave a secret TV interview to be broadcast only after the results were known. In it, he said he would quit as premier on referendum night if the result was No (his advisers later convinced him to wait a day).
At about 7:30 p.m., Parizeau and his closest advisers, Jean-Francois Lisee and Jean Royer, and his wife, Lisette Lapointe, moved to a suite overlooking the main hall at the Palais des congres, where the Yes side would await results.
As for Chretien, he awoke in Shawinigan that morning and voted in nearby Grand-Mere before flying back to Ottawa. The No side's referendum-night base was the Metropolis, a Montreal bar/concert venue on Ste-Catherine St., a 10-minute walk from the Yes side HQ.
But Chretien opted to stay in Ottawa, ensconcing himself in 24 Sussex Drive to watch the results, with his wife, Aline, and key advisers including political aide Eddie Goldenberg.
ACT 1 (8 TO 9:30 P.M.): A YES SURGE
8:04 p.m. Early results trickle in. It's Yes, 50.5 per cent; No, 49.8 per cent. Only 95 votes are counted but the 48 vs. 47 count is a taste of what's to come.
Night has fallen. On CBC, a gloomy live shot of a darkened 24 Sussex Dr., light emanating from the glass front door.
In Toronto, former Canadiens great Ken Dryden tells an interviewer: "I'm absolutely nervous here, as if a performance or a game was about to begin but also realizing that things are beyond control."
8:20 p.m. Yes has surged: It's at 56.7 per cent vs. 43.3 per cent for the No.
But there's no jumping up and down in Parizeau's suite. Instead, silence reigns.
"When you're with the premier in the room, the premier sets the tone," PQ MNA Jean-Francois Lisee, a Parizeau adviser at the time, told the Montreal Gazette this month. "If he wants to chat, you chat. If he wants to stay silent, you respect that. And (Parizeau) was silent.
"We were watching the results, we would whisper among ourselves because he had decided to be silent, to just take it in."
Early on "we thought we would win, and so he probably awaited the enormous responsibility that would come with a win. That would have been his moment, his career achievement."
On election nights, "if you're doing well, there's a lot of energy in the room and people are talking and reacting to what's happening," former premier Jean Charest told the Montreal Gazette this month. "A referendum where the issue is the future of the country is pretty unique, so you feel very, very real pressure of what the outcome will be."
Charest is watching the results with his wife, Michele Dionne, and close advisers, in a suite at the Crowne Plaza Hotel on Sherbrooke St. in downtown Montreal.
"We were all very anxious and nervous," he says. With Yes leading, "I was thinking, 'My God, if this is the result of the evening, we're all going to be in a lot of trouble tomorrow morning.' All my instincts told me that folks weren't ready for this, people didn't have a clue what they were going to end up with."
In Ottawa, Chretien, too, is edgy. "We were realists," he would later tell an interviewer. "I didn't know" what the result would be.
"I was nervous." Montreal results, expected to heavily favour the No side, are slow in coming.
Early results show that in other traditional Liberal ridings, the Yes side is doing better than expected.
CBC reports the Canadian dollar has dropped 30 basis points.
A Greek-Canadian is asked what he will do if it's a Yes. "I'll still be here tomorrow," he tells a CBC reporter.
"I'm a Quebecer and I'll stay in Quebec, but it will mean some serious problems."
With Yes now at 55 per cent, singer Richard Seguin, a staunch sovereignist, is jubilant, as is the rest of the crowd at Bar Medley on St. Denis St., where the band Les Colocs is hosting a referendumnight party.
"We don't want to be distinct, we want to be sovereign!" Seguin tells a reporter, in front of a cheering, fleur-de-lis waving crowd. "Yes, we are confident!" Two thousand young, mostly-Yes supporters are crowded into
the Medley, watching the results on giant screens. Colocs frontman Andre (Dede) Fortin had promised that if the Yes side wins, 'we'll celebrate;' if it's a No, 'we'll get drunk.' The mood is more sombre at a seniors' residence in Sherbrooke, where the average age is 78. A reporter tells Radio-Canada anchor Bernard Derome that some of the residents have moved their money to Ontario or New Brunswick in case of a Yes victory. Fearing a Yes, some "practically have their bags packed."
At Montreal's Palais des congres, energized Yes voters are pumped, chanting "Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye!" In Vancouver, a TV panel of average Canadians weighs in.
One man says he's not worried. Canada can survive if Quebec leaves a hole between Atlantic Canada and the ROC, he says. Look at Alaska and Hawaii - they remain viable despite not being physically connected to the rest of the United States. Next up: a woman says she's "horrified" that voters in one province "can tear the whole country apart."
At the Yes side party, PQ vicepresident Monique Simard is interviewed in front of a boisterous crowd. "I can see the rest of Canada is a bit stunned," she says. That's because "the Canadian political class did not prepare Canadians" for a Yes. She says Canadians should realize that a Yes vote isn't "against Canada and Canadians; it's for Quebec."
8:39 p.m. An estimate of the votes counted so far indicates 92 per cent of anglophones have voted No, as have 79 per cent of allophones. As for francophones, it's 59 per cent Yes. To win, all sides agree, the Yes needs 60 per cent of French-speakers to say "Oui."
"There's a good chance that they (the Yes side) could win it by a percentage point," political scientist Alain Gagnon tells a reporter.
8:52 p.m. Montreal votes still aren't coming in. Speculation is that the long lineups at polling stations mean voters cast ballots after 8 p.m. In ridings that voted No in 1980 (which ended in a No victory, 59.56 per cent to 40.44 per cent), the Yes vote is up by about 12 per cent, a good omen for sovereignists.
At Laval University in Quebec City, two students - a Yes and a No - stand on either side of a reporter.
"Canada is a great country but for me, the best way to take our future in our hands is ... to be sovereign as a nation," one says. On the other side: "I still believe in Canada very much, I still believe that there can be solidarity between both cultures that founded this country."
CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge suggests that, because it's so close, "crisis is the looming word," whether Quebec votes Yes or No.
A prominent No supporter says the federation must change, even if his side wins. "People in Quebec voted for change within Canada and I guess this time around there will be change to prevent us from going through this traumatic experience again," says Marcel Cote, a prominent economist who would go on to run for Montreal's mayoralty.
More Montreal results are trickling in. The western part of the island is heavily No, but the Yes isn't doing as well as expected in the east.
9:05 p.m. The very high turnout rate could give the Yes side an advantage, Lisee tells a reporter, because it likely means more youth went to the polls, and youth tends to vote Yes.
Asked what Parizeau will say in his speech, Lisee isn't specific. "He is a man of state. We say around him that Quebec has a head of state before it has a state, and you'll see it whatever way it turns out."
9:07 p.m. With 30 per cent of ballots counted, it's Yes 50.7 per cent, No 49.3 per cent. Just 20,000 votes separate the two sides.
Won't a close No win lead to more headaches? "The problems of victory are infinitely preferable to the problems of defeat," Liberal MP Brian Tobin tells a reporter.
For young people in Quebec, sovereignty is "a deep conviction. Whatever the result tonight, people across the country - Canada - have to understand that for the young people in Quebec, their country is Quebec and this conviction will still be there," a young Yes organizer tells an interviewer.
At Yes HQ, "we try to remain calm but we believe, we really believe, that it's going to be Yes," Lisette Lapointe, Parizeau's wife and adviser, later recalls.
In Toronto, author Pierre Berton is uneasy. "I haven't had such squeamishness since the Blue Jays entered the World Series (in 1993)," he says. He fears a close No victory would mean "years of negotiation" with Quebec.
The tight race shows a cleavage in the "soul of Quebec," says lawyer Yves Fortier, a prominent No supporter. If it's a Yes, "I can't for the life of me think that we can build a country on that kind of division."
On the same TV panel, Yes campaigner Josee Legault zooms in on the francophone vote - 58 per cent Yes so far. If it's a narrow No victory, "it means you've got a serious legitimacy problem in this country ... and the federal government is going to have to put something on the table," Legault says. No organizer John Parisella answers: "You have a serious legitimacy problem if you have a very close Yes vote." Quebecers' choice was between crisis (a Yes vote) and change (a No vote), he insists. Parisella tells Legault: "I take strong issue to the francophone/anglophone division because when you're talking about the breakup of a country, every vote is equal, every vote counts."
At 24 Sussex, the tension is thick, Chretien adviser Eddie Goldenberg would later tell an interviewer. "I recall myself at one stage being so nervous - we'd been watching it on the second floor of the prime minister's residence. I couldn't take it anymore. I walked downstairs to try to find another television where I could be by myself. We were very, very nervous."
Reports confirm counting has been slow because long lineups led to a delay in the closing of some polls. The few votes that have been counted in Montreal show 66-percent No and 34-per-cent Yes.
In Ottawa, an apprehensive Finance Minister Paul Martin is watching the results in his department's bunker, surrounded by advisers. "I think there were more people there that night than on a normal workday," Martin recalled last year. "But when the results started coming in, you would have heard a pin drop."
9:25 p.m. The race is tightening. Yes, 50.12; No, 49.88. It's deathly quiet at the Palais des congres.
ACT 2 (9:34 P.M. -9:46 P.M.): IT' S TIED
With 65.7 per cent of votes counted, it's 50-50.
After a near-death experience, the crowd at No HQ erupts. They're chanting "Ca-na-da, Ca-na-da!" and singing O Canada.
So far, only the Montreal and Outaouais regions have voted No. The rest of the province is Yes blue.
9:41 p.m. "For a lot of Quebecers, this would be the worst-case scenario," the CBC's Jason Moscovitz says. "The No side winning a narrow victory with the vast majority of French-speaking Quebecers having voted Yes. Tension, social tension - all these things are possible.
... There will be a lot of bitterness."
In Parizeau's suite, it has become clear a Yes will not materialize.
"When we saw the results coming from Quebec City and the Beauce, we saw that we wouldn't have the majority that we needed," Lisee said. Jean Royer, Parizeau's chief of staff, breaks it to the premier. Parizeau doesn't react, maintaining his stoic demeanour. "Quebec City was a clue that we could get through," Charest says. "If the Yes side was going to win they had to have very strong support there, which they were not getting."
But Charest and other No campaigners aren't popping champagne. First, they need to see how much the Montreal vote tally would help.
"This wasn't about winning, this was about survival - about getting through with enough votes to push back and say, 'Well, there's a winner and a loser.' "
ACT 3 (9:47 P.M. -10:19 P.M.): NO TAKES THE LEAD
9:47 p.m. The No side leads by 16,781 votes. So far, 3,584,835 ballots have been counted. At Metropolis, people who had been on the verge of tears earlier are cheering and waving Canadian flags. But with 78.6 per cent of votes counted, it's only 50.2 No, 49.8 Yes.
9:51 p.m. In a Palais des congres suite overlooking the Yes hall, TV cameras capture Jacques Parizeau through a window. He is pacing, a glass in hand.
With 86.5 per cent of votes counted, it's 50.26 No, 49.74 Yes "There is no reason to be depressed if the Yes loses by a very small margin," vice-premier Bernard Landry says on Radio-Canada. "The country we were awaiting tonight we will have maybe tomorrow. ... There's maybe a small delay that will be imposed by democracy."
Sovereignists must pick themselves up, "without bitterness, acrimony or animosity" and continue the battle. "If it's not tonight, it's a matter of time." Landry seems eager to deliver another message to sovereignists. "Let's not seek to lay blame," he says. "We can blame the system, we can blame history - but not men and women who in good faith voted No."
9:53 p.m. CBC notes the apparently high number of rejected ballots in some ridings.
10:08 p.m. The mood is sombre at Yes HQ. "Nationalism is not done in Quebec, and the rest of Canada is going to have to deal with this reality," an impassive Yes supporter tells a reporter. If Yes loses, "Quebec has a great respect for democracy. Everybody will accept the result but the question will not be resolved ... the people of Quebec will continue the battle for recognition."
TV networks say the Yes side isn't conceding yet, in part because results are sparse from a riding in the northern Laurentians that had voted massively for the PQ a year earlier.
On a CBC panel, Parisella bristles when told his No side is also a loser because it squandered a significant early lead. "A victory is a victory," Parisella says. "It may be a victory but you've lost," political scientist Alain Gagnon retorts.
ACT 4 (10:20): NO BY A WHISKER
TV networks declare a victor: it's a No.
With 96.4 per cent of votes counted, it's No, 50.38; Yes, 49.62.
A huge roar goes up at Metropolis, as Radio-Canada's Derome declares: "A majority of Quebecers for the second time in 15 years reject the idea that Quebec become a sovereign country and choose that Quebec stays in Canada. ... It's a narrow victory, but a victory nonetheless."
"We only really knew when Bernard Derome said the No side had won, it was that close," says Charest, who then made his way to Metropolis to speak to the partying crowd. At Yes HQ, it's silence. Sullenly, sovereignists look up at big screens, some holding their heads in grief, others hugging and sobbing, their dream shattered.
"It was devastating," Lapointe recalled. "It was as if your blood had turned to ice. It was like being hit with a sledgehammer. His (Parizeau's) dream had turned to dust."
In Parizeau's suite, only five people are supposed to remain to prepare before the premier's concession speech - Parizeau, Lapointe, Lisee, Royer and a bodyguard - but a stream of people comes in to commiserate.
Lisee said he tried to discuss "the tone" Parizeau should take, encouraging him to be "generous" in his speech.
"We were having a hard time because Mr. Parizeau didn't want to talk about this. (Instead), he was venting frustration, his disappointment, everything that he had done, all the sacrifices he had to go through during his life.
"This was a momentous event, we went from 40-per-cent Yes in 1980 to almost 50 ... (Parizeau) had always put the idea of independence above his ego (but) on that night, he was really centered on the damage (the loss) was causing him."
Parizeau indicated he "was going to be blunt" in his speech, but Lisee said he didn't know what that meant. Lisee offered to write a concession speech and Parizeau accepted.
EPILOGUE: UGLY ENDING After a winner is declared, fights break out near Metropolis, as supporters of the two sides spill out of their respective headquarters, which are less than a kilometre apart. There is pushing and shoving, storefront windows are broken, groups yell "Quebec!" and "Canada!" at one another.
But police - 450 of them in uniform and undercover and in a helicopter overhead - keep order. By the end of the night, five officers are injured and 39 people are arrested on charges including mischief, possession of homemade firebombs and illegal assembly. The Vaudreuil riding office of provincial Liberal leader Daniel Johnson is torched.
Animosity also remains within the two camps.
That night, Parizeau and Lucien Bouchard, whose personalities, styles and strategies clashed, had watched the results in separate Palais des congres suites and only spoke once - briefly and by phone, after the final result was known.
After a conciliatory speech by Bouchard, Parizeau takes the stage at 11:15 p.m. but never takes the prepared speech out of his pocket. He thanks his troops and says the Yes side will live to fight again.
But instead of rallying all Quebecers, he bitterly blames "money and ethnic votes" for the sovereignist defeat. The speech would haunt him for the rest of his days.
On the No side, during Charest's speech, TV networks switch to Chretien's address to the nation. "I walk offthe stage and my wife, Michele, tells me, 'That was a pretty good speech - too bad no one caught it." Some saw it as a deliberate attempt by federal Liberals to divert attention from political rival Charest, who had impressed voters with his passionate No speeches, passport in hand.
Chretien arrives at Parliament Hill in a dark blue sedan. A cheering, flag-waving crowd awaits him. But the prime minister is shaken and shows it in his televised address, just before midnight. "I was caught by surprise" by the high number of Yes votes, he later admits.
Proceedings would eventually be launched against people involved in both the Oct. 27, 1995, unity rally (cheap bus and airline tickets and other costs were not factored into No side spending limits) and the rejection of a disproportionately high number of ballots in some No ridings, but they were later dropped.
All but 329,500 of eligible voters cast ballots on Oct. 30, 1995. At 93.5 per cent, it was the highest voter turnout in Quebec history. No: 2,362,648. Yes: 2,308,360. (Or 50.58 per cent to 49.42 per cent). Margin of victory: 54,288 votes. ariga@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/andyriga Sources: Montreal Gazette archives La Presse archives CBC live referendum night coverage Radio-Canada live referendum night coverage: Breaking Point, CBC documentary The Morning After, Chantal Hebert The Night Canada Stood Still, RobertWright Referendum investigations, ElectionsQuebec

Manitoba director Ryan McKenna's first French-language film is a leap of friendship and faith

Full text: Le coeur de madame Sabali is director Ryan McKenna's first French-language feature - one he hopes will create a larger narrative of where he's from.
What happens when a heart lives on in another body? Cellular memory - the speculative notion that organs and cells retain personality characteristics and donor history after a transplant - is the cinematic hook in .
A similar line of inquiry might also apply to the film's director, Ryan McKenna, a Franco-Manitoban who has been living in Montreal since 2008: What happens to a filmmaker's work when they live in another province and culture?
Crisscrossing provincial and linguistic divides is just what some creative types must do to see their work produced. McKenna's French-language feature, which premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival last week to rave reviews, just screened in Montreal during the city's Festival du nouveau cinéma (FNC) and it will be playing at Cinémental, Winnipeg's western Canadian French-language festival, later this month.
Occupying plural languages and identities, McKenna has taken on a status of Quebecker in the name of this film. Creatively, though, he says he's not so sure. You can take the boy out of Winnipeg, but can you ever take Winnipeg out of the boy? Or his film?
is the Manitoba director's first French-language feature, and it is ambitious: McKenna had a 30-person team; the film includes a cameo of the internationally celebrated Malian musical duo Amadou & Mariam; and McKenna and co-producer/costume designer Becca Blackwood infused every scene with their Winnipeg-DIY, Technicolor aesthetic, all stylized lighting and extravagance.
Voyelles Films, a Montreal-based regional production company, took on as its first-ever feature-length film, in a leap of friendship and faith.
McKenna had an intense 24 days of shooting, and he jokes production was "strangely familiar" to the way he grew up: attending immersion school and speaking French all day, returning home to speak English at night. But besides the language distinction, "There is a lot more encouragement for this kind of filmmaking, and to promote auteur or experimental cinema in Quebec," McKenna says of working inter-provincially. "That's the big difference."
The film was only made possible through the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), a provincial grant. McKenna believes the attitude in English-language filmmaking is that features are considered somewhat a vanity project. The real money, he's been advised countless times, is in documentary. And he found the funding juries between Telefilm Canada and SODEC markedly different - with the latter evaluating projects for cultural and artistic merit, and not simply on market potential.
So while feature films are produced in the rest of Canada, they're largely financed through arts council grants, and made for significantly less money. "So you need to take an entirely different approach," says McKenna. He would know.
McKenna shot his first English-language feature through a particularly cold Winnipeg winter in 2012. The First Winter about a Portuguese man who makes a misguided move from the Mediterranean climes to Winnipeg - is abstract, full of fantastical elements and shows off our brutal prairie winter without compromise.
While he describes the work as low budget, McKenna stresses that production was " rich: there's a value in that."
With an interest in regional cinema as a way in to different cultures, McKenna says his intention is to make films that create a larger narrative of where he's from. , for example, inspired him to co-author a manifesto on the filmmaking style he called Winnipeg Brutalism, which includes a strict rule about including at least one (unfaked) blizzard.
"My films are often a reaction to the dominant style of the region," says McKenna, adding later he's noticed a need to adjust to the territorial rhythms of wherever he's working. "Where you are affects the art," he says.
He's not as comfortable speaking with the same authority about Quebec culture just yet, but McKenna quips if he were to write a similar statement on filmmaking in Quebec, the first point of the manifesto would read: no white walls. "There are so many films that are austere, dark, depressing realism [in Quebec]," he says. "So I wanted to respond with lots of colour and energy, to make a film that reflected how I experience Montreal...about coming out of a dark place."
At the end of the day, he didn't want to make an essay about Quebec. "[It's] more about relationships between people, which is universal."
In his dramedy, protagonist Jeanette - played by the superbly cast Quebecois cult icon Marie Brassard - receives the heart of a murdered Malian donor. She is injected into an entirely different community and feels comfortable therein, though the audience can't be sure if the feelings are hers or her donor's.
As a Winnipeg transplant, McKenna contends he can see the "meta" narrative between himself and the plot of his movie, but hadn't meditated about the parallel too deeply. "I am from the weirdo world of the Winnipeg Film Group and bring this sensibility to the work I do in Quebec, but I would like dual citizenship," he says with a laugh.
Certainly, he's not alone. Matthew Rankin, who has traversed and filmed between Quebec and Manitoba extensively in the name of art, is a poster child for this.
Caroline Monnet is another filmmaker with a similar (though reverse) trajectory. The francophone and Algonquin multidisciplinary artist is originally from Outaouais in western Quebec, but took off to Winnipeg from 2006 to 2011 to get her foot in the door of the film world, returning in 2012.
"You are never really exactly one thing," Monnet says about the inter-regional and inter-personal jumps she has made for projects and funding. "But managing these three worlds can be an advantage... I'm able to work for francophone, anglophone and indigenous productions. I like those tensions that exist when identities mix."
Steve Gravestock, a programmer at TIFF who has selected Canadian feature films for the festival since 2004, says the back-and-forth has always been a reality for Canadian filmmakers and producers. But especially for filmmakers today. "The domestic market is increasingly an uphill battle," he says. "And there are many factors that play into that."
Guy Maddin's The Forbidden Room, filmed at the Phi Centre in Montreal, is one recent and obvious example of a filmmaker moving across provinces to get his work done, says Gravestock. He also mentions that Denis Villeneuve and Denys Arcand will often shoot in Toronto. And as far as the provincial festival ecosystems go: "What separates the regions are the local industry that is targeted, and the scale with which they engage internationally."
Images Festival finds a market in in the visual art world, for example. Hot Docs has its TV industry; TIFF is its own monster, reflecting the growth in Toronto, while VIFF tends to mirror its audience through regional and international cinema from the Pacific West. "In order to survive, a festival must reflect the nature of its city," Gravestock says.
And it's just different in Quebec. "I'm not sure that the desire to see ourselves on screen plays out in the same way [as Quebec] across English Canada...There is something peculiarly Canadian about the way we interact with our cinema."
Differences aside, the rest of Canada is receptive to Quebecois works, says Gabrielle Tougas-Fréchette, co-producer of Voyelles Films, who has been a programmer with the FNC for the past decade. "You guys in Toronto laugh way harder."
The FNC is proud to produce and show Quebecois culture on screen, which speaks to a cultural difference adds Tougas-Fréchette, but she says both sides would benefit from being more curious about domestic film across the country. "A language or cultural barrier is just not a good excuse anymore."
The FNC, which has been around four years longer than TIFF, still lives somewhat in its shadow on the Canadian film radar. Regardless, it is overwhelmingly celebrated as a unique place to showcase cinema auteurs from French and English Canada, and internationally.
It was the only Canadian festival willing to screen , says McKenna. "They stand behind smaller scale films with maybe not as much of a budget but that have artistic ambition or integrity," he says. "So I really appreciate that."
A mere five-hour drive from the GTA and completely bilingual for English viewers, it is worth the transplant.
McKenna says he was pleasantly surprised how many Quebecois expats and francophones turned up to the world premiere of in Vancouver. "I just feel really lucky I was given the chance to make a film in French, that I wasn't told ," he says. "My identity is in there, somewhere - even if it's somewhere strange."

New Uniforms, Familiar Faces; Beat Cops bring together an all-star lineup of locals

Full text:   AT A GLANCE
Beat Cops launch Mean Streets Tuesday at Turbo Haus, 5011 Notre-Dame St. W., with No Aloha. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $10 at the door.
"Crime doesn't wait, so why should we?" asks Beat Cops bassist Tim Fletcher.
Why indeed? And so it is that the Montreal all-stars have come to release their energetic and inspired debut long-player, Mean Streets, a mere 11 months after they started enforcing the laws of rock in our fair (and occasionally not-so-fair) city.
If Fletcher's name sounds familiar, it's because anyone who observed Montreal's ascendant music scene during the previous decade would know him as singer/guitarist for Juno Award-winning indie-pop band the Stills. He's not the only one with name brand recognition: Mikey Heppner (former singer/guitarist for hard-rock phenomenon Priestess) assumes identical duties in Beat Cops, with the backup of Patrick Bennett (former guitarist for hard-charging hardcore band Trigger Effect) and Max Hebert (the drums behind popular retro rockers Les Breastfeeders).
Perhaps lesser known is the fact that Fletcher and Heppner have a history, one that goes back 14 years to Heppner's upstart punk band the Dropouts.
"I was only in the Dropouts for about six months (in 2001), and we played something like four shows," says Fletcher. "It was actually one of the catchiest bands I've ever been in. The songs are total punk anthems and super fun - it was hilarious and awesome."
Shortly thereafter, the Dropouts spawned very differently angled "side projects," as Fletcher and Heppner like to call them: the Stills and Priestess. With the mothballing of both bands in 2011 and 2012, respectively, the door was left open for eventual rock 'n' roll reunification, and the musician friends stepped through it in July of last year.
Fletcher and Heppner aren't an obvious music-making combination, given the conspicuous stylistic differences between the bands they are best known for (and you can add Bennett and Hebert to that equation), but none of that matters in Beat Cops. There are better reasons for being partners in, and against, crime.
"We both listen to a lot of music and we're both ridiculous people," says Heppner.
"I really think that Mikey is a super-amazing, talented songwriter," says Fletcher. "I'm an admirer and appreciator of Mikey's creativity. That's what appealed to me when he said, 'Hey, do you wanna start a band?' ""And it was the total opposite for me," deadpans Heppner. "I really find Tim to be a hopeless hack."
"So it's a zero-sum game that really works out, y'know?" adds Fletcher. "One side of the seesaw's down and the other part's up."
For Beat Cops, Fletcher moves over from his usual guitar to bass, which he characterizes as his weapon of choice these days.
"He shreds on the bass and it's really, really fun seeing what crazy s-t he comes up with," enthuses Heppner.
"It's a mixture of skill and humour," Fletcher offers jokingly. Something similar could be said for Mean Streets. It's a recording that, despite some serious playing, does not take itself overly seriously. There is a thread of mischievous fun and good humour that winds its way through the often intricate writing.
"Max pointed that out," says Heppner. "We had other songs that didn't make the record and I remember him saying, 'These are all good songs, but I find that (the ones that are making the record) all have some sort of release, or humour and an edge to them, and the other ones just aren't funny.' ""It was earnestness versus tongue-in-cheekiness," says Fletcher.
On Mean Streets they've hit that songwriting sweet spot, composing tunes that rock aficionados and casual fans alike can appreciate. In terms of stylistic palette, we're in Jackson Pollock territory here, with a blizzard of colourings - hard rock, classic, pop, sludge and punk among them - combining for a curious and compelling whole.
You might hear a bit of the Byrds in the 12-string of the album-opening Emotional, a suggestion of CCR in the first notes of When You Left Home, and maybe quick zaps of Zappa and Thin Lizzy throughout. Never enough to call it imitation or homage, but rather clear evidence of indirect references that ricocheted offthe insides of their skulls a couple of times before lodging in the ear of the listener.
"I could sit down with a list of all the song titles and basically tell you what each part is in reference to in my mind, but we make music that you can't really call anything super-specific," says Heppner, skilfully sidestepping pigeonholes. "A ska band plays ska, and there are boundaries around what that means, but we're just a rock band and we don't really have a style. It's just a mashing of all influences."
"But it's still song-oriented, snappy tunes," says Fletcher.
"It's not musique concrete," adds Heppner.
"The most important thing, though, is that we uphold the law," finishes Fletcher. "It's hot out on the streets."

Full text:   Blizzards, stranded motorists, ice damage and frozen transport routes. Marco Parent welcomes them all.
"When everyone goes inside, I go outside," he says.
Parent, 24, left the comparatively sheltered life of radio host in Shawinigan four years ago to join MeteoMedia, the French-language arm of national specialty channel The Weather Network. Parent is MeteoMedia's Montreal reporter for weather disasters in Canada and the United States.
"As a source of weather stories, Montreal is the perfect storm," says Parent. "Heat, smog, snow, wind chill, dangerous pavements, burst pipes, damaged roads, we've got it all."
Parent also seeks out positive stories and covers eco-friendly initiatives, such as green housing developments, as well as activities that encourage people to go outside and enjoy the weather instead just complaining about it.
"I'm particularly interested in people whose livelihoods are directly affected by weather," says Parent. "As a keen skier, it was an eye-opener to discover what happens behind the scenes at ski resorts and interview the cooks, chairlift mechanics and other staff."
A bigger eye-opener was probably New Brunswick's weather bomb in March 2014, with its pounding rain, high winds and heavy snow.
"Cameraman Michel Millaire and I got stuck in Shediac (N.B.) during the snowstorm of our lives - just after warning people not to go outside. It looked like we would have to sleep in the news van until a viewer tweeted us with an offer of help. We were escorted to a hotel by rescuers on snowmobiles.
Parent knows he's not supposed to put himself in danger for work, but admits to enjoying the adrenalin rush: "Michel and I sometimes push things to get the best shot.
You need to get close to the story to tell it properly."
But it takes more than willingness to face the elements to be a weather reporter.
When Parent raced to Massachusetts last January to cover the snowstorms, no cameraman was available to join him. Undeterred, Parent filmed the storm damage, recorded his pieces to camera, laid down the voice-overs, edited the footage and sent complete reports in two languages - all with his iPad.
"I'm no supergeek, and it was the first time I'd been out alone," he says. "But the Internet and financial pressures on mainstream media are increasing the demand for new breed of multi-skilled journalists. Anyways, in this case it was a story that had to be told, no matter what."
While looking for a place to stay the night, Parent found a group of people who had been forced from their homes seeking shelter in the lobby of a BB in Scituate - a small coastal town outside Boston.
"They were stressed and anxious.
Some gave me the keys to their houses, saying, 'Go there and show the world how bad it is.' I went out the next morning and it was as if I'd entered the Ice Age. The houses looked like they'd been dipped in the sea and then frozen solid."
Parent was able to enter one house to face an eerie sight: "It was a framed family portrait, encased in a block of ice, showing the people I'd met the night before."
The incident points to what Parent considers are the three main aspects of his work: "To warn people of danger, to show why we have to respect nature and to tell good stories. That's the part I love the most."
With the arrival of spring, Parent would now like to chase some tornadoes in Texas - if MeteoMedia decides to send him there.
"Don't tell my boss, but I'd pay to do it," he says. "It's my Mount Everest."

Full text:   There's a blizzard outside but I'm whizzing down an empty hallway on a refurbished red Velo Sport bicycle.
The original bike was built in the mid-'80s, but it has been equipped with new handlebars, wheels and fenders. The bike was recently assembled by Rebicycle, a non-profit organization that specializes in refurbishing older bikes.
Located on the sixth floor of an industrial building on de Gaspe St. in Mile End, Rebicycle has existed for about a year but will open for its first full season this spring. The white gallery-like showroom features prototype bikes and mechanics working on site. A colourful mural by local artist Jonathan Cormier captures the pure joy of a sunset bike ride in Montreal in the early summer. Customers can try out bikes in the hallway outside.
"The first thing we ask you is, 'What are you going to be doing with this bicycle?,' " explains Benjamin Adler, strategic adviser at Rebicycle.
With this information, Rebicycle helps customers choose a frame style and size, handlebars, determine whether they'd like (and can afford) vintage or new parts, and other details. Bikes start at around $300.
Each bike is built with a 71-point checklist by mechanics who, according to Rebicycle, are paid the highest base mechanic salary in Montreal, $15 per hour.
"One of the reasons we pay top dollar for our mechanics is that we want the best talent," says Adler. Each bike comes with a one-year warranty and a free tune-up any time during the first year.
"Somebody has to take the usedbike industry by the scruffof the neck and shake it and be like, 'You need to do things better,' " says Adler. "Basically, Rebicycle is trying to change the used-bike industry because we believe it leaves a lot to be desired right now. It's hard to tell where bikes come from, it's hard to know why people are charging you a certain amount."
The asking price for my red ride? $375. An invoice explains the cost breakdown, including new parts and the number of hours of labour it took to build it. It even tells you which mechanic put the bike together.
Rebicycle is also working with factories in Taiwan to custommanufacture parts like a brake that allows certain old bikes to accept a wider range of wheels, and halfmoon shaped handlebars.
With its detailed invoices, Rebicycle aims to take away some of the mystery in the used-bike industry. It also has a grander goal of tackling the endemic problem of stolen bikes, checking every one of its frames against the Canadian Police Information Centre registry, the national stolen goods database, and providing new owners with a certificate of purchase to prove this. Each bike also comes with a membership to Project 529, an online community that helps register and protect bikes.
So where do the majority of Rebicycle's frames come from? An exclusive agreement with Cyclo Nord-Sud, a Quebec charity that sends bikes to Africa and Central and South America, gives Rebicycle the opportunity to recuperate bikes the charity can't use.
Rebicycle also accepts donations. When Cyclo Nord-Sud visited warehouses in the recipient countries, it found the oldest bikes, the vintage bikes, weren't being used. "These bikes are very hard to work on," explains Adler. "There are all kinds of obsolete and obscure tools that you need; you need specialized knowledge, the standards are not the same, you often have to deal with seized parts, which you don't have to worry about with as much with modern bikes."
Rebicycle accepts these challenges. "At the same time, in our opinion, these bikes were really built to last, while modern bikes, especially cheap modern bikes that you find at big-box stores, there's a lot of plastic on them and they're not made to last."
A lot of the frames - the vast majority of which were built in the '70s, '80s and early '90s - were made in Canada, in an era when our country still had a bike manufacturing industry.
"Our bikes are more made in Canada than a lot of the stuffyou can buy nowadays. And they've been reassembled with Quebecois labour, just like they were assembled with Quebecois labour in the first place in 1985."

Full text:   We've finally discovered what climate change really means: that our climate changes every day.
We went from a Saturday blizzard to a Sunday slush storm to a Monday ice storm to a balmy Wednesday to an "extreme cold warning" Thursday with a wind chill of -43.
We lived through the weather extremes of a whole winter in six days.
Not to mention a blizzard in early December followed by a crazy snow-free rest of the month. We have obviously entered a strange new weather system that I call: The bipolar vortex. This new continual-climatechange winter is a challenge even for hardened Montreal winter warriors, who need all their wiles just for:
WALKING: With rapidly shifting bipolar conditions, you must adroitly choose the correct walking style for every moment.
On Monday, Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks were treacherous skating rinks - and many downtowners were using the ice slither walk. In this manoeuvre, you never actually lift your feet from the ground while walking - you plant one foot flatly on the icy pavement, then slither carefully onto the other.
Veteran Montrealers can walk pretty fast this way, shuffling down slippery streets like penguins.
A different walking style was needed Tuesday night when fresh snow concealed the sidewalk ice. This required the minefield tiptoe, where you delicately place one foot down to see if it's safe, then tiptoe another baby step, crossing the sidewalk like a soldier in a minefield.
There's also the snowbank stepand-test technique, where you prod a snowbank with your toe before putting your weight on it. Is it rock-hard and slippery - or does it collapse into slush, shooting nine inches of water into your boot?
Those who walk incorrectly wind up in emergency wards that have been overwhelmed with concussions, frostbite and fractures in the last week - victims of bipolar winter combat.
Part of the problem is that many seniors in their 80s insist on going outside however wacky the weather. I'm proud of them - these are real Montrealers who won't take snow for an answer.
It's time someone gave them a helping hand by developing lightweight winter body armour - like skateboarders wear - to protect their artificial hips, replaced knees and arthritic elbows, shoulders and bums.
As well, we should provide them with the world's first padded and heated pedestrian helmets for winter - and our hospital wards would be calm.
DRIVING: is also tricky in the bipolar vortex, because you don't know whether a snowbank is made of feather-light fresh snow or rock-hard, rain-drenched snow - until you back into it and bounce offlike it's a granite wall.
Then again, last Sunday I was driving through giant slush puddles on the Metropolitan when a towering tsunami of slush leaped over the 12-foot lane divider like a tidal wave and engulfed my car - flinging it into the next lane, where it somehow surfed its way to safety.
EXERCISE: is easy to get this winter, because daily life is enough exercise. Think of your workout: Getting dressed: 100 calories, plus 175 cal. per child you dress. Trudging to car 150 cal., scraping windshield 125, prying open iceencrusted door 130, shovelling out car 600 and brushing giant cake of snow offroof 500.
There. You've had your whole day's exercise, and you haven't even started pushing out the car.
STREET CLEARING: Our confused weather has confused Montreal snow crews, too. On Wednesday a spokesman for the city admitted crews had all been out with snowblowers when the real problem was a mini-ice storm had left sidewalks like glass.
The city has now pledged to adapt to the changing climate with a new rapid-response strike force that will salt our sidewalks as fast as they freeze.
I'll believe that when I don't fall on them - but let me make another suggestion. At Jeanne-Mance Park when you get offthe 80 bus, the stairs down through the park to Esplanade Ave. are immaculately shovelled. But you can't get to them, because the 20-foot stretch from the street to the stairs looks like something from the ice age - a field of glacial ice with jutting icicles and stalagmites so primeval you expect to meet a sabre-toothed tiger.
After picking my way across it and vowing "never again," I saw a blue-collar guy diligently cleaning the steps and suggested he salt the area leading to them.
He shrugged and said: "I've been doing these stairs for 10 years, sir, and no one in the city has ever mentioned cleaning that area."
I suspect there are thousands of small shovel-free zones like this in Montreal that have fallen through the bureaucratic cracks, where pedestrians dread to tread.
But this weekend, relax - the bipolar vortex is stable and on lithium for three days. However, there's an alert in effect for a sandstorm on Tuesday. Joshfreed49@gmail.com

Banks' speed leads Ticats to Grey Cup; Hamilton looks forward to second consecutive title game appearance

Full text:   Jeff Reinebold, the Tiger-Cats' special teams coordinator, looked at Montreal's Dominique Ellis on the sidelines, held his hands out to his sides, and shrugged apologetically.
Hamilton kick returner Brandon Banks, who could dodge snowflakes during a blizzard, had just raced down the sideline 88 yards for a touchdown, his second lengthy punt-return score of the day. Third, if you count the one called back by a penalty.
Poor Ellis had been among those left flailing on both of the scores. Thus the sympathy shrug from the opposing coach.
Alouettes head coach Tom Higgins said he still wasn't sure what had happened as his players tried to tackle vapour.
"There's no way he should have been able to return that (second one) for a touchdown," said Higgins of Banks, who officially weighs 153 pounds but looks as though he would only reach that number with a couple of bricks tucked into his shorts.
"We had guys standing there," Higgins said of his would-be tacklers. "It's almost like he turned into Casper the Ghost" - old cartoon reference there, kids - "because we were grasping at air."
Banks finished with 226 punt-return yards, and the two back-breaking touchdowns, in Hamilton's 40-24 win in the CFL East Final at Tim Hortons Field, booking the Tiger-Cats a trip to the Grey Cup in Vancouver next week.
Appropriately nicknamed "Speedy," although Slippery would be just as accurate, Banks said his electric returns were just a matter of help from his teammates.
"They're just blocking, and I'm just running," said Banks, who played sparingly for the Washington Redskins for three seasons beginning in 2010. "These 11 guys get me to the second level, then I take it to the house."
When he accepted a scholarship to Kansas State in 2008, Banks said he was 147 pounds, the first football player ever to get a scholarship at less than 150 pounds. "But I'm probably 153 or 154 now," he said.
Banks shrugged offthe considerable degree of trash-talking that had emanated from Montreal in the week preceding the game: "Words don't mean nothing," he said. "You see what the scoreboard is."
The Als' chief braggart, receiver S.J. Green, at least backed it up. He had said that Hamilton defensive back Brandon Stewart had "no chance" to cover him, instructing reporters to "put that in the paper. He knows it." This was excellent foreshadowing, as Green totalled 126 yards on six catches, including three touchdowns.
Stewart, who was beaten on two of those touchdowns, said afterward that Green was a great receiver. "But we're playing next week, and they're not."
Zing. Alouettes quarterback Jonathan Crompton, who had run up a 9-2 record as a starter with efficiently dull play, finally broke the 300-yard passing mark for the first time all season, but his stats also included three interceptions, two of which came when the game was still on the line. Crompton was clearly trying to make something happen, but both passes were in the direction of receivers who were well covered. Sometimes, boring is a virtue.
Zach Collaros, his counterpart with Hamilton, threw for a modest 199 yards, no touchdowns, and had a red-zone fumble. Running back Nic Grigsby, who only joined the Tiger-Cats a month ago after being released by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, had 93 yards on 18 carries, two of which ended in touchdowns.
Asked about the wonder of his late-season pickup, Hamilton head coach Kent Austin said it "was no credit to me. He was available."
Austin said the team jumped at the chance to sign a player of Grigsby's talent. (He had asked to be released after Winnipeg reduced his role.) "It was just good luck," Austin said. It also, one imagines, has the Blue Bombers wondering if they shouldn't have talked him into staying.
And so, the Tiger-Cats are in their second consecutive Grey Cup. It's been two seasons in which they played home games at the University of Guelph, and then at McMaster University, and then at a Tim Hortons Field that was still under construction and only half-finished for most of this year. At one point, the annual Labour Day classic against the Toronto Argonauts looked like it might have to played in Toronto instead of Hamilton, unless it was played in Guelph. In the end, it was held at the new stadium, with construction paused just long enough to allow a football game to take place. The Ticats are now 7-0 at the new stadium.
Austin said his team wasn't about to make excuses during its nomadic existence, though it's worth noting that the Ticats started 1-6 amid all that uncertainty.
"Look, we're still going to practise on a football field, we're still going to play a game on a football field," he said. "Every team has challenges."
It's a statement that seems to undersell Hamilton's specific challenges more than a little - even on Sunday, the new stadium was still ringed by temporary construction fencing, and a crane loomed over the south end zone.
Austin said the adversity might have been good for his players in the end. When they earned a first-round playoffbye with a victory over the Alouettes here in the season finale, the team had a week off, then scorched the Als at home again. They certainly looked like a team comfortable in its environment.
Outside the locker-room after the game, Tiger-Cats owner Bob Young was beaming under his yellow ball cap, and receiving handshakes.
How did he feel after this historically weird season? Surprised? Relieved?
"No," he said, then broke out into a wide smile, spying Austin as he exited the locker-room. The two men hugged.
"This guy," Young said, "told me we would get better. And we did."
Indeed. As Speedy Banks might say: look at the scoreboard.

Time to retire the Assassins? Why Far Cry is Ubisoft's future franchise

Full text: Is Ubisoft seeing a transition in flagship franchises?
In 2006, France's Ubisoft was a mid-sized video game publisher with annual revenue of €547-million and 3,500 employees. Today, the company is one of the biggest independent publishers in the world, not far behind Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts with revenue of a billion euros and 9,200 employees, nearly a third of them in Canada.
Where did that explosive growth come from? Two words: Assassin's Creed.
The inaugural game, a historical action-adventure fantasy conceived and developed in Montreal and released in 2007, kicked off an ongoing blockbuster franchise that has become synonymous with Ubisoft.
Prior to this holiday season, there have been six main entries in the series, numerous downloadable add-ons, comic books, toys and clothing lines, and there's a movie in the works. Company executives are on record as saying there's a roadmap for the series through at least 2019. With 73 million copies sold, it's an understatement to say the series has been the turbo-charged engine of growth for the company.
But how much Assassin's Creed is too much? According to the market, we may already be past the point of saturation.
Last year's entry, , still sold an impressive 10 million copies over the holiday period. But that was off significantly from 12 million of the previous instalment over the same period a year earlier.
Management this year made the unusual decision to release not one but two games, for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and for the older Xbox 360 and PS3, in an effort to maintain interest.
Both games were released on Nov. 11 so it's too early to gauge sales, but critical reception has been lukewarm. Both are maintaining respective Xbox console review scores of 76 out of 100 on aggregation site Metacritic. A 76 average for a movie is pretty good; for games, which are generally rated between 70 and 90, it's a veritable kiss of death.
Reviewers are panning the duo for being too similar to previous releases or for technical problems. The underlying message is the same: the games are being released too frequently.
"I don't get doing [Assassin's Creed] every year and I think I'm pretty typical," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter presciently said in a 2012 interview.
So what happens if the series needs to take a break? Do the wheels fall off the engine?
Not necessarily, because Ubisoft does have another figurative motor revving. It's called Far Cry.
A few short years ago, Far Cry was something of a sleeper franchise. A curious attempt at delivering the first-person shooter experience in an open world, it appealed mainly to PC gamers in Europe.
Then, in 2012, sold 4.5 million units over the 2012-2013 holiday season, representing a big jump from the 2.9 million of its predecessor over the same time frame four years earlier.
The game went on to post Assassin's Creed-like numbers with more than 10 million units sold, vaulting the franchise into the big leagues. , last year's entry in Activision's perennial sales-chart-topping blockbuster series, sold 14 million units in comparison.
(Call of Duty is another franchise in decline, with sales considerably off the 26 million units sold of in 2011-2012.)
came out on Nov. 18, and seems to have met the huge expectations from critics, fans and Ubisoft management alike. Its Metacritic rating is 85, with several 90 scores from games critics, which puts it on the right side of that 70-90 scale. Yannis Mallat, who oversees Ubisoft's studios in Montreal and Toronto, expects the game to outsell its predecessor.
"What we learned in , we've mastered it in ," he said in an interview. "You'll probably find what you loved in , but better, and also some new innovation."
Executives aren't ready to commit to it as the new flagship, or to annual releases, but they do have big plans for the series. "It's on a similar roadmap" as Assassin's Creed, Mallat said.
"I think people are actually pleased that they can count on an annual release of their favourite game. As long as you deliver them a quality product, those people are the happiest in the world."
The first game, published by Ubisoft in 2004, was developed by Germany's Crytek. The story was set a tropical island and featured a former American special forces operative fighting against mercenaries, with both sides under threat from a pack of genetically altered beasts.
For the second game, development moved to Ubisoft Montreal and the setting shifted to an unspecified Central African nation. Players were given the task of tracking down and eliminating a vicious arms dealer in the midst of a civil war, and the science-fiction elements were eliminated entirely.
Despite modest sales, garnered critical acclaim for its realism and the advanced artificial intelligence of its characters.
follow-up success didn't come as a surprise, Mallat says, because of the technical work that had gone into its predecessor. Particular effort was put into making the open-world FPS concept work on consoles, an important step if the franchise was to gain traction in the U.S. and Canadian markets, where more people were playing on Xbox and PlayStation than on PC.
In that way, the franchise evolved similarly to Assassin's Creed, where the inaugural game received passable reviews, but laid the technical basis for its sequel, which exploded.
"We knew we could iterate on it and we knew the groundwork was done," Mallat says. "When you start with the expertise and the team down, of course you tame the subject and you master it better. From that standpoint was a better experience."
Ubisoft Montreal headed development on , with the company's Toronto studio contributing significant sections. The game is set in fictional Kyrat, a Himalayan kingdom ruled by the self-appointed despot Pagan Min. Players take on the role of Ajay Ghale, a traveller who winds up in conflict with Min and his henchman. (You can read our review here.)
Thematically, the game explores much of the same ground as its predecessor, where the proverbial fish-out-of-water protagonist must learn to survive against a pack of vicious predators, both human and animal.
Gameplay-wise, the experience will also be similar to the 2012 release, which centred around infiltrating and overtaking enemy forts. As with other open-world games, players can progress through the main story at their leisure, with a plethora of distractions - from side missions to hunting quests and mini-games - to choose from.
also brings back the key to its predecessor's success, a system that Ubisoft calls the "anecdote factory." The game generates random encounters, which results in different experiences for anyone playing. As a result, inspired so-called watercooler conversations where players traded anecdotes about their own unique experiences, which helped build buzz for the game.
Mallat declined to share sales projections, but said that all eyes within Ubisoft are on the game.
"Instead of milking the brand, on the contrary we're making sure we are investing time, energy and talent into it," he said.

Full text: With Asia and the Middle East as Canada's largest source of newcomers, a winter-preparedness class in Montreal helps ease integration
? Pauline Perrotte stood before her class and asked her pupils, all newcomers to Canada, what kinds of rumours they'd heard about Canadian winters.
A woman from Iran raised her hand. "You need to wear glasses," she said, "because your eyes can freeze."
Ricardo Roldan, from Venezuela, had heard about the temperature. "It's as cold as a refrigerator."
Patrick Dumont, a native of Mauritius, off the coast of Africa, had already been through a few Montreal winters. "I thought it would be as cold as a refrigerator," he said. "It's colder."
Each year, Canada throws out a welcome mat to thousands of immigrants. And for many months of the year, that welcome mat is encrusted in snow. So some new Canadians turn to courses like Ms. Perrotte's: a survival guide to winter.
For 90 minutes, Ms. Perrotte tries to dispel some myths and inspire some enthusiasm about Canada's most emblematic season, running through a cold-weather curriculum which includes windchill and weather-stripping, tobogganing and the Bonhomme Carnaval.
The session in winter preparedness is part practical. It's also, fundamentally, about learning to become a Canadian.
"Adapting to winter is the first test of integration," said Ms. Perrotte, herself a native of southern France who arrived in Montreal last year, just in time for one of the harshest winters in years.
Ms. Perrotte works for a community group called the Assistance Crossroads for Newcomers and offered winter preparedness classes in two multicultural Montreal neighbourhoods in recent weeks. Immigrants from countries as varied as Morocco, India, the Dominican Republic and Syria sat in rows, some with notepads on their laps, a few bundled in tuques and parkas even though they were in a heated room indoors.
The sessions help calm the nerves of newcomers who have never seen a snowflake, much less a polar vortex.
"People hear about blizzards and ice storms, and they start worrying about their families and children," Ms. Perrotte said. "We try to reassure them, tell them winter is a magnificent season and that adjusting to it is part of their integration."
Winter looms large in the Canadian immigration experience, especially as the country's source of immigrants changes. The largest group of newcomers to Canada is now from Asia and the Middle East. In the last census, the share of immigration from warm-weather regions like Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America increased.
Winter is rarely the reason newcomers say they love their adopted country. In a 2007 survey, Statistics Canada asked new immigrants what they disliked the most about living in Canada; 27 per cent said the climate, ahead of lack of job opportunities and high taxes. Asked the greatest challenge they faced, 16 per cent said it was Canada's weather.
Ms. Perrotte's course holds up a mirror to a society where taking precautions before stepping outdoors is built into the national character. As author Robertson Davies said, "Cold breeds caution." The theme returns in Ms. Perrotte's lesson over and over.
"Always check the weather before heading out for the day," she tells her class. Take the wind chill into account. Always have a hat, scarf and gloves. A picture of a pair of mittens connected by a string pops up on the screen. This will save your children from losing mittens, she explains. A woman in the front row raises her eyebrows and nods approvingly at the sight of the ingenious invention.
A photo appears showing a pair of hands with swollen fingers. "I'm sorry for this picture," Ms. Perrotte says. "When your hands are too exposed to the cold, you won't feel your fingers any more." A look of alarm passes over some faces.
For newcomers, adapting can mean abandoning meteorological cues from home. Mr. Dumont, from Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, recalls how, during his first winter in Montreal, he looked out his window and saw a bright sun against a luminous blue sky. "In our country, when it looks like that, we go to the beach," he said. Mr. Dumont headed outdoors in a pair of shorts and sandals to take out the garbage.
He quickly learned that some of the coldest days in Canada come when the sun is out.
Despite their apprehensions, the students said they felt reassured by the know-how of a country that invented the snowmobile and snowblower. Ioanna-Livia Preda, from Romania, said she noticed that Montreal placed bus stops right outside Métro stations, so you don't have to wait in the cold outside. "You're very well organized in Canada," she said at Ms. Perrotte's winter session in Montreal's Ahuntsic district.
Mohammed Barakat, a 28-year-old X-ray technician from Cairo, watched YouTube videos to see what a snowstorm looks like. He was awestruck by the military-like deployment of graders and snowplows through the streets of Montreal after a storm.
"We don't have snow in Egypt. I was wondering, after 30 centimetres of snow falls, what does the government do?" Mr. Barakat said after Ms. Perrotte's class in Parc Extension. "I'm eager to see this for myself. How will cars get through the streets? How will people walk on the sidewalks?"
The lesson continued. Just when the psychic toll from talk of snow shovelling, drippy noses and icy sidewalks seemed too heavy, Ms. Perrotte turned to the joys of the season: the Santa Claus parade and Montreal's Igloofest, ice skating, cross-country skiing and the Quebec Winter Carnival.
"Don't stay closed off indoors," she urged her class. "I wish you an excellent winter. Take advantage of it and make new discoveries, and after your first winter, you will be seduced."
At the very least, they will know what windchill is, and it won't be theoretical.

Vachon king for a day

Author: Stubbs, Dave

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vachon-king-day/docview/1617672567/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Here was Vachon with the 1964 N.D.G. Monarchs, a Junior A squad; as a bare-faced rookie with the Canadiens in the late 1960s, grimacing with pucks flying and bodies crashing around him; a little later, prowling the Habs net, in a deep crouch with the crossbar almost even with his head; in the dressing room, his primitive equipment spilled at his feet; back in Montreal in a Kings jersey, dealt by Montreal to L.A. on Nov. 4, 1971, for Denis DeJordy, Dale Hoganson, Noel Price and Doug Robinson.

Full text:   Forty-three years since his last game in a Canadiens net, Rogie Vachon still has a handle on what it's like to be a goaltender in Montreal.
"They love the goalie, but if you give up two or three goals, all of a sudden you're a bum," he says with a laugh of Habs fans and perhaps the media, too.
"It's tough to play in Montreal - very, very tough when I played and I don't think that part has changed at all."
Vachon had just stepped through Canada Customs at Montreal-Trudeau Airport Friday evening, offa flight from his home in Venice, Calif., for a Saturday memorabilia signing at Centre Pierre Charbonneau, in the shadow of the Maurice Richard Arena.
This would be almost a parachute drop: in at 8 p.m. Friday, to the east end to sign a variety of photos and pucks for later sale, signatures on more product early Saturday, an hour meeting and signing for fans before noon, then on a 2 p.m. flight back to Los Angeles, driven to the airport by his brother-in-law.
It was Vachon's first visit to Montreal since this same weekend in 2009, when he dashed through almost as quickly for a similar event.
"It's the way I like to do it," he said, just a small overnight bag on his shoulder, speaking with an accent that blends his native Quebec with his long-ago adopted home of California.
The 69-year-old native of Palmarolle, in the Abitibi region, doesn't do many shows these days. But that's not for lack of effort by promoters who try to coax appearances by the threetime Stanley Cup champion and co-winner with Gump Worsley of the 1967-68 Vezina Trophy.
Indeed, Vachon is very rarely seen on the memorabilia circuit that's populated by many of his contemporaries, their autographs a hot property with collectors.
"I have invitations all the time but I'm very lazy," he said, laughing again.
"Still, I'm amazed at the mail that finds me from all over the place. Last week I had something from a guy in Switzerland who wanted me to sign a Canadiens logo. And in the package he sent me a box of Swiss chocolate - for two little autographs."
Hockey cards and photos arrive constantly, "but I also sign a lot of biscuits," Vachon said of Canadiens-and Kings-crested pucks. He'll autograph each one carefully around the logo, not across it, "because it just looks neater that way."
You consider this elegant man, 5-foot-7 and today not much over his 170-pound playing weight, and you wonder a goalie this compact made his living guarding NHL nets from 1967-82, for the Canadiens, then Los Angeles Kings, with two-season stops in both Detroit and finally Boston in his twilight years.
As we spoke, he sifted through a couple dozen vintage photos I'd brought him: Here was Vachon with the 1964 N.D.G. Monarchs, a Junior A squad; as a bare-faced rookie with the Canadiens in the late 1960s, grimacing with pucks flying and bodies crashing around him; a little later, prowling the Habs net, in a deep crouch with the crossbar almost even with his head; in the dressing room,
his primitive equipment spilled at his feet; back in Montreal in a Kings jersey, dealt by Montreal to L.A. on Nov. 4, 1971, for Denis DeJordy, Dale Hoganson, Noel Price and Doug Robinson.
"I've never seen any of this stuff," Vachon said of this 8x10 glossy history, shaking his head.
And then he came to a photo of teammate Serge Savard crashing into Vachon's Forum goalpost in 1970, the exquisite pain on the defenceman's face reflecting the fact his leg was shattering in five places.
"You'd try to save players when you could, push them past the net, but the play was coming right at me," said Vachon, intently focused in the photo on the incoming New York Rangers rush.
He would become enormously popular during 6 1/2 seasons in Los Angeles, making hockey a place to be in Tinseltown long before Wayne Gretzky'd arrival. Vachon was the first King to have his jersey retired and, after his playing days, he'd fill most every front-office job for the team, from goaltending coach to president.
He's probably best be known for his brilliance in the 1976 Canada Cup, leading Team Canada to the championship with his .963 save percentage, 1.39 goalsagainst and two shutouts that named him the tournament's best goalie and earned him MVP honours on his team.
Inexplicably, he is not a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, no matter that his numbers compare favourably to the many from his era who are enshrined.
Vachon left the game for good in 2008, having most recently been a Kings ambassador. But he still makes the occasional appearance, at the beginning of this season handing offthe club's 2013-14 Stanley Cup banner with fellow legend Marcel Dionne to current players for its homeopener raising to arena rafters. I tell Vachon that 40 years ago to the night, he was in the Kings net, turning aside 53 Buffalo shots in a 7-2 Los Angeles victory.
"In those days, 40 shots was just a normal night," he replied. "There'd be nights of 50."
Memorable was the game of Dec. 1, 1971, at the Forum, the night after he had married Nicole Blanchard in Burlington, Vt.
Hours after their wedding, the newlyweds were driven by a friend, Quebec race-car sensation Jacques Duval, through a snowstorm back to Montreal, where Vachon would face a blizzard of 50 Canadiens pucks in a 5-3 Habs victory less than a month after his trade to the Kings.
"That was a nice wedding present," Vachon joked. "Welcome home!" He and Nicole are the grandparents of three, ages 10 to 4 1/2. Calvin, the 9-year-old of their son, Nick, is a goalie in California, on a team that plays kids a year and two their senior.
"He gets a lot of work and he's a lot of fun to watch," Vachon said. "This season I bought him a new pair of pads and they're 32 inches (tall). That the same size I wore in the NHL."
He says you'd not know he was a big-league goalie if you visited his home; Nicole has the walls decorated with the work of Quebec-native painter Normand Boisvert.
"But I have lots of stuff," said Vachon, who auctioned much in 2010 but has kept cherished sticks, jerseys and a mask.
He says he watches "everything" on TV and gets to Kings games on his season tickets if they're not used by his kids and grandchildren, all huge hockey fans.
They all enjoy the work of Kings goalie Jonathan Quick, who last Thursday became the team's all-time shutout king, his 33rd one better than Vachon.
Quick trails Vachon in only two Kings goalie stats now: games and minutes played, and those seem likely to be overhauled this season, too.
You'll find no one happier about it than the man whose standards he's knocking offone by one.
"Quick can win games all by himself," Vachon said.
He'd know a thing or two about that, the records showing he did the same for his NHL clubs on more than one night.

Full text: Four Canadians are missing and feared dead after a series of blizzards and avalanches
It had been snowing in Nepal's upper Manang district when two groups of Canadians had to decide on Tuesday whether to proceed with their treks in the narrow valleys north of the Annapurna range.
They decided to go ahead, and later that day, a torrent of rocks and snow swept away four of them, three from Quebec and one from Vancouver.
They were among as many as 27 people missing or killed in blizzards and avalanches around the Annapurna range this week. Fall is Nepal's high season for trekking, but heavy rain and snow have lashed the region after tropical Cyclone Hudhud struck the Indian subcontinent.
There are conflicting views about why the Canadians ventured onto the trail.
A Kathmandu tour operator whose guide led four of the Canadians said his group was reluctant to move forward, but were swayed by six other Canadians booked by a Montreal travel agency.
"My guide said, ‘Maybe this is dangerous. Better not go.' But they said, ‘Oh, we can go.' And my clients followed them," said Harka Gurung, team leader at the Kathmandu outfitter Nepal Hidden Treks.
The other group was made up of six Quebeckers who booked with the Montreal outfitter, Terra Ultima. The group's tour leader was an experienced outdoorswoman, Sylvie Marois, and once in Nepal, they had a local guide, Kusang Sherpa, co-owner of Panorama Himalaya Trekking.
Ms. Marois, who is one of the people missing after the accident, was an accredited avalanche-safety instructor who trained others on avalanche risks, so she would never have led her group out in Nepal had there been a danger, said a friend and colleague, Renée-Claude Bastien, head of the Quebec association of adventure-tourism guides.
Ms. Bastien led the same tour in Nepal for Terra Ultima a year ago. The area is usually dry and snow-free at this time of year, and safe for trekkers.
"I have full confidence in Sylvie's judgment," Ms. Bastien said. "She always knew what was going on around her, and always had people's safety in mind. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
In an interview from Kathmandu, Mr. Gurung said it snowed all night before the two groups entered the Nar-Phu valleys, a new trekking destination north of the traditional Annapurna circuit.
A woman who was in the Terra Ultima group said the avalanche hit with a mix of rocks and snow clumps the size of basketballs.
Sonia Lévêque told Radio-Canada the trekkers were on a narrow trail at about 4,000-metre altitude, and had seen and heard smaller avalanches.
"We were looking out for avalanches, but this one really took us by surprise," Ms. Lévêque said.
She ended up buried to the waist in wet, heavy snow. She and her spouse dug themselves out. "We fought for our lives. We were lucky," she said.
Those missing include the 55-year-old Ms. Marois and two other members of the Terra Ultima group, a 59-year-old woman from a Montreal suburb, and Geneviève Adam, a 33-year-old nurse from Quebec City.
The fourth victim, hiking with Nepal Hidden, was Jan Rooks, 55, a nurse at the B.C. Children's Hospital in Vancouver.
Ms. Marois, Ms. Adam and Ms. Rooks were all well-travelled mountain-hiking enthusiasts.
News about Ms. Marois has shocked Quebec's tight-knit world of adventure tourism. She was an award-winning, highly respected expert in outdoors tourism and a mentor to countless people, Ms. Bastien said.
Ms. Adam had scaled Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania last year. Ms. Rooks and her husband, Grant Tomlinson, had trekked in the Ladakh portion of the Himalayas in 2008.
"It is an immense loss for our family," her family said in a statement that described Ms. Rooks as also "an accomplished pianist and keen environmentalist."
Ms. Lévêque said survivors had little success finding their missing companions because up to 20 metres of snow was piled up at the bottom of the avalanche.
Cold and wet, they walked for about an hour to shelter in a cabin.
Rescuers have recovered 10 bodies from the Phu area, the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal said.

Full text: Three other Canadians were rescued and airlifted back to Kathmandu
Fall is normally a prime period for trekking in Nepal, but for two years in a row, tropical cyclones striking the Indian subcontinent have disrupted weather all the way to the Himalayan range.
This week, the passing tail of Cyclone Hudhud triggered freak blizzards and avalanches in Nepal, killing at least 25 people, including four Canadian trekkers who were on a mountain pass north of the Annapurna range.
Three of the Canadian victims were Quebec women - a guide and two customers booked with the Montreal tour operator Terra Ultima. The fourth victim, a woman, was travelling with another Nepalese trekking firm. Their names were not released.
In addition, relatives and friends of two Ottawa-area women travelling in Nepal, Virginia Schwartz and Jane Van Criekingen, said they had not been in contact with the two since Saturday.
Three other Canadians were rescued and airlifted back to Kathmandu, Nepalese officials said.
The three Quebec victims were a 55-year-old Montreal resident who was a tour guide and group leader, a 59-year-old traveller from a Montreal suburb, and a 33-year-old woman from Quebec City. They were part of a group of six who left Canada on Oct. 3 for what was to be a three-week adventure.
"We are in a state of shock," said Julien Passerini, director of operations for Terra Ultima. "We are a small company. We know all our customers personally. These are very, very difficult moments."
Meanwhile, in Ottawa, Mark Schwartz was trying to find the whereabouts of his sister, Virginia, a 37-year-old from Pontiac, in west Quebec, who was in Nepal with her friend, Ms. Van Criekingen.
Mr. Schwartz said the family last heard from his sister on Saturday morning and the two women were heading toward Manang, the district where the other Canadians had died.
The family has set up a Facebook page, hoping that people in Nepal could use it to relay information about the missing.
There was conflicting information about the cause of the deaths and whether the bodies had been retrieved.
The Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal said the four Canadians died along with an Indian trekker in an avalanche in Manang district, northeast of Kathmandu. The five bodies were recovered, the trekking association said in a communiqué.
But Devendra Lamichhane, an administrator in Manang district, said a helicopter pilot located the bodies of the Canadians but could not get close.
"It's very difficult for a pilot. There's very heavy snowfall. It's very, very difficult geography," Mr. Lamichhane told The Globe and Mail in a phone interview from Manang. "Today we tried to send police and they could not get there. It is very, very difficult terrain."
The Nepalese army will resume searches Thursday morning by sending another helicopter, he said.
"We had lots of problems due to the weather. We are still searching and trying to help people," the trekking association's search-and-rescue co-ordinator, Keshav Pandey, told The Globe.
He said the Canadians died near Thorong La, a 5,400-metre-high mountain pass north of the Annapurna range. Thorong La is the high point of the Annapurna circuit, a well-trod trekking route. To reach the pass, visitors would have had to trek uphill for about four hours and would be at risk of acute mountain sickness.
Tim and Becky Rippel, whose Nelson, B.C., outfitting company, Peak Freaks, is leading an expedition in Nepal, reported that the Himalayas' snowline was lower this fall as a result of the cyclone.
The fall is normally good for trekking in Nepal. But the region has been hit by autumn cyclones for two consecutive years, Ms. Rippel said in an interview.
"We saw it coming off the Bay of Bengal and hitting India. You can pretty much predict what it will do," she said, noting that Hudhud's progress could be tracked as it made landfall.
While the weather has been unusual, she said it was the responsibility of tour operators to check climate conditions and delay treks until the snow had firmed up or shed off in avalanche-prone zones.
"Clients do pay when they go on a trip, they pay for risk management. So whoever was guiding them should have been aware that there was a big snowfall and you don't move."
According to the trekking association, three of the Canadian deaths were confirmed by their outfitter, Panorama Himalaya Trekking and Expedition Pvt. Ltd. The association said the death of the fourth Canadian was confirmed by another Kathmandu operator, Nepal Hidden Treks and Expedition.
"It was big snowfall on the mountain so many people are missing and killed," Nepal Hidden Treks team leader Harka Gurung said in an e-mail, adding that the company did not have more details because it had trouble contacting its group on the mountain.
Three yak herders were killed by a separate avalanche at Nar village in Manang, officials told Reuters. In neighbouring Mustang district, four hikers - a Nepali citizen, two Polish nationals and an Israeli - were also killed by a blizzard along the Annapurna circuit, district

Full text: Firefighters and other municipal workers, unhappy with proposed changes to their pensions, stormed City Hall and ransacked the public chambers as city council was about to sit
? Montreal's police earned a reputation during student protests in 2012 as a force willing to resort to tear gas, pepper spray and some muscled arrests to rein in rowdy demonstrators.
On Monday, they gained a different sort of image - that of a force prepared to look the other way when mayhem and vandalism are being caused by fellow city employees.
In scenes replayed repeatedly on Tuesday, police officers stood by impassively while municipal employees stormed into Montreal City Hall, roughing up councillors and throwing glass and papers into the council chambers.
In this case, the police happen to be part of the same pension dispute as their fellow civic employees.
Officers' apparent willingness to put solidarity before duty was met with widespread condemnation on Tuesday. Many were seen standing on the sidelines with their arms crossed while protesters - firefighters and other employees - surged into City Hall and invaded the council chambers.
Comparisons with the police's assertive behaviour toward students during their tuition-hike protests were inevitable.
"There can't be two types of treatment" toward protesters, Premier Philippe Couillard said after calling a press conference in Quebec City, going on to say that the "silence of our police forces" allowed city council to be disrupted by "threats and intimidation."
The acts "dishonour the very essence of our institutions and diminish the moral authority of our police forces," he said.
Officers' mostly laissez-faire approach Monday allowed the protest to degenerate. Demonstrators entered the council room as elected officials were about to meet; some wore hooded sweatshirts and bandannas over their faces. They swarmed over the chambers, overturned chairs, and threw a blizzard of papers - pages from their contracts - from the public viewing stands, littering the floor.
One councillor says he was punched in the side inside the council room. Mayor Denis Coderre says water glasses were thrown from the viewing area, and a window to his office was shattered after he retreated there with some councillors.
"This was an attack on democracy," he said, saying some protesters acted "like savages" and some councillors inside his office were scared.
The city police chief, Marc Parent, promised to probe the incident but was met with criticism for handing the job to internal police investigators.
He acknowledged that police behaviour at City Hall would raise public doubts about officers' neutrality and professionalism. "There were shortcomings in the security at City Hall," Chief Parent said.
The raucous scene underscores growing tensions over Quebec's Bill 3, a Liberal bill aimed at getting unions to kick in a larger share of their pension. As protests grow, so does the challenge to the leadership of Mr. Couillard and Mr. Coderre.
Until now, unions' displeasure with the pension changes has mostly taken the form of police officers wearing camouflage pants and firefighters plastering their trucks with stickers.
Judging from the reaction to Monday's events, the behaviour at City Hall isn't likely to win public opinion over to the unions' side.
Parliamentary hearings into Bill 3 open Wednesday in Quebec City. While Mr. Couillard said he's willing to listen to suggestions about improving the pension bill, he's standing firm on implementing changes and cleaning up in Quebec's public finances. The legislation seeks to have workers and cities evenly split the cost of filling their pension plans' $4-billion deficit.
"Quebec is entering a period of profound and necessary change," he said.

Full text: The Dead of Winter
Ho! Ho! Ho! Santa has brought crime fans a brand-new detective series set in Montreal, and it's terrific. Irish-Canadian lawyer Peter Kirby's Inspector Luc Vanier is just what the readers ordered for a Christmas-themed murder mystery.
Kirby, a star of the Fasken Martineau law firm, knows his hometown. From to restaurants to the hangouts of the down and out, we can follow the city like a map. The story begins on Christmas Eve with Inspector Vanier uncheerfully drinking himself into forgetfulness. The past includes a failed marriage and a recently ended relationship. Then he is summoned out. "Crime," he considers, "doesn't take holidays."
Five homeless people are dead in five different locations and it's clear that there is someone evil on the loose. The action covers the week between Christmas and New Year's, and takes Vanier from the mean streets to the highest echelons of Montreal society, including the upper reaches of the Catholic Church.
Kirby knows how to plot, build character and maintain suspense. His Vanier is realistic enough to be credible and interesting enough for readers to hope for a return visit. This is an auspicious debut from a writer to watch. Incidentally, this is a crime-fiction debut for the publisher, Linda Leith, as well. We'll be watching for more titles from her.
The Snow White Christmas Cookie
Funny, smart and the perfect antidote to the seasonal treacle, - the ninth novel by David Handler in the excellent Mitch Berger and Desiree Mitry series - turns the Christmas cozy on its head. As Des Mitry arranges to spend her first Christmas in the picturesque New England village of Dorset, it appears that hell has arrived for the holidays. There are three blizzards and 40 inches of snow. The next-door neighbour is dead of a drug overdose and there's a mail thief raiding this designated historic district.
Des could just kick back and ignore the mayhem, but then she uncovers ties to a black-market drug ring with overtones of organized crime and, with a fourth blizzard on the way, she's on the trail of a very cold killer. Don't mistake this for a traditional holiday novel with lots of cute bits. Handler knows how much sugar needs a dose of realism. This is the perfect "day after" book.
Fatal Winter
Those who love updated puzzle plots and solid English mysteries need look no further than this superb series featuring Anglican priest/sleuth Max Tudor. Malliet has managed to pay homage to Agatha Christie, while at the same time taking her favoured settings into the 21st century.
The setting is the perfect village of Nether Monkslip, where a house party at a local castle ends with two deaths. Max, who prior to his ordination was an operative for MI-5, finds plenty of motive among the dead's greedy relations, but it's his attraction to a local lady that is interfering with his deductive reasoning. This one has all the charm of an Agatha Raisin novel, but it's a lot cleverer.
All is Clam
Mountie Jane Jamison returns in this delightful Christmas confection set in The Shores, that lovely fictional spot just off the coast of Prince Edward Island. There's not yet snow, but there is murder, and it's one Jamison would just as soon not solve. The dead man was a bully and a thug. The suspects are all people once victimized by him and include women and kids. As she sifts the clues, she finds herself hoping for a Christmas miracle: that this death will turn into an accident. This one is great fun.

Full text: The Quebec-based team behind Ubisoft's blockbuster gaming franchise want to steer transmedia spinoffs themselves
The only thing worse than watching someone play a video game, I imagine, is watching them play one you've created. All things considered, François Pelland is being quite patient with me.
"No, no, you have to aim your cannons just ahead of the other ship to hit it. You have to give it time to catch up," he says, his frustration barely concealed as I muddle through a naval battle in , the latest incarnation of a video game franchise that's sold more than 40 million units.
I fire my ship's cannons, but the shots sail wide again. The enemy returns fire and, instead of instructing my crew to duck, I take the barrage full on. Crew mates are blown away and the masts start to burn. I picture Pelland, watching from off to the side, rolling his eyes in disgust.
The trio of opposing ships closes in to finish me off. With their final shots, the screen dims and the words "memory sequence lost" appear. That's how every game tells you that you've failed.
"Maybe we should have started with the tutorial," Pelland quips, smirking.
We're lounging on a couch next to his desk while a hive of activity buzzes around us. The team occupies the whole basement of the old textile factory that serves as Ubisoft Montreal's studio. It's mid-August, and they're in full production mode; the game is due for release on Oct. 30. That's in just over two months.
A digital clock nearby counts down the seconds, literally, until the game's code is frozen and shipped to video-game console makers for certification. There isn't much time left-about a million seconds, or 12 days, to be exact.
The game is "in great shape," says Pelland, its senior producer. Quality assurance is the only stage of production left to complete. The team removed 9,000 bugs last week, but there are thousands more to go. Volunteers from the public are also play-testing the game, and the developers will make final tweaks. Scenarios that prove too challenging for the volunteers (say, certain naval battles) may have their difficulty levels dialled down.
It's crunch time, and everyone knows it. "This is when I become cranky," Pelland says. "This is where we have to guarantee that the game is going to be [delivered] on time."
On some level, everyone at Ubisoft understands the importance of While the new game bears the numeral 3 (referring to the history-themed adventure series' shift into a third era and the addition of a new protagonist), it's actually the fifth game created for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, not to mention the various adaptations for mobile systems. The series has been instrumental in building Ubisoft into one of the biggest game publishers in the world, with 26 studios in 18 countries. Though it's based in France, Ubisoft can almost be considered a Canadian company. Nearly half of its 6,900 employees are here, while many of its biggest franchises-including and -are Canadian-made.
Expectations are high for the new which is something of a risk because it introduces a new storyline, setting and main character. Nevertheless, in March Ubisoft announced that had shattered the records for pre-orders in the U.S., surpassing last year's pre-release demand for by a factor of 10. The pressure for Pelland and Co. to deliver a hit is definitely on.
Arguably more importantly, Ubisoft hopes that will serve as the cornerstone of Ubisoft's ambitious plan to expand its reach beyond mere video games. With its deep and well-established fictional universe, the franchise is fertile ground for "transmedia," a growing trend in the gaming industry that enables companies to harvest more revenue from an intellectual property by taking the characters into other domains. While film, television and other spinoffs from video games have existed since the days of , they're often licensed out to third parties. By attempting to maintain creative control over its expansion into these areas, Ubisoft is breaking new ground.
* * *
Ubisoft, like most video game companies, was started by young men. Convinced that the market had a big future, the five Guillemot brothers-Claude, Gérard, Michel, Christian and Yves-founded Ubisoft in 1986 in Rennes, a small city about three hours west of Paris. The idea at the time was to publish and distribute games developed in North America and Japan to the growing audience in France. Yves, then 25, was named CEO. By the end of the decade, the company ventured into the creative arena with its own games. , a colourful adventure title, became Ubisoft's first bona fide hit in 1995.
Ubisoft was lured to Canada by prolific Québécois lobbyist Sylvain Vaugeois, who saw the firm becoming the linchpin of a new digital economy for Montreal. The federal and provincial governments teamed up to give the company generous annual tax credits of $25,000 per employee for five years in exchange for creating 1,000 jobs. Montreal, which was experiencing a corporate exodus (following the narrowly defeated 1995 referendum on sovereignty), was desperate for investment. Mayor Pierre Bourque personally drove the new studio heads around in his little blue car to look for office space. They settled on an old textile factory in the run-down Mile End area. The operation got up and running in 1997 with 50 employees imported from France, as well as seven tons of Playmobil sets. The studio heads awkwardly explained to customs agents at Montreal airport that the toys were needed to train recruits in the basics of three-dimensional modelling.
The 2002 spy game -Ubisoft Montreal's first high-profile title-won critical acclaim for its advanced use of light and shadow, and sold more than seven million copies. The next two years saw another pair of hits with and , relatively unremarkable "platformer" (think running-and-jumping) games that would go on to become part of a franchise that sold more than 10 million units.
Suddenly, Ubisoft Montreal was catapulted into the premier leagues of game development. The studio had expanded to nearly 1,000 employees, and a Quebec City outlet was in the works. Eager to capitalize on the successes, the bosses in France ordered another game. They expected a follow-up within the fantasy adventure-themed franchise.
Instead, Montreal went rogue.
It was January, 2004, and, fresh off a long vacation after the frantic production of , creative director Patrice Désilets wanted to try something different.
The new was supposed to run on the next generation of game consoles, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The only problem was, no one knew what the hardware specifications of the new consoles would be.
"It was a good thing," Désilets says, "because we just started to dream."
Désilets saw an opportunity. He envisioned a game similar to the popular series, where players could roam freely and accomplish objectives in any order they liked, though they were usually confined to city streets. In a clever twist, Désilets wanted players to be able to go wherever they wanted, without limit. If the player was curious about any structure visible within the game, they could climb on top of it.
The problem with building a more action-oriented instalment of was that the series' protagonist didn't fit. "The Prince is someone who's waiting around for the King to die so he can take his place, so while he's a Prince, he doesn't do much," says Désilets.
While considering the dilemma, Désilets suddenly remembered a book he had read in college about the hashashin, an order of warriors who inhabited mountain fortresses in Persia around the time of the First Crusade. It was the perfect backdrop for this next-generation adventure. Thus, -the game's unofficial title for its first two years of development-was born.
About 80 people worked on the game for the next two years, and by mid-2006, the team had a playable demo. By this point, Désilets could no longer hide what he had known all along-that this wasn't going to be a game. After years of subtly hinting at the truth, the team finally pitched Ubisoft's management as well as its marketing department on the idea that they had come up with something genuinely original. To their surprise, management agreed, and was officially born.
"I'm a bad employee because they asked me for and I came up with " Désilets says. "I didn't listen to my mandate."
The big test came in May, 2006, at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (known as E3) in Los Angeles, the game industry's most important showcase. The team showed off the prototype, and it was an immediate hit; won numerous accolades, including best action/adventure game in the Game Critics Awards.
It was finally released in November, 2007, and went on to become Ubisoft's biggest hit to date, its various instalments selling more than 39 million copies.
* * *
In a darkened conference room in Ubisoft Montreal's basement in March, François Pelland and Alex Hutchinson, 's Australian-born creative director, are about to show me the genesis of their new game. The pair came on board in early 2010, after Désilets had a falling-out with management over creative differences (he subsequently ended up at rival publisher THQ), and after the series' original producer, Jade Raymond, was promoted to head Ubisoft's new Toronto studio.
The first game in the franchise followed Altair, a Crusades-era assassin, on a quest through cities such as Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. , released in 2009, shifted the story to Renaissance Italy, where a mischievous nobleman's son named Ezio Auditore discovers his family's links to the assassin order. That game proved to be so successful for Ubisoft that it came out with two direct sequels, in 2010, and in 2011. With , Ubisoft has finally retired Ezio and shifted the focus to a new character, a half-English, half-native American assassin named Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor Kenway.
The franchise's underlying story, however, centres on Desmond Miles, a modern-day descendant of this assassin brotherhood who is forced to use a virtual reality device that lets him experience the lives of his ancestors. From an intellectual property perspective, Pelland and Hutchinson explain, the universe is cleverly constructed, in that it isn't wedded to one particular character or setting. It can move freely from the Crusades to the Renaissance to colonial America without missing a beat.
The potential variety of settings is also why Ubisoft management believes it can release games annually without the franchise getting stale. A road map for future instalments, is in place until at least 2019.
Pelland and Hutchinson show me a "mood" video, a trailer they put together early in their conception process that was intended to convey the new game's essence. Toy soldiers and model buildings-harkening back to the studio's Playmobil beginnings-stand in for the 3-D animation to come. Fife-and-drum music plays, giving the clip a real, colonial-era feel. The video was meant to unite the creatives behind a common vision. "One of the big disasters you can have is if your art team is over here making a fantasy game in primary colours, and your engineering team is making " Hutchinson says.
The next video Pelland and Hutchinson show me was made later in the development process. A hallmark of games has always been the main character's ability to run freely along rooftops and buildings. extends that ability into the natural world-a significant technical challenge. Hutchinson beams with pride that his team was able to overcome it.
At one point, the creators had planned to allow players to scalp their foes, but though this practice is historically accurate-scalping was a common battle ritual among some native American tribes-it was scrapped. "You know some creepy kid is going to do it, like, 50 times, and it's going to be on the Internet," Hutchinson says. "That's all your game is going to be about. It's the game where you scalp everybody."
* * *
While the gaming media loves Ubisoft, analysts aren't terribly crazy about it. In September, only a handful were rating the stock a "buy." In contrast, Activision Blizzard Inc., one of Ubisoft's main rivals, has more than a dozen "buy" recommendations, even though it is often criticized by gamers for milking its franchises such as and
Some feel Ubisoft may be overfocusing on certain franchises, such as , at the expense of others. The series, for example, initially saw four releases in four years, which fatigued the market, while other franchises, such as , go four years between releases.
"They need better planning," says Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. "? I don't get doing that every year and I think I'm pretty typical."
Yannis Mallat, president and chief executive of Ubisoft Montreal and Toronto, seems unwilling to strong-arm his creative team, pointing to the positive results of their decision to disobey their mandate and create instead of . The Montreal studio also currently has half a dozen early-stage projects on the go that headquarters doesn't yet know anything about. When the executives visit from France, the latest projects will be sprung on them for the first time, Mallat explains.
"We let the teams express what they want to do," he says. "It's really not an organization where the teams do what HQ wants. It's an organization where HQ wants to make sure the teams are empowered enough to impress and come up with content they're proud of."
The creativity-first approach may be paying off. After posting a full-year loss of €52 million in 2010, the company bounced back to a profit of €37 million this year, thanks to strong growth in digital and online sales. Creating and scheduling the release of various games isn't a science, Mallat says, but he feels the company is getting better at it. "Quality and innovation definitely go hand in hand with profitability and good figures."
Louis-Pierre Pharand is also looking for ways to help Ubisoft please the financial analysts. Two years ago, he made the jump from producing games-he worked on , as well as two of game publisher Electronic Arts' key franchises, and -to directing a new "transmedia" division at Ubisoft. It's a term that makes creative types cringe. "It's a big bullshit word that people use for everything," Pharand says. "It's used for everything from licensed products to a cellphone with a logo on it."
Ubisoft's transmedia efforts had to be different, Pharand says, because he didn't want to be some "executive schlub" looking to extract every last penny from the company's intellectual properties. Rather than just a simple licensing and marketing branch-the parts of a creative company tasked with extending its brands into other, potentially lucrative media, from TV and movies to T-shirts and mugs-Pharand's new UbiWorkshop division has narrative development and expansion as its core philosophy.
As became a priority for Ubisoft, UbiWorkshop has evolved into the company's own vertically integrated multimedia production house, charged with exploring potential new revenue streams. When Pharand wasn't happy with the job of mainstream comics publisher DC () in distributing the comic book, he pulled it in-house. The company was then able to control the size of its print run and its release dates. "On ubiworkshop.com and in Quebec bookstores alone, we surpassed what DC did with the sales of the soft-cover [comic books]. We also signed multiple deals in different territories," Pharand explains. "With a partner, these deals would have been complicated, if not impossible, to manage."
Then there's Ubisoft Montreal's new, proprietary Passenger technology, which takes 3-D animation and artwork created for games and repurposes them into footage that can be used in television, movies and online. Bringing in a 22-person team to test it out, Passenger enabled UbiWorkshop to create the 21-minute animated film , which depicts the final days of Ezio Auditore, one of the franchise's most beloved heroes. By using environments and crowd models created for , Pharand estimates Embers was three times cheaper to make than if it had been animated from scratch. The film was packaged along with various in-game extras into several versions of , which moved an additional million copies on top of the standard edition's sales. More importantly, Pharand says, UbiWorkshop now has the infrastructure to create an animated TV show completely in-house.
At Ubisoft, each game franchise has a "puzzle maker," or a person who ensures that transmedia opportunities (known as "gateways") are added during the design process. The puzzle maker is essentially the guardian of the franchise's canon, entrusted with making sure that a character created for a story in one medium, for example, fits in and doesn't conflict with the continuity in another medium. Puzzle makers are also there to remind every game developer to think about more than just games, and to design those gateways into their product, which is the opposite of how things have traditionally played out.
"We've all worked on games where someone has handed us a novel and said, 'Here.' And we're like, 'We didn't have anything to do with this,'" says Pat Redding, game director on
"We're having the opposite problem now, which is that we're very involved," adds Maxime Beland, 's creative director. Game developers will now sit down with comic-book writers and novelists, and brainstorm together. Some of their ideas might end up in the game itself, while others will filter into other media; regardless, there will be links and references between the two worlds. The process is creatively engaging, Beland says, though it does take time.
The vertical integration extends to the company's biggest projects, such as the recently announced film. Ubisoft Motion Pictures is now developing the project with Hollywood star Michael Fassbender (), who will act in and co-produce the film.
There's a pervading sense in the games industry that Hollywood studios just don't "get" games.
"Video game franchises usually don't make the jump to movies well. That's what we're afraid of. We don't want to be a statistic," Pharand says. "You don't give your baby away to anyone without being there as a watchdog."
Many comic book franchises once suffered similar fates, but, recently, companies like Marvel have become adept at churning out successful adaptations. After years of licensing characters to third parties that produced flops such as and , Marvel formed its own movie studio. The move allowed the company to maintain creative and quality control over its properties. Marvel's subsequent box-office success culminated with this summer's , one of 2012's biggest hits, with gross worldwide revenues of over a billion dollars .
Ubisoft had initially been in talks with Sony to produce the movie, but in 2010, when Disney's movie (based on the Ubisoft game) turned out to be both a critical and a commercial disappointment, the video game studio decided to go it alone. With Fassbender connected to the project, and Jean-Julien Baronnet, former CEO of EuropaCorp (the studio behind the popular series), heading up Ubisoft Motion Pictures, the new arrangement involves participants with track records as filmmakers while keeping things firmly within Ubisoft's grasp.
Pharand's next move is to transition UbiWorkshop into a group responsible for thinking up online initiatives based on non-traditional business models. In early 2013, the division will release a humour-driven, downloadable title for PCs that will generate revenue through in-game purchases such as weapons and armour. Free-to-play services, which are already huge in Asia, are projected to become a $7-billion market by 2015; in Europe, free-to-play titles make up more than half of the market for games.
"We're not a major player now [in free-to-play] but there's definitely an intention to have a wider offer there," Pharand says. "We want to build a different type of game development. We see ourselves as the renegades."

Back at Pelland's desk, the clock counts down the seconds before the code behind is frozen. Media and format expansion are the furthest thing from his mind; the immediate future of the franchise rests on the game itself. At this year's E3, with neither Microsoft nor Sony revealing much about their next-generation consoles, the show was anyone's to steal-and Ubisoft stepped up in a big way. Led by the company wowed audiences with a full complement of impressive games. A number of gaming critics declared Ubisoft "best in show," and scooped up numerous awards.
Pelland walks me through another sequence in the game. This time, I'm on terra firma, exploring an abandoned mansion that holds clues to a murder. I'm stuck inside one large room with no apparent exit. "Let's see how long it takes you to get out," Pelland says.
Unlike the naval battle, this is a familiar experience in games. Having to climb one's way out of places is old hat. After a few fruitless efforts, I discover a stuffed-bear trophy off to the side of the room. Grabbing onto his open maw, I climb up, then jump to a nearby chandelier. From there, the escape is easy. Pelland and I share a smile of satisfaction.

Full text: Platooning sees lead car set the pace and other cars follow along
Tired of driving? Then join a road train. You can fiddle with your smart phone, read the newspaper, have your lunch and save up to 20 per cent on fuel. At least that's the promise.
There's a project going on in Europe now call SARTRE. It's not J-P the existentialist - it stands for Safe Road Trains for the Environment. These road trains aren't the ones that have a tractor pulling two or three trailers instead of one. This kind of road train strings a bunch of cars together and is also known as platooning. The idea is that a lead car, driven by a professional driver who is not texting, sets the pace and all the electronic goodies that are in most new cars, like radar, sonar and cameras, keeps the cars tightly spaced and running together.
We've seen a few experimental cars that drive themselves but it is unlikely that governments and liability lawyers will allow them on the highways and byways anytime soon. However if you have a car with adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, cross traffic warning and the rest, you've got a car that is almost road-train-ready now.
The SARTRE project is running mini-road trains in Europe. The point is to show that a road train can operate safely on public highways without changes to the road and roadside infrastructure. Experiments have been done on "electronic highways" where they tear up the road and install electronic sensors and guide-posts and so on but they are tremendously expensive. The new idea for road trains is to use the stuff already built into cars.
The SARTRE tests have run vehicles at 85 km/h with the gap between each vehicle set at six meters. They are trying to demonstrate how the use of platoons can lead to environmental, safety and congestion improvements. On the environmental side they believe that driving in a platoon can cut your fuel burn by up to 20 per cent. They'll try to pack the vehicles in tighter together (bumper-to-bumper?) to maximize the drafting advantages (minimize air resistance) of tight spacing.
As to safety question - ask any automotive engineer and they'll tell you computers can drive a car better that you can if we would only allow it. In terms of congestion improvements it's obvious. Packing more vehicles into tighter spaces is the way to maximize the capacity of highway systems.
There are still lots of problems to be worked out but they seem far from insurmountable. For instance, if you sign on to the road train to Montreal, can you get off before Montreal? Or can you join it as it passes Oshawa? Cars with a touch of artificial intelligence could automatically join and leave platoons but we don't have that yet. In addition these tests have been run mostly in Spain so far where they lack blizzards, ice and moose. But a sunny, summer day on the 400 or 401 would seem to be no problem.
Automated highway systems are yesterday's bagels. They tried it near San Diego along I15 in 1997 and made some technical progress but the economics pointed directly toward autonomous intelligent vehicles rather than building specialized infrastructure. If you're using adaptive cruise control in your car now you know that you almost never have to touch the brakes or the gas. The lane departure and blind spot warning can also pull you back into the proper lane. Cross traffic warning can slam on the brakes before you back into someone. All this stuff is easily tweaked for road trains.
I'll keep an eye on how the SARTRE project works out and report back. They'll have to up the speed from 85 km/h or I'm sure most people would skip it, stick to the left lane and blow right past. I'd also like to see them change the name. Call it the Soul Train not the Road Train. Play the music and join in.

Full text: Irene downgraded to post-tropical storm but high winds and heavy rains still pack a punch
Downgraded from a hurricane, Irene still managed to wreak havoc on travellers' plans as it entered Canada on Sunday, with dozens of U.S.-bound flights cancelled and passengers travelling to and from Eastern Canada being warned they could suffer the same fate.
Now considered a post-tropical storm, Irene still brought hurricane-like conditions, with the worst winds in Nova Scotia and heaviest rains in Quebec and western New Brunswick.
As the remnants of the hurricane barrelled down on New Brunswick, Gordon Nason was crossing his fingers.
The pensioner is one of the few people left in Second Falls, a rural area west of Saint John, that has flooded already in the last year. Many people have moved away and condemned houses sit empty, their swing-sets unused and trees dropping fruit on the ground.
But Mr. Nason, who moved in after the floods to a house that had collected a foot of water, was cautiously optimistic Sunday afternoon. Manipulation of the dam upstream had brought down the river level, he said, reducing the chances it would again burst its banks.
"I think we're going to be okay, I'm not sure but I'm hoping so," he said. "I just watch the water. If it's rising I'll move out, I'll have to, until it goes down again."
Others were taking aggressive measures to protect against Irene. A home farther downstream had heavy equipment and a boat at the ready.
But some in the province were blasé about the approaching storm.
In the mid-evening a steady stream of cars were turning up at a Saint John beach, which the city had warned could experience a storm surge. Hundreds of people gathered under leaden skies at Saints Rest to watch the waves roll in. A windsurfer and a pair of kite-boarders took advantage of the gusts.
Although weather had been grim for much of the day, a number of people pointed to the example of past hurricanes that had received great attention and then fizzled before arriving.
Officials across the Maritimes have been pleading with residents to take this seriously.
"Let's all give this storm the respect it deserves," Ross Landry, Nova Scotia's Minister of Justice, said in a statement. "Irene will bring heavy rain and high winds and the hazards those conditions can create. Please err on the side of caution."
Western Nova Scotia and areas around the Bay of Fundy are under a tropical storm warning and will see wind gusts of up to 120 kilometres an hour. Grand Manan, an island just south of the New Brunswick mainland in the Bay of Fundy, and Yarmouth, on Nova Scotia's southwestern tip, are expected to receive the worst battering.
Porter Airlines, which flies out of Toronto Island's Billy Bishop airport, cancelled all Boston and Newark flights on Sunday. The company has asked passengers flying to Quebec City, Montreal, Halifax, Moncton and St. John's to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport, as they too might be cancelled.
More than 40 flights scheduled to arrive at Toronto's Pearson International Airport on Sunday night were cancelled by early evening, and dozens more were delayed. The majority of cancelled flights were from the eastern United States, though one flight from Montreal was cancelled, likely due to the number of planes stuck at U.S. airports. Many flights from Atlantic Canada were pre-emptively listed as delayed, signalling that the region is preparing for harsh conditions.
More than 248,000 homes were without power in Quebec Sunday night as Hurricane Irene steamed northward. Hydro-Quebec said most of the outages were in the Montreal region, the Eastern Townships and the Quebec City area as the outer fringes of the storm brought heavy rain and gusts to the province.
Eastern Quebec - including Quebec City, Sherbrooke, and the Eastern Townships - and western New Brunswick are expected to receive 50-100 millimetres of rain over the course of the day.
Parts of southwestern New Brunswick and southern Quebec have already received in well excess of 50 millimetres of rain. Fredericton, N.B., received 83 millimetres of rainfall by midnight and Sherbrooke, Que., had been drenched by about 105 millimetres.
The storm's effects in the region are expected to last through Monday, with some wind and rain lingering into Tuesday. By Monday evening, Irene's centre is expected to be over Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula.
Its reach is so wide that cities as far west as Ottawa could see heavy rains by Monday. Bursts of wind and rain are expected to hit Labrador, but not nearly with the same intensity as the Maritimes and southern Quebec.
Chris Fogarty, program supervisor with the Canadian Hurricane Centre in Halifax, said that after Irene's rainfall passes through the Maritimes, the wind will remain - meaning some areas could see a sunny day with wind gusts up to 100 km/h.
Wind warnings have been issued for much of the region. Environment Canada said Windy Hill near Greenwood, N.S., reported a wind gust of 93 km/h early Monday and gusts of 90 to 110 km/h are forecast for early Monday over exposed areas.
On Saturday, Irene was a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest designation on the scale, but changed in shape as it moved north, Mr. Fogarty said, becoming a post-tropical storm by Sunday afternoon.A post-tropical storm is greater in area but weaker in intensity than a hurricane, he said. Rather than high-intensity winds near the centre of the storm, it is spread out among the storm system. The nature of the storm is such that rain will be heavier on the west side of Irene's track of movement, while wind will be heavier in the east."The highest winds near the centre of the storm are not nearly as intense as they are down in the tropics," Mr. Fogarty said.When viewed by satellite, Mr. Fogarty said, a post-tropical storm looks more like a wintertime blizzard, more comma-like in shape than a concentrated hurricane.Despite the classification, Environment Canada - which oversees the Canadian Hurricane Centre - has issued a tropical-storm warning for the Bay of Fundy area, "just to make people a little bit extra aware of the potential for higher winds," Mr. Fogarty said.The Canadian Hurricane Centre monitors coastal weather even before hurricane season, predicting how major storms will change as they approach Canada.As Irene enters Canada on Sunday, Environment Canada asks residents to monitor the weather as frequently as they can.

Up to 180,000 homes were without power in Quebec on Sunday as hurricane Irene steamed northward as a tropical storm that forecasters cautioned still had enough punch to cause flooding and wind damage by the time it reaches Eastern Canada.
Hydro-Quebec said most of the outages were in the Montreal area as the outer fringes of the massive downgraded hurricane brought heavy rain and winds gusting to 90 kilometres an hour to the area despite still be centred over New England.
Chris Fogarty, director of the Canadian Hurricane Centre in Halifax, said Irene was expected to push fully into the Maritimes and eastern Quebec late Sunday and into Monday.
He said the heaviest rainfall was expected in Quebec while high winds and pounding surf were more of a concern in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
"The heaviest rainfall is occurring in the Quebec region - the Eastern Townships - and with the water levels already particularly high there, that (flooding) is going to be the concern," he said.
Fogarty said rainfall amounts could approach 100 millimetres in some areas of eastern Quebec and parts of northwest New Brunswick.
St. Stephen, N.B. saw 35 mm of rain fall in little over an hour early in the morning. Eastern Quebec - including Quebec City, Sherbrooke, and the Eastern Townships - and western New Brunswick are expected to receive 50-100 mm of rain over the course of the day.
Western Nova Scotia and areas around the Bay of Fundy, meanwhile, have a tropical storm warning and will see wind gusts of up to 120 km/h.
Grand Manan, an island just south of the New Brunswick mainland in the Bay of Fundy, and Yarmouth, on Nova Scotia's southwestern tip, are expected to receive the worst battering.

Its reach is so wide that cities as far west as Ottawa could see heavy rains by Monday. Bursts of wind and rain are expected to hit Labrador, but not nearly with the same intensity as the Maritimes and southern Quebec.

Irene's intense conditions have caused numerous flight cancellations. Porter Airlines, which flies out of Toronto Island's Billy Bishop airport, cancelled all Boston and Newark flights on Sunday. The company has asked passengers flying to Quebec City, Montreal, Halifax, Moncton and St. John's, N.L. to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport, as they too might be cancelled.
About two dozen flights out of Toronto's Pearson International Airport had been cancelled for Sunday by noonhour - many to New York, but some even to Detroit and Minneapolis. No flights to Atlantic Canada had been cancelled at that hour.
Both WestJet and Air Canada are warning passengers travelling to storm-affected areas, including Atlantic Canada, that their flights may be delayed or cancelled.
Mr. Fogarty said that after Irene's rainfall passes through the Maritimes, the wind will remain - meaning some areas could see a sunny day with wind gusts up to 100 km/h.
Wind warnings have been issued for much of the region, including Western Nova Scotia and areas around the Bay of Fundy. Irene will reach peak intensity in these areas around 11 p.m. Sunday night. Mr. Fogarty said these regions, when at high tide, are at the biggest risk for flooding.
On Saturday, Irene was a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest designation on the scale, but changed in shape as it moved north, Mr. Fogarty said, becoming a post-tropical storm by Sunday afternoon.
A post-tropical storm is greater in area but weaker in intensity than a hurricane, he said. Rather than high-intensity winds near the centre of the storm, it is spread out among the storm system.

Montreal Impact's brutal season gains a pulse

Full text: Heading into next year's leap to MLS, Quebec squad hopes it can only go up from here
? They talked to players from other clubs, they visualized, planned, girded.
If it's one thing to intellectualize upheaval, it's quite another to actually experience it up close in the way the Montreal Impact have done in their buffer year between lower-league NASL and the MLS glamour circuit.
"It's something you have to go through to really know what it's about," said 34-year-old defender Nevio Pizzolitto, the club's captain. "It's easy to say at the beginning of the year that there's going to be guys coming and going, it's a try-out, it's a transition year, but it's easier said than done. But I think you grow . . . and the club grows and learns from a tough year like this."
Tough year is something of an understatement: amid a blizzard of changes, the Impact have played 21 games this year and won just four - two of them against expansion strugglers Edmonton and one last week against the last-place Atlanta Silverbacks.
The low point? Well, it's hard to pick just one.
There's the nine-game winless streak; the time the skipper spat at rival fans (he was later cleared of doing so intentionally); the day the owner publicly chewed out the club's most loyal supporters.
A total of 46 men have rotated through the squad this year; high-profile European signings Kevin Hatchi and Idriss Ech-Chergui were both released in mid-summer, as was French defender Richard Pelletier, who signed in 2010.
Under fire coach Marc Dos Santos resigned at the season's mid-point, the plan to expand Saputo Stadium to 20,000 seats - it includes $23-million in public funds - has been delayed because the initial tenders came in over-budget.
All in all, it's a narrative of turmoil and futility that will seem familiar to soccer fans in Vancouver, but the picture isn't all menacing storm clouds as the season winds down and MLS beckons.
In fact, there is plenty of cause for optimism.
Attendance for Impact games has mostly held steady despite the anemic performances, corporate interest for sponsorships and luxury suites is picking up.
And the club signed a pair of lucrative contracts with shirt sponsor BMO (which also sponsors Toronto FC) and with upstart French-language cable network TVA Sports.
"Let's face it, this is moment in our club's history . . . yes, it's challenging, but everyone is pumped up," said Richard Legendre, the Impact's executive vice-president, adding "it feels pretty much like we're organizing two seasons at the same time - it's very motivating."
Legendre said new tenders for the stadium will be issued in the next two weeks - the club has opted for pre-engineered stands that will allow the project to make budget without sacrificing the plans for covered roof sections.
The fact that construction will begin after the season will also mitigate costs, even if it means that the team has to play its first few MLS games in the Olympic Stadium.
"The Big O has been good to us, we had 55,000 for Santos Laguna, 47,000 for (a friendly against) AC Milan," said Legendre.
Indeed, the club is eyeing the possibility of holding its season openers in the cavernous stadium - which works much better for soccer than it ever did for baseball - in future seasons as well.
All that remains is to meet the target of selling 15,000 season tickets - Legendre says "it's the biggest challenge in the next seven or eight months" - and to find takers for the remaining corporate boxes.
The Impact has also hired a new coach for next season, former MLS player and U.S. national team assistant coach Jesse Marsch, and has taken points from its last two games - the NASL format is forgiving: six of the eight teams in Montreal's division will make the playoffs and the Impact sit seventh.
"We have seven games left . . . this team should not be in the position we are in with the players we have, so we'll see," said sporting director and interim field boss Nick De Santis.
The former Impact playing star has been singled out for particularly brutal treatment by a segment of the fan base including the team's Ultras (a loyal, hard-core fans group that briefly staged a walk-out to protest the squad's ineptness on the pitch).
De Santis ripped the Ultras in a recent radio interview and team president and principal owner Joey Saputo followed suit when the fan group slammed the team's recruitment policy and ticket price hikes, among other things.
"I think this season hasn't really accomplished very much, it's raised more questions than it's answered about the players who were here and the ones brought in," said Patrick Leduc, a former Canadian international midfielder who retired from the Impact last spring.
The fact that no players are under contract for next season has only accentuated the daily pressures of competitive soccer.
"I don't think you can say it hasn't been a distraction. Even it's not management's intention, guys have trouble feeling that the club is behind them," said Leduc, who now writes a soccer column for La Presse.
There is also criticism that the Impact didn't fully assimilate the lessons learned by fellow Canadian MLS sides Toronto FC and the Vancouver Whitecaps - both have struggled to find the stability that allows good clubs to flourish.
De Santis holds a different view.
"I think we've learned an important lesson: we all have to be on the same page. If we work together and have the same vision and same principles - we can have different opinions - we will have success," he said.
With the highly-regarded Marsch in place (the 37-year-old has attended training regularly since his appointment) the preparations for next year are in full swing.
Though Saputo has repeatedly said he doesn't want the Impact to look like a typical expansion club (i.e., lose a lot), De Santis is realistic in his expectations.
"Jesse's message was 'if you think things are difficult this year, wait until next year.' That's a reality," he said. "We have to look at what's been done by other expansion teams and fix certain things, but the reality is we are an expansion team and we have to find 20 odd new players," he said.
The emphasis will shortly shift to finding bargains in the South American and European lower divisions, and planning for this winter's expansion draft and the MLS Super Draft (Montreal has the top pick among U.S. college players).
But more immediately, there is the NASL season and despite injuries to Canadian forwards Reda Agourram and Ali Gerba, the team, with several new arrivals including on-loan Colombian striker Miguel Montano, is showing signs of rounding into form.
"We're starting to have fun again, and I think that's very encouraging," said Pizzolitto.
Winning is the balm that soothes all wounds, and the players are trying to put the best possible spin on their situation.
"There's positives as well. In Vancouver there's a handful of guys who stayed, in Portland as well. So it's not that they're going to change the team completely, if you perform well enough you have a chance," Pizzolitto said.
The Whitecaps, who have had a rude introduction to MLS and sit in last place, also had an up-and-down season in their transition year.
But they also managed to play well enough to reach the league semi-finals (beating fellow MLS expansion team Portland along the way).
"It's the end of the year that people remember . . . we absolutely want to do it. Can we do it? Absolutely," Pizzolitto said. "If we pick up a few wins here and get into the playoffs, I don't think any team is going to want to play us.."

Mega Brands Inc. is making another play at the grown-up toy collector with its plans to make construction toys based on the popular medieval and online games.
Following its success with Microsoft's video game, the Montreal-based toy maker has signed a licensing agreement with Blizzard Entertainment.
is a multiplayer online role-playing game that has millions of devotees around the world. StarCraft is a real-time strategy game.
The and products appeal to older children and adult collectors who are more willing to pay higher prices for their passion, said Vic Bertrand Jr., chief innovation officer at Mega Brands.
The average buyer, for example, is 30 years old. "For every 10-year-old, there's a 40-plus out there buying so it skews up there in age," he said in an interview.
The older collectible buyer is very loyal and typically craves everything available with the game. Mr. Bertrand also said the manufacturer is also able to have discussions more easily with adults about the products they'd like to see.
The addition of highly collectible toys allows Mega Brands to stretch the price points for the construction sets. The most expensive toys, for example, will sell for $100, while those geared for boys will top off at $50 to $60.
That makes the partnership with gaming companies a winning strategy, says Neil Linsdell of Versant Partners.
"I think the target here is to replicate the kind of success that they've had with and then you've got a real gangbuster toy," he said in an interview.
Mr. Linsdell said and allow the Mega Bloks maker to have the best of both worlds by diversifying its product offering while also solidifying its core market.
"It does move you up to a new demographic which is obviously not as price sensitive."
The company declined to disclose sales for or its estimates for the toys.
Since last year's recapitalization, Mega Brands has announced a series of licensing agreements for construction toys including Hello Kitty, Thomas the Tank Engine and Need for Speed.
The addition of the deal shows that the company is "on the fast track to get back to the growth that they had before," Mr. Linsdell added.
Mega Brands, which was hammered from the fallout of several recalls of its magnetic toys, hopes to be back to $500-million of annual revenues within four years.
The and -themed Mega Bloks will make their retail debut in summer 2012, a year after the fever among younger audiences is expected to peak for .
The deal with opens the possibility for other new worlds but not 's other game .
"Our players regularly amaze us with their creativity, and we're confident that they'll enjoy building and collecting the - and -themed construction sets that we'll be bringing to market with Mega next year," stated Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment.
has been the world's best selling multiplayer online role-playing game since its debut in 1994. followed in 1998, with the sequel in 2010.
The new deal doesn't signify waning interest in , Mr. Bertrand added. Microsoft Games plans to relaunch later this year, followed in the fall of 2012 by .
Unlike the games, which are futuristic military games typically played on Xbox systems, the Blizzard offering is an online world full of castles and fantasy vehicles.

Full text: Bruce Dowbiggin on the statistical screed of Mike Gillis and Vancouver’s relationship with the Canucks
Has Colin Campbell declared war on the nattering nabobs of negativity in the media? Since the NHL Director of Operations' tempestuous radio visit to TSN 1050 last week, refs have seemingly put away the whistles. Watching the Vancouver- Chicago game Tuesday night, the after-whistle punch, high stick or slew foot are suddenly a-okay again. Has Campbell declared a return to "let the players decide" hockey to vex his media antagonists?
Who knows what lurks in the minds of hockey men?
Canucks GM Mike Gillis had his opinions about Campbell's thoughts, but he wasn't suggesting any theories Monday as he employed the time-honoured media scum to rattle off a few statistics. Okay, he dropped an ad hominem or two in there, but mostly it was a statistical screed on how the ice has been tilted during their series with Chicago. It was left to Vancouver media to connect the dots to a tinfoil hat conspiracy. And whether the absence of calls against Vancouver in Game 7 proved Gillis' strategy had worked. Even though the Canucks were hit with a crucial penalty in overtime, most media thought the Canucks escaped being called for several more.
Hockey Mad: "Vancouver's a city gone mad."-- caller to on TEAM 1040 Monday. Forget the drop-dead scenery, the fabulous restaurants, the mild weather -- Vancouver can make you crazy. Thanks to its melodramatic hockey team, Van City turned civic angst into an art form in the run-up to Tuesday's Game 7 against their Chicago nemeses.
Quite a statement about a town that rioted when the 'Nucks were beaten in the 1994 finals. Where Leafs Nation, with all its neuroses, can at least summon up 11 previous Cups, Vancouver's loyalists have only the bitter herbs of forty years of failure. "Did I jump off the bandwagon?" asked another TEAM 1040 listener in the wake of the Canucks' 2-1 OT winner. "Of course I did."
Nothing charts the mood of a city better than sports talk radio, and Tuesday's mood was "pure panic," says TEAM 1040 afternoon host David Pratt. "I haven't seen our phone boards light up like this since the (Todd) Bertuzzi incident (in 2004). Tuesday was probably the biggest game for this city since 1994. If they'd lost it would have been the darkest day in Canuck history, going from 3-0 to Armageddon."
To explain the city's mishegas relationship with its team, Pratt says you must see the Canucks as Charlie Brown and everyone else in the NHL as Lucy, pulling the ball away at the last moment. "It's 40 years of getting their hearts ripped out," notes Pratt.
Throwing petrol on the auto-da-fe was Gillis's cri de coeur about the refereeing-- which recalled a similar performance from former Vancouver GM Brian Burke who coined the immortal line, "Sedin is not Swedish for punch me" in a Detroit series last decade. "When Burke did that in 2002, that was gamesmanship," Pratt says. "Mike Gillis had an argument, the discrepancy was real. So no, I don't think he was wring to get the fans worked up."
Omission/Commission: So how to explain the seeming discrepancy pointed out by Gillis? A recent book Scorecasting BY John Wertheim and Tobias Moscowitz suggests that what appears to fans to be an agenda of the league or its referees is, in fact, human nature at work. The authors say humans give the benefit to errors of omission over errors of commission-- i.e., refs swallowing the whistle rather than insinuating themselves into a close game. "People are rarely held to account failing to act, though those errors can be just as costly," writes Wertheim/Moscowitz.
Officials in every league subscribe to the physician's motto "Do no harm", thereby (subconsciously) keeping games close. So, umpires statistically call the 3-0 pitch a strike or an 0-2 pitch a ball. NBA refs make up for a casual foul by letting another go. And while NHL refs continue to call objective fouls (too many men, delay of game) they will allow John Scott punching Alex Burrows in the mush or Dave Bolland two-handing Henrik Sedin's stick in a critical situation. Penalty minutes per penalty also go down later in NHL games.
But, the authors say, this appearance of non-bias is a bias too. Pocketing the whistle is "a noble objective," write the authors. "But it expresses an unmistakable bias, and one could argue that it is worse than the normal, random mistakes referees make during a game." The Philadelphia Flyers of the 1970s played this omission/ commission card like a Les Paul, intimidating referees through a blizzard of fouls to not call one more.
Still, leagues reward officials who omit, not commit. "You might have a longer career as an official if you back off," NFL referee Mike Carey, one of the very best, is quoted as saying. "But you won't have a more accurate career."
Close Calls: TSN swings and missed Tuesday on how the Daniel Briere and Milan Lucic boarding penalties were different. Philly's Briere got just two minutes for what TSN's Pierre McGuire said was a "vicious" hit, while Boston's Lucic got five and a game for boarding Montreal's Jaroslav Spacek. (Briere later combined with Mike Richards, who escaped justice for a similar boarding in game five, on a goal to eliminate Buffalo.) Retired ref Kerry Fraser told the TSN audience that the hits were different but declined to show how or why. Fans went from befuddled to vexed while players keep trying to kill one another.
Speaking of referees, never understand the quick whistle when referee "loses sight of the puck". If puck is frozen it'll be frozen in a second, a minute, a week from now. Let the play continue. But the TV types buy into this bromide as if it's logic, like "I before E except after C". Like hand passes in defensive zone.
BTW: CBC at its very best in the booth Tuesday. Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson have already become the sine qua non, but they took their work to another level in the mind-bending tension of Game Seven Game 7 between Vancouver and Chicago. Hughson (mostly) curtailed his Canuck instincts while Simpson was level-headed and perceptive. Meanwhile, Bob Cole's church-organ pipes boomed in the Boston/ Montreal Game 6. Love how Cole drops the article to call them "Canadiens" the way Danny Gallivan once did. "Here come Canadiens to centre ice..."
Fill It Up With Premium: Optics are everything. When a judge lifted the NFL's lockout of its players, Miami Dolphins defensive back Will Allen arrived at team headquarters in his Bentley, garnering immense public sympathy for the plight of players in the labour dispute. Players also make a great fuss about avoiding an 18-game schedule, citing the rigours on their bodies, giving fans value for their money. Funny, players never make a peep about the league's fans paying full price for the four worthless exhibition games that most of them miss -- but which cost ticket holders full price.

Monster storm wallops Quebec, New Brunswick

Full text: In Sherbrooke, Quebec, police urged people not to leave their homes
? Snowmobiles were deployed to help heart-attack victims, people skied down sidewalks and cars slipped and slid as a monster storm walloped Quebec and New Brunswick on Monday.
Up to 70 centimetres was expected in pockets of the region and there were multiple road closures as snowfall greatly exceeded forecasts.
New Brunswick Hydro reported 3,000 customers were without electricity Monday afternoon in Fredericton and Bouctouche, after freezing rain also fell on that province.
In southeastern Quebec, snowmobiles were being pressed into service to help ambulances reach patients.
The police in Sherbrooke, Que., about 120 kilometres southeast of Montreal, used their snowmobiles to aid the ambulance crews by creating a path for the emergency vehicles.
In two cases Monday morning, the snowmobiles helped ambulance attendants reach two heart-attack victims who were stricken while shovelling the heavy snow.
Martin Carrier, a Sherbrooke police spokesman, said the victims were a man and a woman in their 50s.
"I've been told they're stable," Mr. Carrier said later Thursday. "There's no danger to their lives."
Police and firefighters were also deployed to help three doctors to get to the hospital, one of them a surgeon who had to perform urgent surgery.
The storm had other effects on medical services in the city, which is the largest in the Eastern Townships. The Sherbrooke university hospital centre, the area's biggest hospital, rescheduled appointments and elective surgery.
Police took the exceptional step of urging residents not to leave their houses.
"Visibility is nearly zero and there's a lot of accumulation in the streets," said Mr. Carrier at the storm's peak.
"The Sherbrooke police service is asking people to avoid travelling on the road and to stay at home."
The city put its emergency measures plan into effect in the wee hours as it became clear the weather situation was deteriorating and travel along city streets became virtually impossible.
A command post was set up to monitor snow-clearing and co-ordinate emergency response. The city's bus service was shut down. Schools and university classes in the area were cancelled.
Police urged people to only use the 911 emergency line for only the most urgent situations. The system had been flooded with calls as the storm intensified.
In several cases, cars sat in their parking spaces buried under a mountain of snow with only hints of metal peeking through the powder.
People found unique means to make their way around the city, as the air filled with the roar of snowblowers and passing plows shoved mountains of the powdery white stuff in front of them.
Snowmobiles zipped along streets as pedestrians put on snowshoes and cross-country skis to make their way around town. Some of the more adventurous even flew down hilly streets on snowboards.
Cars crawled and sometimes slipped and slid off the road, resulting in a few crunched fenders.
Elsewhere around Quebec, the provincial transport department closed some highways due to poor visibility.
Montreal got around 20 centimetres, with gusting winds. An army of snow removal equipment hit the streets in Montreal in the early-morning hours and city officials said operations were going well.
Andre Cantin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the wintery blast was "quite a big storm."
"A very significant amount of precipitation fell over the Eastern Townships and just south of Montreal - in fact over the south shore all the way to Rimouski and even Gaspe," he said.
"All those regions, they got between 40 to 60 and even 70 centimetres of snow."
Mr. Cantin said the storm was not unusual for this time of year, although the amount of snow may be a record for some areas.
"The month of March is generally where we get our worst snowstorms because the air gets warmer, there's more humidity in the air, more humidity available to form precipitation."
Snowfall was greater for some areas than predicted because a weather system moved slightly from the path it was being tracked on.
Monday's storm followed the 40th anniversary of a blizzard that dumped close to 50 centimetres of snow on Montreal on March 4, 1971. That storm was blamed for 30 deaths in Quebec, 17 of them in Montreal.
Mr. Cantin said forecasters expected better weather in the coming days.
"I don't think winter is over yet but we'll get relief."

Full text: Keys to the game for Montreal and Saskatchewan at Sunday's Grey Cup in Edmonton
? Montreal Alouettes
1. Stay loose. No matter how dominant they are in the regular season, quarterback Anthony Calvillo and the Alouettes' offence always seem to play tight on the biggest stage.
2. Man up. On a chilly Alberta evening, against a team that practises in blizzards and is known for its resiliency, Montreal is going to have to match Saskatchewan's heartiness.
3. Avon Cobourne. The most outstanding player from the 2009 Grey Cup game could make all the difference if he gets Montreal's ground game in gear.
4. Chip Cox. The outside linebacker has a nose for the ball (two interceptions against Saskatchewan this year), and his ability to blitz with speed and stealth could really disrupt the Riders' offence.
Saskatchewan Roughriders
1. Green energy. It is bound to be another home game for the Riders, and the Sea of Green could certainly help disrupt Montreal's offence.
2. Weston Dressler. The Riders' receiver owned Montreal defensive backs in two games this year (22 catches, 323 yards, three touchdowns) and will either be a primary target or one heck of a decoy.
3. Darian Durant. The Riders' quarterback also got fat on the Alouettes in 2010 (926 passing yards, seven touchdowns), and seems to be able to read Montreal's defences better than most opponents.
4. Special teams. The Alouettes are clearly better in this area, so it is incumbent on kicker Warren Kean, punter Eddie Johnson and return specialist Ryan Grice-Mullen not to make the big mistake.

Perched behind the bar, a vast gilt-framed mirror reflects the elegant stone-walled dining room with its vintage wedding-present china, white leather banquette and stuffed boar's head mounted on the wall.
The kitchen plays with French and Italian cooking and supports it with a deep and well-chosen wine list, but the bar is about pure mixology.
Renowned Montreal bartender Manny Vidas created the original menu - he still mans the bar on Tuesdays - but he has passed the reins to colleague Graham Warner to develop the winter lineup. It features lots of figs, vanilla, brandy and bourbon, and has a handy little guide to the type of glass - highball, martini, rocks - your drink will come in.
Perhaps its most impressive accomplishment, however, is the St-Moine le Cochon, which translates roughly as the dirty little priest; it's a drink that reimagines the Cosmopolitan, that most frivolous of cocktails, as something with substance and depth.
This version features B&B instead of vodka and cranberry-infused bitters instead of triple sec. It gets added body from the use of fresh egg white.
St-Moine le Cochon
Ingredients
2 ounces B&B
1 ounce pressed lemon juice
White of one medium-sized egg
3 dashes of cranberry-infused Angostura bitters (see recipe below)
Method
Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass, add ice and shake well. Strain into an ice-cold martini glass and garnish with three dried cranberries floated on the surface.
Cranberry-infused Angostura Bitters
Ingredients
Bottle of Angostura bitters
A dozen dried cranberries
Method
Empty the entire bottle of bitters into a Mason jar and drop in a dozen dried cranberries. Close the jar and leave in a warm, dark place for two weeks, shaking once daily. After two weeks, pour the mixture into a food processor and blend. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer.

Full text: New technology unveiled during Friday night's Canadiens game allows hockey fans to choose which camera angle to watch the game
Is it the future of televised hockey or simply a fascinating footnote on the road to more sophisticated NHL coverage? CBC rolled out its online access camera feature for Friday night's Boston-Montreal centennial celebration. As the Canadiens (finally) put 100 years of history behind them, it was intriguing to think that the access cam launch might be almost as historic an occasion as the game.
For those who watched Friday, the chance to say they were there the day 360 became a commercial reality in hockey.
The device - positioned at centre ice, just above the level of the protective glass - provides a 360-degree panorama of the action during a game. Fans with the requisite online technological capability can choose to view the play on the ice, the players on the bench, the fans in the stands, the Jumbotron or just about anything else that occurs within the radius of the device (which was developed by Calgary's Immersive Media). Eagle-eyed viewers could see Sergei Kostitsyn flee down the tunnel to the dressing room after taking a big hit or catch Bruins players sharing a laugh on the bench.
In effect, fans can now produce their own broadcast of the game without the middle man of a director choosing shots. There was no play-by-play associated with the game. Thanks to Chevrolet's sponsorship of the soccer-ball sized gizmo, there were no commercial interruptions. Online viewers had the closest approximation of a live game experience as a result. (The NFL has recently used versions of the 360 technology for major games and for breaking down highlights or strategies.) Of course, they also suffered the ear-splitting music and in-game promotions of the Bell Centre.
So how did it work? Technically, the experiment - which will be repeated at various games throughout the year - seemed to work well. There were no lags or delays in the coverage, no dropouts, no blurring of the action (unless you tried to zoom in). Essentially it was like having the viewing field of a very good seat - without binoculars to get closer. Or the smell of the Bell Centre hot dogs.
Drawbacks? Once viewers were finished noodling the technology's novelties, it settled into a more conventional game cast (which the TV pros capture well already). The nets seem a little distant. Despite the win, the hapless Habs don't look any better in 360 than they do in high definition. But certainly, nothing enough to warrant complaint.
According to Hockey Night in Canada executive producer Sherali Najak, cost and accessibility in various arenas will dictate future usage. The access cam will be available for the Winter Classic on New Year's Day.
Close Call
The vicious winter storm that hit western Canada on Friday almost played havoc with CBC's coverage of the women's World Cup races at Lake Louise. Host Scott Russell was caught in transit as the Calgary airport cancelled almost half its inbound flights. The Trans Canada Highway leading to Lake Louise, too, was closed for a time. Contingency plans were drawn up, local CBC host Doug Dirks (already at the venue) was put on notice to stand by. After an arduous day's travel from Toronto, Russell finally made it through the blizzard to the Chateau Lake Louise at 2 a.m. to call the races that went off at noon.
Tin Cup Nothing quite like the final day of the PGA Tour's qualifying school. Exultation and despond for the game's grinders hoping to be the next Tiger, er, Phil Mickelson.
Today's final round on the Golf Channel is a torturous, six-hour ordeal for the Canadians and others in the field to get their Tour card for 2010. Graham DeLaet of Weyburn, Sask., is close to a lock for his card, but the other Canadians will be hard pressed to get one of the top 25 and ties who receive exemptions for 2010. Chris Baryla of Vernon, B.C., has a card but is trying to upgrade. If you want reality TV, just watch the faces on the 18th hole today.
Can You Hear Me Yet?
Finally, Rod Peterson, the Saskatchewan Roughriders' play-by-play caller, had a Grey Cup to forget. After calling Corus' nationwide radio feed of the first half of the game at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, Peterson watched the second half on the sidelines while Rick Moffatt of Montreal's CJAD called the second half of Montreal's dramatic win.
Peterson was up close and personal at the bench for the Riders' bitter 13th-man denouement. Devastated after the game, he noticed his cell phone hadn't been working on the field. When he finally got it to work he found a message from the radio booth. Believing Saskatchewan was about to win, the producers had invited him to come back up to call the final three minutes of the game - and, without knowing, chronicle the Roughriders' classic choke.

Review: Nest of Spies, by Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya

Full text: Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya's attack on Canada's anti-spy measures is off-base, filled with errors and quick to embrace dubious conspiracy theories. Tretiak was a spy?!
Hidden somewhere in this messy nest of a book is a bold polemical pamphlet, or maybe, better yet, a PowerPoint briefing, just waiting to be born. The authors, one of whom is a professional journalist (de Pierrebourg), the other a security consultant and former CSIS officer (Juneau-Katsuya), have a legitimate message: There are spies (mostly of the economic variety) under our beds, and we are not very good at worrying about them, or doing anything to mitigate their pesky presence. States such as Russia and China have emerged as major players in the field of post-Cold War economic espionage, quite apart from the private-sector bottom-feeders who are out there in droves.
Canadians and their government would see this reality, according to the authors, if it weren't for cowardly bureaucrats, bungling intelligence types, head-in-sand politicians and the distractions of an unfortunate obsession with terrorism, just because it kills people. In the dream world of the authors, "espionage would be by far our top national security issue."
I wouldn't mind living in such a relatively peaceful dream world, but it doesn't describe reality. I have no doubt that economic and other forms of espionage weigh on the minds of national security officials in Ottawa; so do many other kinds of new and old threats. It's a matter of perspective and of weighing the priorities.
Moreover, economic espionage is one of those tricky matters that requires not just professional responses from government security agencies, but close co-operation between government watchers and the private sector where much of the spying takes place.
There may be a need for a jeremiad on the topic, but it's a subject that calls for some sophisticated analysis and for some hard-headed policy recommendations. One of the authors' favourites - "put 'em behind bars" - doesn't take us very far, not least because some of the spying that goes on is conducted by foreign officials who enjoy the legal protections of diplomatic status; also because much of the spying, in the economic area, at least, does not involve the theft of "classified" information. It might involve stealing proprietary information, but that is another matter altogether.
In other words, economic espionage operates in a grey zone and is not susceptible to black-and-white treatment. It requires watching, behind-the-scenes diplomatic protests as warranted, and close work between government and targeted firms and communities in Canada. Espionage is not going to go away any time soon, and it can't be stopped, but knowing as much as possible about what is happening under your bed and keeping the monster in its box are good ideas.
There is really no excuse for getting key facts about Canadian intelligence history wrong
When the authors turn from tub-thumping to historical narration to illuminate the espionage threat to Canada, the trouble really begins. The authors acknowledge their limitations in a charming manner, saying that they are neither scientists nor academics. Both true. It does not absolve them from a slipshod way with the facts or give them any licence to concoct conspiracy theories.
There is really no excuse for getting key facts about Canadian intelligence history wrong, especially when you are buttressing your Cassandra-esque warnings with Canadian history.
Igor Gouzenko, the Soviet cipher clerk who defected in Ottawa in 1945 to startle the world with tales of a massive Soviet spy network in the West, did not work for the KGB and did not take documents out of the Soviet embassy in a briefcase (he was not that dumb).
Canadian airliners were not ordered to turn and fly directly north (into an oncoming blizzard of feared Soviet bombers?) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A government-sponsored think tank, the Canadian Centre for Arms Control and Disarmament, named by a recent Russian intelligence defector as a happy hunting ground for secrets to send home to Moscow, did not change its name; it ceased to exist. No Soviet listening base in Montreal existed to capture U.S. presidential telephone calls (hello?). The Canadian Anti-terrorism Act, which the authors decry as a weak law, was not passed in 2003, but in 2001. And so on.
Some pretty noxious theories are trotted out in this book. The authors can't seem to help themselves. They play with the idea that the Indian government orchestrated the Air India bombing in 1985 and promise that they won't go further "down the road of a conspiracy theory." In the very next paragraph, they do exactly that, with shadowy Indian government plotters out to incriminate the Sikhs and destabilize Canada. As with most conspiracy theories, there is absolutely no evidence for this, and worse still, it makes no sense. But that has never stopped a good conspiracy theory.
In other places, the authors descend to smear tactics, arguing that the famous Soviet goalie from the 1972 summit series, Vladislav Tretiak, was, when he took off the pads, shazam, a Soviet spy. They are nice enough to call this a "hypothesis." They bang on about this for several pages and then take a dip into the playbook of Senator Joseph McCarthy by revealing that they sent a series of questions to the ex-Soviet goalie and now Soviet parliamentarian (hint: He's a member of Putin's United Russia party) offering him a chance to clear his name of the accusation that he worked for the KGB. Tretiak refused to answer these silly questions. Must prove he was KGB through and through.
Juneau-Katsuya takes up other pages in this book to fight a rearguard action in defence of one of the more notorious episodes in intelligence assessment to hit CSIS and the RCMP. While a serving CSIS officer, he was involved in the Sidewinder affair, named after a series of botched intelligence studies written jointly by the RCMP and CSIS that claimed to have found a massive Chinese conspiracy at work in Canada. The project fell apart amid wrangling between the two agencies and was eventually excoriated by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, who found that CSIS did the right thing in deep-sixing the studies. Juneau-Katsuya would prefer to believe that it was all a cover-up.
So much dross buries the valuable bits of this book. There are some, including the narrative of the intelligence effort to recover documents after the Soviet consulate in Montreal burned to the ground in January 1987. The authors are also right to call attention to some of the more egregious examples of Chinese intelligence operations in Canada, many targeted at groups who are feared by Beijing to represent a threat - the Falun Gong, the free Tibet movement and so on.
One last test the authors fail. If you want to judge the merits of a non-fiction book, weigh the conclusions for sense. But who can puzzle out the meaning of the book's concluding paragraph, with its reference to parades and twirling batons and "stepping high." This is supposed to be a metaphor for Canada's place in the world? Pass me a conspiracy theory.

Full text: Sunday's Grey Cup showdown features a pair of teams that are very familiar with the Canadian Football League's marquee event.
Montreal is making its fifth appearance in the last seven championship games. The Alouettes, however, have only one title to show for those appearances - a 2002 triumph over Edmonton.
British Columbia will play in its third Grey Cup in the last seven. The Lions' last title came in 2000 with a victory over Montreal.
Heading into the game, history appears to be on British Columbia's side.
B.C. has won eight of nine games against Montreal since 2002. The Western champion Lions pounded the Als, who beat Toronto in the East final, both times they met this season - 48-13 in Montreal on Sept. 1 and 36-20 in Vancouver on Sept. 16.
Will the trend continue on Sunday?
Grey Cup week always brings an opportunity to reflect on the state of the game. This year is no different. Among the lingering issues is the fact that the contract of commissioner Tom Wright expires at the end of year. A successor has not been named.
On Tuesday, the Globe's Grey Cup team of Stephen Brunt, Allan Maki and David Naylor took an in-depth look at a number of issues surrounding the league .
Stephen Brunt was online today and discussed both Sunday's match-up and the state of the league.
Join the Conversation at that time or submit a question or comment in advance. Your questions and Mr. Brunt's answers will appear at the bottom of this page when the discussion begins.
Sasha Nagy, globeandmail.com writes: Hi Stephen: Thanks for taking some time during a busy Grey Cup week to answer questions from Globe readers. There's nothing like Grey Cup weekend to draw prodigal fans of the CFL back into the fold. How important do you feel the Grey Cup is to Canada's national identity? Does the game transcend sport?
Stephen Brunt: Hi Sasha. It's a bit of a cliche, but I do think the Grey Cup ties in to national identity. Not for everyone in Canada, and not everywhere - this is a great, big diverse country we live in. Even an Olympic hockey gold medal doesn't speak to somebody out there. But the great thing about the Grey Cup is that it is absolutely, organically, uniquely ours. The game was invented here. The league is completely based here. And in a lot of ways, the spirit of the event is far more grassroots than, say, the Stanley Cup Finals. The closest thing, really, is the Brier. You don't have to be a hard core football fan to enjoy the ritual of watching the game on Grey Cup Sunday. And I would point you to Dave Naylor's story today in the sports section, and on Globesports.com, about how Canadian football has become a point of entry into North American sports for immigrant communities. The Canadian quotient of the two teams playing on Sunday is in a lot of ways more representative of this country in all its hues than are the Canadians playing on NHL teams.
Andrew D from Canada writes: Good day, Mr. Brunt. Three quick questions: 1) Do you feel the negativity regarding the dip in attendance and television viewership is overdone? Sure, it's down slightly from last year, but having seen the attendance and television numbers from even 7 years ago it seems the league has made major strides in getting back into the public consciouness. 2) Can you remember the last time a blowout was expected in the Grey Cup? I personally can't recall the last time one team was thought to be so superior to the other. 3) Where do you think Adriano Belli will end up next year? As an Argonaut fan, I think he'd be invaluable in shoring up the run defence.
Stephen Brunt: Hi Andrew. 1) Actually, the television numbers are pretty strong this year, and in general, attendance across the league if fine. That crowd of 50,000 last week for the Western Final in Vancouver was particularly impressive. The challenge for the league has always been how to translate whatever its numbers are into enough revenue to pay the bills, and make a bit of a profit. They're not quite there yet. 2) Two years ago, a lot of people including me thought that the Lions were going to blow out the Toronto Argonauts, who had upset Montreal in the Eastern Final. We were all wrong, and maybe we're wrong to assume an easy B.C. win on Sunday. 3) Not sure about where Belli will wind up. He's a terrific player, but his lack of discipline on the field really hurt the team when he played for Hamilton this season. It will be a real challenge for any coach, trying to keep all of that emotion focused in the right place.
Steve K from Canada writes: Hi Stephen: I admire your writings and comments. Maybe I'm getting old, but ... is there any chance that the CFL season could be moved a month earlier? Like alot of people, I love summer games but find the minus 10-20 Celcius November games to be a bit of a drag sometimes. Why do even CFL 'hotspots' (no pun intended) like Edmonton, Winnipeg, Regina appear to have hundreds/thousands of no-shows on Grey Cup day? Winnipeg seems to be having trouble selling all the Cup tickets this year. I think it's because a lot of people would, truthfully, prefer to sit in a warm home take in the game on tv. Also, with a warmer Cup game the action would be a bit more accomplished vs. muffed passes/punts/fumbles etc. (e.g. Doug Flutie's criticism during his CFL days) Ok, maybe I'm being a suck ... but I don't want every Cup game to be in an indoor stadium.
Stephen Brunt: Hi Steve. Thanks for the kind words.
They did move the schedule back a week, to try and avoid playing Grey Cup games in howling prairie blizzards (though, irony of ironies, the last time the Grey Cup was really affected by winter weather, it was held in the league's most southerly outpost, Hamilton. That game, despite the snowstorm, was a barn-burner.). I think there a couple of business reasons why they won't move it any earlier. Start in the middle of June, and there would be conflicts with the end of the National Hockey League playoffs, both in terms of audience and media interest. Hold the playoffs any earlier in the fall, and they move a little too close to the World Series. Plus, I think that there's a feeling that a lot of people really don't tune in to the CFL until Labour Day. The way the schedule is now, the CFL gets plenty of attention for the stretch drive and the playoffs. And they're going to luck out on the weather again this year - Sunday is supposed to be clear and not too cold, though that's a lot easier to say if you know you're going to be watching from a warm press box.
John Ng from Ottawa writes: Hi Stephen. Enjoy your work. Any truth to the rumour that Alouettes owner Robert Wetenhall is spearheading another attempt at U.S. expansion, this time targeting a number of northern-border sites like Rochester, N.Y. and Portland, Or? And who will be the new, de facto gatekeeper of the league, now that Hugh Campbell has left his saddle? Thanks.
Stephen Brunt: Hi John. Bob Wettenhall does indeed believe that the CFL ought to look into U.S. expansion again, focusing on border cities, rather than heading farther south - the way they tried it the first time around. Suffice it to say that not many of the other owners and governors agree with him. But if the league is going to grow beyond eight teams, which is probably necessary to ensure its survival long-term, it might be tough to find places in Canada where there's the right ownership and the right stadium in place. Tom Wright suggested today in his farewell press conference that he thinks they'll be in Halifax after 2010, and that they still would like to get back into Ottawa. Both of those are problematic for different reasons, and if the league found itself in the same kind of financial peril it was in ten years ago, I wouldn't be shocked if more owners might be willing to consider moving into the U.S. As for the next Hugh Campbell, I don't know who could fill that role now. He was a unique combination of things - a football guy who could wield power as though he owned the community franchise in Edmonton. The dominant figures in the league now are the ones with the deepest pockets - David Braley, Wettenhall, Bob Young, and the Toronto owners Howard Sokolowski and David Cynamon - but none of them played the game.
al wonders from Canada writes: Watching the Grey Cup game is a tradition that I fear is fading badly in Canada. My son works in a major sports bar and last Sunday he tells me that the CFL finals were only on the smallest TV located in a corner with the sound turned off. Also I don't know anyone who is going to a Grey Cup event. I hope it is not like that in the rest of Canada because for me when I was younger it was always a great event. I think it is dying because it is not really a Canadian event. Wouldn't it be better if only Canadian citizens were allowed to play and more cities were capable of putting a team together. Do you think the CFL might attract more fans if the Maritime provinces could be represented and perhaps Northwestern Ontario? I think more and more Canadians see the CFL as place for Americans who can't make it in the NFL and as such it will never generate as much excitement as it should.
Stephen Brunt: Thanks for the question Al. There have been Americans playing in the CFL for more than a half century now. We just mourned the passing of one of the greatest of them - Jackie Parker. If you ask any CFL fan of a certain vintage to name their favourite players, you can bet that many if not most of them would be Americans who we embraced as our own heroes. So I don't think the nationality of the athletes is really an issue. But I know what you're saying about the Grey Cup not being the universal attraction that it seemed to be years ago. I think that's more a reflection of our fragmenting world than anything else. There are so many more entertainment and sports options. You can watch any game from anywhere in any league at any time. I think that works against building home town/home country allegiances. I'd argue that isn't what it once was, either. It still draws a big number, but the days of families huddling around the tv on Saturday night are over. It will be interesting to see what my kids - raised in Hamilton, but with a completely different set of experiences than my own - decide they care about as they move on in adulthood. I know they don't feel nearly as strongly about the Ticats, the Blue Jays, and (no, not the Leafs) the Detroit Red Wings - or any team, for that matter - as I did growing up.
Steve K from Canada writes: Hi Stephen. What is your opinion on the current overtime rules for CFL games? Personally, I think having what amounts to a 'football shootout' is silly ... I wish the CFL would revert back to the old rules ... I might be the only one but I thought the ending to last year's Grey Cup game would've seemed more legitimate if the teams had continued playing using regulation-time rules.
Stephen Brunt: It's a tricky question, that the CFL, the NFL, and U.S. college football have all struggled with. I don't think there's a perfect solution. The shootout format was supposed to be better than the first-team-to-score wins format. it made sure that both teams touched the ball in overtime, and increased the chances of the game being won on a touchdown rather than on a long field goal. It can feel a bit gimmicky, though, like shootouts deciding the World Cup. That said, I thought that the entertainment value from last year's Grey Cup finish outweighed any uneasiness I might have about the format.
John Rowell from Nelson, B.C. writes: Hi Stephen: I don't know much about Montreal's quarterback and his back up. How do they rate compared to the Lions' Dickerson and Pierce?
Stephen Brunt: Anthony Calvillo, at his best, is an elite CFL quarterback, and has been for most of the last decade. But this year, he hasn't looked like himself. He's had trouble with his passing accuracy at times, and looked like a guy who might be getting old in a hurry. That said, he played very well against the Argos in the Eastern Final last week. Dickenson, when he was healthy, was the class of the league this year, and Pierce is very capable if he has to step in. If the Als are forced to use either of their back up quarterbacks - Nealon Greene and Marcus Brady - they'll be in big trouble.
Sasha Nagy writes: Stephen: What do you think of Ricky Williams' foray into the CFL? What was gained by the experience for the league and the Argos?
Stephen Brunt: Well, what was it Pinball Clemons said? That it was a win for the franchise, but "an unorthodox win?" Ricky was certainly a fascinating personality, but in the end, I don't think he sold any tickets (and I was one of the people who was sure that he would). On the field, we'll never know what he really could have done, because after he came back from his injuries, the Argos refused to consistently put the ball in his hands. A lot of the hardcore CFL loyalists are using Williams' relative lack of success as proof of the league's quality. Well, maybe - but just once, I would have liked to seen him touch the ball 20 or 25 times in a game.
Sasha Nagy writes: In reading some of the early posts on your Grey Cup blog I was impressed by the experience the Globe team of reporters (yourself, Allan Maki and David Naylor) brings to covering the CFL's signature game. As a CFL fan and kid growing up in Ottawa, no memory is greater to me than Clements to Gabriel for the 1976 Grey Cup win at Exhibition Stadium over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Do you have a favourite finish from one of the Grey Cup games you've covered?
Stephen Brunt: Even though my guys lost (though we're always impartial in the press box), it would have to be the finish of the classic 1989 game between Saskatchewan and Hamilton. It wasn't just Dave Ridgway's last play field goal to win it, but everything that led up to that point, including Tony Champion's catch, one of the very best I've ever seen. And who could really begrudge a win for the greatest fans in the league? They sure deserved it after what Gabriel did to them in 76 - not to mention what Ian Sunter did to them in 72.
Sasha Nagy: Stephen, thanks for taking the time to answer questions. You've got a busy day ahead of you. I know that Grey Cup week is nothing by work, work, work for the journalists covering the big game. I'll let you save your official prediction for the pages of Globe. But for now, can you tell us who will be the key player for each team on Sunday? And, if you have any other closing thoughts, we'd love to hear them.
Stephen Brunt: Thanks Sasha. It's been fun. Though we always focus on the quarterbacks, I think both running backs in this game - Robert Edwards for Montreal and Joe Smith for B.C. - are going to be key players. To have any chance, the Als need Edwards to do what he did against the Argos last week, not only chewing up yards and clock, but allowing Calvillo to use a lot of play action in the passing game. And B.C. will need to establish a running game to keep the Montreal defence honest - otherwise, they'll be blitzing Dave Dickenson on nearly every play.
Hope everyone enjoys the game.

Full text: While daylight saving time offered the luxury of additional sleep for the Monday-to-Friday crowd yesterday, the extra hour on the clock meant another hour in the office for some of Canadian university football's top coaches.
In a cross-country checkup of who was hard at work yesterday morning, six days before the Canadian Interuniversity Sport playoffs, it was the Manitoba Bisons' Brian Dobie, Laurier Golden Hawks' Gary Jeffries and Steve Sumarah of the Saint Mary's Huskies caught on the job, answering the phone.
With eight semi-final games scheduled for Saturday, all three said, despite being among the favourites heading in, they weren't taking anything for granted.
With that in mind, here's a look of what to expect from the first leg of the road to the 2006 Vanier Cup:
Canada West
Regina Rams (4-4) at (No. 2) Manitoba Bisons (8-0)
Previous meeting: Oct. 21 - Bisons 49, Rams 44
After finishing the regular season as the lone undefeated team in the CIS, Manitoba celebrated on the sidelines with an ice-bucket shower for long-time bench boss Dobie. The coach, understandably, appreciated the gesture, but wasn't about to get caught up in the hoopla. He has, after all, been down this road before. In 2002, the Bisons were 8-0 and the top-ranked team in the country the final five weeks of the season. A lopsided loss to Saskatchewan in the first round of the playoffs, however, and Manitoba's hard work went down the drain. And while his team is confident that won't happen this time around, Dobie sees the Rams as challenge. "We're playing the team that we think is the most dangerous team in Canada West," he said. "They're so explosive. Their M.O. is they pretty much abandon the run ... They just throw the ball all over the field like no one else, regardless of down and distance, regardless of whether they're up 17 or down 21. They're a big-play team, and they're a very threatening team every time they have possession. It will be a high-scoring game, guaranteed."
UBC Thunderbirds (4-4) at (No. 5) Saskatchewan Huskies (6-2)
Previous meeting: Sept. 23 - Huskies 35, T-Birds 33
A high-powered Thunderbirds offence, led by running back Chris Ciezki, matches up against a tough-as-nails Huskies defence in Saskatoon. Saskatchewan is the defending conference champ and brings a lot of experience on both sides of the ball.
Ontario (OUA)
Western Ontario Mustangs (6-3) at (No. 7) Laurier Golden Hawks (6-2)
Previous meeting: Sept. 23 - Golden Hawks 34, Mustangs 18
His team may have won the Vanier Cup the last time around, but Jeffries says the dreaded championship hangover hasn't affected the Golden Hawks' attention to detail this season. "We were out there this morning, we had a practice in a blizzard," he said yesterday from Waterloo, Ont. "But given the alternative, we're glad to be out there." On Saturday, Laurier will host Western, a team coming off of a 20-16 upset win over the eighth-ranked Windsor Lancers. "It's always exciting playing Western," Jeffries said. "It's one of the great rivalries in Ontario, and I think we've played some of the most exciting football games that have been seen in this league. There's no reason to think this will be any different."
Queen's Golden Gaels (5-4) at (No. 3) Ottawa Gee-Gees (7-1)
Previous meeting: Oct. 7 - Gee-Gees 34, Golden Gaels 13
After shocking the Mustangs in the final game of the regular season to slink into the final playoff spot, Queen's pulled out another upset on Saturday, with a 25-19 win that eliminated the McMaster Marauders. The Little Team That Could will have their work cut out for them this Saturday, however, as Ottawa boasted the top offence and defence in Ontario this season.
Quebec
McGill Redmen (3-4) at (No. 1) Laval Rouge et Or (7-1)
Previous meeting: Sept. 16 - Rouge et Or 43, Redmen 27
The top-ranked team in the country for the entire season, Laval is coming off its first loss of the year, a 7-2 defeat at the hands of the Montreal Carabins on Saturday. Expect a quarterback's duel between Laval's Benoit Groulx and McGill's Matt Connell, two of the top pivots in the country.
(No. 6) Montreal Carabins (6-2) at (No. 4) Concordia Stingers (6-2)
Previous meeting: Sept. 16 - Stingers 25, Carabins 11
The two top rushing teams in Quebec go head-to-head as these intercity rivals meet in the semi-finals for the second season in a row. Montreal came out on top 28-17 last time around, but the Stingers have home-field advantage and won handily against the Carabins during the regular season.ƒo
Atlantic (AUS)ƒo
St. Francis Xavier X-Men (2-5) at Saint Mary's Huskies (3-4)ƒo
Previous meetings: Sept. 9 - X-Men 21, Huskies 19; Oct. 27 - Huskies 32, X-Men 0ƒo
After a promising 2-0 start to the season, the X-Men have lost five in a row, including a lopsided loss on Friday to the team they'll face this weekend in Halifax. Given St. FX's Jekyll-and-Hyde campaign, coach Sumarah says he's not quite sure what to expect from the X-Men. "We're approaching [the game]very cautiously," he said. "This is kind of one of those sleeping dogs. I mean, they've gone five games and have only gotten one touchdown. But those are the teams that scare me more. Those [struggling]teams, you just have to hope you get up early on them. Because you don't want them to hang around - that's when you get in trouble."ƒo
Mount Allison Mounties (2-5) at Acadia Axemen (5-3)ƒo
Previous meetings: Sept. 9 - Axemen 34, Mounties 9; Oct. 28 - Axemen 34, Mounties 15ƒo
The Mounties' real victory this season came when they ended a 34-game losing streak earlier this month, giving the program its first win since 2002. Given that Mount Allison has drawn the defending conference champions in the semi-finals, that will likely be as big a leap as the rebuilding program makes this season.

IAN HUME, ATHLETE: 1914-2006

Full text: He was a Canadian track and field legend among master athletes who set countless world records when not needed by the Montreal police as a ringer
? Heading out for an early evening jog or trying to squeeze in a few holes of golf before the sun sets may not sound extraordinary. But when Ian Hume went for a run, he brought along a lightweight golf bag and a handful of golf clubs. Out on the links during the dying light of day, the course void of players, he would tee up, drive the ball, then race down the fairway toward his next shot. A gifted athlete, Mr. Hume celebrated his 66th birthday by playing 88 holes (he jogged through the final nine in an impressive 40 minutes and 41 strokes).
Mr. Hume's sporting career began in 1929 when, as a 15-year-old, he savoured his first taste of competition. For the next 70 years, he set countless track and field world records before retiring from competitive sport in 1999 at the ripe young age of 85.
He was a hero to writer and editor Todd Swift. "When I would say I was his grandson, people would nod, as if I had said Atticus Finch was. To meet him was to never forget him. He inspired you to be your best, in any walk of life."
Raised on a family farm in a village near Knowlton, Que., Mr. Hume's eccentricity manifested early. As a boy, he walked miles to school with a pet crow for an escort. Found injured, the bird had been nursed back to health by Ian's mother. It befriended young Ian and followed him through the treetops wherever he went. During school hours, the crow remained perched on a window sill until class was dismissed and then accompanied the boy back to the farm.
Much of Mr. Hume's development as an athlete can be traced back to farm life and its strenuous routines. When he wasn't throwing bales of hay around, he and his brother, Donald, would take turns leaping over them. His daughter, Margaret Swift, said her father believed that cultivating the land was the quintessential exercise. "He always thought that any good, hard work you did was the best for physical development."
With all that work, the brothers should have had little time for athletics. To compensate, they became exceedingly efficient and made time by racing through their responsibilities in order to play baseball before nightfall. The fact that they lacked equipment or a diamond to play on didn't deter them. Instead, they lathed their own bats from hickory and ash and transformed a patch of mowed hay into a field of dreams. By all accounts, his chores cannot have harmed his swing. A clutch player, he caught the eye of baseball scouts who signed him up to play with a Montreal Royals farm team.
An equally gifted scholar, he was only 15 when he enrolled at Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Que. At 5 foot 5, he was told he was too small to play on the school's basketball team. He returned a year later and was eagerly accepted as a star player. He had grown 12 inches.
After graduating, Mr. Hume began a career as a high- school Latin and mathematics teacher. Teaching in Fitch Bay in Quebec's Eastern Townships, he became infatuated with Melita Fraser, a fellow lecturer who taught 30 kilometres away in Beebee. Mr. Hume's courtship began during winter and, on one occasion, he skied through a blizzard of sleet and hail to be with her. His devotion and persistence so moved her that, in 1942, she agreed to marry him.
For all that, he never gave up his interest in athletics. He reputation in track and field was such that he became a ringer for the Montreal Police Department. Every summer, he would be hired as an instructor to help ready recruits for the Policemen's Athletic Association championship. To make Mr. Hume eligible for a competition that featured officers from all over the continent, he was made a member of the vice squad. His duties included the occasional ride in a squad car. From 1938 to 1950, he did the department proud, winning the overall individual championship 13 times.
A superb high jumper and javelin thrower, Mr. Hume was selected to Team Canada, at 40, to compete at the Commonwealth Games in 1954. Interestingly, the older he became, the more gold was heaped on him. In 1975, he returned to competition at the inaugural Association of Veteran Athletes world championship track and field meet in Toronto and, over the next 25 years, he set more than 40 world masters age records in nine events and won bundles of gold medals.
Along the way, Mr. Hume was made head official for track and field events at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Earlier, in 1966, he had attended the Commonwealth Games in Jamaica as a Team Canada coach.
In 1981, Mr. Hume was named a member of the Order of Canada and, in 2002, was awarded the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal for outstanding contribution to his community. He was inducted into the Canadian Amateur Hall of Fame in both the athlete and builder categories. But it was in 1982 that he achieved the apex of his fame when Today Magazine listed him as the 16th of the 115 best things about Canada.
Ian Knowlton Hume was born
on July 20, 1914, in Foster, Que.
He died in Saint-Lambert, Que.
on March 27, 2006. He was 91.
He is survived by his wife,
Melita, and by his children
Edward, Margaret, Heather,
Laurel and Vicki.

Winter returns with a fury

Full text: Winter returned to Canada with a vengeance yesterday, causing deadly traffic pileups near Ottawa and Montreal and lashing the Prairies with bitter cold.
Four people were killed on the main highway between Ottawa and Montreal near Embrun, Ont., with close to 40 vehicles involved in a series of collisions.
Another major crash left at least six people injured and closed the busy junction of Highways 417 and 17 at Arnprior, northwest of Ottawa, for several hours.
In Quebec, one man died and 40 other people were injured in a massive pileup on the Trans-Canada Highway near L'Assomption, 40 kilometres northeast of Montreal.
High winds, combined with frozen road surfaces, were blamed for the pileups. Winds clocked at 112 kilometres an hour also derailed five cars of a freight train on a bridge over the St. Lawrence River. No one was injured, but the wreckage stopped some Montreal commuter traffic.
"There seemed to be a lot of misery from coast to coast. . . . There were weather warnings for everybody," David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment Canada, said. "It was [likely]the worst day of the winter."
No temperature records were set, but the sudden drop left a lot of people grumbling, he added. The 10-day forecast shows the weather remaining steadily and unusually cold today before moderating early in the week.
"It would be cold based on this year's standard but, based on the 30-year record, it will be about normal," Mr. Phillips said.
Canadians suffered as a nation as the relatively balmy conditions enjoyed in January gave way in much of the country to lower-than-normal temperatures.
Winnipeg recorded wind-chill temperatures in the low minus-40s. The coastal areas, both west and east, suffered from unusually high winds, putting all of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island under wind warnings. But the effects of yesterday's severe weather were most visible in the Ottawa and Montreal areas.
The deadliest incident happened at midday near the small town of Embrun, just east of Ottawa.
Police say a 40-year-old Ottawa man and his two-year-old daughter died after the minivan in which they were driving hit a transport truck. That crash set off a chain-reaction that involved 37 vehicles.
Also killed in the accident was a 60-year-old Ottawa man who died when his vehicle went under a semi-trailer and another man who died while en route to hospital. About 40 people were injured, 11 seriously.
Jason Baker told a CTV reporter that he was lucky to be alive. After his Isuzu Trooper hit the car in front of him, Mr. Baker said, he followed he first instinct, which was to flee. Firefighters said that may have saved his life.
"I look at it now and it's pretty badly damaged," Mr. Baker, 27, said of his vehicle. "It's actually under a transport truck, I believe. If I didn't move, that would be me and I would more than likely be dead."
Near L'Assomption, the scene of another deadly crash, witnesses said drivers were blinded by blizzards that triggered a 40-vehicle collision.
In some spots, rescuers reported seeing up to three cars heaped on top of each other. It took several hours, in glacial, windy conditions before all survivors could be extracted from the twisted remains of their vehicles.
Fierce winds in Montreal were blamed for tipping the freight train and ripping part of the roof off a grade school, sending tin sheets crashing onto parked cars nearby.
North of Montreal, up to 30 vehicles crashed, including empty tractor-trailer rigs too light to stay upright in the wind.
The wind, ice and snow were part of a storm that whipped across most of Southern Ontario and Quebec. The brunt of the weather hit Ottawa and surrounding areas yesterday, where fierce winds tore down power lines and snow and ice shut down highways and grounded flights at the Ottawa airport.

Artist created long-running, rural Quebec comic strip

Full text: Appearing in Le Bulletin des Agriculteurs for 60 years, the man behind Onésime was unknown outside the province
? At first glance, an illustration by Quebec artist, Albert Chartier, could easily be mistaken for a Norman Rockwell. The pastoral charm and simplicity are present in the works of both artists, but upon closer inspection a distinctly Canadian point of view appears in the illustrations by Mr. Chartier. His favourite themes were hockey, skiing and the customs of rural Quebec.
Unrecognized outside his home province, Mr. Chartier entertained six decades of readers with his comic strip . A skilled draftsman with a knack for storytelling, was the continuing adventure of a henpecked man with a sour-looking face who was dominated by his wife, Zénoide. With a supporting cast of family members, Onésime's foibles were documented in the monthly magazine Le Bulletin des Agriculteurs.
Although he insisted that he never intended to create a portrait of Quebec through his comic strip, in an interview with Montreal's Drawn and Quarterly magazine, he remarked that he tried to make Onésime typical of his place and time. He named the chinless pipe-smoker who looked down his nose through his pince-nez after one of his uncles. "And I borrowed many of his expressions from friends and relatives . . . I made a point of doing that. I really wanted to record specific expressions and a way of talking that you hardly hear any more."
Albert Chartier was born in the working-class Plateau Mont Royal neighbourhood on June 16, 1912. After a brief and suffocating stint at the L'École des Beaux Arts de Montréal, Mr. Chartier opted for a career as an illustrator. During the Prohibition movement in the United States, when Montreal's reputation as a city of excess attracted Americans to the city's bars and cabarets, Mr. Chartier earned a living selling drawings of popular jazz musicians to tourists.
His first published work was Bouboule, a comic strip he collaborated on with journalist René Boivin, which was featured in the daily La Patrie from 1937 to 1938. At the same time, he started a society magazine called Can-Can. Mr. Chartier would abandon the magazine after his collaborator, Martin Tessier, died during the Second World War.
In 1940, he married Suzanne Martel and they moved to New York City where he worked for the Columbia Comic Corp., and Big Top Comics. During the war, he returned to Canada and illustrated for the Federal Wartime Information Board creating panel gags for the troops.
His much-loved first appeared in 1943 in what was the subscription-only publication of Le Bulletin des Agriculteurs. The setting for strip was in St-Jean-de-Matha, around Lac Noir, where the Chartiers and their children eventually settled. The humour in the comic strip is burlesque and vaudevillian. Many of the jokes are played out against a backdrop where extreme weather, a hockey match or the Catholic Church influences the behaviour of the characters.
Mr. Chartier's talents as a draftsman are ever present in the wonderfully choreographed panels of . The style is reminiscent of comic strips like and . The quality of his pen and ink cross-hatching is superb. Dazzling renditions of the changing seasons: apple blossoms, flash floods, fall foliage and blinding blizzards were masterfully portrayed. Readers adored Mr. Chartier's comic strip. Year after year, polls showed it was the magazine's most popular feature.
Chris Oliveros, publisher of Drawn and Quarterly, described Mr. Chartier's association with the Bulletin as both a blessing and a curse. In its heyday, Mr. Oliveros estimates that the Bulletin had some two million readers, but it limited Mr. Chartier's exposure to the world outside of rural Quebec. In spite of a lack of recognition, Mr. Chartier's talent was in constant demand. Throughout the 50s and 60s the artist was frequently commissioned by La Presse and the Montreal Star to design the Rockwellesque covers that appeared on their weekend inserts. He also held a teaching position at the École des Arts et Metiers Commerciaux in Montreal from 1967 to 1977.
Although his regional celebrity never resulted in international kudos, his rural following did provide him with the opportunity to live the life of a country gentleman. He spent his days doing what he loved best: drawing and painting and cultivating his sense of humour. Ultimately, for Mr. Chartier, fame was less important than the work itself. During the Drawn and Quarterly interview he insisted that when a person is passionate about developing their talent it doesn't feel like work at all. "I mean, sure it's work, but it isn't hard labour. Despite the difficulties and the effort, it's still a pleasure. And in the end I believe in that pleasure."
He died on Feb. 21.

Full text: Staff get along without meeting in person
? SiteSell Inc. president Ken Evoy happily admits he doesn't have a clue what his employees do during the regular workday.
He's never seen most of his customer support staff in the flesh, and considers his Australia-based programmer a good friend, despite having never met him. Indeed, Dr. Evoy only knows the majority of his 36 employees as a voice on the phone, or a name on an e-mail.
"I don't know whether my employee is working at four in the morning, or whether he's asleep at four in the morning," the intense, ever-smiling Dr. Evoy said. "All I measure is one thing: output."
Since its inception in 1998, SiteSell has been a teleworking -- or telecommuting -- company in the truest form of the term. The company, which sells Internet business development software, has no head office. Dr. Evoy directs business behind three gigantic plasma screens at his home in Hudson, about 45 minutes outside of Montreal.
As such, he has none of the workaday hassles associated with your average nine-to-fiver. He doesn't wear a tie, he doesn't have to go outside in the minus-30-degree weather, and the only commuting he does is in his slippers -- usually from the office to the kitchen.
SiteSell employees, meanwhile, are scattered around the globe. There are software people in Australia, England and France. In Kentucky, an employee works for the company's telemarketing and e-mail sales -- a department headed up by a fellow in the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla.
His employees "would get chewed up in a big company," according to Dr. Evoy. "They're not game players, they're not politicians, they're not strokers. They're the kind of people who get taken advantage of in a big company. They're self-motivated, they work hard, they put out good quality work, [but]they don't self-promote very well. This doesn't count when it comes to teleworking. All that counts is quality and quantity of the work you put out. It speaks for itself, there can be no game playing."
As a purely telework-based company, SiteSell is somewhat of an anomaly in Canada, according to InnoVisions Canada, a telework consulting organization.
"Most people have not clued in yet," said InnoVisions president Bob Fortier, noting that the lion's share of Canada's 1.8 million teleworkers work for larger, office-based companies.
Several companies are experimenting with telework, including Compaq Canada, Bank of Montreal, Nortel Networks Corp., Ontario Hydro and Imperial Oil Ltd., among others. Still, though, teleworking is in its infancy in this country.
One of the main barriers to implementing telework, according to Mr. Fortier, is the misconception that working from home is synonymous with slacking off. Another problem is what Dr. Fortier calls "Jurassic" managerial models -- old world managers "who like the idea of having their employees around them."
For someone like Dr. Evoy, though, the classic office setting is itself dysfunctional and rife with the kind of people who want to do as little as possible for their paycheck. "I've worked in a big company, and hated it," Dr. Evoy said. "I can't stand going into an office; I can't stand the games, the politicking."
When SureFire Commerce, a once high-flying dot-com, bought SiteSell in 2000, Dr. Evoy says he found it difficult having to deal with the gridlock of upper management that suddenly had a say over his company. Though he was (and remains) friendly with SureFire executives, he found the experience difficult.
"I used to think Dilbert was funny as a hypothetical construct," he said, referring to the popular comic strip that skewers the world of cubicles and water coolers. "After working in a company, you understand Dilbert on a very profound level."
Dr. Evoy bought SiteSell back a year and a half ago, and it is on its way to making "mid-seven figures" in revenue this year. The company sells Site Build it!, a product allowing small businesses and work-from-home types to get (and get noticed) on-line. SiteSell is ranked as one of the top 30 best business sites on the Web, according to Internet tracker Alexa.com.
Before the Internet game, Dr. Evoy worked as a general practitioner at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital. He eventually left, confounded by Quebec's medical system, but still does the occasional shift there. Medicine "became a hobby" while he pursued his lifelong dream of inventing toys. Pooch Patrol, a stuffed dog with interchangeable expressions, was a big hit for Tonka. He then got into penny mining stocks in 1997, before discovering the Internet.
He is a self-professed workaholic who goes on week-long binges in front of his computer. Once, after a lengthy vacation in Anguilla, he didn't leave the house for over a week. When he did, he drove on the left side of the road, an Anguilla-born habit that nearly caused a head-on collision near his house. "I hadn't been outside in a week, and it didn't even occur to me."
His workers, too, tend to be comfortable behind their computer screens. Dr. Evoy once sent a message to his Montreal employees, floating the idea of a Friday night meet-and-greet. "People e-mailed backed and asked 'Why?' " Dr. Evoy chuckles. Another party was akin to a first date, complete with awkward silences and flustered exits.
He has words of advice for people thinking of taking their show out of the office. "If you're a very social person, and you need that social interaction, then you need to be making a deal with your boss to come into the office some days, or you'll go crazy."
Not having an office, meanwhile, saves nearly $800,000 a year, he estimates. Employees supply their own computers and Internet connections. The regular staff meetings are done by way of conference calls and through a blizzard of e-mails. His wife -- "V.P. of Everything Ken Doesn't Do," Dr. Evoy says -- works at a desk a few metres away from his (though they don't face each other). The only time the computers are shut off is when the family goes on vacation.
Dr. Evoy admits teleworking isn't for everyone. "About 70 per cent of workers" aren't cut out for it, he says, noting the perfect teleworker is self-motivated and deadline-friendly. Like any job, balancing work and home is key. "Either you get the type who can't separate work from home, or you get the guy who can separate it too well and doesn't get anything done."

Costs drive site selection

Full text: Economist helps clients account for variables involved in choosing locations
Selecting sites for offices, factories and shopping centres ought to be a dollars-and-cents proposition echoing the axiom that it's all a matter of "location, location, location."
In fact, site selection is a matter of hard-cost accounting as well as accounting for tastes.
Reducing the riddles of siting has been the business of Princeton, N.J.-based John Boyd for 28 years. A 53-year-old, French-speaking economist, he took a job with management consultancy Dun & Bradstreet in New York, where he worked on site evaluation, and then, in 1975, set out on his own.
His first assignments as an independent site consultant led him to guide Canadian companies moving head offices out of Montreal in the wake of the passage of Bill 101, which compelled companies to use French in their daily business, to Toronto and New York.
Today, much of his work is helping U.S. and European companies set up Canadian offices and plants and assisting Canadian companies in establishing branch operations.
In assisting Toronto-Dominion Bank to optimize the call centres it acquired through its 2001 merger with Canada Trust, he prepared what Suzanne Deuel, TD's senior vice-president of human resources, calls "an exhaustive report on what the merger would mean and what management would have to do to make it work."
Mr. Boyd strives to be politically neutral, which is not necessarily easy when dealing with U.S. companies and laws that have heightened sensitivity to security issues.
In his view, the numerous variables in site selection, including labour costs, electric power costs and access to airports, train lines and highways, should be the core issues in site selection. "Problems of border management will be solved in time," he says.
"The North American free trade agreement makes the U.S. and Canada a single entity for site selection purposes," Mr. Boyd says. "Our clients are increasingly making location choices that regard the continent as seamless."
Seeking to reduce the vast number of variables that affect site choices to those that can be quantified, Mr. Boyd channels matters of personal or local preference -- such as Canada's forbidding winters in comparison to Florida's forbidding hurricanes -- to a question of taste. "Some clients like vanilla and some like chocolate," he says. "Canada has colder winters but the country is equipped to handle that weather."
The analysis of variables in site selection, which economists had sought to reduce to a mathematical mapping problem in the 19th century, has become a predictive science in which the best planners have to stay ahead of issues that involve security and its effect on security matters, Mr. Boyd notes.
For example, it has become desirable to put plants and offices in places that have direct and quick access to small airports that tend not to be locked down when security issues arise. Too many security-driven shutdowns have hit Newark, LaGuardia and San Francisco International airports, he says.
"You don't want executives with six-figure salaries standing in line for security for two to three hours," he explains. "Air travel through hubs used to be inefficient, now it has become really troublesome. Gateway airports have more security problems than smaller, less risky airports that offer direct flights to other places."
Unlike Via Rail service in the corridor from Windsor to Quebec City, U.S. Amtrak service is unreliable and getting worse, he says.
Canada is growing in popularity among European companies that are establishing North American beach heads. The higher level of education of the Canadian labour force as compared to the U.S. labour force draws some companies, Mr. Boyd says. Just as importantly, Canada's national health care system financed by taxes means that employers do not have to support immensely costly company health plans. Health care costs are a major drag on corporate earnings in the United States.
As well, Canada is seen as politically stable with moderate costs of living in most areas, competitive corporate taxes, competitive wages, and relatively low energy costs that offset relatively high heating requirements in the long winter months, he says.
Canada has more favourable tax treatment for research and development costs than the United States, Mr. Boyd says. Internationally recognized mathematics centres like the University of Waterloo and developing biotech research centres in Montreal and Saskatoon are making Canada more attractive to businesses that need access to those assets. Add an affinity that some European companies have for Canada and its linguistic diversity and cultural accommodations, and the country appears to offer valuable bonuses for locating north of the U.S. border, he adds.
Finally, there is the issue of political security. In contrast to the heightened concerns about security in the United States, Canada offers a relatively relaxed atmosphere, Mr. Boyd says. "There is a greater reluctance to invest in developing countries where political unease is a concern. Canada appears to be stable and that's a big plus in its favour. Our clients tend to see Canada as a safe haven and as a cost-efficient place to do business. With those qualities, a few blizzards melt in significance."

The first severe snowstorm to hit Central Canada will delay air travel Tuesday while motorists faced a morning drive on snow-covered roads.
The storm, which hit Winsdor Monday morning and travelled eastward toward Montreal, left snow, freezing rain and ice pellets after exiting the U.S. Midwest. The accumulated snowfall in some areas was expected to reach between 30 and 50 centimetres by Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the storm was expected to push into eastern Quebec and New Brunswick.
Air Canada officials advised Monday night that as a result of continued heavy snow in the Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal regions it planned to cancel or delay more than half its Tuesday morning flights. Travellers can call Air Canada and Canadian Airlines officials for flight information at 1-888-247-2262 before heading to the airport.
Heavy snow warnings were issued by Environment Canada for the area north of Toronto. Snowfall was expected to continue into the night in most areas before tapering off into flurries by Tuesday morning.
The airline expected to resume normal schedules by late Tuesday afternoon and plans to substitute larger aircraft to accommodate stranded passengers. Travellers who reschedule flights will not have to pay change fees.
Pearson International Airport official Peter Greg said that 70 per cent of Monday departures and arrivals were cancelled.
Earlier in the day, an airport spokesman said the airport was as ready as it could be for the storm, and that new equipment in place allows crews to clear snow from runways in a third of the time it used to take.
But passengers weren't made to sleep at the airport overnight.
Laura Cooke, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, said "we secured several hundred hotel rooms in the Toronto area to put up those whose connecting flights were cancelled."
The agency warned people not to travel Monday night as near-blizzard conditions would produce hazardous driving conditions. Temperatures were poised to dip Tuesday.
In other cities such as Windsor, snow started falling at noon Monday but by 5 p.m. had turned to freezing rain, said Cliff Woolcock, maintenance manager for the city. The area had already received about eight centimetres of snow.
Hamilton was hit with snow and freezing rain but a police spokesman said while the city had "a rash of minor accidents", there were no serious incidents.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Midwest got the brunt of the storm.
Chicago's O'Hare Airport cancelled about 75 per cent of its departing flights and housed thousands of stranded travellers. Earlier Monday, a plane skidded off the runway because of the weather. The storm was felt as far south as Texas, with snow possible in El Paso, along the Mexican border.
The storm began as a jet stream hit a cold front sitting over Colorado Monday. The jet stream created a low-pressure area, where Colorado's cold air clashed with warmer air sucked in from Texas and Oklahoma. Fuelled by powerful winds, the whole weather system headed northeast toward the Great Lakes and grew in intensity.
City crews poised to tackle weather
By ALLISON DUNFIELD Globe and Mail Update
Heavy snowfall caused aggravation during rush hour in southern Ontario Monday evening, but no serious problems.
Ontario Provincial Police said that no highways were reported closed as of 5 p.m. EST and there were no major accidents on Monday.
In Windsor, Ont. snow started falling by noon on Monday but by 5 p.m. it had turned to freezing rain, said Cliff Woolcock, maintenance manager.
He said the Southwestern Ontario city had been hit with eight centimetres of snow by 4:30 p.m. and 20 salter plows had been operating on major city routes since 10:30 a.m.
"We hope to get through this by tomorrow morning," Mr. Woolcock said, adding the city's first major storm of the year was supposed to end early Tuesday morning.
In Peterborough, north of Toronto, snow was falling "very lightly" by about 4 p.m. EST, said Greg Hogg, road supervisor for the city. "We don't have anything major as of yet."
However, Peterborough was expected to have up to 25 centimetres. Mr. Hogg said the city's 13 plow trucks, two graters and five front-end loaders are prepared. He said ploughing would likely begin after midnight. "Everyone should be able to get to work tomorrow."
In Kitchener by about 4:30 p.m., only about five centimetres of snow had fallen, Mike Tout, manager of operations, said, adding "it's snowing pretty good right now."
Mr. Tout said that there were a few fender-benders on the Conestoga Espressway expected to get between 15 and 20 centimetres.
Weather problems began Sunday evening in Parry Sound, Ont, the Canadian Press reports. Three people died and one is in hospital after a minivan crossed the centre line and hit a southbound car head-on on Highway 69 near Parry Sound on Sunday evening.
Provincial police in Parry Sound said both people in the car were killed, along with one passenger in the minivan.
