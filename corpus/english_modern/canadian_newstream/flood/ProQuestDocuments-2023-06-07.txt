Full text: QUEBEC - As Quebec health officials scrambled in late summer to prevent a flood of new COVID-19 infections, some doctors and researchers questioned whether the prevention measures would be effective. Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.
"Something is not working in Quebec," said Dr. Nima Machouf, an epidemiologist at l'Université de Montréal. "When we look at the numbers, we look at Quebec and we compare it to the rest of Canada. In Quebec, it's not going well. In Ontario, they're a much larger population, but they have half as many patients. "
The provincial government's response, she and several other experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday, lacked severity early, when the second wave was still a bump. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Quebec City and Montreal.
Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé and Dr. Horacio Arruda, the director of public health, repeatedly urged the public to avoid gatherings indoors but took no further measures to prevent them from happening.
"Is it the message that didn't come through?" Machouf wondered. "They never stopped telling us to stop gathering indoors. We know there is a risk of contagion."
Some experts said the government needed to emphasize communicating clear policies to Quebecers. A volley of inconsistent messages, they said, left room for people to bend or break the guidelines or fell upon the deaf ears of a tired public who had lived through a lockdown and were enjoying their freedom.
Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease specialist at the Jewish General Hospital and assistant professor in the department of medicine at McGill University, said Dubé's recent plea for Quebecers to avoid social gatherings for 28 days lacked clarity.
"It's not clear whether it's a suggestion or a strongly worded request," he said. "It doesn't appear to have the force of law and yet with the current level of transmission that we're seeing, clear action is needed."
Oughton and other experts also questioned the government's refusal to mandate masks in classrooms. Non-medical masks are mandatory indoors throughout the province, but not for schoolchildren in classrooms or in theatres, when attendees are sitting down.
"They cannot give mixed messages that don't make any sense," said Dr. Parisa Ariya, a professor in the departments of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and chemistry at McGill University who has published numerous articles on the spread of bioaerosols.
She said a collection of newly published research indicates that the virus can spread farther than two metres and criticized the government's failure to mandate masks in all indoor settings. It adds ambiguity to a problem that, in her view, should be clear cut: masks work. When people are indoors together, in any setting, they should wear them, she insisted.
"Indoors is the worst place (for the virus)," she said.
Health officials should have erred on the side of caution rather than downplayed and resisted evidence pointing to the possibility that the virus can spread as an aerosol, she argued. Masks should have been made mandatory indoors earlier, and they should now be worn at gatherings of all kinds, she said.
Some experts expressed sympathy with government decision-makers. Officials in Quebec have been trying to walk a careful tightrope: on one side, they are attempting to limit the economic and social impacts of lockdown measures; on the other side, they want to prevent cases from rising to dangerous levels.
"I certainly don't envy my colleagues at public health for having to make these decisions," said Dr. Brian Ward, a professor in the department of medicine at McGill University, "because it's pretty easy to look back, three, four weeks later and say 'OK, that's not what we wanted to happen.' "
Although COVID-19 cases are climbing in many countries and in several other Canadian provinces, Quebec remains the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, as it was in the spring.
"The first time, it is conceivable that Quebec was disadvantaged by having an early spring break and an influx of travellers and all this other stuff, but this time we don't have that as a reason," Oughton said.
Cases of COVID-19 are rising in countries around the world: the U.K., Poland, the Netherlands and Spain, but each country is responding to the pandemic differently and some are having better results than others. South Korea, for example, has aggressively stamped out the infection and appears to have repressed a second wave.
The experts who spoke to the Montreal Gazette said Quebec should actively seek lessons from other countries and follow their leads.
"We have to learn from others," Machouf said. "We have to see what are the others doing that we're doing poorly. That's the way we will be able to solve the problem."

Quebec will help Montreal supply masks to transit riders, says Legault

Full text: QUEBEC - The province wants to help Montreal obtain enough face masks to make travel by public transit as safe as possible given the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier François Legault said Wednesday.
And Quebec has announced plans to allow citizens to practise individual non-contact sports this summer such as golf, tennis, running, cycling and day fishing. The ban on such activities will be lifted as of May 20.
In a whirlwind day at the National Assembly, which sat for the first time since March 17, Legault used his pandemic briefing to respond to a flood of criticism that the government is not obliging Quebecers to wear protective face coverings - especially on public transit.
The furthest Quebec will go is to "strongly recommend" citizens wear masks of some sort when they leave their homes.
On the other hand, Legault said he is also worried the government's decision to gradually lift elements of the lockdown in Montreal will increase the number of people using the métro and bus system.
"Masks are going to become really important," Legault said, adding he wants to help Montreal in any way he can.
"But we have to be sure quality masks are available before thinking about rendering them mandatory."
That, in fact, is the real problem - bigger than than legal questions.
With 500,000 people riding the métro every day, Quebec would need tens of millions of quality masks. It is unlikely sufficient supply can be found. Legault hopes Quebec suppliers will come forward.
Earlier, answering a question from interim Parti Québécois leader Pascal Bérubé in the legislature calling for mandatory masks, Legault said the inventory Quebec has in stock now has to go first to healthcare workers.
"If, in the coming days - and we're working hard on this - we have enough masks to give them to all those using public transit, then we could have this discussion," Legault said.
"Unfortunately right now, even if we're working very hard, there is not the availability of the masks we would need."
On Wednesday, a new SOM-Cogeco poll revealed 89 per cent of Quebecers believe masks should be obligatory on public transit.
Masks were not Legault's only problem Wednesday. He also expressed frustration that Quebec has not yet hit the 14,000 tests a day target it set two weeks ago. It is still hitting only about 9,000 a day.
"I just want to tell you I don't accept this," Legault said. "I am not happy and I have told the people who are responsible. It means we need to be better organized, it means we need to better inform the population in different neighbourhoods."
Quebec Justice Minister and Minister Responsible for Canadian Relations and the Canadian Francophonie Sonia Lebel speaks to an Opposition MNA while the cleaning crew prepare the room for the next question period.
The death toll continues to rise in Quebec. Legault reported 89 new deaths Wednesday, bringing the total to 3,220.
Quebec still lags in explaining in detail who is sick and dying, Legault conceded. The list of CHSLD's considered hot spots has not been updated since May 1 despite repeated requests from citizens and the media.
Both Legault and Health Minister Danielle McCann said they plan to correct that situation in short order with McCann saying the new update will show some improvements.
Legault, however, revealed that 5,139 seniors in 332 residences are now infected. Eighty per cent of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have been in public and private seniors' residences.
Legault also announced he will be in Montreal Thursday and Friday for the first time in two months. He will meet with Mayor Valérie Plante and said he wants to see first-hand how officials are handling the pandemic.
Wednesday also marked the first day opposition politicians were able to address questions on the handling of the pandemic directly to Legault's government.
Among the first on her feet was the new leader of the Liberal official opposition, Dominque Anglade.
After congratulating the government for its initial response to the pandemic, Anglade said its more recent response has been error-prone and incoherent. She specifically asked why Quebec, with 23 per cent of Canada's population, has 60 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths.
"That is the equivalent of municipality of Saint-Tite," Anglade fired across the floor.
But there was a solemn tone in the day, too. MNAs observed a moment of silence for the victims of the virus, while the flag of the legislature was lowered to half-mast for the day.

Montreal book and record stores went online, but not all eager to reopen after lockdown

Full text: Within 48 hours of the provincial government shutting down all non-essential stores across the province in March, the folks at Aux 33 Tours had created a full-scale web store with close to 80,000 records for sale online. And reaction was swift and enthusiastic, with the Mont-Royal Ave. E. store, one of the city's leading vinyl retailers, receiving a flood of orders.
Aux 33 Tours, which didn't sell online before the COVID-19 crisis, uses several different delivery methods, including Canada Post for faraway deliveries and drivers here in Montreal who are delivering around 100 packages around the city every day.
Stores in Montreal will be allowed to reopen May 25 under Premier François Legault's plan, but Aux 33 Tours owner Pierre Markotanyos doesn't think he'll open that day and is unsure when he'll reopen his doors.
"My greatest fear is: What if we open up and we're open for two or three weeks and one of my staff gets COVID and I have to retrace the customers who've come into the store in the last three days and tell them to quarantine themselves? Then I'll have to shut down and disinfect the whole store," said Markotanyos.
"I don't feel comfortable opening the store if I don't feel I can protect my employees and protect my customers."
Many book and record stores in Montreal have, like Aux 33 Tours, branched out into online sales to satisfy customers while the bricks-and-mortar stores are closed due to government regulations.
Venerable McGill Ghetto used-book emporium The Word has elicited much positive reaction to its new online sales presence At the beginning of the crisis, the store was offering a surprise book box where the customer would receive books selected by staff at The Word. They put it on hold after a couple of weeks because it was complicated to manage, but say it will be back shortly. They do also still offer a surprise book option and store manager Brendan King-Edwards says it is popular with people who want to send a present to someone they're unable to see right now because of confinement rules.
King-Edwards says The Word will reopen May 25 and will continue selling online.
"If we're being realistic, people are going to be spending more time at home and they're not going to necessarily want to go out and go shopping," said King-Edwards. "It's not ideal for us because we're a historic location and one of the things people love about us is actually coming to the location."
The Drawn & Quarterly bookstore on Bernard St. in Mile End also began online sales and delivery at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. The folks at Drawn & Quarterly are not sure if the store will re-open May 25.
Encore Books & Records on Sherbrooke St. W. in N.D.G. took an innovative approach to selling books and records during the pandemic.
"Right now we're delivering in N.D.G. once a week and we're taking orders on Facebook," said Encore owner Sean Madden. "What we're doing is putting up pictures of our sections and people can browse the pictures online and then they tell us which book from which picture number. It's basically a community service."
Madden is not sure if Encore will reopen May 25.

Verdun Hospital hit with coronavirus outbreak affecting up to 35 patients

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/verdun-hospital-hit-with-coronavirus-outbreak/docview/2385834748/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Verdun Hospital has been hit with the most severe outbreak of COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/q-and-a-what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-covid-19/ ) to date of any acute-care facility in the city, with as many as 35 patients infected, five doctors sent home for self-isolation, along with an undisclosed number of other health workers also contracting the coronavirus.
As Montreal struggles with 20 COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care centres, up from 13 on Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-outbreaks-have-hit-13-long-term-care-centres-in-montreal/ ), the pandemic has now spread to two general hospitals, the city's director of public health confirmed on Thursday. Dr. Mylène Drouin declined to name the other hospital. but the Montreal Neurogical Hospital was hit with an outbreak a week ago.
"Everyone is terrified, overwhelmed by the situation, to see that the virus is now widespread," Dr. François Plante, a lung specialist who practises at Verdun Hospital, told the Montreal Gazette.
Plante, 74, was not exposed to the outbreak since he has been confined to his home as a precaution after Premier François Legault on March 14 called on all Quebecers who are at least 70 years old to stay home. But Plante warned the outbreak will probably strain the already stretched resources of the hospital.
"The impact is certainly disastrous because of this illness," he said. "It's appalling."
There were actually two COVID-19 clusters declared at the hospital on LaSalle Blvd. The first was discovered after doctors developed symptoms of the respiratory illness while conducting rounds on a floor. But authorities have not been able to identify the source of the second cluster in the same facility.
As soon as the doctors tested positive, every patient in the hospital was also tested. That yielded the result of 35 infected patients, some of whom are asymptomatic.
Verdun Hospital staff are now testing every patient for COVID-19 upon admission.
All 35 patients have been isolated in a so-called hot zone. The hospital has a total of 244 beds.
"It's not the doctors' fault, as they were (initially) asymptomatic, but it's a possible reason for the outbreak," said Jean-Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for the health authority in charge of the hospital.
"We really don't want fingers pointed at our doctors," Aubé added. "Their work is essential. The minute they showed symptoms, they stopped working immediately."
Staff are now testing every patient for COVID-19 upon admission to the hospital. The reason is that some of the 35 infected patients might have contracted COVID-19 in the community and were asymptomatic when they checked into the hospital for a different medical reason.
Of the five doctors who are in self-isolation at home, two have tested positive. The three others are at home because of their exposure to the sites of the contagion. They will have to test negative two times after 14 days of isolation before they can return to work.
Other health-care workers have been sent home, too, Plante said. Aubé was unable to confirm whether other workers at the hospital are in self-isolation, but he estimated that as many as 100 health employees in the Centre-Sud region that includes Verdun have tested positive for COVID-19.
Drouin urged health workers who have flu-like or respiratory symptoms not to show up for work. Although authorities are giving priority to health professionals for testing, she explained that Quebec's screening test is not sensitive enough to detect a COVID-19 infection in someone who is asymptomatic.
"I don't have all the details about what happened at Verdun," Drouin told reporters at a news conference. "As you know, we have outbreaks in a couple of hospitals right now."
The Montreal Neurological Hospital reported an outbreak a week ago( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hit-with-two-covid-19-outbreaks-31-health-workers-infected/ ). Admissions were suspended until further notice and some activities were redirected to the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM). Officials at the McGill University Health Centre - which oversees the Neuro - have refused to make public the number of patients who were infected.
The two hospital outbreaks underscore the enormous challenges health workers face in treating patients during the pandemic, including extreme fatigue and the ever-present risk of contracting the highly contagious coronavirus. Research has shown the novel virus - known as SARS-CoV-2 - can last on some surfaces for up to three days.

Coronavirus: Deep concern and distress now at seniors' residences

Full text: Benoît Huberdeau usually visits his mother, Raymonde, at her Laval nursing home every two or three weeks, making the 90-minute drive from his home to spend a few hours with her and lift her spirits.
At 90 years old, Raymonde is bedridden, has a heart condition and is beginning to wrestle with bouts of dementia.
When the government first banned visits to seniors' residences amid the COVID-19 pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-chslds-totally-unprepared-for-pandemic-grieving-woman-says/wcm/e03e06ad-b7eb-46d4-9caf-3d7fa876cd56/ ), Huberdeau and his six siblings were frustrated but understood it was for the greater good.
Now as reports emerge of more and more outbreaks in seniors' residences, that understanding is turning into deep concern and distress. On Monday, Huberdeau was told there was one confirmed COVID-19 case in his mother's residence, the Centre d'hébergement de Sainte-Dorothée.
By Thursday, health authorities confirmed the centre now has 26 cases - and three deaths.
"We understand the measures, but she's still our mother," Huberdeau, 59, said Thursday. "We're used to encouraging her through this. It always did her good to see us. Now she's closing in on herself and I don't know if she understands what's going on."
As outbreaks have multiplied in public and private seniors' residences across Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-chslds-totally-unprepared-for-pandemic-grieving-woman-says/wcm/e03e06ad-b7eb-46d4-9caf-3d7fa876cd56/ ), government officials have said stopping the spread inside the homes is the province's greatest challenge.
As of Thursday, nearly one-quarter of all seniors' residences in the province - a total of 519 - had at least one COVID-19 case. In the greater Montreal region, there are now outbreaks in 20 residences and 148 health network employees that have tested positive( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-outbreaks-have-hit-13-long-term-care-centres-in-montreal/wcm/ffc73c0f-0a09-4edf-84ab-d9d3d17c2c9e/ ).
Asked Thursday whether he felt the government has lost control over the situation, Premier François Legault said he doesn't believe it has.
The government announced a pay raise for frontline workers in the health network, something the premier said he hopes will convince some to switch from part-time to full-time and increase staffing in the centres.
And Legault reiterated it's crucial people respect the ban on visiting the residences, calling it a matter of life and death.
The government also continues to look into ways of minimizing health network workers moving between different centres and potentially spreading the virus without knowing it, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said.
McCann said the province is trying to find new measures to ensure seniors inside the homes aren't feeling too isolated from their loved ones, be it by more telephone calls or distributing iPads within the centres to allow for video calls.
"We're very sensitive to the situation (seniors) are living," McCann said.
Legault also said he understands some Quebecers may be feeling the need to take their family members out of the residences given the outbreaks.
The premier said he wasn't ruling out the idea, but mentioned that all decisions are being made on a case-by-case basis. Criteria such as the person's health and the centre's overall situation and location would need to be considered.
As for releasing a detailed list of which seniors' homes are the hardest hit in the province, as some have requested, Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda said that isn't in the plans at the moment, questioning whether it's in the public's interest to do so.
Huberdeau and others who spoke to the Montreal Gazette said communication with the centres has become increasingly difficult as the situation has worsened. Families are instead relying on getting updates from nurses they've grown to know through the years.
Huberdeau wishes the government would be more forthcoming about it all - he understands officials are trying to keep a positive tone to reassure people, he said, but wonders whether it's time to be more open about what's happening in the residences so families can begin bracing for the worst.
But mostly, Huberdeau wishes he could somehow buy more time with his mother. When staff organized a video call between the two on Monday, Huberdeau said it was more confusing for her than anything else.
"It's heartbreaking," he said.
"We lost our father a few years ago, but we were with him at the end," Huberdeau added, breaking down. "I fear we won't be able to be with our mother."

Full text: The Montreal Gazette is receiving a steady stream of questions from readers about COVID-19. We are doing our best to answer as many as we can.
Here's a glimpse into our mailbox.
Question: Given the whole COVID-19 situation going on, and various stores closing down such as LUSH and Apple, I find it surprising that Bulk Barn (a store that carries 95 per cent bulk products) is still open for business. I feel as though a bulk store as such is a big risk factor for spreading the virus. In the store, they have hundreds of scoops that are shared amongst the clients that come in. I have also seen many people putting their hands in the bins despite there being notices on the bins not to snack in the store. Just like everywhere else, they probably clean, wash their hands, wear gloves, etc. However, despite all of these precautions, I still feel as though the store should not be allowed to stay open.
Answer: Sabrina Saad, a supervisor at the Bulk Barn outlet at the Marché de l'ouest in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, said the stores remain open because they sell food, which is an essential service. "We have implemented a new program that allows customers to be served around the store so that way they don't touch anything and they're served by an employee who scoops their items for them. That way they're only touching things that are packaged. The employees are wearing gloves and they walk around and take fresh scoops for every customer." The Bulk Barn stores also are limiting the number of clients in the store at any given time. At Saad's Bulk Barn, there is usually only two or three people in the store at a time.
Question: In your article (last week) you wrote: "On Wednesday, the Canadian government passed an emergency COVID-19 bill that includes $2,000 per month in direct support through the Canada Revenue Agency to those who can¹t work because of COVID-19. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said benefits for workers would come as early as the first week of April." Who can apply for this benefit? Is it in addition to the Employment Insurance application? How does the government know who will benefit? My husband has been temporarily laid off, but as he works in the hotel industry there is not yet a realistic timeline as to when he will be re-hired. His company is filing the necessary paperwork.
Answer: The Canada Emergency Response Benefit will provide you with $500 a week for up to 16 weeks. The federal government will begin taking applications on April 6. You can apply to either Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency, but not both. To be eligible, you have to: reside in Canada; be 15 years old or over; have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 or due to illness; or because you lost your job for reasons beyond your control. You can't be receiving Employment Insurance benefits for the same period. You also have to have earned a minimum of $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the application.
Question: I was surprised to see that Montreal Trudeau airport had many flight arrivals and departures (Wednesday) as well as scheduled flights for (Thursday). Am I having a bad dream? It doesn't look like exceptions or non-commercial flights only. There were a few flights to and from New York, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Houston, as well as flights from Paris, Frankfurt, Qatar. Aren't Canadian borders supposed to be closed?
Answer: Air Canada confirmed it has cancelled much of its travel, but still has some flights. It is collaborating with the Canadian government to bring back Canadian citizens from abroad and there are flights for that from Bogota to Toronto Friday, from Algiers to Montreal Saturday, and from Buenos Aires to Toronto Sunday. There are also many flights daily within Canada. In addition, Air Canada is still flying one flight a day from Montreal to Boston, Chicago, Washington, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. Air Canada also has up to two flights daily to Newark, N.J. A spokesperson from Air Canada didn't respond to requests for an interview.

Full text: Montreal opposition leader Lionel Perez( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-passes-rejects-anti-semitism-definition/ ) says his son has tested positive for COVID-19 and was apparently in the house when Perez held an intimate engagement party for his daughter.
On Tuesday, Perez's daughter - who lives with her parents in Montreal - and his future son-in-law - who lives in New York - celebrated their engagement long distance via Zoom, the videoconferencing app that has seen its popularity surge during the coronavirus pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ).
Perez decided to add a festive note by asking a musician friend to serenade the family from the driveway. Several well-wishers passed by to take part in the celebrations, albeit at a good distance from the house, Perez said.
In a written statement sent to reporters just before midnight Wednesday, Perez said he now regrets holding the celebration.
"I now understand that under the current crisis, it was not advisable to hold this family activity, for which we didn't predict the enthusiastic reaction of passersby, " Perez said. "If I had to do it over again, I would do things differently, to be more prudent."
The celebration took place despite the fact that both Perez and his son were isolating themselves because his son had tested positive for the virus. Perez said his son did not have any symptoms despite the positive test.
"I advised the city clerk as well as the Plante administration and my own caucus about the situation," Perez said. "We put in place strict isolation measures at home, and I am also isolated. I asked to be tested, but did not fit the criteria set forth by the public health department."
He added that his son went outside for a brief period during the event, but was told to go back in the house.
Perez, who represents the Darlington district in the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, said the plan for the celebration respected the rules for social distancing since his friend remained outside.
"Besides celebrating the engagement, it was really an opportunity to uplift my neighbours at a time when we really have the need," said the Ensemble Montréal leader, who compared the event to balcony concerts that have become popular in many countries during the coronavirus crisis.
Perez added that most of his neighbours appreciated the musical interlude and waved from their porches. But someone called 911 and reported that a gathering was underway, in contravention of rules preventing social gatherings during the pandemic.
Montreal police dispatched several squad cars and told Perez to shut down the celebration.
"At every single moment, the rules were respected," Perez said.
"The quasi-totality of people were on their porches and on their balconies," he added.
Perez said he did not invite anyone, including his elderly parents who live three blocks away. Only Perez, his wife and their four children were inside the house.
However, a few people who happened to be walking past the house stopped to offer well wishes while keeping a two-metre distance, Perez added.
Perez said that when police arrived he immediately co-operated with them and asked his musician friend to leave.
"I can understand why people would be concerned, but I think that people have to realize that the rules were respected at all times, and if ever there was a risk of them not being followed I would have put a stop to it immediately," Perez said.
Marvin Rotrand, the independent councillor for Snowdon, said he believed Perez when he said the rules were respected.
"I've now known Lionel Perez for over 10 years and he is not someone who would ever flout rules or put the public at risk," Rotrand said.
Rotrand questioned whether Perez's public profile, or the fact he is identifiable as Jewish because he wears the kippah, might have played a role in the incident.
Asked whether anti-Semitism might have played a role, Perez refused to comment.
Julien Lévesque, a media relations officer with the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, said visits made by police to private homes are confidential and declined to provide details.

Plante declares state of emergency in Montreal to help homeless, slow spread of coronavirus

Full text: By Paul Cherry and Christopher Curtis
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante declared the city has entered into in a state of emergency on Friday with the goal of providing aid to the homeless and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
"With the evolution of the situation, we have reached a point where we have given ourselves new powers, exceptional powers, to make us more agile," the mayor said late Friday afternoon. "I declared the state of emergency because our resources for the homeless need reinforcements and we need them now. It is the most vulnerable among us who need us.
"Our homeless population finds itself without food, no place to rest and with no protection and that is unacceptable. (Premier François Legault) asks us to stay home. But what does that mean when you have no home?"
Hours earlier, Quebec's director of public health, Horacio Arruda, asked that the city declare the state of emergency because the virus is spreading faster in Montreal than in other parts of the province.
Plante noted earlier this week the downtown and Guy Favreau YMCAs were turned into welcome centres for homeless people who have been turned away from other locations trying to respect social distancing recommendations. She also said the former Royal Victoria Hospital was being modified to help homeless people diagnosed with the coronavirus or awaiting the result of a test to determine if they have it. Those already diagnosed with the virus will be placed on one floor, while those awaiting test results will be sheltered on another.
"But we have to go farther then we already have. New shelters will be set up in the coming days. The city will also set up outdoor day centres in public spaces frequented by the homeless. There will be five sites that can welcome 1,000 people per day," Plante said, while adding the first site will be at Cabot Square in the heart of downtown.
The mayor said her declaration is comparable to when a state of emergency is declared when there is a flood in the city and authorities need to take over spaces, for example a parking lot or a park. Plante said the powers also allow the city to dispatch police and firefighters into areas where they are needed.
During the press conference at city hall, Plante also addressed rumours the city would somehow be shut down on Friday.
"I want to make something clear. A lot of information has been circulating. I want to assure the public and set the record straight. The city is not under lockdown. Neither is it under quarantine. Not today, not tomorrow. If there is a day when it becomes the case it will be at the request of the Quebec government and the public health department. If it is ever the case, it will be done in a gradual manner. So I want to say we are not at that point at all."
"If we have to put other measures in place, like closing the bridges, admittedly, we are ready," Plante said, while repeating that it would have to be up to the provincial government "to push that button."
Quebec's Civil Code includes a section through which a "local municipality may declare a state of emergency in all or part of its territory where, in an actual or imminent major disaster situation, immediate action is required to protect human life, health or physical integrity which, in its opinion, it is unable to take within the scope of its normal operating rules or of any applicable emergency preparedness plan."
Plante said she doesn't want the city to reach a point where police are pulling people over merely to ask them where they are going. She also said she does not want to completely close off access to the city's parks.
"For a lot of people it is the only backyard they have, but people have to be super-vigilant (to maintain a two-metre distance from other people)," she said, while noting stairways to Mount Royal were closed because of reports that people weren't following those recommendations.
Stewart Greville, left, speaks with Resilience Montreal project coordinator David Chapman in Cabot Square in Montreal on Friday, March 27, 2020.
Stewart Greville, who was at Cabot Square on Friday, said he doesn't know if he has the coronavirus( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ) and he desperately wanted to self isolate Thursday after being tested for COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/health-network-having-trouble-delivering-on-pledge-to-house-homeless-shelter/ ), but instead he spent the night with 106 other homeless people at the downtown YMCA.
"I was in a line where people were coughing, spitting, fighting for six hours," said Greville, 62. "After waiting for six hours, I slept in a dorm where our beds were just three feet apart. This is dangerous. If I'm infected, a lot of people were exposed to the virus last night."
For two weeks, Quebecers have been on lockdown to fight the spread ofCOVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-live-updates-bank-of-canada-lowers-interest-rate-to-boost-economy/wcm/42c413c7-c143-439e-a12c-256afd34a53c/ ): schools and non-essential businesses are closed, police have the power to arrest people for gathering in groups of more than two( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-laval-police-field-100-calls-about-violations-of-safety-protocols/ ) and millions are staying home for days at a time.
Now - 15 days after the province announced its first social-distancing measures - Health and Social Services Minister Danielle McCann says there's a plan to house the homeless in a wing of the old Royal Victoria Hospital( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/royal-vic-converted-into-isolation-centre-for-montreals-homeless/ ). The minister said Friday homeless people will be moved out of crowded shelters and into "places where there is more space," but did not provide further detail.
The extent of the problem began to surface on Monday, when a homeless man who tested positive for coronavirus was picked up by police( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/health-network-having-trouble-delivering-on-pledge-to-house-homeless-shelter/wcm/af52249b-dec6-4ee6-b6fc-5f8e835281e6/ ) while standing in line at the Old Brewery Mission. He'd been tested two days earlier, but was allowed to wander the city despite exhibiting symptoms of the illness.
In response, the mission's executive director - Matthew Pearce - said Quebec's health ministry would provide hotel rooms to homeless people so they could self-isolate while awaiting test results. But on Thursday, Pearce said the province was struggling to keep that promise( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/health-network-having-trouble-delivering-on-pledge-to-house-homeless-shelter/ ).
A spokesperson with CIUSSS Centre-Sud told the Montreal Gazette on Thursday he had "no idea" about the pledge to house homeless people in hotels. Contacted again Friday, the spokesperson said he had no new information.
The Old Brewery Mission isn't taking new residents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-homeless-can-stay-in-a-hotel-while-awaiting-coronavirus-test-results/ ) and it's serving most of its lunches in to-go bags so clients don't have to eat under the same roof.
The Resilience Montreal day centre was forced to shutter its doors Thursday and move its services into Cabot Square. On Friday, about 100 people gathered in the Atwater Ave. park, a clear violation of social-distancing norms.
Victoria sits on a ledge in Cabot Square in Montreal on Friday, March 27, 2020.
"Services everywhere are shutting down, people are sleeping on the streets, they're eating less, it's really tense on the ground," said David Chapman, who runs Resilience Montreal. "I've never seen so many homeless people in the park at once. They're coming all the way from Berri St. and that's causing some rifts with the local homeless."
Greville said he had a high fever and "nasty cough" Thursday.
"I suppose I was lucky to sleep indoors, but I lined up outside the YMCA at 2 p.m. They let us in at 8 p.m.," he said. "I don't know what I exposed others to or what they exposed me to, but we're talking about a life or death situation here. If the province has a strategy, it feels like it's a little too late."
Chapman says there should be mobile testing at Cabot Square or in other places that serve the homeless.
"We have no idea how big the problem is, and that's scary."

Coronavirus: Quebec closes daycares, elementary, high schools, CEGEPs and universities

Full text: QUEBEC - In another sign Quebec is grinding to a halt, daycares, elementary and high schools, CEGEPs and universities will be closed for the next two weeks as Quebec steps up its battle against the novel coronavirus( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ).
Premier François Legault( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/covid-19-quebec-asks-anyone-returning-from-travel-to-self-quarantine ) made the announcement - which affects about one million students and teachers in 3,200 public and private establishments - at a news conference Friday updating Quebecers on the evolution of the COVID-19 situation.
Legault said he knows that the closing will be an inconvenience for some parents, but said it has to be done to slow as much as possible the spread of COVID-19. Quebec, nevertheless, considers the situation stable with 17 confirmed cases.
"I know this will be a headache for parents, but it is our responsibility, the challenge for the next two weeks, to ensure the fewest number of cases possible," Legault said at a news conference held at the legislature.
Daycare workers will be asked to continue to offer services to parents who must work to provide essential services, such as in health or ambulance services, Legault said.
Both the public and private daycare networks - a total of 305,800 spots - are affected. The anticipated date for re-opening everything is March 30 but the shutdown could also be renewed should the situation require.
Legault appealed to parents and friends to lend a hand to parents who might need help caring for their children. He also urged employers to show tolerance, adding other measures will be announced Monday to financially compensate companies for absent employees or those in voluntary isolation because they are returning from March break holidays.
And setting the tone for what will be a daily encounter with the media where he can speak to Quebecers living through the COVID-19 crisis, Legault again made an appeal for calm and solidarity. Thus far, he said he is "very proud" of the reaction of citizens.
"I want to tell Quebecers that yes, I fully realize that I am asking a lot of you," Legault said. "But we are doing this to avoid the worst from happening.
"Let's keep at it, roll up our sleeves together and I am convinced we will get through this."
Legault and key ministers will also be working through the weekend with the premier planning daily media briefings.
Addressing reports of panicky citizens lining up at grocery stores and cleaning the shelves of items such as toilet paper( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-crowds-at-montreal-area-stores-as-shoppers-stock-up ), Legault said such behaviour is not necessary.
He said the truckers who supply stores are hard at work.
"We do not foresee any food shortages," Legault said, noting truck and airline and ship personnel are exempt from the call for voluntary isolation. "I am telling people, don't worry about food. Right now all trucks are delivering goods."
On hand for the announcement, Education Minister Jean-François Roberge said he does not expect the extended holiday for students and teachers to affect the academic calendar.
Asked about the change of heart over school closures - Quebec had held off closing them until now - Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, said the decision is related to the recent return of many students from March breaks.
"The cases (of COVID-19) which have returned, which we have seen recently, are cases of people who travelled in certain countries during March break," Arruda said.
"We want to avoid (the virus) being introduced because there has been an increase in travel by parents (in that period)."
He stressed he does not believe children are more at risk. So far, there are no cases of a child dying as a result of exposure to the virus - even in China where the outbreak began, Arruda said.
But Legault nevertheless repeated he wants tighter border controls and said he intends to ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to limit the number of visitors to Canada when the premiers discuss with Trudeau later Friday.
That meeting was to be held by conference call because Trudeau has isolated himself in his Ottawa home after his wife Sophie Grégoire tested positive( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/cp-newsalert-sophie-gregoire-trudeau-tests-positive-for-covid-19-pmo-2/wcm/de5c5605-e453-46c5-a438-c880207f1e1d ) for COVID-19.
Legault said there is an "incoherence" in the fact Quebecers are being asked to voluntarily isolate themselves but visitors do not have to.
He called on Trudeau to "rapidly limit the admission of visitors to Canada."
Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Friday that Canadians should cancel all non-essential travel outside the country.
The Legault government also moved to deal with a flood of complaints about its telephone hotline Info-Santé 811. Normally the line receives on average about 6,000 calls a day. That number has nearly doubled to 11,200, creating long waits.
Legault said people with questions about COVID-19 need to stop calling 811 and should call the other general information health line, 1-877-644-4545.
Health Minister Danielle McCann said problems with congestion on the 811 line will be corrected, with 88 more nurses being added to answer calls.
"I want to reassure the population, this is a problem we will fix very rapidly," McCann said. "I am personally following up on this."
Quebec also announced plans to open 12 new clinics across the province to screen people for COVID-19. Once 15 are up and running, the province believes it will be able to conduct between 300 and 400 tests a day.
The government's decision to close daycares and schools comes a day after the government hesitated to do so. Ontario announced a day earlier it has closed schools until April 5.
Dozens of school boards and schools went ahead Thursday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-schools-universities-grapple-with-new-covid-19-directives ) and announced their own closings for Friday.
Quebec has four new confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 17.
#COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) - 4 nouveaux cas confirmés : les personnes infectées reviennent d'un pays étranger. Le réseau de la santé est mobilisé pour leur prise en charge. Jusqu'à présent, 17 cas de COVID-19 ont été confirmés au Québec. #santequebec( https://twitter.com/hashtag/santequebec?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

But there was no decision on suspending work at the legislature, which has nevertheless banned visitors and stepped up hygiene protocols. Workers were seen disinfecting bathrooms and even doorknobs.
In Ottawa, the House of Commons( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/parliament-suspends-for-five-weeks-over-covid-19-concerns/wcm/258d170f-7957-43bd-92a0-c5b5e4da66e0 ) has been recessed until April 20 to prevent further exposure to the virus.
Legault noted with 125 MNAs, the National Assembly does not fall into the category of indoor venues with more than 250 people. The government announced Thursday all such events have been cancelled.
The commons has 338 federal MPs.

Full text: QUEBEC Despite a chorus of protests, the Legault government says it has no intention of backing down on last minute amendments to its school reform plan.
And it disputes claims by mayors of cities who say they have been left holding the bag - which could mean tax increases for citizens - because the new service centres (which replace school boards) will be allowed to seize the land they want from municipalities to build schools and pay nothing for it.
"There is an urgent need to act," Premier François Legault told reporters arriving for question period at the legislature. "Our law is very moderate.
"We give (service centres) two years to come to an agreement with each municipality before we require them to hand over the land."
Legault went so far as to say municipalities come out ahead because the government will pay to build the schools in their communities and that will help attract more citizens.
"I think it's a good deal," Legault said.
The comments came amid the turmoil sparked by the Coalition Avenir Québec government's decision to add a series of last-minute amendments to Bill 40, legislation abolishing school boards to replace them with service centres.
Tabled in the legislature in the wee hours Saturday morning under the cloud of closure, the amendments not only immediately put an end to the jobs of hundreds of school board commissioners in the francophone system, they also gave the school service centres that will replace boards the power to force towns and cities to hand over municipal land - for free - if needed to build new schools.
Stunned, Quebec's mayors have lashed out at the government, saying they were never consulted about the matter.
Quebec's Union des municipalités (UMQ) denounced the move, describing it as a form of disguised expropriation power that Quebec is unilaterally handing over to non-elected service board directors.
On Tuesday, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante again attacked, saying education is a provincial responsibility and cities and towns should not be asked to pay for new schools.
"I will not let the government pass the bill to us and let the municipalities pass it on to the citizens," Plante told reporters at Montreal City Hall. "I think it would be completely unfair."
"It would be unacceptable to us for the government to force us to buy private land and then give it away," she said. "In concrete terms, it's like telling the city of Montreal to buy a piece of downtown land for $40 million. Where am I going to find this money?" she said.
The mayor said she would discuss the issue with other mayors at upcoming meetings of the UMQ and the Montreal Metropolitan Community.
In fact, Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin, who chairs the caucus of Quebec's larger cities, is insisting Education Minister Jean-François Roberge appear before them Thursday when the cities meet in Montreal.
Roberge told reporters he would contact the disgruntled mayors by phone, but argued the government had no choice but to act because the current system of allowing school boards and cities to negotiate such arrangements on their own is not working.
His officials estimate as many as 50 needed school construction projects are currently blocked. Roberge noted no new high schools have been opened in Quebec since 2006 despite skyrocketing growth in student numbers.
"The status quo is Griffintown where people realized two or three years too late that there were not enough schools and no more land to build them on," Roberge said. "We have to work differently."
He did concede that inserting the amendment at the last minute was not ideal, but insisted it was not ready earlier.
Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest denied the government was forcing the reforms and said teams of her officials have been on the ground for months informing mayors what was coming down the pipe from Quebec City.
She also blamed the mayors for years of non-co-operation with the old school boards.
"There are lands that were offered (for schools) in agricultural lands, in swamps, in flood zones," Laforest said. "It's kind of particular. Sometimes even right by highways."
Earlier, Quebec's three opposition parties called on the government to at least temporarily suspend the amendments.
"I am stunned that over the course of a few hours the minister (Roberge) has managed to turn opinion unanimously against himself," interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand told reporters.
"Whether it is parents'committees or municipalities or unions, all the groups are absolutely furious."
"This reform is like buying a house where you are only allowed to visit the outside, but not the inside, where there are plenty of hidden defects, but you are obliged to buy it anyway," added Liberal education critic Marwah Rizqy.
"There's a limit to bulldozing people."
Parti Québécois education critic Véronique Hivon accused the education minister of trying to pull a fast one on municipal leaders.
"The minister has insulted the mayors, he has insulted all the opposition members of this parliament with his way of doing things," Hivon said.
But there were also questions Tuesday about how the new service centres will work now that the commissioners are gone.
Diane Beaudet, a former school commissioner in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, said she was appalled at how Bill 40 was rammed through the National Assembly in the middle of the night.
Now that commissioners have been ousted, some parents are uncertain about who will respond to their needs, said Beaudet, a commissioner at the Commission scolaire de Montréal since 2014.
"I was available on (Facebook) messenger morning, noon and night," she said.
"It wasn't just parents who contacted me. I was contacted by community organizations dealing with vulnerable parents who needed help."
Many parents in her community have bad memories of their time at school and are uncomfortable calling the principal, she said.
"We were local people who knew the issues," she said.
"We could direct parents to the right place or answer questions. They have destabilized the system."
Parents who have questions about their child's school or their education should contact the principal's office, said Alain Perron, a spokesperson for the CSDM.
Bill 40 is so complex and has so many amendments that school board lawyers are examining it with a fine-tooth comb so they can explain the changes to employees and teachers.
Under the new law, parents are permitted to enrol their child in a school in another service centre, if there's space.
For instance, a parent living in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce could enrol their child in a school on the West Island if the school is not full. However, if the West Island school would need a spot for a local child the following year, the N.D.G. student would have to return to a school in that neighbourhood.

Full text: Re: "Pierrefonds-Roxboro mayor decries inaction on flood prevention" (Montreal Gazette,Jan. 30) Pierrefonds-Roxboro mayor Jim Beis has criticized Montreal and Quebec for not acting to prevent flooding in hisborough.
Yet Beis and his council have at least in the past supported housing construction in part of the 285 hectare environmentally sensitive floodplain inPierrefonds.
Ironically, the OCPM (Office de Consultation Public de Montréal) public hearing in 2017 for this very "development" was moved to the OCPM's Montreal's office because of flooding at the Pierrefonds-Roxboro boroughbuilding.
Beis should realize that among his best allies in flood prevention is our nature conservation movement, which opposes building over Pierrefonds'floodplain and its richbiodiversity.

Legault personally deleted anti-Muslim hate messages from his Facebook page; Premier's post after memorial for victims of mosque attack drew online trolls

Full text: ST-SAUVEUR Premier François Legault says he personally deleted many of the anti-Muslim hate messages posted by internet trolls on his Facebook page following this week's memorial to the victims of the attack on the Quebec City mosque three years ago.
"Wednesday night I started doing it myself," Legault told reporters Friday. "I didn't like what I saw, honestly. And then I asked people, because I have to sleep, to continue the work. (I said) We have to manage and erase those messages as soon as possible."
Legault was unable to say exactly how many hate messages found their way into the comments section of his page, which is open to the public and managed by him and his staff. Later, an aide confirmed to The Montreal Gazette it was "hundreds," and the staff was busy all night trying to keep up with the flood.
The aide said they decided to not remove Legault's initial message calling for tolerance - which is still posted - because it would appear the government was caving in.
"It would be like they win," an official said. "It's the risk you run when you post something. You can't really control social media."
Emerging for a news conference after a two-day Coalition Avenir Québec caucus meeting, Legault appeared shaken and annoyed with what had happened, noting it was the "first time I see so many."
"We never know if it's only a few people under different names," Legault said. "It's tough to say how many people are concerned. But it's unacceptable and I don't like to see that at all."
Asked about comments he made at the pre-winter caucus meeting in Gatineau a year earlier that he did not believe Islamophobia exists in Quebec, Legault said he continues to believe Quebecers "are not racist or Islamophobic people."
"I think there are some cases, there are a few people that like to send those hate messages but still I don't think that it represents the Quebec people," Legault said.
He was cautious in responding to comments made earlier by his minister for government digital transformation, Éric Caire. He said Quebec has to find a technological way to stop such behaviour because education sensitization programs are not enough.
"I think we have to look with police at how we can better manage social media," Legault said. "If there is something we can do it's around that. Of course, we cannot do that alone but, besides, I think you will always have a few people that you cannot control and that's a terrible thing, an unacceptable thing."
Earlier Friday, Robert Pigeon, the Quebec City police chief, told reporters whenever stories involving the Muslim community make the news, there is invariably an increase in hate incidents such as what happened to Legault's Facebook page.
The third anniversary of the Quebec City mosque attack was Wednesday. Pigeon noted the Sûreté du Québec also monitors Legault's Facebook page at all times.
Legault posted his message just after the ceremony at the mosque, which he attended.
The message said: "We thought this kind of event was not possible in Quebec. Having a father, husband or brother ripped away from us because of intolerance and hate.
"We are united here this evening to remind ourselves that our people are not sheltered from this kind of hate. But this hate is not that of Quebec. The real face of Quebec is that of the people the day after this tragedy who gathered to show their solidarity."
Legault revealed he tried he to remove the messages himself at the end of a news conference that started with him saying he did not want to dramatize the incident. Last November, he himself touted Facebook as a good tool for measuring public opinion.
"If you look on my Facebook, for example, 90 per cent of the people agree with what we are doing," Legault said then in reference to his immigration reforms.
He said he did not think this week's messages went so far as inciting violence that could make it a criminal matter, so he did not report it to police.
"I am convinced it is a very small minority hiding behind social media which is hateful, intolerant," he said. "It is my duty as premier to denounce these hate messages and say what is happening is unacceptable."
He expressed doubt about enacting a recommendation of the Quebec human rights commission a few years ago, which suggested the government adopt a policy to fight racism and hate acts.
"I don't think a law can impede a few intolerant people, to settle all these problems," he said. "The great majority of Quebecers are tolerant, respectful and welcoming.
"Let's not let a few people change the harmony we have living together, which is the envy of people all over the world, the social peace we have in Quebec."
Other ministers in his cabinet also expressed frustration about the incident earlier in the day, but appeared at a loss on how to stop it from happening.
"We have to denounce these messages," Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette told reporters. "We are an open society, a tolerant society. And there's no space for that kind of message. And all messages like that are not tolerable. Such behaviour is unacceptable ... and we have to find a way to make people responsible and pay for what they say."
"You know, stupid people are stupid people," Caire said. "And there's a limit on what education can do. That's why I said yes to education, but we need to find other means to stop those people for whom education is not the response for what they do."
He did not elaborate. "It's dreadful. It is unacceptable," said Transport Minister François Bonnardel. "We have to deplore, deplore, deplore loud and strong." pauthier@postmedia.com Twitter.com/philipauthier

Full text: ST-SAUVEUR - Premier François Legault says he personally deleted many of the anti-Muslim hate messages posted by internet trolls on his Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/FrancoisLegaultPremierMinistre/ ) following this week's memorial to the victims of the attack on the Quebec City mosque three years ago.
"Wednesday night I started doing it myself," Legault told reporters Friday. "I didn't like what I saw, honestly. And then I asked people, because I have to sleep, to continue the work. (I said) We have to manage and erase those messages as soon as possible."
Legault was unable to say exactly how many hate messages found their way into the comments section of his page which is open to the public and managed by him and his staff. Later, an aide confirmed to The Montreal Gazette it was "hundreds," and the staff was busy all night trying to keep up with the flood.
The aide said they decided to not remove Legault's initial message calling for tolerance - which is still posted - because it would appear the government was caving in.
"It would be like they win," an official said. "It's the risk you run when you post something. You can't really control social media."

"I think there are some cases, there are a few people that like to send those hate messages but still I don't think that it represents the Quebec people," Legault said.

Some power outages from violent storm will last into next week, Hydro-Québec says

Full text: Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until early next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left about 900,000 clients in the dark Friday.
The utility has more than 1,000 employees on the ground and is also hiring private companies and asking neighbouring jurisdictions for help.
But the damage is so widespread that it will take time to deal with downed power lines that have caused 2,000 power failures across the province, Éric Filion, president of Hydro's distribution division, told a press conference late Friday afternoon.
Starting late Thursday night, powerful winds snapped many trees, which in turn toppled power lines, Filion said. Many wooden electrical poles were also damaged.
He said Hydro doesn't know yet which areas of Quebec will get their power back first, in part because the storm continues in some parts of the province. The storm is moving east and more customers are expected to lose their power in the coming hours, he said.
Filion dismissed comparisons to the 1998 Ice Storm, when up to 1.4 million were without power at one point, with some not getting it back for weeks.
He said the main difference between that storm and the one that hit Montreal this week is that Hydro's steel transmission towers were not affected by the latest windstorm. That will make it easier to restore power, he said.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault held a news conference to reassure Quebecers that all steps are being taken to deal with the storm and power outages.
She confirmed one death: a man in Bromont, who was hit by a tree. "I want to offer my sympathy to the family of this man," Guilbault told reporters.
She indicated the government expects the intensity of the wind to drop overnight and flooding to start receding in most regions of Quebec, except the Eastern Townships.
"This is a big meteorological event hitting Quebec full bore," Guilbault said. "I ask people to be extremely prudent. If you can stay home, avoid leaving your home, avoid going on the roads. Let this storm pass. By tomorrow, everything should be stabilized in most regions in Quebec. Avoid unnecessary risks.
"I want to reassure everyone things are under control. All our public security and civil security teams are deployed and in contact with municipalities affected."
Earlier in the day, as Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million - a number that could represent as many as three million users.
Hydro-Québec says some Quebecers won't get their power back until early next week. 1,000 Hydro workers working on it but the damage is so widespread that it will take time to deal with all the broken equipmen, utility says. @mtlgazette( https://twitter.com/mtlgazette?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

As of 5 p.m., 897,595 customers were without power across Quebec.
Storm damage is affecting the commute for many Montrealers.
Many traffic lights are out and the Deux-Montagnes train service was down for part of the day. The Exo agency that runs the service said it brought in diesel trains to replace electric ones but was also dealing with debris on the line, delaying some departures.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro earlier in the day tried to manage customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 km/h that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene, we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."

The numbers backed up Hydro's claim( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ).
As of 3 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 280 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 115,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Québec reported that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island, west-end and central Montreal as wind-blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
There are more than 2,000 power failures across the province and workers have to visit each site, Hydro-Québec says. Many trees have cut many power lines and many hydro poles were toppled. But main transmission towers intact. @mtlgazette( https://twitter.com/mtlgazette?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Urgences-santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls, when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.
Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoit Garneau said the high winds had resulted in some unusual calls being answered.
Garneau said those calls included extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been literally blown out of his second-floor work area.
Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so, or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents not to use 911 to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. However, some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours was evident on streets and highways, and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Heavy rain warnings remained in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations were being carried out because of concerns the St. François River would flood), Rimouski, St-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.
The storm and power failures have had an impact on the political agenda: Guilbault announced the Coalition Avenir Québec general council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Quebec City has been cancelled so delegates can avoid travel and MNAs can stay in their ridings to help citizens.
"We want our MNAs to be in the field with citizens, given the situation," Guilbault said.

Full text: As Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear Friday that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million - a number that could represent as many as two to three million users.
As of 3 p.m., 980,140 customers were without power across Quebec.
Storm damage may affect the commute home for Montrealers. Many traffic lights are out and the Deux-Montagnes train service is down until at least 4:15 p.m.
[PERTURBATION] ??Due to strong winds, a power breakdown occurred on the Deux-Montagnes line. Service expected to resume not before 4:15 pm. For more info, click here : https://t.co/0efMDfMyBj( https://t.co/0efMDfMyBj )
- exo6 Deux-Montagnes (@exo6_DM) November 1, 2019( https://twitter.com/exo6_DM/status/1190356588499886080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
The good news: the worst of the storm appears to be over. Environment Canada lifted the wind warning for Montreal and surrounding areas at 3:40 p.m.
Hydro-Québec has scheduled a 4:30 p.m. press conference to provide an update on the outages and its efforts to restore power.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro earlier in the day tried to manage customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 km/h that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene, we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."
The numbers backed up Hydro's claim( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ).
As of 3 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 280 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 115,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Québec reported that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island, west-end and central Montreal as wind-blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
Urgences-santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls, when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.
Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoit Garneau said that while it was fortunate that no major injuries had been reported, the high winds had resulted in some unusual calls being answered.
Garneau said those calls included extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been literally blown out of his second-floor work area.
Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so, or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents not to use 911 to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. However, some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours was evident on streets and highways, and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Heavy rain warnings remained in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations were being carried out because of concerns the St. François River would flood), Rimouski, St-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

However some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Meanwhile, nearly 234,000 Hydro customers in the Montérégie region, which includes Montreal's South Shore, were in the dark as scores of isolated outages were reported from St-Lambert to Lac Mégantic.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours were evident on local streets and highways and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Commuters who left their cars at home also had to face an interruption of service on the Deux-Montagnes line, as a power failure brought trains to a halt. Service was not expected to be restored before 3 p.m. at the earliest.
The wind warning issued for the Montreal area remained in effect Friday morning.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )
As of 2 p.m.Hydro-Québec reported more than 55,000 customers in the Eastern Townships, 67,000 in the Chaudière-Appalaches region and more than 122,000 in the Laurentians were without power.
Heavy rain warnings remain in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations are being carried out because of concerns the Saint François river will flood), Rimouski, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 mms. of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15-25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. However they were obliged to take to social media by mid morning Friday to urge residents not to use the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight also allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau and Hochelaga Sts. However some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Meanwhile, nearly 234,000 Hydro customers in the Montérégie region, which includes Montreal's South Shore, were in the dark as scores of isolated outages were reported from St-Lambert to Lac Mégantic.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours were evident on local streets and highways and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Commuters who left their cars at home also had to face an interruption of service on the Deux-Montagnes line, as a power failure brought trains to a halt. Service was not expected to be restored before 3 p.m. at the earliest.
The wind warning issued for the Montreal area remained in effect Friday morning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), with Environment Canada predicting that "southwesterly winds will reach up to 100 kilometres per hour beginning this morning."
Those gusts have the potential to damage buildings and turn loose objects into projectiles.
As of 2 p.m.Hydro-Québec reported more than 55,000 customers in the Eastern Townships, 67,000 in the Chaudière-Appalaches region and more than 122,000 in the Laurentians were without power.
Heavy rain warnings remain in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations are being carried out because of concerns the Saint François river will flood), Rimouski, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 mms. of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15-25 cms. of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

Full text: As Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear Friday that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in one million, a number that could represent as many as two to three million users.
As of 1:30 p.m. a total of 907,845 customers were without power across Quebec.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro-Québec managed customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 kms./hr. that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."
The numbers backed up Hydro's claim.
As of 1:30 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 254 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 146,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Quebec reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island , west-end and central Montreal as wind blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.

The wind warning issued for the Montreal area remained in effect Friday morning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), with Environment Canada predicting that "southwesterly winds will reach up to 100 kilometres per hour beginning this morning."
Those gusts have the potential to damage buildings and turn loose objects into projectiles.
As of 12:15 p.m. Hydro-Québec reported more than 700,000 customers without power across the province, including 42,000 in the Eastern Townships and 37,000 in the Chaudière-Appalaches region and nearly 108,000 in the Laurentians.
Heavy rain warnings remain in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations are being carried out because of concerns the Saint François river will flood), Rimouski, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 mms. of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15-25 cms. of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Quebec rock icon Marjo poses with notorious Hells Angel at party( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-star-marjo-attends-party-poses-with-notorious-hells-member )
Marjo, a.k.a., Marjolène Morin - the former member of the wildly popular Quebec group Corbeau - has been out of the limelight for quite some time. Now 66, her last album release was in 2010, when she put out Marjo et ses hommes, Vol. 2. Her heyday with Corbeau dates back further, with her popularity peaking in the 1980s and '90s, beginning with the release of the hit Illégal in 1982. It is not surprising, given her lingering popularity, to see her pop up at events and posing with fans. More surprising, perhaps, is seeing her pose, arm in arm, thumbs raised and sporting a pronounced grin with a known member of the Hells Angels. The photo features Marjo clad in leather, sitting with Serge Lebrasseur, 55, a notorious member of the biker gang wearing, well, a Hells Angels T-shirt.
Allison Hanes: Have your say on Quebec's climate policy( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-have-your-say-on-quebecs-climate-policy )
The Quebec government wants to hear from citizens about the next steps in combatting the climate crisis. The Environment Ministry has launched an online public consultation seeking your input on everything from your transportation habits to your behaviour as consumers to your efforts to reduce waste. It asks what you are doing now, what more you are prepared to do, what the barriers are to stepping up action (including outright unwillingness) and how the government should proceed, be it via financial incentives, investments in infrastructure or building public awareness. So speak up loud and clear. You can find the survey here.( http://www.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/formulaires/consultations/PECC/index.asp?fbclid=IwAR1JGlCDEIr_agswhglFjn_nW7PXi8ZQMkuHFBMuKR_WmM0ZCoDgSSwxuh8 )
Why Quebecers prefer illegal pot over going to the cannabis store( https://montrealgazette.com/cannabis/why-quebecers-prefer-illegal-pot-rather-than-going-to-the-cannabis-store )
Cannabis has been legal for a year, but 82 per cent of what Quebecers smoked still came from the black market. Why were people going underground when they had a perfectly legal option? To find out, the Montreal Gazette spoke to four everyday pot smokers who buy on the sly. They listed fast home delivery, no lineups, anonymity and better prices among their reasons for taking the illegal route. Approximately 150 tons of cannabis was consumed in Quebec in 2017, according to SQDC president and director Jean-François Bergeron in a speech last week. Yet in its first year of operations, the Société québécoise du Cannabis has sold only 27 tons. That means 123 tons of weed were sold illegally here over the past 12 months, assuming those 2017 numbers from Statistics Canada hold. "If it's not SQDC, it's not legal," Bergeron said.
Angèle says there are long waits at legal pot stores, but her dealer arrives at her house within 30 minutes.
Montreal awards urgent contract to repair deteriorating water main( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/deteriorating-downtown-water-main-supplies-1-2-million-montrealers )
It supplies water to 1.2 million residents and five hospitals, and it's crumbling. One of the city's largest water mains is being replaced( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-water-main-repairs-will-clog-traffic-beside-ville-marie-tunnel ) in a rather dramatic way, with the city calling it an urgent repair job. Because of the urgency, the city asked and received an exception from the province's environment ministry to speed up the contract awarding process. "The worst scenario is that if we don't repair it, it will explode and that can cause a huge flood in the Ville-Marie tunnel and the Orange Line of the métro," Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday. The pipe was shut off on July 16 after a routine inspection found it had deteriorated much quicker than expected. Executive Committee vice-president Sylvain Ouellet said the water was diverted to three smaller pipes in the network, but that's only a temporary solution.
'Do the right thing': Climate rally puts pressure on federal leaders, voters
Time is running out for the students who gathered in Jarry Park Friday to call for action against climate change. It was the last day of student protests before voters across Canada elect a new government Monday. They want the next Parliament to be one that commits to drastic measures that will cut greenhouse gas emissions. But with the looming possibility of a minority Conservative or Liberal government, they say there's a sense that Canada will continue with a decidedly tepid approach to climate action. "This is one last push, one last reminder for voters to do the right thing," said Olivia Ruge, a student at Marianopolis College. "The next four years are crucial in deciding whether we want to take steps in the right direction or go back to the way things were."

Montreal climate march: 'We are the change,' Greta Thunberg tells throng

Full text: Led by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets of Montreal Friday, calling for action on climate change.
Organizers said close to 500,000 people took part, paralyzing downtown as they walked a four-kilometre route from Jeanne-Mance Park to Old Montreal.

At the end of the march, Thunberg, a slight 16-year-old whose activism has spurred millions around the world to join the fight against climate change, stood on a box to reach the microphone to be able to address the crowd.
She urged Montrealers to keep up the fight.
"Today we are millions striking and marching (around the world) and we will keep doing it until they listen," she told the cheering throng. "It should not be up to us, but somebody needs to do it. This is an emergency and we will not be bystanders.
"Some would say we are wasting lesson time, we say we are changing the world so that when we are older we will be able to look our children in the eyes and say we did everything that we could."

Thousands of elementary, high-school, CEGEP and university students joined the march, after schools across the city cancelled classes.
They carried signs that read "We're missing our lesson to teach you one" and "You're stealing our future" and "Your opinion is not a fact, science doesn't lie." People lined the streets, cheering as the marchers passed.
It was one of dozens of climate strikes taking place across Canada and around the world.
Thunberg was at the head of the march, with a group of Indigenous students carrying a banner that read "Au front pour la Terre Mère/To the front lines for Mother Earth."
In a speech peppered with French, Thunberg joked about the similarities between her home country and Canada - the cold winters, the moose, the hockey. But then her words became serious.
"You are a nation that is allegedly a climate leader; Sweden is also allegedly a climate leader," she said. "In both cases, it means absolutely nothing. In both cases, it's just empty words."
Thunberg, who began striking for climate action outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, said the fight against climate change will not stop until world leaders take the problem seriously.
And she dismissed naysayers who say young people can't make a difference.
"I think we have proven that to be wrong by now," Thunberg said. "The people have spoken. We are the change and change is coming."
Some of those who marched behind Thunberg said they were inspired by the activist, who has become a global icon.
"A few years ago, climate change wasn't on my radar at all but - just as Greta said - I started listening to the scientists and I've changed the way I live," said Hélène Audrit, a PhD student in neuropsychology.
"I'm a vegetarian now, I no longer own a car, it's hard not to take action when you realize how urgent the situation is."
Kahawi Jacobs, who came from Kahnawake, said she felt the power of the crowd.
"Respecting and preserving the Earth is just part of who we are," Jacobs said. "Just to be on our territory with so many people behind us, it's phenomenal."
After the march, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante welcomed Thunberg to city hall, where she was given the keys to the city.
"Greta represents all the youth pushing us, the adults, the leaders, the companies, to take our responsibilities," said Plante, who was among those who took to the streets on Friday.
Thunberg told the mayor she was "very overwhelmed" by the reception she received in Montreal.

Earlier, Thunberg met Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau privately. She said she asked him to act on "the current, most available science."
"Of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough," Thunberg told reporters later. "Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."
Climate activists have criticized Trudeau for his decision to buy the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.
While in Montreal Friday, Trudeau was targeted by a yelling anti-pipeline protester who called the prime minister a "climate criminal."
Later, during the march, several people yelled at Trudeau about pipelines, including one who attempted to throw eggs at him on Sherbrooke St. Police handcuffed the man and took him away.
The climate event was the latest in a series of Friday youth-organized climate marches this year, including one in March that attracted 150,000 people.
"We're the ones who will live the worst case scenarios predicted by science. Our resources are limited," Ève Grenier Houde of Fridays for Future, a youth climate group, said Friday. "We need support from our parents, teachers and elected officials."
Grenier Houde had a plea for Montreal's mayor, Quebec's premier and Canada's prime minister: "Madame Plante, Mr. Legault and Mr. Trudeau, it's your responsibility to ensure our future."
Legault did not attend the march, but posted a letter on Facebook Friday, telling Quebec's youth that he hears their plea for action.
A poll out this week indicated that climate change is tied with health care as the No. 1 issue among Quebec voters.

Mayor Valérie Plante is welcoming Thunberg to city hall.
She says she is giving her the keys to the city to thank her for coming to Montreal and for inspiring many people in the fight against climate change.
"Greta represents all the you who are pushing pushes us, the adults, the leaders, the companies, to take our responsibilities," Plante said.
In her opening remarks, the mayor reiterated that the city plans to reduce its carbon emissions by 55 per cent by 2030( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-addresses-un ) on its way to carbon neutrality by 2050.
Plante said 500,000 people took part in today's march.
5 p.m. A quick view of the crowds
4:25 p.m. 'We are the change and change is coming'
In a speech peppered with French, Greta Thunberg told Montreal marchers that the fight against climate change will not stop until world leaders take the problem seriously.
"We're at least 500,000 here today - you should be very proud of yourself," Thunberg said to cheers.
"We have done this together and I can't thank you enough for being here. It's just incredible to be united in such a way for a common cause. It just feels great, doesn't it?"
She said Canada shares some attributes with her native Sweden.
"You are a nation that is allegedly a climate leader. Sweden is also allegedly a climate leader," she said.
"In both cases it means absolutely nothing. In both cases, it's just empty words. We've told (elected officials) to unite behind the science but they didn't listen."
She urged Montreal marchers to keep up the fight.
"Today we are millions striking and marching and we will keep doing it until they listen," Thunberg said. "It should not be up to us, but somebody needs to do it.This is an emergency and we will not be bystanders.
"Some would say we are wasting lesson time, we say we are changing the world so that when we are older we will be able to look our children in the eyes and say we did everything that we could.
"We have been told so many times that there is no point in doing this, that we can't have an impact and make a difference. But I think we have proven that to be wrong by now. We are the change and change is coming.
3:40 p.m. Live feed
The Gazette's Jason Magder is near the stage, providing a live feed of speeches. Apologies if it breaks up; the network is spotty due to the number of people at the march.
Greta Thunberg is expected to speak.
Earlier, Jason spoke to some youth. Part of his story:
They came from far and wide to lend their voices to the cause and march for awareness( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-coverage-greta-thunberg-leads-climate-march-in-montreal ) of a climate crisis they feel powerless to prevent.
"When we finally realize what's happening, it will be too late," said Léona Dugas-Paquet, 10, who was marching with her mother. "We're very concerned because maybe when it's too late to save the planet, we'll still be around and that would be tragic."
Dugas-Paquet said she's inspired by 16-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg, who led the march and inspired a global movement. She joined the climate strike by joining the rally instead of going to class.
"She's really courageous to do what she's doing," Dugas-Paquet said. "You can say she's had a good influence."

3:30 p.m. Almost 500,000
There is no official crowd count but organizers are calling today's event historic, Jesse Feith reports.
"Earlier we spoke of the largest environmental march, but we can now forget environmental - it's the largest march of any kind in Quebec history," an organizer just told the crowd near the stage at the end of the march.
Later, the throng cheered when it was told that "close to half a million" people were taking part.
"Not only the largest march in history of Quebec, but the largest gathering for the climate of the whole week," an organizer said.
In March, in another youth-led climate march( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-lets-hope-our-childrens-concerns-dont-fall-on-deaf-ears ), 150,000 people took over Montreal's streets.
"Today we're nearly 500,000 people gathered in Montreal but there are also 52 protests across Quebec," organizer François Geoffroy said. "Behind these protests are simple and clear demands... It's a historic moment where, together, we're asking elected officials for concrete actions." Cédric Gray-Lehoux, youth spokesperson for the Assemblée des Premières Nations Québec-Labrador, said: "We're here, united as youth, to say we won't tolerate it anymore and change is coming."To those in positions of power, it's very simple (...) if we do not protect Mother Earth, Mother Earth will not protect us. No matter how much money or power you have, you cannot escape this reality."

12:25 p.m. Suzuki impressed with Thunberg
11:55 am. Trudeau reacts
From the Canadian Press:
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has thanked Greta Thunberg for mobilizing so many people, particularly young people, around climate change.
The Liberal leader was asked about his meeting with the 16-year-old activist during a news conference( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-promises-liberals-would-plant-2-billion-trees-to-fight-climate-change/wcm/78236962-a223-4bd8-8d3d-25af05af4aca ) in Montreal today.
Trudeau - who has faced criticism for his government's purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline project - says he agrees with Thunberg that Ottawa needs to do more for the environment.
He's made a series of announcements this week aimed at reducing emissions, protecting oceans and encouraging conservation.
From Reuters:
Trudeau is promising more climate action but has also had to defend his decision to buy and expand a major oil pipeline in western Canada.
"In my wonderful conversation with Greta this morning, we talked directly about the need to do more, much more. I thanked her for the amount of people that her call to action has mobilized," he told reporters after promising to plant 2 billion trees if re-elected.

The march is set to start at noon.

11:15 a.m. Thunberg on Trudeau, Indigenous youth, Montreal and Trump
Activist Greta Thunberg speaks at press conference prior to big climate march in Montreal Sept. 27, 2019.
Thunberg answered four questions from reporters.
She was asked about her meeting with Justin Trudeau this morning.
"My message to all the politicians around the world is the same, just listen and act on the current most available science. I try not to focus so much on individuals and rather focus on the whole picture because ... of course it's easier just to blame someone. And of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough. Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."
Why did she invite Indigenous youth to help lead the march?
"Indigenous people have for centuries and millenniums protected the local environment and of course we need to because they are often the ones who are being, who are at the front line, so we need to be able to hear their voices. So that's why I think it's so important that indigenous people lead this fight."
Why did she decide to come to Montreal?
"Why I decided to go to Montreal, because I was planning on where to go and of course, I want to go to Canada as well and I was invited to attend the march in Montreal. I thought why not? And I decided to go there because I think it's fun to visit lots of different places. Because this is not just one country, this is everyone. Also because I know Canada is striking on the 27th and the U.S. is striking on the 20th so that's why I sort of changed countries because diff countries strike on different dates.
"From Canada I have already seen today that the strikes have been very big and I think and I hope the rest of the strikes of Canada will be very big as well. I know you have elections now, and that is always a very busy time when I really want to understand what is going on. I expect that you as well as other countries take your responsibility and do your part from a global perspective."
Does she have a theory about why some political leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, mock her?
"Of course I don't know. I don't understand why grownups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead. I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests or whatever it is, is threatened by and we should take that as a compliment that we are having so much impact that people want to silence us, we've become too loud for people to handle, so they want to silence us. So we should also take that as a compliment."
10:45 a.m. Thunberg speaks
Greta Thunberg addresses the press conference. The Gazette Facebook page is covering Thunberg's press conference live.
Thunberg, who has been tweeting images of marches around the world this morning( https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg ), said:
"It's great to be here with you all in Canada. I'm looking very much forward to today. So today there's another global climate strike and it is very exciting to be see the pictures and the videos from all around then world and to hear from everyone who has been organizing the local strikes.
"The strikes have been very successful today. I think it's too early yet to have any official numbers but I guess we will have to see how many turned out.
"I'm very excited to be here and it's going to be very much fun today and to once again stand together, people from all around the world, for one common cause, that is very empowering. It is very moving to see everyone, everyone who is so passionate to march and strike, people of all ages, all generations.
"It's a very good day I would say."

9:45 a.m. Thunberg is on her way
It was unclear if Greta Thunberg was going to take part in this morning's press conference by march organizers. But they now confirm she will indeed be there. She'll make a statement and answer a few questions.
But she seems to be running late. Will arrive in an hour.
One of the organizers confirmed a report that Thunberg arrived in Montreal in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.
"We're all here for the same reason: We are sick and tired. Things must change.
Our voices as youth will not stop. We will be here, whether you like it or not, to make sure you hear our voices." - Cédric Gray-Lehoux#MarchePourLeClimat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarchePourLeClimat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #ClimateStrike( https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateStrike?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #FridaysForFuture( https://twitter.com/hashtag/FridaysForFuture?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Uq0kv1U04Y( https://t.co/Uq0kv1U04Y )

Gazette colleague Jesse Feith( https://twitter.com/JesseFeith ) is at the press conference. He writes:
François Geoffroy, spokesperson La Planète S'invite au Parlement (LPSP), opened the press conference.
"Nine months ago we launched a call, not just to march but to strike for the climate," Geoffroy said. "In 40 years, no government has presented a credible transition program. Our trust is running out, and so is our patience."
Ève Grenier Houde, from Fridays for Future, said: "We're the ones who will live the worst case scenarios predicted by science. Our resources are limited. We need support from our parents, teachers and elected officials."
She had a plea for Montreal's mayor, Quebec's premier and Canada's prime minister: "Madame Plante, Mr. Legault and Mr. Trudeau, it's your responsibility to ensure our future."
Dominic Champagne, spokesperson for the Pacte pour la transition: "The situation has not gotten any better since Earth Day in 2012. It's only gotten worse. But this movement will continue to grow until we reach a tipping point."
You can watch the press conference live( https://www.facebook.com/laplaneteauparlement/posts/554557248626500?__xts__[0]=68.ARBcGyNbBCOQIXAduQXGasrwFYVqZzM865KwJ8oYD3MdFJmPbkubpNnN7FHWALU7KybA418rRPsQovFyvULVpjLJWRERAdq_yhMVNo6Swj0bWrCOwpuPm5DlFXjSeUqvgN0G_-Le4MSY0o4Q3qQTIb5dAPzdXIGiKi0pScO5r_pb6YnxdvOII2D8_xWshNeCnLLZUObWntYZA2H1OD1ZkG0Bp_7hJRtrjQjEDs4bH7CKqpGiVVymimQlCgTYOakYfuDqie5F1PwLeIw9aZFW_LK-4gZcwAEPFv0L6nfkgHPwnQMLMD7XERujMOoypYUxKGM1amMH-YicQ5rmLlDVDNEejc9qf5YBQ4qOuLSz11XlmwHZeMCGbnufR1Wq9zbRG5Kl01Y8pmIkB_2dn1ytlW-91G2nayqpj783RnxXWUfDNfHukOdenJYlHv5fRCJXJFUhql5A5284JcHo-OmewRP5MCdiAHrv82MQMsTBoY1TE1zbGByfV67-sye5yn4&__tn__=-R ) on the Facebook page of La Planète s'invite au Parlement.
9:30 a.m. The premier says he's listening
Unlike politicians such as Valérie Plante, Justin Trudeau, Yves-François Blanchet and Elizabeth May, Quebec Premier François Legault decided not to participate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) in today's march, instead sending his environment minister, Benoit Charette.
But he posted a message on Facebook this morning, telling Quebec's youth that he hears their plea for action.
In reads, in part: "Do not be afraid of your beliefs and be proud of your passion. It is with great hope that I watch you walk for our future. And it is with a helping hand that I propose to help us build a more prosperous, greener and therefore more proud Quebec."
A poll out this week indicated that climate change is tied with health care as the number one issue( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) among Quebec voters.
9 a.m. The plan
Picture-perfect weather( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ), free transit( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-transit-free-in-and-around-montreal-on-friday-for-climate-march ) and Bixi bikes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ), tens of thousands of students( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/csdm-turns-sept-27-into-ped-day-for-climate-march ) and workers taking the day off to join, growing fears about the impact of climate change, and the presence of prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/acclaimed-teenage-environmental-activist-coming-to-montreal ).
You can see why some are expecting the youth-led march to be huge - even bigger than the one on March 15( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-lets-hope-our-childrens-concerns-dont-fall-on-deaf-ears ), when 150,000 university, CEGEP, high-school and primary students took over the city's streets. Some are predicting double that number will show up today. It could be the biggest ever climate event in Canada.
We'll know in a few hours. In the meantime, here's the schedule for the day.
9:30 a.m. Organizers hold press conference. It's unclear whether Thunberg will be there.
Noon. Four-kilometre march starts at the George-Étienne-Cartier-Monument( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monument+to+Sir+George-%C3%89tienne+Cartier/@45.5142452,-73.5896311,1383m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91a320b7b7cb1:0xd7b453760780c689!8m2!3d45.5142452!4d-73.5852537 ) on Park Ave. It is to end at Wellington St., near Nazareth St.( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+Wellington+%26+Rue+Nazareth,+Montr%C3%A9al,+QC/@45.4956082,-73.5594434,1128m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91af567769b9f:0xedac61585b5265bc!8m2!3d45.4957057!4d-73.5557907 )
5:30 p.m. Thunberg meets privately with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante at city hall.
6 p.m. At public event, Plante gives Thunberg keys to the city. A photo op is planned but Thunberg is not scheduled to speak.
Colleague Jesse Feith has more about what to expect( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ).

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was targeted by an anti-pipeline protester at a stop in Montreal on Friday.
Later, during the march, a protester attempted to throw an egg at Trudeau on Sherbrooke St., near Park Ave., Gazette colleague Frédéric Tomesco( https://twitter.com/ftomesco ) reports. Police handcuffed the man and took him away.

11:55 am. Trudeau reacts
From the Canadian Press:
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has thanked Greta Thunberg for mobilizing so many people, particularly young people, around climate change.
The Liberal leader was asked about his meeting with the 16-year-old activist during a news conference( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-promises-liberals-would-plant-2-billion-trees-to-fight-climate-change/wcm/78236962-a223-4bd8-8d3d-25af05af4aca ) in Montreal today.
Trudeau - who has faced criticism for his government's purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline project - says he agrees with Thunberg that Ottawa needs to do more for the environment.
He's made a series of announcements this week aimed at reducing emissions, protecting oceans and encouraging conservation.
From Reuters:
Trudeau is promising more climate action but has also had to defend his decision to buy and expand a major oil pipeline in western Canada.
"In my wonderful conversation with Greta this morning, we talked directly about the need to do more, much more. I thanked her for the amount of people that her call to action has mobilized," he told reporters after promising to plant 2 billion trees if re-elected.

11:15 a.m. Thunberg on Trudeau, Indigenous youth, Montreal and Trump
Activist Greta Thunberg speaks at press conference prior to big climate march in Montreal Sept. 27, 2019.
Thunberg answered four questions from reporters.
She was asked about her meeting with Justin Trudeau this morning.
"My message to all the politicians around the world is the same, just listen and act on the current most available science. I try not to focus so much on individuals and rather focus on the whole picture because ... of course it's easier just to blame someone. And of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough. Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."
Why did she invite Indigenous youth to help lead the march?
"Indigenous people have for centuries and millenniums protected the local environment and of course we need to because they are often the ones who are being, who are at the front line, so we need to be able to hear their voices. So that's why I think it's so important that indigenous people lead this fight."
Why did she decide to come to Montreal?
"Why I decided to go to Montreal, because I was planning on where to go and of course, I want to go to Canada as well and I was invited to attend the march in Montreal. I thought why not? And I decided to go there because I think it's fun to visit lots of different places. Because this is not just one country, this is everyone. Also because I know Canada is striking on the 27th and the U.S. is striking on the 20th so that's why I sort of changed countries because diff countries strike on different dates.
"From Canada I have already seen today that the strikes have been very big and I think and I hope the rest of the strikes of Canada will be very big as well. I know you have elections now, and that is always a very busy time when I really want to understand what is going on. I expect that you as well as other countries take your responsibility and do your part from a global perspective."
Does she have a theory about why some political leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, mock her?
"Of course I don't know. I don't understand why grownups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead. I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests or whatever it is, is threatened by and we should take that as a compliment that we are having so much impact that people want to silence us, we've become too loud for people to handle, so they want to silence us. So we should also take that as a compliment."
10:45 a.m. Thunberg speaks
Greta Thunberg addresses the press conference. The Gazette Facebook page is covering Thunberg's press conference live.
Thunberg, who has been tweeting images of marches around the world this morning( https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg ), said:
"It's great to be here with you all in Canada. I'm looking very much forward to today. So today there's another global climate strike and it is very exciting to be see the pictures and the videos from all around then world and to hear from everyone who has been organizing the local strikes.
"The strikes have been very successful today. I think it's too early yet to have any official numbers but I guess we will have to see how many turned out.
"I'm very excited to be here and it's going to be very much fun today and to once again stand together, people from all around the world, for one common cause, that is very empowering. It is very moving to see everyone, everyone who is so passionate to march and strike, people of all ages, all generations.
"It's a very good day I would say."

9:45 a.m. Thunberg is on her way
It was unclear if Greta Thunberg was going to take part in this morning's press conference by march organizers. But they now confirm she will indeed be there. She'll make a statement and answer a few questions.
But she seems to be running late. Will arrive in an hour.
One of the organizers confirmed a report that Thunberg arrived in Montreal in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.
"We're all here for the same reason: We are sick and tired. Things must change.
Our voices as youth will not stop. We will be here, whether you like it or not, to make sure you hear our voices." - Cédric Gray-Lehoux#MarchePourLeClimat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarchePourLeClimat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #ClimateStrike( https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateStrike?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #FridaysForFuture( https://twitter.com/hashtag/FridaysForFuture?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Uq0kv1U04Y( https://t.co/Uq0kv1U04Y )

Gazette colleague Jesse Feith( https://twitter.com/JesseFeith ) is at the press conference. He writes:
François Geoffroy, spokesperson La Planète S'invite au Parlement (LPSP), opened the press conference.
"Nine months ago we launched a call, not just to march but to strike for the climate," Geoffroy said. "In 40 years, no government has presented a credible transition program. Our trust is running out, and so is our patience."
Ève Grenier Houde, from Fridays for Future, said: "We're the ones who will live the worst case scenarios predicted by science. Our resources are limited. We need support from our parents, teachers and elected officials."
She had a plea for Montreal's mayor, Quebec's premier and Canada's prime minister: "Madame Plante, Mr. Legault and Mr. Trudeau, it's your responsibility to ensure our future."
Dominic Champagne, spokesperson for the Pacte pour la transition: "The situation has not gotten any better since Earth Day in 2012. It's only gotten worse. But this movement will continue to grow until we reach a tipping point."

9:30 a.m. The premier says he's listening
Unlike politicians such as Valérie Plante, Justin Trudeau, Yves-François Blanchet and Elizabeth May, Quebec Premier François Legault decided not to participate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) in today's march, instead sending his environment minister, Benoit Charette.
But he posted a message on Facebook this morning, telling Quebec's youth that he hears their plea for action.
In reads, in part: "Do not be afraid of your beliefs and be proud of your passion. It is with great hope that I watch you walk for our future. And it is with a helping hand that I propose to help us build a more prosperous, greener and therefore more proud Quebec."
A poll out this week indicated that climate change is tied with health care as the number one issue( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) among Quebec voters.
9 a.m. The plan
Picture-perfect weather( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ), free transit( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-transit-free-in-and-around-montreal-on-friday-for-climate-march ) and Bixi bikes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ), tens of thousands of students( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/csdm-turns-sept-27-into-ped-day-for-climate-march ) and workers taking the day off to join, growing fears about the impact of climate change, and the presence of prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/acclaimed-teenage-environmental-activist-coming-to-montreal ).
You can see why some are expecting the youth-led march to be huge - even bigger than the one on March 15( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-lets-hope-our-childrens-concerns-dont-fall-on-deaf-ears ), when 150,000 university, CEGEP, high-school and primary students took over the city's streets. Some are predicting double that number will show up today. It could be the biggest ever climate event in Canada.
We'll know in a few hours. In the meantime, here's the schedule for the day.
9:30 a.m. Organizers hold press conference. It's unclear whether Thunberg will be there.
Noon. Four-kilometre march starts at the George-Étienne-Cartier-Monument( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monument+to+Sir+George-%C3%89tienne+Cartier/@45.5142452,-73.5896311,1383m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91a320b7b7cb1:0xd7b453760780c689!8m2!3d45.5142452!4d-73.5852537 ) on Park Ave. It is to end at Wellington St., near Nazareth St.( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+Wellington+%26+Rue+Nazareth,+Montr%C3%A9al,+QC/@45.4956082,-73.5594434,1128m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91af567769b9f:0xedac61585b5265bc!8m2!3d45.4957057!4d-73.5557907 )
5:30 p.m. Thunberg meets privately with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante at city hall.
6 p.m. At public event, Plante gives Thunberg keys to the city. A photo op is planned but Thunberg is not scheduled to speak.
Colleague Jesse Feith has more about what to expect( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ).
Stay tuned. A team of Montreal Gazette reporters, columnists and photographers will be on the ground all day. Come back often; this post will be updated throughout the day.

A natural solution to periodic flooding

Full text: Re: "Quebec's flooding plan is misguided: hydrologist" (Montreal Gazette, July 26) and "Is the climate crisis solution in your backyard?" (Allison Hanes, July 23) The threat of periodic flooding along our riverbanks poses many problems.
Claude Marche, an engineer, offers one solution: He wants Quebec to support rebuilding in flood zones with the help of flood-proof construction techniques. That might be good for homeowners who have been flooded but maybe not so good for other taxpayers and certainly not good for the environment.
What the rivers need - what they had before reckless human interference - is abundant wetlands along their banks. These wetlands serve as natural sponges, absorbing excess runoff when it occurs. Such wetlands also provide vital habitat for threatened species and help clean pollutants from waters flowing into our rivers.
Instead of protecting only buildings, we need to protect and restore wetlands to create a livable environment for ourselves and other species.
The recent spike in flooding is due partly to climate change but is also facilitated by deforestation in the headwaters of the Ottawa River.
Old-growth forests were logged out in the 19th century, and secondary forests still provide huge quantities of lumber, plus pulp and paper, for export. Where forests are cleared, snow and rain become surface runoff, building to floods downstream. The roots of living forests instead help the soil hold more water.
Societies living off the unsustainable destruction of their natural capital will not flourish for long. We don't need better construction in our wetlands; we need more wetlands. Forests and wetlands must be protected and restored. Then we'll have healthy river systems, and periodic flooding will abate even in the face of climate change.
In fact, reforestation could help save us from global warming. As Allison Hanes reports, researchers at a Swiss university calculate that "increasing the planet's tree canopy by 25 per cent ... could eventually absorb as much as two-thirds of the carbon that has been spewed into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution."
Various industrial systems for pulling carbon out of the atmosphere have been suggested, but none has yet proven economical on a large scale, and any such system must consume energy that will primarily derive from fossil fuels, at least in the near future. A massive expansion of forests would give us massive sequestration of carbon in a process powered by photosynthesis.
Much of this continent was once covered in forests, and we need to take steps back in that direction. We need to ally ourselves with Mother Nature, not continue fighting against her.

CAQ more concerned with '450' than '514' area: Beaconsfield mayor

Full text: Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle says the provincial government's handling of its flood map roll out is an indication the West Island is not a priority for Premier François Legault and his Coalition Avenir Quebec government.
Bourelle is still frustrated with CAQ's handling of the newly revised flood map( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/quebec-flood-map-remains-inaccurate-say-west-island-mayors ) which still has more than 150 Beaconsfield homes within the government's special zone d'intervention spécial (ZIS) for floods.
The Quebec government's preliminary map, which came out in June, shows flood zones in Dorval. A revised version of the map was then released mid-July.
For those residents, located mostly on waterfront properties along Lake St. Louis, it puts a freeze on building, renovating or making major changes to their properties.
Although the city of Beaconsfield recently passed a resolution to "urgently reiterate its request to the Quebec government to exclude 152 homes erroneously included in the special planning zone for floods," Bourelle said the provincial government's handing of the file has left him dumbfounded.
"This whole thing is a comedy of errors," the mayor said. "The first map was absolutely atrocious. It was a total botched-up job. Then they come up with a second map, and you can't understand the logic of the second one. Because if you're going to remove 45 residences in Beaconsfield (from the map), why 45 and not all of them?
"We're either in the flood zone or we're not," he added. "There's no difference between the 45 and the others. So it's equally as botched-up. I don't think they know what they're doing, quite frankly."
Bourelle didn't hold back in his assessment of Quebec's bureaucracy.
"Everything that's happening is confirming my suspicion they have no idea what they're doing. They will not share with anybody their rationale, or how they did this, except that they took a plane and flew over. Well that's not a great way of identifying a flood zone."
Bourelle suggested the CAQ may be more interested in sorting out the problems of communities outside of Montreal, which supported the CAQ in the 2018 provincial election."For me to make that conclusion, I think, would not be the right thing to do. But my observation is they seemed to have addressed issues must faster in the 450 than they have in the 514. So based on that observation, you have to wonder why they're doing it.
"They (exempted) Ste-Marthe-sur-le-lac from the flood map. But Ste-Marthe-sur-le-lac was flooded. How can they go slow quickly and decide to remove Ste-Marthe-sur-le-lac, which is a CAQ area?"
He noted that Beaconsfield properties that still fall within the flood map did not flood in either 2017 or 1019.
Asked if it was just bureaucratic bungling or political overtones at play in the flood map, Bourelle replied: "Well, you have to wonder because why are they going about it the way they are?
"You have to wonder if they are more conscious about protecting areas more favourable to the CAQ than others?
"Mind you, having said that, it's no different, in a way, than the Liberals behaved when they're in power. They take for granted the West Island anyway. When the Liberals are there, they take for granted the West Island because (they always vote Liberal). So no issues are taken care of by the Liberals either because, what the hell, they're going to get their votes anyway."
"So we're in a helluva position in the West Island," added the mayor. "The Liberals take us for granted, the péquistes will never do anything for the West Island because they know they've written us off, and it looks like the CAQ is writing us off, as well. So, poor West Island."
Last Friday, Bourelle said he has written two letters to Andrée Laforest, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, but has not heard back. .
"I have written her two letters. Last one was 15(th) of July, asking for a meeting. I didn't hear boo from her. I would've expected, out of respect, for the minister to respond to my letters. That's a minimum. Or just a phone call . . . but nothing."
A political attaché for Laforest defended the province's handling of the file last week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/municipal-affairs-ministry-defends-new-quebec-flood-risk-map ). Alexandre Lambert told the Montreal Gazette that water levels on Lake St. Louis were "very high this year. Maybe there are areas in the West Island that were not touched, but there are sectors that are lying lower that were touched. We're working with the tools we have."
The province is still accepting requests for map revisions from residents until Aug. 19, before issuing a third and final map in September.
Meantime, Beaconsfield has also mandated a law firm to determine "legal options failing the withdrawal of the falsely identified properties in Beaconsfield."

Full text: A noted hydrologist is slamming the province's handling of recurrent flooding, saying it has the duty to better manage its water flow, rather than abandon those who have been flooded.
"People who live in flood zones are not culprits, and if they are flooded, it's not just their responsibility, but the responsibility of everyone," said Claude Marche, a retired engineer and hydrologist at the Université de Montréal.
The municipal affairs ministry recently published a map delineating a special intervention zone (SIZ) whereby those who live in that zone won't be covered for extreme damage to their home because of flooding, and instead will be eligible for up to $250,000 to abandon those homes.
Alexandre Lambert, a political attaché for Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, told the Montreal Gazette this week the government is trying to reduce the cost of compensating those affected by springtime floods.
"We have done a courageous thing to review the rules in the flooded areas, something that was not done during the 2017 flood," Lambert said, adding that because of all the development that has been permitted in at-risk areas, the province has doled out more than $1 billion to flood victims since 2011.
Marche, however, said the province should not be blaming those who built in flood-prone areas, but instead address the root causes of flooding. He wrote a report last October analyzing possible solutions to recurrent flooding in the wetland area of Val Morin, where he lives. He submitted it to the ministry of environment and asked that experts be called in to test out his theories.
He said he was ignored. In the wake of this past spring's flooding, Val Morin resident Bill Prickett - whose home is flooded every year - has also been trying to speak with officials at the municipal affairs ministry and the environment ministry to propose a project to try to limit the severity of flooding in their Laurentians town. If the project is successful, the pair envisions coming up with solutions to flood zones all across the province. Marche said there is nothing wrong with permitting people to live in flood-prone areas as long as the province puts in place measures to limit the damage caused by flooding.
"We're going to get more flooding as the climate changes, so we have to learn how to live with these changes," Marche said. "Every area needs its own unique solution."
Prickett said he believes the province has the responsibility to educate all those who live in floodrisk areas so they can make their homes flood-proof or resistant to floods. He said the province can also use landscape architecture techniques and draw inspiration from cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which are located below sea level but have put in place measures to manage rainwater and rising sea levels.
In Rotterdam, for example, a public square in the middle of the town acts as a retention basin and when sea levels rise, water is directed to the square.
"This is something that has never been done in Quebec," Prickett said. "We have to continue our research, and right now, we're being blocked because we have had no response from the province. We have 250 communities that are implicated, so it will take 250 different solutions.
"There are experts around the world who can work on the question of land use."
"Instead, the government is taking a totally populist take on this, saying 'these people are in flood zones, they're getting damage; we don't want to pay for them.' "But some of these houses have been there for 100 years."
In his case, Prickett's Val Morin home is located in a wetland and it floods every year, but his home is built in such a way to resist the annual rising water.
"I know that a few weeks every year, I'm going to have to get to my house by taking a canoe," Prickett said.
Marche said the province has to change its mentality because it's easier in the long run to invest in making these areas livable rather than paying every year to compensate those who are flooded.
"These properties have an enormous economic value, and if we are able to eliminate the nuisance of flooding, they will have an even greater economic value, so it is our duty to reclaim these properties," Marche said. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder

I suggest they use the only tool that counts: Have municipalities advise them of which zones flood and which don't, put that information together and issue the accurate results. Case closed.

Residents concerned over new flood map; Only have until Aug. 19 to flag errors

Full text: Tim Coochey's house was flooded in 2017, and he's still paying the price for what he calls government mistakes.
Coochey's Des Maçons St. home was included in a moratorium flooding map issued by the Quebec government this week.
The map delineates an area called the zone d'intervention spécial (ZIS), where all building and renovations must be halted, and homeowners affected by flooding in the future within that zone may not get compensation from the province.
"We were flooded because of (faulty) infrastructure, because the sewers backed up, not because of the river level," said the longtime Pierrefonds resident. "Now I'm told I'm in a flood zone and my nest egg is worth half of what I paid because of government errors? I'm sorry, but no."
Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis said the new map is causing major grief to anyone trying to build or renovate in the affected area, and that includes the borough, which is in the process of building a new municipal pool - a project that has now been halted.
"The reason (the Quebec government) did it quickly is they didn't want people to rush and get permits. So basically they closed the door until they figured it out," Beis told the Montreal Gazette this week.
"That's fine and dandy, but you didn't even consult me or anybody. I have (people) who've paid thousands of dollars to get to the permit stage. Now I have to stop everything." The map, as determined by aerial photography and satellite images, outlines areas that experienced flooding in 2017 and 2019.
It is an updated draft of a highly contested one issued last month, which showed thousands of homes in areas that were not affected by any flooding, now suddenly in the intervention zone - speculation being that cloud cover from the images created a false impression. Homeowners were permitted to contest the first map, and have until Aug. 19 to contest this version of the map. Another draft of the map will be issued in December.
Coochey said the new map appears to contain many errors, since it relies on aerial photographs, instead of using elevation levels to determine the risk of flooding.
"Something is obviously wrong with the map," he said. "If you look at the elevation levels of the areas now deemed to be in the flood zone, it makes no sense."
Klaus Bodnik agrees. His Roxboro home was also flooded in 2017, but in his case, too, it was groundwater that caused his basement to become submerged.
Bodnik sold his home in November and now lives in Île-Bizard. He said before the sale went through land surveyors evaluated the home and determined it to be located outside of the 100-year flooding zone. However, the province's map shows it to be located in the ZIS area.
"(The surveyors) evaluated the elevations of the whole property, and found out the property was above the 100-year level," Bodnik said.
Marie-Claude Nichols, the MNA for the Vaudreuil riding, which includes several of the areas affected by the two historic floods, slammed the government's approach to the flood map, saying it isn't properly consulting with citizens before drawing up maps that can dramatically affect property values, and the ability to renovate or build.
"There are a lot of people who are anxious, because there's a lot of incoherence on this map, and it's on the verge of incompetence," Nichols said. "We still have several people who weren't affected in either of the floods who find themselves on this map. People are angry, and they don't understand. I have heard from some people who have their homes for sale, and now they're not worth anything."
She said the government is moving too quickly to adopt a map, when it should be working with cities and towns to better determine the areas that are at risk.
"This government is acting all by itself," said Nichols, the opposition critic for municipal affairs. "Cities want to work with the government, and they are the ones who know the area and can say which areas were flooded. It should be the municipalities submitting their maps to the province, and the province making an overall map."
Making matters worse, Nichols said, people who are in the designated flood risk zone are not being told by the province, so every property owner has to consult the map online, and then send an email to the government by Aug. 19 to explain why they should not be included in the flood zone.
"We're in mid-July and people are on vacation, and they give people until Aug. 19," Nichols said. "This isn't a good way to work. No one is going to get a letter to their home notifying them about this."
Blair Feltmate, a professor at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at the University of Waterloo, said while there could be errors introduced in flood risk maps, people should not be surprised that when outdated flood maps are revised, many more homes are included in the area deemed at risk for floods.
"As a result of climate change, we are getting bigger storms with greater frequency, so the past weather is not an indication of the future," Feltmate said. "And over the course of the last 100 years, we have removed 60 to 80 per cent of the natural infrastructure that was here, and what was built tends to not absorb water well, and can affect flooding."
Nichols said she understands that principle, but the current draft has too many "incoherences."
"For example, the dam at Beauharnois is deemed to be located in the flood zone. That makes no sense at all," she said, adding that some areas located at the top of cliffs are also deemed to be at risk.
Bodnik said while the tools being used to create the flood map are debatable, he questions whether the government should be telling anyone they can't live in their homes, unless it purchases them outright for their fair market value.
"If people had the right to build in the past, they have the right to live there now," Bodnik said. "You can't take that away from somebody. The folks there built homes with permits granted by the community. The municipalities have been collecting taxes from these properties for all these years. You can't just tell people: 'Your property is worthless. Get out of here.'" jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Full text: The other day, I pulled out my Dad's old fedora to see what I looked like in a FBI agent Eliot Ness hat. It was then that I realized, in every generation, a guy's head size quadruples.
It teetered on the top of my head like the snow on Mount Fuji. I estimate by the year 2100, all men's noggins will be the size of Stewie's on Family Guy. (It might be something an agrochemical corporation is putting in the wheat.) By then, we will all walk hunched over and suffer severe spinal problems but not feel it because we will all be chewing cannabis gum. (Doctor's will tell us it is good for us.) Also, we will be wearing 100 gallon hats just to keep from getting sun stroke from global warming. (God knows, how low our cargo jeans will ride by then; they will probably drag a half a block behind us.)
It doesn't seem that long ago, men went from suits and fedoras to jeans and baseball caps (worse, worn backwards like you don't want nape burn.) just to go out to buy cigarettes - In those days, doctors recommended smokes as extremely beneficial for good digestion, and totally healthy for you. (Until it was disproven. You know, like one day we will wake up and realize cell phones have turned us into phosphorescent microwaved TV dinners that pick up FM stations in our collar bones.)
Where was I? Oh yeah. You look at all of those black and white photos - before colour was invented - and see all the guys wearing these cool Dick Tracy (for the benefit of Generation Now - a vice-president in the 1930s) hats while crowding Bonnie and Clyde's bullet riddled V8 Ford. (It was beige, but you couldn't tell by the picture.)
These days, you don't see many hats unless you go to Texas where even the cattle wear Stetsons. (Is felt a form of leather?) When is the last time you saw a lady wearing a pillbox or a Roaring Twenties Cloche at No Frills? Or a guy in a bowler like in The Avengers (the British detective duo not what you see at Comicon.)
I miss hats. How neat (pardon the foul language) would it be to see everyone expressing themselves with headdress designs like Pilgrim hats, Royal Guard bearskins, sombreros, coonskin caps, and beanies? (I liked the ones with propellers on top.) I admit, it would be hell watching a movie in a theatre.
I think politicians should be forced to wear hats appropriate to their stature: Dunce caps. I think people in bars should wear party hats to fit the mood; tougher bars should hand out flying-bottle-proof helmets.
You wonder why hats went out of fashion. (OK, only I wonder. You probably don't care.) Maybe hats don't look good on a Buddhist style head shave - a popular hair(less) trend these days. Actually, I used to wonder why people don't wear hats anymore until I recently bought a really expensive, beautiful fedora (size 1300) and proudly put it while walking along the river. A gust of wind immediately swooped it off my head and blew it all the way into the drink.
(Note to local boaters and fishermen: If you see my hat, can you please return it to me, care of the West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/category/news/local-news/west-island-gazette ). I am offering a generous reward, as there is no price too high when it comes to spiffy fashion.)
I miss my hat.

Flood map causing headaches as residents scramble to report errors

Full text: Tim Coochey's house was flooded in 2017, and he's still paying the price for what he calls government mistakes.
Coochey's Des Maçons St. home was included in a moratorium flooding map( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-releases-updated-map-of-flood-zones ) issued by the Quebec government this week. The map( https://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/zones-inond/ZIS-20190715/index.html )delineates an area called the zone d'intevention spécial (ZIS), where all building and renovations must be halted, and future homes affected by flooding within that zone may not get compensation from the province.
"We were flooded because of (faulty) infrastructure, because the sewers backed up, not because of the river level," said the longtime Pierrefonds resident. "Now I'm told I'm in a flood zone and my nest egg is worth half of what I paid because of government errors? I'm sorry, but no."
Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis said the new map is causing major grief to anyone trying to build or renovate in the affected area, and that includes the borough, which is in the process of building a new municipal pool - a project that has now been halted.
"The reason (the Quebec government) did it quickly is they didn't want people to rush and get permits. So basically they closed the door until they figured it out," Beistold the Montreal Gazette this week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-room-for-improvement-in-revised-flood-maps ). "That's fine and dandy, but you didn't even consult me or anybody. I have (people) who've paid thousands of dollars to get to the permit stage. Now I have to stop everything."
The proposed flood zone map can be found at http://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/zones-inond/carte-esri-czi/index.html( http://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/zones-inond/carte-esri-czi/index.html )
The map, as determined by aerial photography and satellite images, outlines areas that experienced flooding in 2017 and 2019. It is an updated draft of a highly contested one issued last month, which showed thousands of homes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/bureaucrats-booed-by-hostile-crowd-during-flood-map-consultation ) in areas that were not affected by any flooding, now suddenly in the intervention zone - speculation being that cloud cover from the images created a false impression. Homeowners were permitted to contest the first map, and have until Aug. 19 to contest this version of the map. Another draft of the map will be issued in December.
Coochey said the new map appears to contain many errors, since it relies on aerial photographs, instead of using elevation levels to determine the risk of flooding.
"Something is obviously wrong with the map," he said. "If you look at the elevation levels of the areas now deemed to be in the flood zone, it makes no sense."
Klaus Bodnik agrees. His Roxboro home was also flooded in 2017, but in his case too, it was groundwater that caused his basement to become submerged.
Bodnik sold his home in November and now lives in Île-Bizard. He said before the sale went through, land surveyors evaluated the home and determined it to be located outside of the 100-year flooding zone. However, the province's map shows it to be located in the ZIS area.
"(The surveyors) evaluated the elevations of the whole property, and found out the property was above the 100-year level," Bodnik said.
Marie-Claude Nichols, the MNA for the Vaudreuil riding, which includes several of the areas affected by the two historic floods, slammed the government's approach to the flood map, saying it isn't properly consulting with citizens before drawing up maps that can dramatically affect property values, and the ability to renovate or build.
"There are a lot of people who are anxious, because there's a lot of incoherence on this map, and it's on the verge of incompetence," Nichols said. "We still have several people who weren't affected in either of the floods who find themselves on this map. People are angry, and they don't understand. I have heard from some people who have their homes for sale, and now they're not worth anything."
She said the government is moving too quickly to adopt a map, when it should be working with cities and towns to better determine the areas that are at risk.
"This government is acting all by itself," said Nichols, the opposition critic for municipal affairs. "Cities want to work with the government, and they are the ones who know the area and can say which areas were flooded. It should be the municipalities submitting their maps to the province, and the province making an overall map."
Making matters worse, Nichols said, people who are in the designated flood risk zone are not being told by the province, so every property owner has to consult the map online, and then send an email to the government by Aug. 19 to explain why they should not be included in the flood zone.
"We're in mid-July and people are on vacation, and they give people until Aug. 19," Nichols said. "This isn't a good way to work. No one is going to get a letter to their home notifying them about this."
Blair Feltmate, a professor at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at the University of Waterloo, said while there could be errors introduced in flood risk maps, people should not be surprised that when outdated flood maps are revised, many more homes are included in the area deemed at risk for floods.
"As a result of climate change, we are getting bigger storms with greater frequency, so the past weather is not an indication of the future," Feltmate said. "And over the course of the last 100 years, we have removed 60 to 80 per cent of the natural infrastructure that was here, and what was built tends to not absorb water well, and can affect flooding."
Nichols said she understands that principle, but the current draft has too many "incoherences."
"For example, the dam at Beauharnois is deemed to be located in the flood zone. That makes no sense at all," she said, adding that some areas located at the top of cliffs are also deemed to be at risk.
Bodnik said while the tools being used to create the flood map is questionable, he questions whether the government should be telling anyone they can't live in their homes, unless it purchases them outright for their fair market value.
"If people had the right to build in the past, they have the right to live there now," Bodnik said. "You can't take that away from somebody. The folks there built homes with permits granted by the community. The municipalities have been collecting taxes from these properties for all these years. You can't just tell people: 'Your property is worthless. Get out of here.'"

Kramberger: Room for improvement in revised flood maps

Full text: While some inaccuracies were corrected for local municipalities along Lac St-Louis in the revised flood zone maps( http://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/zones-inond/zone-intervention-speciale.htm ) released by Quebec's Municipal Affairs Ministry on Monday, it's not all good news.
The mayors of Beaconsfield and Dorval are shocked sections of homes in their cities remain in a 20-year flood plain - although none of these residences were flooded in spring 2017 or 2019. Unless further changes are made, these homes will therefore be subjected to a special planning zone( https://www.mamh.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/inondations-printanieres-2019-zone-dintervention-speciale ) (SPZ) decreed by the province, which essentially places a freeze on any potential new construction or renovation projects. There are also concerns regarding home insurance and the resale value of these properties if they remain in a designated special flood zone.
Beaconsfield's Georges Bourelle and Dorval's Edgar Rouleau didn't mince words when speaking with the West Island Gazette. They both labelled the ongoing inaccuracies in the flood map as inept and incompetent work by provincial officials.
"They did some corrections, but it still doesn't make any sense," Rouleau said of including Dorval homes on the revised flood map. "We still have a lot houses in our territory that were never flooded before.
"I don't think they have any idea what they are doing," he added
The province ignored local civic officials and homeowners, who turned up en masse at a July 4 information meeting in Pointe-Claire and repeatedly pointed out that homes along Lac St-Louis were not flooded in spring 2017 or 2019, Rouleau said.
At least they removed the Dorval Gardens shopping centre( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/les-jardins-dorval-shopping-centre-has-been-sold ), located just southwest of the Highway 20/Dorval Circle interchange, from the second edition of the SPZ released Monday, Rouleau noted.
Bourelle said his city made its position clear in a resolution tabled last week, which demanded all 197 Beaconsfield homes included in the initial SPZ be removed from any revised food zone map.
"They removed some of the properties, but there remain several properties that were not flooded and are still on the map. That's extremely disappointing," he said.
For instance, the mayor noted all of the homes in the Thompson Point neighbourhood are still erroneously included in the SPZ, considering none of them were flooded in 2017 and 2019.
"What's the rationale being used here - know one knows," Bourelle said of the flood map. "Frankly, I think there is a lot of incompetence right now in this process."
In the provincial decree adopted for the SPZ, the city of Montreal is listed, but none of the reconstituted West Island municipalities, such as Beaconsfield, are named, although they are marked in the online flood zone, Bourelle pointed out.
Lac St-Louis is also governed by navigational rules, which control water flow from Lake Ontario to Montreal and prevents massive flooding, Bourelle said.
Beaconsfield and Dorval city councils will once again demand withdrawal of all homes in their respective territories from the SPZ.
Affected homeowners still have until Aug. 19 to request revisions.
The mayors suggested affected homeowners could consider launching a class-action lawsuit against the province if their properties remains on the SPZ despite not being flooded in 2017 and 2019.
Rouleau said he has lived near the lake in Dorval for many years and his home has never been flooded.
New building restrictions might be needed in areas hit hard by floods twice in the past three years. However, it's clear to me that the province dropped the ball preparing its SPZ by needlessly creating stress for West Island homeowners who didn't get touched at all by the recent spring floods.

Full text: Some municipal officials were relieved, while others were deluged with calls Tuesday after Quebec released an updated map showing areas at risk of flooding.
The map shows "special intervention zones"( https://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/zones-inond/ZIS-20190715/index.html ) that affect 783 Quebec municipalities, 30 less than a previous map released last month. The at-risk zones in the revamped map, the result of public consultations with more than 5,600 people, aerial photographs and field surveys, are coloured in purple.
The purple areas cover less ground in the new map than the previous map, but at-risk zones in West Quebec still cover swaths of land on the Ottawa River from the Ontario-Quebec border near Hawkesbury in the east to L'Isle-Aux-Allumettes, near Pembroke, as well as much of the Gatineau River almost as far north as Low.
According to the decree released on the Gazette Officielle du Québec, rebuilding homes or building new ones in the areas destroyed by a flood in 2017 or 2019 will not be permitted. Residences can only be rebuilt where damage does not exceed 50 per cent of the new cost, which will be determined by municipalities.
There are 1,036 properties with buildings in the Gatineau portion of the map, said Coun. Myriam Nadeau, who represents the Pointe-Gatineau district, the most heavily affected by flooding. There are another 1,818 Gatineau properties without buildings on the map.
Nadeau said about a half-dozen homes in her ward that were in the previous map are not on the new map, thanks to topographic information the city of Gatineau provided to the province.
"I'm happy that the new decree took into account the expertise of the city of Gatineau," she said. "I'm not saying there may not be some further adjustments."
Municipalities have been scrambling not only with the aftermath of this year's flooding, but to also respond to residents who say their homes or cottages are in areas that have never been flooded - and want a reassessment.
"It's definitely added to the pressure we've had since the beginning of the flood," said Nadeau. "It takes away some of the manpower to do other things."
In April, Quebec Premier François Legault announced that Quebec will offer a lifetime maximum of $100,000 to any home damaged by flooding. The alternative for homeowners is to accept $200,000 to move and allow their home to be demolished.
Nadeau said 89 homes have already been demolished in Pointe-Gatineau because of the 2017 flooding. It's unclear how many will be demolished due to this year's flood.
Yann Jodoin has owned a rental property on Boulevard Hurtubise, across the street from the water side, since 2012. The house was damaged in the 2017 flood, and he spent about $85,000 to renovate it, with about half of that covered by provincial compensation. The house was damaged by floods again in May.
"This time we said we're not doing anything. It's not that we're giving up, but the program changed," said Jodoin, who may also qualify for $50,000 for the land.
"If we lose the rental, the bank won't come after us. And we're not stuck with a worthless piece of land," he said. "I have no feelings for the house. It was just an investment. It's my house, it's not my home."
But Jodoin also reflects that if many property owners walk away, municipalities will have to contend with reduced tax revenue and empty lots. "It's going to be weird. I don't know how they'll manage all those empty lots."
Joanne Labadie, mayor of Pontiac, which includes 47 kilometres of Ottawa River waterfront west of Gatineau, said one piece of land Pontiac requested for reconsideration is off the new map. However, there are three other areas - including a portion of the village of Quyon - that have never been flooded and remain on the map.
The municipality has about 6,000 permanent residents and between 300 and 250 cottages. After the 2017 flood, Pontiac lost 29 permanent residents and "countless" cottagers, she said. "We have no way to follow up on which cottages have been abandoned. It's just a matter of time before they collapse, or they are seized for non-payment of taxes."
The municipality had to raise taxes and implement an unpopular business tax. The loss of cottagers is a loss to the local economy, said Labadie.
"Local businesses count on cottagers. Rural municipalities depend on taxes."
Labadie points out that in order for full-time resident to get $200,000 for their house and $50,000 for their land, the property has to sustain 50 per cent damage. "If you have a $700,000 house, $200,000 is not enough to motivate you to leave."
This is why she fears the next flood. People who have no security or insurance will risk their lives and the lives of first responders to save their homes, she said. "We just don't have the budget to help them. They (the province) are downloading the problem on municipalities."
Winston Sunstrum, mayor of L'Isle-Aux-Allumettes, a 230-square-kilometre island on the Ottawa River, said he was deluged with calls Tuesday morning after the new map was released.
"There are still a lot of errors on the new map," he said. "Sections of our municipality that didn't flood in 2017 or 2019 are still on the map. The phone has been ringing off the wall."
Quebec will release another map in December. Residents have until Aug. 19 to recommend further modifications( https://www.mamh.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/publications/ministere/inondations_printanieres_2019/formulaire_zis.pdf ) to the map. When Legault announced his flooding action plan, he said his team has two mandates - to ensure that compensation happens quicker and to prepare municipalities for the 2020 round of floods.
But Sunstrum believes the entire process has been rushed. His municipality, which has 1,400 permanent residents and about 2,000 cottagers, has only two employees who are qualified to make assessments for the province in response to appeals for modifications. Waterfront properties account for almost two-thirds of tax assessment.
"The 2017 flood had an impact on so many properties. The 2019 flood added more properties. This flood zone (map) added a whole lot more properties," he said.
Tim Wilkinson has owned a cottage on the island for the past 10 years and still has a mortgage on the property. He fears he won't be able to sell his property or even do regular maintenance. As a cottage owner, he doesn't qualify for a buyout because it's not a primary residence.
"I have to continue to pay for a property that I can't sell," he said. "I am so stressed out. I lost 14 pounds, and I can't sleep at night."

Schukov: Sign, sign, everywhere a sign controversy

Full text: Remember the song?
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?
It was a top 40 (Why was it always 40 and not a nice round 50?) hit in 1971 by a Canadian( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada ) rock( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music ) group Five Man Electrical Band( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Man_Electrical_Band ). Seems, in Quebec, tolerance for expressive signage (advertising or not) has gone the way of religious symbols. Actually, in this kitchen-cooking province (last I checked, it was not a sovereign state but acts like one) of Canada where the pot continues to over-boil, tolerance is at a premium. As news bits on signage go, Seinfeld might say, "That's a giant matzo ball out there."
Chumming for trolls, I submit two recent West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/category/news/local-news/west-island-gazette ) stories:
The Hub Hardware store in Beaconsfield runs afoul of sign bylaw:
The iconic store in Beaurepaire Village removed a 71-year-old store sign after contravening a (2012) city bylaw; John Meagher, West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/the-hub-hardware-store-in-beaconsfield-runs-afoul-of-sign-bylaw ); June 12, 2019. Quote: Local businesses are allowed two exterior signs, and The Hub had exceeded the limit with seven:
What difference does any number of signs make? It's called ADVERTISING. The whole anal argument stems from the default insistence of "maintaining the character of the village." Grabbing that donkey tail, I wonder, how many bill boards on our highways is not too much and how does even one Godzillian Buffalo jeans sign off Highway 20 maintain the character of a ...uh... road? And by the way, a 71-year-old sign IS part of the village's character. (Whereas it's okay to have Coke and Pepsi flashed everywhere.)
Homestyle Bakery owner in legal spat with city of Beaconsfield:
Bob Simotas, outside his bakery and pub, said the city of Beaconsfield informed him that some of his signs don't comply with certain bylaws.
Quote: Owner says doing business in Beaconsfield is frustrating because he is often embroiled in legal snafus with city officials. John Meagher, West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/homestyle-bakery-owner-in-legal-spat-with-city-of-beaconsfield ); June 26, 2019.
It would seem this sort of West Island by-law takes its zero-wiggle-room cue from the OFL.
I don't know if any other municipalities have any signage bylaws with anything that smells as bad as that of Beaconistan's but doesn't its City Hall have bigger fish to fry? (Maybe, on all counts, but doing research beyond shovelling my two cents - which today is rounded off to zilch - makes my head hurt.) I know Pointe-Claire doesn't mind you putting out a sign like a For Sale or a welcome flag as long as you pay them a permit fee. (Do Halloween and Christmas decorations count as signs if they have words on them? And as a tax bonus is there any carbon footprint associated with any of this?)
As for the fiefdom of B, I ask, "How many signs (including events mini-posters) is it okay to post on the front window of a dépanneur? Some of them look more decorated than a Mexican bus.
People for the most part have accepted the whole ridiculous government affliction with squashing the human right to post self-expression (commercial or not.) In fact, Quebec is still a laughing point to outsiders when it comes to Bill 101, a law that says you can't use one of Canada's two official languages (if some Canadian tax payer wishes to do so) on a sign. Last I checked, Quebec is still part of We the North. So to those lawmakers both big and small (minded), when it comes to the quality and quantity of signage: Grow up.
(This space reserved for trolls and Beaconistan legislators.)

History Through Our Eyes: July 14, 1987, flooding on the Décarie

Full text: On the afternoon of July 14, 1987, a trio of violent thunderstorms hit the Montreal region. A total of 55 millimetres of rain fell within a five-hour period, as well as some hail. Hydro-Québec declared a state of emergency as more than 300,000 customers across the island lost power. Most of the métro was shut down after tunnels flooded. Countless basements were flooded too, as sewers backed up. One motorist lost his life when his car got stuck in a flooded underpass on Beauharnois St. under Highway 15.
There were no fatalities when the trench-like Décarie Expressway flooded, but the scene was nonetheless dramatic, as shown in this photo by Pierre Obendrauf, which was published the following day in the Montreal Gazette, along with extensive coverage.
"All that could be seen of some cars trapped on the expressway just north of Plamondon Ave. was the roof - just barely," we reported. The water was 3.5 metres deep at its deepest point, near Ferrier St., we said.
Many motorists escaped their cars by squeezing through windows: "They huddled on rooftops and swam to the safety of highway medians, waiting for the flood to subside or rescuers to reach them," we reported. Firefighters spent more than two hours evacuating trapped motorists. More than 200 people in 75 cars were forced to abandon their vehicles, we wrote.
One woman we quoted said she had been terrified and felt like she was in a horror movie. But a firefighter told us that some others were laughing, and that "one fellow even went swimming in the dirty water for the fun of it."

Tomkinson: Fear fuelled attendance at Vaudreuil-Soulanges flood map consultation

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/tomkinson-fear-fuelled-attendance-at-vaudreuil/docview/2255287256/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: When new flood zone maps( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/preliminary-flood-zone-map-is-ridiculous-dorval-mayor-says ) were released by the Quebec government this summer, shock rippled through waterfront communities throughout the province.
Areas apparently now considered to be at risk of flooding included not only those which were flooded in 2017 and 2019, and properties below the zero- to 20-year flood line, but also many properties that were not even within the 100-year flood zone. In Pointe-Claire alone, the mayor said there were 265 properties that had never been affected by flooding that were marked in red on that map.
Not surprisingly, homeowners - and municipal governments - panicked. The new flood zones, supposedly calculated based on aerial photography and satellite images, seemed as arbitrary as if someone's toddler traced the shoreline with mommy's lipstick.
Public consultations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/bureaucrats-booed-by-hostile-crowd-during-flood-map-consultation ) were held last Thursday in 25 locations across the province on the same day and time. Fear fuelled attendance.
At the session for Off-Islanders at the Château Vaudreuil on Thursday, so many upset homeowners turned up that people were turned away. The line of parked cars stretched from the hotel's jam-packed parking lot back to the nearest highway exit, on both sides of the road. Those I spoke with said they didn't know if they even needed to be there, but they feared what might happen if they didn't show up to find out.
The new map matters. Owning a home in a flood zone is no joke. Those coloured by the lipstick-like lines may have to put their dream homes on hold indefinitely. Others may have difficulty finding insurance (or have to pay more for the privilege of coverage). Still more may have trouble selling, or find themselves fielding insultingly low offers as investors circle vulturelike, hoping for a deal. According to the latest statistics from the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers Vaudreuil-Soulanges is the only area in Greater Montreal where sales volume decreased in June, with sales decreasing by 11 per cent following this year's floods.
It's clear that after suffering two "once in a lifetime" floods in the last three years that our flood maps need to be revised. But it has to be done responsibly, and respectfully.
At the meeting, bureaucrats clarified that the red zone on those infamous maps marking the "ZIS" (zone d'intervention spéciale) was intended to identify areas that were affected by flooding in 2017 and/or 2019. Those properties face a moratorium on new development, as well as on reconstruction or renovations greater than 50 per cent the value of the home. Those whose properties are marked in the red zone but were not affected by those floods were asked to email zis2019@mamh.gouv.qc.ca( https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=zis2019@mamh.gouv.qc.ca ) to ask for an exemption. The deadline to submit comments or request corrections to the map is Aug. 19.
As several people pointed out at the public information session in Vaudreuil-Dorion, it will take an army of bureaucrats to process the avalanche of exemption requests that are sure to follow this debacle. Meanwhile, homeowners who were ready to build, renovate or rebuild are in limbo.
They deserve better.

Full text: Residents across the West Island and Off-Island in the past year or so have taken up causes to block developments or replacement projects. Some succeeded in their goals, other decisions favoured the promoter, and some contentious sites remain a battleground.
In Pincourt( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/off-island-gazette/pincourt-citizens-ramp-up-fight-to-preserve-shrinking-green-space ), activists held a concert last Saturday to help defray fees for legal advice or for environmental studies to back up their opposition to a proposed housing project in an area dubbed the Rousseau Forest. They consider the area to be a wetland and green space. What's problematic is that the site is privately owned and has been zoned for development since the 1950s. Whether or not they successfully lobby Pincourt city council to reconsider accepting a potential housing project, you have to give these activists credit for being creative in sourcing financial backing from the community. Meanwhile, the city is planning to base its decision on a report it has commissioned. I wonder how the sparks will fly if the city's report suggests it's OK to green-light the housing project?
In Pointe-Claire, three contentious projects recently considered by city council led to confrontational debates: the redevelopment of the Pioneer bar site, the Walton Ave. strip mall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-city-council-overturns-demo-committees-walton-decision ) and a community hall project for the local Coptic church( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/opponents-to-church-expansion-concerned-by-halls-commercial-license ). Although the city has given its approval for the church hall and the Pioneer( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/citizens-group-takes-legal-action-to-save-pioneer-bar-from-demolition ) projects, court challenges launched by citizens are pending.
In the coming years, Pointe-Claire will probably have to deal with a major residential-commercial development near the future REM station being built just west of Fairview shopping centre. The mall's owner, Cadillac Fairview, announced( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/bold-vision-for-redevelopment-of-land-near-fairview-mall ) that it has partnered with Ivanhoe Cambridge to realize such a project. Without a doubt, environmentalists will pack city hall once a project is formally proposed and a request is made for a building permit.
Some Pointe-Claire residents are also petitioning against a replacement project on their street for a single-family home. The spacious lot holds a small home built in the 1940s. It will be bulldozed in favour of a larger, modern home. There are a dozen similar examples currently posted on Pointe-Claire's online demolition committee information page( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/demolition-committee/ ).
In Dorval, the city made a valiant attempt last year to buy the McConnell Woods, located along the waterfront, but the offer was rejected. The land was later sold to a promoter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/mcconnell-woods-to-transform-into-royal-quai-luxury-development ) proposing to build about 30 luxury homes.
However, a portion of the land is in a flood zone. So should residents who signed a petition against the development now still hope all the land will be transformed into a public green space?
"No," Dorval Mayor Edgar Rouleau told the West Island Gazette, adding that the McConnell Woods project will proceed as planned.
It's commendable that residents stand up for what they believe is best for their community. It's certainly preferable over total apathy or not paying enough attention to what elected officials are approving until it's too late.
It's interesting to note that residents are often more upset about the prospect of a project blocking their view than anything else. And when citizens are unhappy, the not-in-backyard approach remains a popular go-to.
No matter how transparent a West Island municipality is about a project being considered, there is still most often backlash or calls for revisions, whether for condominiums or townhouses.
Citizens airing their grievances can, at times, become frustrated, especially when elected officials share a difference of opinion. However, the discourse should remain respectful. Some of the exchanges at public meetings are becoming increasingly toxic. Is that a good look for the West Island?

Pop prodigy Billie Eilish has rocketed to worldwide stardom

Full text: Billie Eilish is everywhere.
Since the release of her 2016 debut single Ocean Eyes, the 17-year-old pop prodigy has collected 26 million followers on Instagram, accumulated 48 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and topped the charts in 15 countries. Her music videos for her hits Bad Guy, Bellyache, Lovely and When the Party's Over have amassed 200 million views - each.
In the next few months, she is expected to perform nearly 40 concerts to promote her album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which sold 313,000 units in its first week.
But on Wednesday night, Eilish was in Laval, performing to 9,500 fans at Place Bell. To better understand the hype surrounding the pop singer's meteoric rise to fame, the Montreal Gazette spoke to Eilish's legion of followers who lined up outside the venue.

Who is Billie Eilish?
"Billie Eilish is my religion," said 19-year-old Emma Belmont, decked out in baggy electric-blue clothes designed to emulate the singer's anti-pop star aesthetic. "I would do anything for her."
Billie Eilish is different things to different people. To longtime fan Jana Bedjaoui, she's "a role model." To Shanaya Smith - who only discovered Eilish's music this year - she's "a girl everyone can relate to." According to the New York Times, Eilish is "the future of pop."
Regardless of what she is labelled as, one things is certain; there is no definitive way to classify this Los Angeles native who, through a short SoundCloud upload in 2015, was catapulted to stardom almost overnight.

What makes Eilish different?
Eilish's singularity is perhaps most evident in her music videos, which contain imagery that can be considered downright haunting.
Spiders crawl across her face in the video for You Should See Me in a Crown and, in Bury a Friend, she is stabbed repeatedly amid flickering lights. Also, in When the Party's Over, jet-black goo oozes out of her eye sockets as she laments how "nothing is better sometimes." This is a far cry from the visuals of traditional pop stars like Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.
"Most artists make an effort to look good in their music videos," says Patricia Balla. "But Billie is authentic, and that's why she's revolutionizing pop music."

What genre is her music?
Eilish's music falls in a category recently paved by starlets like Lorde and Lana Del Rey - traditional pop tinged with melancholy. While many of her songs are catchy and upbeat, in interviews and live performances, her downcast eyes and bored facial expressions hint at some greater sorrow lying below the surface of the infectious gloss. For some fans, this makes the music all the more relatable.
"Billie is one of the only artists that knows what I'm feeling before I do," said Julia Prud'homme, one of the first fans to make it through the doors of Place Bell.
To reflect the angst-ridden lyrical content, Eilish's songs are riddled with eerie sound effects, manipulated pitch, and unstable beats. On Bury a Friend, she samples the sounds of breaking glass, an oven timer, and the drill she recorded during a visit to the dentist. Meanwhile, heavy rain and police sirens enhance the themes of depression and mental health present on the soft ballad Before I Go.

What tracks would fans recommend?
With an EP and LP under her belt, there are no shortage of songs to choose from. Still, at Place Bell, most fans seemed to agree that there is one song that best embodies the star's style and artistry - Bury a Friend. An ode to sleep paralysis, the track finds Eilish taking on the perspective of the monster under her bed. Eilish herself has said that this is the track that inspired the themes of her debut album.
"Bury a Friend is creepy, but it's also captivating," said 22-year-old Cassandra Lee. "It's the song that got me hooked."
Many fans also pointed to Bad Guy, the album-opener where Eilish playfully announces that she's the type to "make your momma sad" and "make your girlfriend mad."
"Bad Guy tells you everything you need to know about Billie Eilish," said 17-year-old Stéphanie Houde, while preparing to enter the venue for what she deemed would surely be "the best night of my life."

Full text: "I just love Hudson in springtime," mused a joyful Clint Ward recently. "Here we are, barely into June and, already everything is in bloom, and that includes the arts. Everything is ready."
Ward is a longtime volunteer whose grasp of the local scene is as firm as anyone I know. The other day, he and I were sharing BLTs at the Carousel lunch counter in the centre of town where, between bites, Ward was also flipping through a makeshift listing of up-coming arts and cultural events and commenting on what a wonderful adventure we had awaiting us.
On Thursday, June 6, everything begins for real. That's whenArts Alive! Hudson( https://www.villagetheatre.ca/events/arts-alive-2019/ )launches its fourth consecutive community spring festival. Over the next week our town will be buzzing as a broad variety of arts and cultural groupings step up to show their stuff.
The extravaganza begins Thursday night with Hidden Gems, local musicians and friends bringing their open-ended program to the Village Theatre stage. Fee: $20, proceeds to Red Cross flood relief initiative.
As Friday is Movie Day, our local film society has selected Wild Rose, a stunning off-shoot product of Scottish cinema. This beautifully crafted motion-picture tells the story of a young Scottish lass - a single-mother who calls herself Rose-Lynn - who is determined to make it in Nashville as a country music star.

Full text: "I just love Hudson in springtime," mused a joyful Clint Ward recently. "Here we are, barely into June and, already everything is in bloom, and that includes the arts. Everything is ready."
Ward is a longtime volunteer whose grasp of the local scene is as firm as anyone I know. The other day, he and I were sharing BLTs at the Carousel lunch counter in the centre of town where, between bites, Ward was also flipping through a makeshift listing of up-coming arts and cultural events and commenting on what a wonderful adventure we had awaiting us.
On Thursday, June 6, everything begins for real. That's whenArts Alive! Hudson( https://www.villagetheatre.ca/events/arts-alive-2019/ )launches its fourth consecutive community spring festival. Over the next week our town will be buzzing as a broad variety of arts and cultural groupings step up to show their stuff.
The extravaganza begins Thursday night with Hidden Gems, local musicians and friends bringing their open-ended program to the Village Theatre stage. Fee: $20, proceeds to Red Cross flood relief initiative.
As Friday is Movie Day, our local film society has selected Wild Rose, a stunning off-shoot product of Scottish cinema. This beautifully crafted motion-picture tells the story of a young Scottish lass - a single-mother who calls herself Rose-Lynn - who is determined to make it in Nashville as a country music star. Variety calls it a "richly, stirring human story," and describes the lead, Jessie Buckley's performance as bearing "an incandescent star-is-born glow." Tickets $15; Screenings at 2 and 8 p.m.
The weekend offers a potpourri of everything from "wrapping cloths" at Gallery Plus with the Hudson Crafts Group on Saturday 10 a.m.; to a 2 p.m. Hudson Players Club reading of a Chris Gobeil play-in-progress entitled For the Love of Shakespeare at Village Theatre; to a 4 p.m. gathering back at Gallery Plus in time for Hudson author David Langlois' launch of his new book, Courage and Innovation, an in-depth study of the men and women who created Canada's Airport Authorities.

Full text: Montreal Gazette columnist Don Macpherson compared Quebecor to Fox News( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/macpherson-quebecs-fox-news-only-bigger ) in a recent column. I could not disagree more. It's hard for me to stay silent, especially for my colleagues. In my years with Le Journal de Montréal, which is owned by Quebecor, never did I feel I was working for a shrill, populist, conspiracy-loving media outlet à la Fox.
Now, full disclosure.
I worked with Mr. Péladeau père when I ran enRoute, then published by Quebecor. I was a friend of his eldest daughter Isabelle, who died in a car accident in 2013, and gave a eulogy at her funeral. I am also close to estranged sister Anne-Marie and to her daughter Marie-Pierre.
As for Pierre Karl Péladeau, he is the prototype of an inspired and engaged media owner, but the editorial freedom I enjoy as a columnist at Le Journal remains unsurpassed compared with other large media conglomerates I worked for in the past.
When PKP became leader of the Parti Québécois, I wrote about the conflicts of interests he faced as owner of the largest media company in Quebec.
One morning, I bumped into him in the Maison de Radio-Canada. "You don't spare me, do you?" he said. "Why should I?" I replied. He laughed.
More importantly, Quebecor does not employ ideologues as nauseating as Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson or Lou Dobbs of Fox News. Nor are TVA, LCN or Le Journal right-wing propaganda machines.
Anyone who accuses Quebecor's columnist Richard Martineau of "islamophobia" has never read his work properly. He goes after political Islam, or Islamism. Not ordinary Muslims.
Briefly explained, Islamism works toward the implementation of sharia law. (Islamists tried but failed, thanks to the efforts of Quebec's Morocco-born Fatima Houda-Pepin, then a Liberal MNA, to establish Canadian sharia family courts.) Some Islamists are violent, others denounce violence; sadly many instrumentalize democracy and our human rights laws to suit the needs of their politico-religious agenda.
Those most at risk from Islamists in Canada are non-religious Muslims, especially women. But journalists who cover this beat often remain silent while young girls are kidnapped by their families to be married abroad, become someone's fourth wife thanks to imams who think our laws are naff, or undergo female genital mutilation, because they don't want to be seen as islamophobic.
Not me. I will write. I will growl. I will denounce. I may bite.
I examined Le Journal's cover stories online on a recent Sunday. Nothing there qualified as populist: "No more grades inflation in schools;" "Sexual predator on the loose in Tétreaultville;" "Flooded without living in a flood zone;" "Hydro-Québec's management of its dams criticized;" "Motorcyclist killed;" "Vice-admiral Norman: The Opposition requests an emergency meeting."
Far from trying to mobilize people against an elite, à la Fox, Le Journal gives ordinary Quebecers the kind of news they are interested in, which explains why Quebecor's dailies (Le Journal de Montréal, de Québec, 24H) are read by 55 per cent of all Quebecers aged 14 and over, while other media struggle. La Presse had to turn to not-for-profit fundraising when Power Corporation jettisoned the newspaper it had purchased 51 years ago.
Meanwhile, Quebecor successfully launched an online radio station, QUB - I have daily columns - which has already won national awards for podcasts.
Le Journal enjoys an incredible connection to its readers. Call it populism if you insist, but I prefer to call it popular.
This year, Le Journal de Montréal took home the Prix Hubert Reeves for its science compendium Tout savoir en cinq minutes at the Grands Prix du journalisme, catégorie Grand Public. Le Journal also had finalists in most categories.
That recognition, and much more over the years, serves as a rebuttal to detractors who dismiss Quebecor, one of the few media companies that continue to hire and invest heavily in content.
I am proud to be part of the most ideologically diverse, challenging and successful bunch of Quebecor columnists.

Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac's dike rebuild supported

Full text: Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac will rebuild its controversial dike.
The Quebec government announced on Friday that it has given the town the go-ahead to rebuild and even raise the dike that failed on April 27.
Environment Minister Benoit Charette made the announcement in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac with other cabinet ministers.
"Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac will have the support of the (environment) ministry to move ahead as quickly as possible with the necessary work on the dike," Charette said in a statement that was released by the government.
The statement also assured the ministry's personnel will help the town's council and residents in the coming months.
The work should be completed by the spring of 2020, the government says.
"Since the beginning of this episode of exceptional floods, I contended that the Quebec government will be there to support the victims," Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said in the statement.
"However, now that the recovery phase is underway in Ste-Marthesur-le-Lac, we have had to make known as quickly as possible the government decision concerning the dike. Today, we want to make it clear to the local population that we agree with (the town). The dike plays a crucial role in flood protection in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac and it can be rebuilt as soon as possible."
The dike was built in 1976, a long grassy mound of earth and gravel pushed up against the shoreline to keep flood waters at bay.
It failed when a weak point crumbled under the pressure of a lake swollen to record levels. The waters rushed through, creating a channel roughly 20 metres wide - large enough to flood one-third of the town of 18,000 within hours. More than 2,500 homes were inundated, and 6,500 people fled.
In the aftermath of the disaster, many were critical of the city, saying the dike should never have been built in the first place.
"There is no valid excuse for humans to build in that spot," said hydrologist François Brissette of École de technologie supérieure.
"The reason they are protected by dikes is because their houses are built in a lake. For a hydrologist, a flood plain is considered part of a lake - it's where a lake can stock its excess water when the floods come."
While some Ste-Marthe residents have been permitted to return home, there is still a threat of flooding throughout Quebec.
Friday's rain was expected to add to the thaw of ice and snow to raise the water levels of the lakes and rivers up north that feed into the Ottawa River's system.
Many reservoirs in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region were at capacity, according to a statement by the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board.
The board said it expected levels to rise, but in the Montreal and Ottawa areas they are not expected to surpass the first peak of river levels reached last week.
While the city of Montreal lifted its state of emergency this week, Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis said authorities are still monitoring the situation closely, and urged people not to take away sandbags or undo any measures to protect their homes from a flood. René Bruemmer of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this report. Postmedia News

Full text: Re: "Situation is stable across province, authorities say" (Montreal Gazette, May 6) Kudos to the city of Montreal and its workers for the proactive stand that saved many of us from another traumatic experience.
In 2017 flooding, we were so unprepared and the damage was extensive. This time around the city supplied us with sandbags and had an open line of communication.
Now the flood is practically over, my sincere thanks to all the workers of the great city of Montreal.

"However, now that the recovery phase is underway in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, we have had to make known as quickly as possible the government decision concerning the dike. Today, we want to make it clear to the local population that we agree with (the town). The dike plays a crucial role in flood protection in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac and it can be rebuilt as soon as possible."
The dike was built in 1976, a long grassy mound of earth and gravel pushed up against the shoreline to keep floodwaters at bay.
It failed when a weak point crumbled under the pressure of a lake swollen to record levels. The waters rushed through, creating a channel roughly 20 metres wide - large enough to flood one-third of the town of 18,000 within hours. More than 2,500 homes were inundated, and 6,500 people fled.
In the aftermath of the disaster, many were critical of the city, saying the dike should never have been built in the first place.
"There is no valid excuse for humans to build in that spot," said hydrologist François Brissette of École de technologie supérieure. "The reason they are protected by dikes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/dike-in-ste-marthe-sur-le-lac-was-inspected-but-failed-anyway ) is because their houses are built in a lake. For a hydrologist, a flood plain is considered part of a lake - it's where a lake can stock its excess water when the floods come."
While some Ste-Marthe residents have been permitted to return home, there is still a threat of flooding throughout Quebec. Friday's rain was expected to add to the thaw of ice and snow to raise the water levels of the lakes and rivers up north that feed into the Ottawa River's system.
Many reservoirs in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region were at capacity, according to a statement by the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board. The board said it expected levels to rise, but in the Montreal and Ottawa areas they are not expected to surpass the first peak of river levels reached last week.
While the city of Montreal lifted its state of emergency( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-flooding-montreal-lifts-state-of-emergency-as-waters-recede ) this week, Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis said authorities are still monitoring the situation closely, and urged people not to take away sandbags or undo any measures to protect their homes from a flood.

Full text: Editor's note: This is an open letter to the Grand River Conservation Authority.
Dear GRCA (and others),
The news is once again filled with tragic stories of flooded communities both close to home and throughout this country. It has become increasingly obvious to expert and layman alike that the effects of climate change are upon us.
The members of the Nith River Flooding Action Committee respectfully submit this letter to you in the hopes of galvanizing our resolve to work together to protect our town from the future flooding of the Nith River.
We are witnessing the results of a delayed response to the maintenance of a dike system (not unlike our dike on the Nith River) by the events in Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac in Quebec.
From the Montreal Gazette:
For at least 18 months, the city of Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac has known its dikes needed repairs. Mayor Sonia Paulus requested funding to modernize the 43-year-old structure in 2015, but work was only scheduled to start next fall... And reports suggest the city may have known of serious problems with the dike as early as 10 years ago... At the time, the recommendations of experts was that the dike be raised by two feet.
When the members of our organization read this, we could not help but recognize how similar this appears to be to our current situation. Many of the engineers we spoke to have recommended raising the Nith River's dike system by two to three feet to keep flood waters within the confines of the river banks.
It was also suggested that the bridge at the 7/8 Highway is causing a "pinch-point" in the river and backing water up into the city. Our engineering friends have suggested that culverts should be installed to help divert some of the water safely around the structure - a repair already being utilized in some northern Ontario communities with similar problems.
Steps must be taken now to prepare New Hamburg for a future with higher water levels.
From Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo,
"At the level of communities, what we should be doing is looking at how we can use things like berms, diversion channels, holding ponds, cisterns, bioswales ... to direct water to safe locations where it can be stored or discharged downstream,"
This sentiment was echoed by a recent Toronto Sun article written by Lorrie Goldstein:
"... adaptation means doing practical things now to help Canadians cope with the impacts of climate change, however it's caused. Adaptation has the bonus of doing things that are worthwhile regardless of whether severe weather is caused by natural, man-made, or 'people made' factors. It includes... rebuilding and reinforcing aging dams, berms and spillways BEFORE they break."
It also makes great fiscal sense. Investing funds now to prevent flooding in the future will save our town money in the long run. Ursule Boyer-Villemaire, an associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in disaster management and climate resilience planning, sums it up:
"Responding to disaster is going to be a lot more expensive than being proactive in vulnerable sites."
It is our organization's sincere hope that the sentiments expressed by these experts are shared by all levels of our government and the GRCA.
Please let us know how we may assist you in these efforts. Our organization would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.
We are hopeful that we can all work together to find solutions today before they become the problems of tomorrow.
Respectfully,
Richard Quesnel and the Nith River Flooding Action Committee

Ste-Marthe's displaced residents get green light to rebuild homes

Full text: The people who lost their homes to a dike collapse in Ste-Marthe-surle-Lac last month will be allowed to rebuild.
Mayor Sonia Paulus said Monday she believes a new, taller and stronger dike will be strong enough to beat back the Lake of Two Mountains when its waters swell each spring. Paulus says repairs to the current dike were completed Sunday and the situation on the ground is stabilizing.
The city should be done pumping water from its streets by Thursday, according to the mayor. As of Monday morning, roughly 5,000 people remained displaced by the flood.
News of progress on the dike and pumping efforts may be encouraging to the residents waiting to return home. But those same people, many of whom had to flee their homes and outrun the cascading water, want to know how the wall was breached and whether a new wall will hold.
"If we're going to go back, we need to know exactly what went wrong," said Alexandre Cordeau, who lived in the worst-hit sector of Ste-Marthe at the time of the flood.
"Who was inspecting the dike? Was it an engineering technician? A blue-collar worker? The mayor while walking her dog? The more we know about the process of inspecting the better we'll feel going back."
Cordeau, a quality-control inspector, doesn't know the extent of the damage to his home. His house is among the 125 that were "sacrificed" and left underwater so the city could contain flooding that displaced 6,500 people.
It may be that when it's time for Cordeau, his wife and their oneyear-old daughter to consider moving back home, their property will need to be torn down and rebuilt.
When he bought his house three years ago, he assumed the structure keeping it above water was stable. Since it failed, Cordeau has been trying to get his hands on old inspection reports to get a sense of whether the disaster could have been prevented.
One recommendation from a 2009 report - which concluded there had been significant damage to the dike - outlines measures the city should take to ensure the wall holds firm. The report states that the city needed to implement "surveillance measures" to assess the structure's quality.
Cordeau says he think the question of whether the city bears any responsibility in last month's breach may hinge on the quality of those surveillance measures.
"If it turns out the city is clearly at fault here then I would consider joining a class-action lawsuit against (Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac)," Cordeau said.
"A lawsuit would likely be long and no one should expect to get rich out of it. But if there is negligence and there is a way of recouping some of our losses, then a lawsuit may be the right course of action."
A group of about 500 Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac residents met last week to discuss launching a class-action lawsuit against the city. They are expected to file suit within a few days, according to plaintiffs reached by the Montreal Gazette.
The dike was inspected after severe flooding in 2017 but the quality and frequency of those inspections remain unclear. This fall the city was scheduled to begin repairs on 3.5 kilometres of dikes, some of which date back to 1976.
Now that work will be far more extensive.
The part of the structure that crumbled last month was a "natural dike" - a mound built of grass and clay. A new version of the dike would be taller and could be reinforced with concrete.
Asked whether he thinks he should even rebuild in a flood plain, Cordeau said he's willing to take that chance.
"With the right structure in place, with the right inspection protocols in place, I think it can work," said Cordeau, whose family is living with relatives at the moment.
"The worst has already happened. They'll watch the dike, if there wasn't a good inspection program they'll have one now. You don't want a second flood like this in 2020 or 2022 and Ste-Marthe isn't the only city built on a flood plain.
"Maybe it'll happen again in 40 years or maybe they'll make the modifications they need to make. But this is our home and for a lot of people, this is it, this is all they have. My wife and I are young and we can start over. Many people can't.
"So, for a lot of people, what other choice is there? We have to rebuild." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Flood victims need more psychological support, says renowned PTSD expert

Full text: A world-renowned expert in post-traumatic stress disorder is warning Quebec authorities to provide long-term psychological and financial support to the victims of the province's worst flooding on record or face an unprecedented wave of anger.
"This is a test for the authorities," said psychologist Pascale Brillon, who trained the social workers who responded to the victims of the 2013 train derailment in Lac-Mégantic that killed 47 people.
Unlike Lac-Mégantic, a once-in-a lifetime disaster, the flooding in the past three weeks occurred only two years after the spring inundations of 2017. Many flood victims fear more flooding in the future as a consequence of climate change.
"The authorities have to be there when it's less sexy, three months from now," Brillon added. "This is when everyone else will be on vacation and having fun. But the victims will feel that they're all alone."
Brillon, who has written extensively about PTSD, said the trauma suffered by flood victims is unique in that many end up being consumed with anger at the government over what they perceive to be the slow pace in obtaining financial compensation.
What's more, flood victims sometimes find it difficult to receive psychological support compared with the victims of violence or work accidents, Brillon observed.
The provincial government has adopted a new flood-compensation program this year. Premier François Legault has pledged that claims will be processed faster than they were in 2017. Under the new program, those flooded will receive a lifetime maximum of $100,000 to repair flood damage. Those who choose to move will be indemnified up to $200,000 for their houses.
But a number of flood victims have already complained that the new program is far from ideal, with one Île-Bizard resident saying that the premier could "go f- himself."
And as the number of evacuees rose to more than 10,000 across the province on Tuesday afternoon, it's not clear whether the government has boosted psychosocial resources for victims. On Saturday, hours before the emergency evacuation of Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, Health Minister Danielle McCann told reporters that the government would deploy a total of 60 social workers and psychologists to assist flood victims.
McCann's office did not respond to queries by the Montreal Gazette since Monday about whether the ministry planned to increase the number of "intervenants." Over the weekend, the Montérégie-Ouest health authority that oversees flood-stricken Rigaud increased the size of its psychosocial team from eight to 10 members.
Mathieu Allaire, the Montérégie-Ouest's coordinator of emergency measures, acknowledged that the psychological impact of the floods will be felt only in the coming months.
"We're still at the beginning, he said. "We've noticed that as soon as people saw that the flooding was going to go beyond the levels of 2017, we sensed some people were discouraged."
"What was hard for people in 2017 is they said the compensation process was complicated and long," he added. "This time around, the elected officials tell us it won't be as long or complicated. If that's not the case, it could lead to more of an impact."
Still, the social workers and psychologists assisting flood victims are mostly the same ones who helped in 2017 and have gained invaluable experience, said Jade St-Jean, a spokesperson for the Montérégie-Ouest health authority.
"There's a bond of trust that's been established between the workers and the flood victims," St-Jean added.
"They're better prepared and more proactive."
Based on Brillon's experience, the flood victims will go through two stages before experiencing symptoms of PTSD. In the first stage, their efforts are focused on trying to save their house as they erect sandbags around their property. In the next stage, they might feel euphoric as they re-enter their house after the floodwaters have receded.
But that euphoria will then give way to long-term PTSD symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, depression and anger in the months that follow.
Some victims will begin to associate the rain with flooding or avoid going to a lake. Others will start to "self-medicate" with alcohol, worsening their symptoms, Brillon noted.
Making matters worse is the uncertainty of dealing with another flood and making the difficult choice of either trying to sell their house or continue living in it. Psychological treatment will vary among individuals and can last from months to years.

'The worst is behind us,'Legault tells residents; People should strongly consider moving from flood zone, premier says

Full text: As floodwaters began to recede across the province Monday, Premier François Legault warned those hoping to restore their homes to their past splendour to think twice before doing so.
"I want to insist that people who have serious damage should seriously think about moving (out of the flood zone)," Legault told reporters while on a tour of the Mauricie town of Maskinongé, which was one of the first areas affected by spring flooding that swelled the Rivière Sud-Ouest.
In a few minutes, this year's flood became the worst recorded in the history of the province, when more than 6,000 people fled their homes in a matter of hours in Ste-Marthesur-le-Lac over the weekend when a dike breached, and water covered one third of the homes in the small town.
Legault said there is some reason for optimism, as the peak of springtime flooding has been reached.
"I want to assure people that the worst is behind us," Legault said. "For now, what's important is to take care of people and to ensure, along with the Red Cross, that everyone has a place to stay."
Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault warned the road to recovery will be long and challenging.
"I want to prepare people to arm themselves with patience," Guilbault told a news conference Monday. "The lowering of water levels will be slow and take time. We need to be aware of that and prepare for it."
As of Monday night, more 10,149 people had left their homes across the province, compared to roughly 4,000 in the historic floods of 2017. A total of 6,681 homes had been flooded and another 3,488 cut off from their communities by floodwaters.
In Montreal, 94 residences were flooded on Monday, 49 were surrounded by water and 55 were evacuated.
Guilbault congratulated emergency responders across the province for excellent work since the disaster began.
"It's been 10, 11 days, even more for some, that people have been hard at work day and night, day after day," she said. "Thank you, everyone."
Guilbault said the province is keeping an especially close eye on the situation in Ste-Marthe-surle-Lac, where Mayor Sonia Paulus said authorities reported a drop in water levels overnight Sunday, and some will be permitted to return to their homes on Tuesday afternoon.
Paulus said the town had been working since 2017 to reinforce the dike that failed, but had been waiting for permission from the environment ministry.
Asked about that Monday, Legault said an application was made to the Quebec government in February for work that would have been done in the fall of 2019.
Legault said the province will speed up access to funds for those who wish to rebuild their homes, hoping that it will be faster than in 2017. However, according to the new regime in place, those flooded will only get a lifetime maximum amount of $100,000 to repair flood damage. Those who wish to move will get up to $200,000 for their houses, $50,000 for the land, and compensation for their furniture, Legault said.
He added that the situation could be difficult for small towns like Maskinongé, because if hundreds take the province's offer of compensation to move away, towns will be short property tax.
"I understand that it can be almost dramatic on the finances of the municipality, so we will have to ask questions about how we can help municipalities that will be affected," Legault said. "We want to minimize damage in the long term and avoid Quebec taxpayers to pay repetitively for repairs. This is what we will figure out in the coming weeks."
In the meantime, the Bell Falls dam on the Rouge River appeared to be holding up, as water levels dipped below critical and were expected to continue to decrease over the next few days.
"It's still at 900 cubic metres per second (down from a high of 1,300 reached last week), and that's nine times the average," said Cendrix Bouchard, a spokesperson for Hydro-Québec. "We're confident it can sustain that level of pressure."
He said the order to force 50 people from their homes downriver as a precautionary measure will stand at least for the next few days.
As of Sunday, the Red Cross had taken charge of roughly 1,000 Quebecers, with about two-thirds relocated to hotels. About 100 volunteers and more than 30 staff are providing support in 11 municipalities and are monitoring the needs of 22 other communities.
The weather forecast calls for two more episodes of rain on Wednesday and Friday. The rain will be accompanied by warmer weather, with temperatures reaching 12 to 15 C on Thursday.

Is $200,000 a fair buyout price for a house in a Quebec flood zone?

Full text: Is Quebec Premier François Legault's offer to pay homeowners $200,000( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-is-it-time-to-bail-out-flood-zone-homes-for-good ) to abandon their flood-prone houses an example of government largesse, or an unjust drop in the bucket for residents whose homes were once worth far more?
The answer is complex, because when it comes to building homes on flood plains, there are several players who may share the blame, including the federal, provincial and municipal governments, the homeowners, and a capricious global weather system.
"The problem is responsibility is shared between a large number of actors, but the responsibilities are ambiguous enough that it's very difficult to hold any one party accountable," said Daniel Henstra, a University of Waterloo professor specializing in flood-management policies, and a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.
"Governments are increasingly getting tired of paying to repair the same houses over and over, so when it comes to fairness as a general principle, they have to also look at whether it's fair for the public treasury - that is, taxpayers - to be repeatedly bailing out these people who have these repeated flood losses."
On Sunday, Legault said the government was adjusting its programs to funnel compensation money to residents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ) more quickly. It's reducing the maximum amount for repairs, down from $159,000 offered during the 2017 floods. Now the government will pay out a maximum of $100,000 in cumulative flood compensation, after which residents could receive up to $200,000 to move from flood-prone areas.
That offer came as little solace to residents like René Rousseau, who has been trying to sell his $900,000 home on the Laval island of Île Bigras for $700,000 with no luck, mainly because the for-sale sign on his front lawn is currently underwater.
The mayor of flood-stricken Gatineau, Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin, noted that people require not only the value of their home, but what it will cost them to live in a new location.
"If we ask people to leave, they must leave with dignity, and that means with enough financial means to have a quality of life that would be equivalent elsewhere. For many people, $200,000 for a house is pretty limited."
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said the need for people to move out of homes in flood-prone areas is a delicate subject.
"This is a subject that we must approach with gentleness. ... We're talking about whole neighbourhoods in some cases," she said Tuesday. "For those who live in places that will be systematically flooded year after year, we do have to raise questions."
Plante said the price for compensating homeowners should be set regionally, because there are huge differences in property values between the Beauce, for example, and Montreal.
The mayor of flood-stricken Gatineau noted that relocated residents would require not only the value of their home, but what it would cost them to have an equivalent quality of life elsewhere.
There is a common public reaction to blame the homeowner, Henstra noted. But often homeowners are not advised of the risks, and it's up to municipalities to decide whether or not developers can build and sell properties, he said, which shifts the blame to the cities.
Municipalities may have little knowledge of flood zones, however, due to a lack of flood mapping that indicates current and future risks, which is a provincial responsibility. That issue is common across Canada, where there has been long-standing confusion over who is responsible for what, and a lack of conversation between different levels of government, Henstra said.
The problems are exacerbated by the fact that shifting weather patterns and climate change have increased flood hazards.
Since the floods of 2017, Quebec has moved ahead of many provinces, creating a flood action plan and ordering flood maps for the whole province by 2021. The offer of $200,000 to homeowners can be seen as progressive, Henstra said, in that the government could also leave it up to the free market to decide, in which case flood-prone houses might fetch a far lower price.
The offer of compensation to move is a major improvement over past practice, such as when Quebec paid homeowners in the flood zone of the Richelieu Valley( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-floods-why-experts-say-disaster-will-strike-again ) to rebuild in the same area after the 2011 floods, said Pascale Biron, an expert in river dynamics and professor in Concordia University's department of geography, planning and environment. Also promising is that Quebec has given the local responsibility for flood mapping to the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, which oversees the 82 municipalities of the greater Montreal region, as opposed to handing the reins to individual municipalities whose land-development decisions can be influenced by the promise of property tax benefits.
"The bottom line is that it's positive that we are now realizing perhaps this is not sustainable and we have to think differently," Biron said.
"But we have to be cautious and not use the one-size-fits-all solution and force everyone to leave without taking into account the local situation."

Quebec flooding: Water levels expected to peak by Thursday

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/quebec-flooding-water-levels-expected-peak/docview/2213730099/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: The battle to keep Montreal's suburbs above water is going well, but it isn't over yet.
As melted ice and rain continue to fill the Ottawa River basin, water levels will probably peak by Thursday morning, according to Urgence-Quebec. And while the flooding isn't expected to exceed 2017 levels, officials are preaching caution for citizens who live in flood-prone areas.
"What I'm asking the population is to maintain their level of preparation at the highest level, to watch out for the safety of their neighbourhood, to help one another and to show solidarity," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance.
"(The rain) has a direct impact on water levels in the Montreal region. ... It's the weather that will determine whether or not the level will go up."
Lachance said the vast majority of dikes have already been built, but some still need to be raised or reinforced, especially on Île-Bizard. He also said authorities have no intention of evacuating Île-Mercier, south of Île-Bizard, even though the bridge to the island has been closed.
A parking lot is flooded in Pierrefonds. The street where the Club Piscine is located is beside the Rivière des Prairies. Many communities in the area are still in peril from rising waters.
As of midday Tuesday, 1,418 people across the province had left their homes, while 2,900 residences were flooded and a further 2,200 were cut off from their communities by flood waters or landslides caused by waterlogged soil.
But many of the communities that were devastated two years ago have been spared from the worst.
Deux-Montagnes resident Aimée Rupnik Subashi remembers the chaos of 2017; the water pierced through dikes and sent sewage pouring into people's basements and front yards. At the time, citizens banded together to keep their houses from going under, but dozens lost everything.
"We have friends whose house is still in the process of being repaired," said Rupnik Subashi, who lives near the flood zone by the Lake of Two Mountains. "Two years ago, we didn't have enough shovels, we weren't sure how to tie the sandbags down and it was sort of chaotic, it caught us by surprise."
Rupnik Subashi remembers people canoeing supplies up and down her street as rain battered the neighbourhood. Soldiers were eventually called in to save the nearby water filtration plant.
"This year, it couldn't be a more different picture," she said. "There's constant patrol of police, firefighters and city workers, the mayor's been by and not just for the pony show.
"The sandbagging and dike building was smooth and constant, everyone had a job to do, citizens organized volunteer groups on Facebook, the city built these massive dikes days before the flood ... my kids helped out after school. It was impressive."
Men look out at the Rivière des Prairies beside a house surrounded by water in the Ste-Dorothée area of Laval on Tuesday.
Meanwhile outside of Quebec City, the Beauce remains the province's most affected area by far, with the Chaudière River overflowing its banks and forcing the removal of 867 people, damaging 1,863 homes and leaving 80 others isolated.
In northwestern Laval, the Canadian Armed Forces and blue-collar workers continued to reinforce dikes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighters helped pump water from yards and basements in Laval West and Fabreville.
About 42 homes have seen their basements flooded, according to Const. Évelyne Boudreau of the Laval police. The presence of soldiers on the ground has freed up local firefighters and police to answer emergency calls from about 100 homeowners across the island.
"We're doing our best to work with the elderly and more vulnerable people," Boudreau said. "Meanwhile, we're repatriating a bunch of municipal employees to take phone calls from and advise citizens. It's all hands on deck."
Boudreau said the city closed the bridge linking Île-Bigras to Laval's main island on Tuesday and boat traffic between Laval and its northern neighbours was suspended to alleviate pressure on the dikes.
Back on the shores of Lake of Two Mountains, Steve Mason says the water has largely stabilized since Easter Sunday. Two years ago, it was not water directly from the lake that nearly washed away his home, but rather a breach in the city's dike.
"The dike was on higher ground, so when it went, it took about half an hour and there was four feet of water at our door," said Mason, who also lives in Deux-Montagnes. "That really put a panic into things. But this year, the city contained it and life is a lot easier."
This year, the city started work on its dike on April 16 and continued into Easter weekend. But in the end, Mason said he mostly counted on family, friends and neighbours to keep his home dry.
"We had an army helping us out for God's sake," Mason said. "We ordered something like 25 tonnes of sand and had a lot of good people helping us shovel it, tie it, bag it and stack it. It'll continue to rise but we're ready for it."

Full text: As expected, the number of those affected by flooding across Quebec continued to increase on Tuesday, but that toll is expected to stabilize over the next 48 hours.
Environment Canada is predicting rain for the swath of the province stricken with flooding - a corridor that stretches from the Outaouais region to the Chaudière-Appalaches area south of Quebec City - but precipitation is expected to be light and scattered.
Public security officials have said over the past few days that the high-water point is expected to be reached Tuesday or Wednesday, after which water levels will either stabilize or start to drop, a process that has already begun in several areas.
As of 9 a.m. Tuesday, 1,418 people across the province had left their homes, while 3,152 residences were flooded and a further 1,869 cut off from their communities by floodwaters or landslides caused by waterlogged soil.
The Beauce remains the most affected area by far, with the Chaudière River overflowing its banks and forcing the removal of 867 people, damaging 1,863 homes and leaving 80 others isolated.
Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance called on residents of flood-prone areas not to let down their guard.
"What I'm asking the population is to maintain their level of preparation at the highest level, to watch out for the safety of their neighbourhood, to help one another and to show solidarity," he said to reporters during a visit to the fire department's command centre on Mount Royal.
Lachance noted that more rain is expected in the Ottawa River basin.
"That will have a direct impact on water levels in the Montreal region," he said. "It's the weather that will determine whether or not the level will go up."
Lachance said the vast majority of dikes have already been built but some still need to be raised or reinforced, especially on Île Bizard.
He also said authorities have no intention of evacuating Île Mercier, south of Île Bizard, even though the bridge to the island has been closed.
In northwestern Laval, the Canadian Armed Forces and blue-collar workers continued to reinforce dikes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighters helped pump water from yards and basements in Laval West and Fabreville.
About 42 homes have seen their basements flooded, according to Const. Évelyne Boudreau of the Laval police. The presence of soldiers on the ground has freed up local firefighters and police to answer emergency calls from about 100 homeowners across the island.
"We're doing our best to work with the elderly and more vulnerable people," said Boudreau. "Meanwhile, we're repatriating a bunch of municipal employees to take phone calls from and advise citizens. It's all hands on deck."

As Quebec deals with more flooding, memories of 2017's catastrophic floods have galvanized support among West Island residents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flooding-residents ). From donating drinks and food to knocking on doors to make sure elderly and vulnerable residents have flood protections in place, hundreds of volunteers are pitching in to help their neighbours. "It's really heart-warming to see everybody turning out to lend their support to people who need it," said Rachel Shizgal, 50, of Dollard des Ormeaux. The floods of two years ago remain seared into residents' memories, she said. Vicky Belisle, 72, went out to check on her neighbours. Two years ago, she recalled, bags for filling with sand were in short supply. "People were fighting over bags. People were using pillow cases (as sand bags)," she said. Over the last week, Shizgal said, there have been plenty of sand bags to go around. Of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, she said "you can't fault them this time.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he wants all public infrastructure of his city fed by "zero-emission Canadian hydroelectricity"( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/new-york-city-mayor-wants-a-contract-with-hydro-quebec-by-next-year ) and he wants a deal signed by 2020. Quebec Premier François Legault hailed the announcement on Twitter.( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/1120416464681492480 ) "Wow!," Legault said. "Hydro-Québec could become the green battery of northeast of America." Hydro-Québec said it would be "happy to engage in discussions with New York City" to firm up the Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line project, which would have a capacity of eight terawatt-hours of electricity. Cables would be buried under ground and under water for more than 530 kilometres. The project has been on the table for at least 10 years. The original plan was to start construction in 2018 and have the network live in 2021.
WOW! Le maire de New-York annonce la relance des négociations avec Hydro-Québec.

It wasn't a routine day for a sheriff's officer after she spotted a donkey meandering along Interstate 90 near Chicago. Video( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5O0z8bn-l4 ) from a body camera taken Wednesday shows the bewildered Cook County officer radioing: "There's a donkey in the middle of I-90." The officer then ordered the donkey to "come here, sweetie." She asked a motorist to stand with the donkey while she could figure out what to do. The officer also asked the donkey where it was from. It turns out the animal's name was Dusty, who was eventually returned to its owner.

Full text: Wearing a security vest and clutching a megaphone, Johanne Hudon-Armstrong directs the steady stream of trucks arriving at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
"Barwick St. is an emergency," she barks as volunteers pile sand bags onto a trailer pulled by an SUV. And off it drives to bring protection and encouragement to West Island residents whose homes could be threatened by the rising waters of the Rivière des Prairies.
Shovelling sand into sacks or directing traffic in the hot sun is not everyone's idea of how to spend the Easter-Passover long weekend.
But the fear of a possible repeat of the catastrophic floods of 2017 has galvanized an outpouring of support among West Island residents.
From donating drinks and food to knocking on doors to make sure elderly and vulnerable residents have flood protections in place, hundreds of volunteers are pitching in to help their neighbours.
"I'm a project manager by nature, so I took over," said Hudon-Armstrong, who showed up to help with her daughter.
"It's really heart-warming to see everybody turning out to lend their support to people who need it," said Rachel Shizgal, 50, of Dollard des Ormeaux as she dug her shovel into a mountain of sand.
The floods of two years ago remain seared into residents' memories, she said.
"Everyone has stories. Everyone was affected in some way. If it's not them, it's a friend. If it's not the grocer or the dentist, it's somebody else you know," Shizgal said.
"We're dry. Others aren't," said Pierrefonds resident Dolores Carroll, 56, to explain why she and five other family members were volunteering their time.
Her son Eric Paquette, 24, said he had no problems spending the long weekend shovelling sand.
"It's nice and sunny," he said.

Blocks away, homeowner Ginette Roy, 69, gazed worriedly at the water surrounding the mature trees at the end of her waterfront property on Rive-Boisée Rd.
The 2017 floods, which caused $100,000 in damage to her house, "started just the way it is now," she said.
As she looked out, volunteer Lesley Steeves arrived at the house, pushing a wheelbarrow piled high with sand bags.
"Although our house isn't affected, many of my neighbours are," said Steeves, 46, whose husband, parents and sister were also giving their time.
Seeing so many people show up to help "is a reminder that there's some good out there," she said.
Roy, who has owned her home since 1979, said the property had never been flooded until two years ago.
"It was paradise," she said.
"The water never, never came up onto the property."
Walking around the side of the house, she showed where the flood had caused deep cracks in the foundation, which has since been repaired.
Vicky Belisle, 72, a 48-year neighbourhood resident, was also on hand to check in on Roy and other neighbours on the street.
Two years ago, bags for filling with sand were in short supply, she recalled.
"We have a lot of bags this time," Belisle said.
"You can't fault them this time," she said of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough.
"Last time, it was crazy. People were fighting over bags. People were using pillow cases (as sand bags)," she said.
René Leblanc, who lives on nearby des Maçons St., said he was "cautiously optimistic" of not seeing a repeat of what happened in 2017.
The floods caused extensive damage to homes on des Maçons even though the street is several hundred metres from the river, said Leblanc, a retiree and former city councillor.
"Six feet of water poured in within four minutes," he said.
"We weren't ready two years ago. This year, things are very different," he said.
Leblanc was forced to move out of his house for 88 days and spent $115,000 to repair the damage from the flood.
This time around, "our borough has done a brilliant job," he said.
Each households has received two pallets of sandbags and measures have been taken to prevent storm sewers from backing up as they did in 2017, he noted.
Jean Robert Télémaque, 62, a 19-year resident of des Maçons St., spent three days working from early morning to 10 p.m. piling rows of sandbags in front of his house and building a plywood barrier in front of the garage door.
In 2017, the surging flood blew in the garage door, filling the basement with six feet of water in minutes, he said.
"It's definitely stressful," he said.

Before and after
For Tim Coochey, 60, a 27-year resident of des Maçons St., the difference between the 2017 floods and this year is "night and day."
"Just look at the street," said Coochey, surveying the wall of sandbags residents have erected to prevent the damage that occurred two years ago, when several feet of water surged into basements.
"The difference between 2017 and now is that in 2017, they got caught with their britches down," said Coochey, known for the elaborate Halloween decorations he puts up each year, to the delight of neighbourhood children.
When the Rivière des Prairies overflowed its banks two years ago, rising waters caused storm sewers to back up, flooding a wide area, he noted.
"We had three four-foot storm sewers wide open. That was probably pushing two Olympic swimming pools worth of water a second," he said.
"For us, the flood initially started courtesy of the storm sewers," said Coochey, who spent $50,000 on materials to rebuild his basement, ruined by the flood.
Until 2017, the property had never flooded, he said.
This time, Coochey and other residents are leaving nothing to chance.
Not only has he built defences around his own home: he also spent the weekend picking up and delivering sand bags to other neighbourhood homes, making 48 trips from the command centre at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
The 2017 floods are what build the sense of community on display this year, he said.
"We all ganged up together and helped each other," he said.
"Your kids grew up here, that's your house, that's your everything. That's the nest egg for your family," Coochey said.
Given the measures taken to protect homes, it would take a dramatic rise in the river to cause similar damage this year, he said.
"That river's got to come up another 36 inches before she'll breach that dyke over here," he said.
"If Mother Nature gives us three more feet in the river height, we've got problems. If she doesn't, let's get a beer, Coochey said.

Full text: What a difference a few dozen kilometres can make.
While many Montrealers in the city centre were basking in the warm glow of the first true spring weekend of the year, others residing on the edges of bodies of water in Pierrefonds, Île-Bizard, Laval and Rigaud were fighting to save their homes and their way of life from flooding.
It was truly magical downtown for those who had endured nearly six hellish winter months of frigid climes, incessant snow and icy sidewalks. Trees were beginning to bud. Flowers were starting to bloom. Families took to parks for picnicking. And bar/resto terrasses were filled with patrons soaking up the first rites of spring.
Yet it was anything but a blissful long weekend for those who spent it in hip waders trying to barricade their homes from fast-rising waters.
It seems so surreal and downright cruel, especially on a holiday weekend when many families would normally be stuffing their faces around the dinner table, not stuffing sandbags.
The horrendous floods that wreaked havoc on homes in 2017 in these areas were thought to be a once-in-100-years occurrence. Right. Two times in three years should suggest that we are all in it up to our eyeballs - and then some. Can you say climate change? And yet there are those - like the orange-haired denier in the White House - who still believe it's all some liberal hoax. (Maybe if the Potomac River overflows he'll have a change of heart.)
Trump is far from the only unbelieving government leader. But even the believers aren't doing nearly enough.
It's with a certain degree of irony that some of this weather madness took place Monday, on Earth Day( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-flooding-rainfall-is-behind-us-but-thaw-will-be-fed-by-melting-ice ) - when too many locals couldn't see much earth beneath them.
The harsh reality is that there are those who may have to leave their homes for good, because this continual flooding is clearly no coincidence.
François Legault said on Sunday that it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ), to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes. This may have seemed somewhat rash and insensitive, but many felt he had a point. After all, there are some who have yet to complete repairs from the 2017 flooding and now must prepare for a second wave.
Legault tried to offer some solace by suggesting the government could purchase homes in flood zones, to avoid having to pony up over and over again to repair damage caused by repeated floods.
Kim Bronstein holds her son, Jake Romano, 2 years old, left to right, Noah Romano, 10, Joe, 12, father Itsik Romano and Teddy, 8, stand in the family's basement in November 2017. Itsik Romano says this time the government is doing a much better job communicating with residents and helping them hold back flood waters.
Pierrefonds resident Itsik Romano knows all too well about the agony of flooding. His house on des Maçons St. was heavily damaged by the overflowing waters of Rivière des Prairies in 2017. He recently completed renovations to the tune of $140,000, of which $60,000 came from the government and the rest from loans and a second mortgage.
Romano didn't have flood insurance in 2017. Now he does.
"When I bought my home in 2007, no one told me anything about being in a flood zone," says Romano, a digital media designer and father of five. "No one knew then. Surveys in the area were done in the 1950s. So even though we are half a kilometre away from the river, we were flooded on our street."
It could have been worse. His next-door neighbour's home was so ravaged that it had to be demolished.
This time, Romano is prepared for the worst. And so is the borough, he feels.
"The city actually started getting ready a year ago, and that's been the difference so far," says Romano, who credits Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis for stepping up. "Communication has been amazing. They've been leaving sandbags at our doors. They've been sending volunteers. And, perhaps most importantly, they've been dealing with infrastructure issues to avoid the river from flowing into our street like the last time."
So far, so good. Romano's street and others in the area are dry. Two years ago, he had no sandbags; now his house is barricaded by them.
"We're not out of danger yet, but we're making sure that all our neighbours are protected this time."
In fact, Romano and his kids spent much of the holiday weekend filling up sandbags for others in their community.
Romano takes issue with Legault's comments about possibly moving residents from flood zones.
"Moving thousands of people around is just a Band-Aid solution which won't solve the problem," he says. "It would be a lot more effective and much cheaper to reinvest in the infrastructure. It has worked in countries like the Netherlands, and is working so far for us.
"We're not moving, either. We love this community. Over the last two years, we've been brought together and are now one big family."

Full text: Quebecers woke up Monday morning to a second week of spring flooding, with the worst of the damage in the Beauce region. The premier of Quebec had mused whether the time had come for some riverfront homeowners to consider moving elsewhere( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ).
As of 8:30 a.m. Monday, Urgence Québec reported that 2,389 homes across the province had been flooded, while 717 households had been cut off from their communities by floodwaters and 1,509 residents evacuated from their homes. Major flooding was recorded at five sites along Lac St. Pierre, the Chaudière River and Lac des Deux-Montagnes.
During a tour of flooded areas in Laval on Sunday, Premier François Legault wondered whether the time had come for those who find themselves repeatedly flooded during the spring thaw to relocate to higher ground. "If we have to oblige people to move, we will do so," he said, adding that "we have to be lucid" and understand that Quebec taxpayers should not have to pay for flood damage every other year.
Take Our Poll( https://poll.fm/10300697 )
That stark choice was particularly personal for Anna Lin and Eddy Girard, who spent Sunday watching the waters rise at the edge of their property on Île Bigras in Laval.
Since the floods of 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-victims-living-in-bureaucratic-limbo ), the two say they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate their home against flooding. They have lifted the structure by three feet and installed a waterproof foundation. Yet they worry it won't be enough.
"It's discouraging," said Girard. "It's tough to keep your morale up and it's tough for the family because there are always arguments. Do we rebuild? Do we leave? It's a big decision to make."
During his tour of Laval, Legault was informed that the water levels were expected to continue to rise until Wednesday at least.
On Monday, Laval city officials said that while the waters below the bridge linking Île Bigras with Laval were rising slowly, the security of the span could be jeopardized by debris floating along the current or high winds, at which point the span would be closed. Should that occur, emergency services would still have access to the island by water shuttle.
Thus far, a total of 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to Laval to assist citizens and emergency services have made more than 1,450 door-to-door checks of residences in high risk areas.
Nearly 1,400 residences have received palettes of sandbags to deploy around their homes and the strengthening of dikes in the neighbourhoods of Laval-Ouest, Ste-Rose, Chomedey and the Îles Laval continues.

Six sand supply depots have been set up for residents at the following locations:
. Centre communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur-Sauvé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest.
. Berge Couvrette, between Highways 609 and 625 on Bord-de-l'Eau Rd. in Sainte-Dorothée.

. Centre communautaire Bigras at 886 De la Fourche Rd. on Île Bigras.
. Station de pompage at 260 Parc-des-Érables St. in Auteuil.
Meanwhile, the most critical flooding thus far in Quebec was in the Beauce region. A total of 200 people had to leave the town of Scott, an operation made more dramatic by the fact a fire broke out in a local machine shop, only to be extinguished in part by the flooding.
Water levels were also rising in the Outaouais area and in Rigaud, a town that was hard hit by 2017's floods( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/watch-st-lazare-resident-captures-birds-eye-view-of-rigaud-flooding ), although weather forecasts suggest that this year's damage may not be as severe.
"The weather is on our side," said Quebec civil protection spokesperson Éric Houde. "There are other rain systems on the way, but the water that's flowing now won't be back."
Environment Canada predicts the spring thaw will be fed by melting ice rather than rain.
"The heavy rainfalls are behind us," said meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère. "Now we're looking at runoff over the next few days, but no rain for Monday or Tuesday."
According Environment Canada, the flood prone corridor between the Outaouais and the Chaudière-Appalaches region will receive three rainfalls between Monday and the start of next week, although that rainfall will be light. About 10 to 20 mms. of rain will fall overnight Tuesday Wednesday, perhaps less in the Outaouais and Montréal areas, while another 10 mms. are expected late Thursday or early Friday. None of the weather systems bringing that rain expected to remain in the province for long.
Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to drop to more seasonal levels which should slow the melting of whatever snow is left in the areas.
Called in as reinforcements for local civil protection staff, a total of 600 Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed throughout Quebec, about 30 of whom will be deployed Monday in Île-Bizard-Sainte-Geneviève. The soldiers have been assigned to shore up sandbagging and dike reinforcement in areas at risk.
Urgences Québec is urging citizens who have to leave their homes because of the flooding to inform their municipality and to leave a note in their mailbox stating the time of their departure and their destination.
The extent of flooding and the status of water levels in various regions can be consulted at the Quebec public security website.( https://geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/ )

Full text: Premier François Legault said Sunday it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move away to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes.
Visiting Île-Bigras, the largest of the Laval Islands in the Rivière des Prairies, Legault stopped to chat with homeowner René Rousseau, part of whose house is under water for the second time in three years.
"You have to ask yourself the question, do we think that this will keep happening regularly, because if so, it's not the same decision," he said to Rousseau, who had asked Legault how the government would help him out.
"We'll see what we can do that would be reasonable," Legault told him.
Later, Legault told reporters given the increasing frequency of floods because of climate change, the government would purchase homes in flood zones to avoid having to be on the hook to repair damage caused by repeated floods.

"Now it's twice in three years. So for sure there must be the impact of climate change and we have to adjust our programs," he said.
We have to adjust our programs to rapidly compensate people who have damage and need to do renovations. But at the same time, we have to be lucid, and if it's necessary to force people to move, we will have to do it," he said.
A "For Sale" sign on Rousseau's property peeked up through the water.
Rousseau, who has owned the house for 30 years, said he has dropped his price from $900,000 to just under $700,000, but eventually the house might end up being demolished. "The reason is simple: it's in a flood zone," he said.
Earlier, Laval police chief Pierre Brochet said the city has delivered two pallets of filled sandbags to all of the 950 homes at risk of being flooded. While there was less rain than expected over the weekend, Sunday's bright sun and warm temperatures could melt frozen ground and cause waters to continue to rise, he said.
Brochet said the indications suggest the water might not rise quite as high as in 2017 in Laval and predicted the worst would be past by Wednesday.
Later, Legault visited Île-Bizard with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.
In the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, mayor Jim Beis appealed on Facebook for volunteers, trucks, trailers and empty bags to fill sand.
"It's not because it's sunny or clear that we're out of trouble here," he said in a video from the grounds of Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School at Anselme Lavigne Ave. and Rene Emard St. In Pierrefonds.
"We have 48 hours or so that we're really in a critical zone, so we're hoping that everybody comes out," Beis said.
In Rigaud, where 24 homes and 146 people in the flood zone near the Ottawa River were evacuated Thursday and 50 homes were isolated by flooding, residents watched nervously, fearing a repeat of 2017, when record flooding forced thousands from their homes.
William Bradley, whose house in Rigaud sits on a street that hugs the river, said Saturday he filled several hundred city-supplied sandbags this week. He's stacked them four high around doors and windows, wrapping the makeshift barriers in polyethylene.

"It's still coming up, coming up," said Bradley, 72.
He said flooding two years ago caused about $100,000 in damage to the ceramics equipment he stores at home for his small business.
As of Sunday morning( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/CruePrintaniere/Pages/Bilan-provincial-des-cons%C3%A9quences.aspx ), rising river levels had resulted in 980 flooded residences (up from 903 Saturday), 377 isolated residences (up from 251) and 1,264 evacuees across the province (up from 317), according to Urgence Québec.
Eight major floods were identified by Urgence Québec on Saturday evening, threatening thousands of Quebecers: the Chaudière River at St-Georges, St-Joseph, Scott and Vallée-Jonction, all in the Beauce region; Lake of Two Mountains at Rigaud and Quesnel Bay; and the Beaurivage River in Lévis in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

About 200 soldiers started filling sandbags and carrying out evacuations in Quebec's Outaouais and Mauricie regions Saturday night, with an additional 400 troops standing ready to deploy there and in Laval on Sunday, said Brig.-Gen. Jennie Carignan.
A Jeep makes its way along a flooded road in the town of Rigaud on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
The soldiers are "extremely well-trained and prepared" for the flood fight, Carignan said. "They are used to doing it."
Quebec's public safety minister urged residents to stay safe and co-operate with authorities.
"Be careful, be vigilant ... please," Geneviève Guilbault said alongside Carignan at Canadian Forces Base Longue-Pointe in Montreal on Saturday evening.
A vehicle is seen in a gaping hole in the road in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa on Saturday.
Guilbault also offered her condolences to the family of Louise Seguin Lortie, who died early Saturday morning after driving her car into a massive sinkhole caused by flooding in the Outaouais region, according to police.
The accident left the 72-year-old's sedan upside down in a swollen stream after rising river levels swept away part of the road overnight, police said.
Sgt. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines police said a pair of witnesses parked near the washout tried unsuccessfully to warn the driver as she approached.
"That lady, who was driving by herself on that road, fell into a sinkhole basically because of the flooding. There was a culvert that was not there anymore, so the road was cut in half and she was not able to brake and avoid the accident," Fournel told The Canadian Press.
The woman was taken to hospital, but died shortly after, he said.
The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.
Pontiac, which sits along the Ottawa River, is one of at least four municipalities in the Outaouais region to declare states of emergency, along with Gatineau, St-André-Avellin and Val-des-Monts. Trois-Rivières is also under a state of emergency.
"We'll stay as long as we have gas for the generator. We've got a boat - my daughter bought a boat and a motor for us in 2017," he said. "By the way, never buy a boat during a flood season. It gets pricey."
In Deux Montagnes, where flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2017, city workers scrambled to put the finishing touches on a series of dikes Saturday night. The fruit of their labour is an impressive feat of engineering: a 10-foot cinderblock wall that stretches hundreds of meters along the shoreline.
They've been working at it since Tuesday and will continue reinforcing the structure into Sunday morning.

"We feel ready this year," said Éric Bélisle, who lives on 12th Ave. "In 2017, we lost a lot of houses on this street. There was six feet of water in my basement because the flooding backed up the city's sewers."
In Laval as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
More than 45 millimetres of rain fell on the Montreal area between Thursday and Saturday, according to Environment Canada. Rainfall warnings have been lifted, but water levels were already high and are expected to rise sharply over the weekend with warm temperatures and snowmelt runoff.
The city of Laval, just north of Montreal, said in a statement it had distributed sandbags to 900 homes and knocked on 550 doors to make sure people were safe as more than 1,500 homes and business remained under flood watch.
Quebec City and the Gaspé Peninsula can expect up to 30 millimetres of rainfall this weekend, said Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
People are pulled in a small boat along a residential street in Rigaud on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"That will help the snow to melt again, and we do not expect the river will be able to go down for at least 48 hours," he said Saturday.
Guilbault has said the province will allow stores - usually closed on Easter Sunday - to remain open this weekend so residents can stock up on supplies.
Some of the worst flooding Saturday appeared to surge through the Beauce region south of Quebec City, where 868 homes were flooded and 94 people evacuated as of 3 p.m., according to an Urgence Québec bulletin.
In Montreal as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
In Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City, officials have asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance with evacuations ordered by the municipality.
Earlier this week, the Chaudière River burst its banks and flooded a large part of downtown. Officials called it the worst flooding since 1971, with 230 homes and businesses flooded.
In St-Raymond, about 60 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, 24 seniors in three residences have been moved to higher ground as the Ste-Anne River continues to rise.

Flood watch: 'In a critical zone' as melt continues, soldiers deployed across Quebec

Full text: Premier François Legault said Sunday it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move away to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes.
Visiting Île-Bigras, the largest of the Laval Islands in the Rivière des Prairies, Legault stopped to chat with homeowner René Rousseau, part of whose house is under water for the second time in three years.
"You have to ask yourself the question, do we think that this will keep happening regularly, because if so, it's not the same decision," he said to Rousseau, who had asked Legault how the government would help him out.
"We'll see what we can do that would be reasonable," Legault told him.
Later, Legault told reporters given the increasing frequency of floods because of climate change, the government would purchase homes in flood zones to avoid having being on the hook to repair damage caused by repeated floods.
"Now it's twice in three years. So for sure there must be the impact of climate change and we have to adjust our programs," he said.
We have to adjust our programs to rapidly compensate people who have damage and need to do renovations. But at the same time, we have to be lucid, and if it's necessary to force people to move, we will have to do it," he said.
A "For Sale" sign on Rousseau's property peeked up through the water.
Rousseau, who has owned the house for 30 years, said he has dropped his price from $900,000 to just under $700,000, but eventually the house might end up being demolished. "The reason is simple: it's in a flood zone," he said.
Earlier, Laval police chief Pierre Brochet said the city has delivered two pallets of filled sandbags to all of the 950 homes at risk of being flooded. While there was less rain than expected over the weekend, Sunday's bright sun and warm temperatures could melt frozen ground and cause waters to continue to rise, he said.
Brochet said the indications suggest the water might not rise quite as high as in 2017 in Laval and predicted the worst would be past by Wednesday.
Later, Legault visited Île-Bizard with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.
In the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, mayor Jim Beis appealed on Facebook for volunteers, trucks, trailers and empty bags to fill sand.
"It's not because it's sunny or clear that we're out of trouble here," he said in a video from the grounds of Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School at Anselme Lavigne Ave. and Rene Emard St. In Pierrefonds.
"We have 48 hours or so that we're really in a critical zone, so we're hoping that everybody comes out," Beis said.
In Rigaud, where 24 homes and 146 people in the flood zone near the Ottawa River were evacuated Thursday and 50 homes were isolated by flooding, residents watched nervously, fearing a repeat of 2017, when record flooding forced thousands from their homes.
William Bradley, whose house in Rigaud sits on a street that hugs the river, said Saturday he filled several hundred city-supplied sandbags this week. He's stacked them four high around doors and windows, wrapping the makeshift barriers in polyethylene.
William Bradley wades through floodwaters on a street next to his home on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"It's still coming up, coming up," said Bradley, 72.
He said flooding two years ago caused about $100,000 in damage to the ceramics equipment he stores at home for his small business.
As of Sunday morning( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/CruePrintaniere/Pages/Bilan-provincial-des-cons%C3%A9quences.aspx ), rising river levels had resulted in 980 flooded residences (up from 903 Saturday), 377 isolated residences (up from 251) and 1,264 evacuees across the province (up from 317), according to Urgence Québec.
Eight major floods were identified by Urgence Québec on Saturday evening, threatening thousands of Quebecers: the Chaudière River at St-Georges, St-Joseph, Scott and Vallée-Jonction, all in the Beauce region; Lake of Two Mountains at Rigaud and Quesnel Bay; and the Beaurivage River in Lévis in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

Premier François Legault will visit flooded areas in Île-Bigras south of Laval on Sunday afternoon.
About 200 soldiers started filling sandbags and carrying out evacuations in Quebec's Outaouais and Mauricie regions Saturday night, with an additional 400 troops standing ready to deploy there and in Laval on Sunday, said Brig.-Gen. Jennie Carignan.
A Jeep makes its way along a flooded road in the town of Rigaud on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
The soldiers are "extremely well-trained and prepared" for the flood fight, Carignan said. "They are used to doing it."
Quebec's public safety minister urged residents to stay safe and co-operate with authorities.
"Be careful, be vigilant ... please," Geneviève Guilbault said alongside Carignan at Canadian Forces Base Longue-Pointe in Montreal on Saturday evening.
A vehicle is seen in a gaping hole in the road in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa on Saturday.
Guilbault also offered her condolences to the family of Louise Seguin Lortie, who died early Saturday morning after driving her car into a massive sinkhole caused by flooding in the Outaouais region, according to police.
The accident left the 72-year-old's sedan upside down in a swollen stream after rising river levels swept away part of the road overnight, police said.
Sgt. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines police said a pair of witnesses parked near the washout tried unsuccessfully to warn the driver as she approached.
"That lady, who was driving by herself on that road, fell into a sinkhole basically because of the flooding. There was a culvert that was not there anymore, so the road was cut in half and she was not able to brake and avoid the accident," Fournel told The Canadian Press.
The woman was taken to hospital, but died shortly after, he said.
The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.
Pontiac, which sits along the Ottawa River, is one of at least four municipalities in the Outaouais region to declare states of emergency, along with Gatineau, St-André-Avellin and Val-des-Monts. Trois-Rivières is also under a state of emergency.
"We'll stay as long as we have gas for the generator. We've got a boat - my daughter bought a boat and a motor for us in 2017," he said. "By the way, never buy a boat during a flood season. It gets pricey."
In Deux Montagnes, where flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2017, city workers scrambled to put the finishing touches on a series of dikes Saturday night. The fruit of their labour is an impressive feat of engineering: a 10-foot cinderblock wall that stretches hundreds of meters along the shoreline.
They've been working at it since Tuesday and will continue reinforcing the structure into Sunday morning.

"We feel ready this year," said Éric Bélisle, who lives on 12th Ave. "In 2017, we lost a lot of houses on this street. There was six feet of water in my basement because the flooding backed up the city's sewers."
In Laval as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
More than 45 millimetres of rain fell on the Montreal area between Thursday and Saturday, according to Environment Canada. Rainfall warnings have been lifted, but water levels were already high and are expected to rise sharply over the weekend with warm temperatures and snowmelt runoff.
The city of Laval, just north of Montreal, said in a statement it had distributed sandbags to 900 homes and knocked on 550 doors to make sure people were safe as more than 1,500 homes and business remained under flood watch.
Quebec City and the Gaspé Peninsula can expect up to 30 millimetres of rainfall this weekend, said Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
People are pulled in a small boat along a residential street in Rigaud on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"That will help the snow to melt again, and we do not expect the river will be able to go down for at least 48 hours," he said Saturday.
Guilbault has said the province will allow stores - usually closed on Easter Sunday - to remain open this weekend so residents can stock up on supplies.
Some of the worst flooding Saturday appeared to surge through the Beauce region south of Quebec City, where 868 homes were flooded and 94 people evacuated as of 3 p.m., according to an Urgence Québec bulletin.
In Montreal as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
In Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City, officials have asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance with evacuations ordered by the municipality.
Earlier this week, the Chaudière River burst its banks and flooded a large part of downtown. Officials called it the worst flooding since 1971, with 230 homes and businesses flooded.
In St-Raymond, about 60 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, 24 seniors in three residences have been moved to higher ground as the Ste-Anne River continues to rise.

Full text: By Sunday morning, Victoria Square was a lake. The floodwaters that had inundated Montreal's low-lying neighbourhoods of Pointe St. Charles and Griffintown the day before, surged into the city's core overnight. Firemen at the central fire hall on Craig Street, now St.
Antoine Street, were seen paddling, too - from the station in rowboats. Along McGill Street, boatmen charged 50 cents to ferry people a few hundred feet.
"Men could be seen hanging around unable to reach their homes which they had left on Saturday," the Montreal Gazette reported. The flood-prone city had expected a deluge; dikes were reinforced, water pumps tested. Few, however, were ready when the St. Lawrence began rising behind a wall of ice that dammed the narrows near Longueuil. Pointe St.
Charles was hit hardest, with water as deep as 2.5 metres. "The sidewalks floated around and were used by inhabitants as rafts," the Gazette reported.
Floodwaters began to subside early Monday. By 3 a.m., rafts along Craig Street were stranded, the Gazette reported, and "at the corner of Francis Xavier Street the crossing was dry." A Royal Commission was struck to investigate the flood's causes, leading to the construction of massive flood walls in Cité du Havre.

Full text: On April 14, 1969, the Montreal Expos played their first-ever home game, at Jarry Park. Among the 29,184 baseball fans who flocked to see the Expos take on the St. Louis Cardinals was Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand. Len Sidaway's photo of the Expos-cap-wearing Union Nationale premier appeared in the Montreal Gazette the following day, along with copious coverage of the milestone event.
Bertrand had taken office after the sudden death of Premier Daniel Johnson Sr. in late 1968. He served until losing the 1970 election to Robert Bourassa's Liberals.
Bertrand had the honour of tossing out the first ball. He was booed by the crowd, we reported.
The Expos, however, were instant favourites.
"Given a goose-pimply ovation before the game and cheered lustily throughout the city's big league baseball baptism, the Expos surged into a 6-0 lead and blew it and came back as they did in the season opener," we wrote. (They had played six away games to start the season.) The final score was 8-7 for the Expos.
Mack Jones and Coco Laboy starred. Laboy particularly relished the victory over the Cards; he had languished in their farm system without ever getting the chance to play for them, we noted.
The win went to pitcher Dan McGinn, who had come in in relief of starter Larry Jaster after the fourth inning. The Expos committed five errors.
After the game, team owner Charles Bronfman "had to struggle though a back-slapping crowd to reach his car. John McHale was besieged for autographs. Every Expo became an instant hero and Mack Jones broke in as the idol of the cheap seats with his three-run homer in the first inning," we recounted. (McHale was president of the Expos.)
Meanwhile, St. Louis outfielder Curt Flood was blasting the condition of the field, we reported. Frost pushing from underneath the surface of the field had given it a soft, bumpy consistency. The infield was soft and the outfield was rough. "It's tough to figure out which way the ball is going to bounce," Flood said, declaring it the worst diamond he'd ever played on.
The Expos played at Jarry Park until moving to the Olympic Stadium in 1977. It was their home until the end of the 2004 season, after which the team was moved to Washington and became the Nationals.

Full text: Five days after Hampstead Mayor William Steinberg compared Quebec's religious symbols ban to "ethnic cleansing," the town is still reeling from the political fallout.
News trucks from four television stations sat idling outside the town hall Wednesday, outraged commenters continued to flood the city's Facebook page and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged the mayor to apologize.
But within the suburb of 7,000 residents, people were hardly up in arms about Steinberg's remarks.
And while Steinberg said he never meant to hurt anyone by linking Bill 21 to ethnic cleansing, he said he will not apologize for making the comparison.
"I made it clear last week - I'm not talking about Rwanda or Serbia or anything that has to do with violence," Steinberg told the Montreal Gazette.
"The effects of Bill 21 will be to decrease the religious diversity within Quebec; immigrants are not going to come to a place where they're discriminated against, and the ones that are already here are going to be tempted to leave.
"As far as my remarks on ethnic cleansing, it was ethnic cleansing not with a gun but with a law ... peaceful ethnic cleansing. I didn't say anything about genocide."
Hampstead resident Corine Elkaim said she agrees with the mayor.
"I think what he said is right," Elkaim said. "Everyone in the country should have the right to practise their religion. We have to be able to live together."
One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, gave a thumbs up sign when asked what she thought about Steinberg's choice of words.
"My son wears the (Jewish kippah) and no one should tell him what to do or how to be," she said. "Don't tell us how to act, what to do, what to wear. I don't care if a Muslim woman wears a hijab on her head, I care about what's inside it."
Although all of the Hampstead residents interviewed by the Gazette said they oppose Bill 21 - which would forbid public school teachers, police officers and other civil servants from wearing religious symbols on the job - many said they dislike Steinberg's use of the term "ethnic cleansing."
"The comments took attention away from the harmful effects of (Bill 21)," said Arie Benchaya. "It was a bad idea to talk about the bill in those terms.
"I have a lot of family in France and I think (Bill 21) is sort of modelled on that approach. It doesn't work over there and I don't think it will work here."
Another resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said she is embarrassed by the mayor's comments.
"It's an embarrassment, he's an embarrassment and he should apologize. The comparison is completely inappropriate."
On the provincial scene, Liberal MNA David Birnbaum - an ardent opponent of Bill 21 - called Steinberg's words hurtful, while Premier François Legault said Tuesday they were "unacceptable."
Hampstead's Facebook page - generally reserved for news about garbage collection and youth sports - has become a forum for the mayor's detractors. Many now use the site's comments section to hurl insults at the mayor and demand his resignation.
"People should stop talking about, 'Is he going to apologize?'I've already said I'm not. I'm not going to apologize for what I didn't say," Steinberg said.
"If I say, 'I shouldn't have said it,'then people will think I'm retracting the whole thing. I stand by it." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Religious symbols: Québec solidaire votes to oppose all restrictions

Full text: QUEBEC - The left-wing Québec solidaire party( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-solidaire ) has voted to oppose all restrictions on religious symbols in the public sector.
The party, nevertheless, rapidly found itself mired in a fresh controversy when delegates endorsed a second resolution that appeared to open the door to some public workers presenting themselves for duty wearing a niqab or a burka, pieces of clothing that cover the face.
The second resolution nearly overshadowed the overwhelming vote at a QS national council meeting to ditch their traditional support for the 2008 Bouchard-Taylor formula( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/bouchard-taylor-commission ) when it comes to symbols.
The Bouchard-Taylor position was that some restrictions should apply to persons in positions of authority - namely judges, police officers, prosecutors, prison guards, and the speaker and deputy speakers of the National Assembly.
QS defended that line of thinking for years. In 2013, the former QS spokesperson, Françoise David, went so far as to present a bill designed to make the rules law. The bill was never adopted in the legislature.
But QS's support for Bouchard-Taylor went out the window Saturday with a show of voting cards by delegates from across the province, including many anglophones from Montreal.
"The line was drawn today," QS co-spokesperson Manon Massé told reporters shortly after the vote was taken. "Our position will not allow any more exception to this principle: that state secularism is not individual secularism.
"In Quebec, nobody should lose their job or be impeded in exercising their profession of their choice whether he or she wears a religious symbol."
Québec solidaire's decision came in the same week as the Coalition Avenir Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coalition-avenir-quebec ) tabled its own legislation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/religious-symbols-quebec-to-table-secularism-bill-caq-will-propose-moving-crucifix ), Bill 21( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/bill-21 ), on the issue of secularism that imposes a wide range of restrictions on symbols for authority figures working for the states.
Besides the original list from Bouchard-Taylor, the CAQ adds elementary and high school teachers, principals vice-principals, the complete range of court employees, such as clerks and bailiffs, and the heads of other judicial organizations, such as the Régie du logement and Quebec municipal commission.
For QS delegates, the vote came down to two options, A, which was the Bouchard-Taylor formula or B, "no particular regulations."
Option B ruled the day as delegate after delegate took to the microphone to express themselves in favour of freedom.
"I don't agree the state should be allowed to use its powers of coercion to force people to remove their symbols," one delegate told the crowd. "In reality it divides people."
Some linked the debate to other causes such as the rights of workers and their campaigns against capitalists and big business.
"I am here to defend the right of people to work, to fulfill their dreams to have the job they want," Saint-Henri-Saint-Anne delegate Émilie Perrier-Gosselin told the 300 delegates gathered at a CEGEP Limoilou for the two-day meeting.
"They (in the CAQ) are trying to divide us," added Hull delegate Jessica Squires.
"Give me a break with Islam and the charter of values," Catherine Dorion, the QS MNA for the riding of Taschereau said. "What is threatening our culture is not Islam. It's not the Muslims who are in all our hallways using big money to influence our governments, it's the capitalists who are in bed with our governments."
The QS position resembles that of the one taken by the Quebec Liberals( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/liberals-opt-for-traditional-position-against-ban-on-religious-symbols ), but is more categoric in favour of religious freedoms, leading a number of QS members to boast their party will be the de facto real opposition to the CAQ's vision.
"This is reassuring for our society," said Ève Torres, a veiled Muslim woman who ran for QS in the last provincial election in the riding of Mont-Royal-Outremont after the vote. "From now on QS will be the party that defends everyone without compromising.
"This is no longer the monopoly of the Liberal party. QS is the strong opposition which will strongly defend rights and freedoms for everyone in Quebec."
Delegates who had backed the old formula - who pleaded until the last minute on the plenary flood for their option - said later they were disappointed, but rallied to the majority.
"The reason I backed Option A was because I thought it would have helped educate the population on this issue," said delegate Olivier Huard. "We have taken a position which aims at an ideal."
He said the "risk" in taking such a stand is that QS will estrange itself from the part of population that backs a stricter line on symbols. Polls consistently show public support for restrictions on symbols for authority figures, such as judges and teachers.
Montreal delegate Denise Veilleux, who also was in favour of Option A, said she was disappointed because it would have allowed QS to take a step closer to the point of view of the majority of Quebecers - which is in favour of "real and visible neutrality."
It would also allow QS to take issue with the CAQ's decision to continue subsidizing private and religious schools where Bill 21 will not apply.
But Zachary Williams, who ran as a QS candidate in the 2018 election in the riding of Robert Baldwin, was bursting with pride at the decision.
"Option B sends a really clear message on what we stand for, that we are a party for racial justice and social justice, and we are at the forefront of the fight against racism and inequality," he told the Montreal Gazette.
But the clothing issue also emerged as a hot button issue. Adopted quietly after the hoopla over the symbols motion, it addressed the issue of services being delivered and received with the face visible that the Liberals tried to solve with Bill 62( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-bill-62-remains-a-debacle ).
The QS motion says such clothing can be worn as long as it does not impede the worker from completing their tasks, or if there are security concerns, or if the worker tries to convert others to their faith.
While it hands responsibility for policy such as garb over to employers in various ministries and organizations, at no point does it say such clothing - which is in reality non-existent in the public sector - is banned.
The confusion over that new policy prompted the leaders of QS to call the media in for a second news conference, where they tried to clarify what had happened.
"It's false to say the resolution is a green light to clothing covering the face in the public sector," QS MNA and party co-spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois told reporters. "On the contrary, is says we can and we must ban covered faces in many situations.
Nadeau-Dubois said he is unaware of a single profession where such clothing would be compatible; certainly not for teachers or anyone in contact with the public.
"There is nothing in this resolution which supports the niqab or the burka, which are things we have no desire to have. It does not say the general rule is the covered face and uncovered face is the exception.
"It is not a wall-to-wall attitude. It is a targeted attitude, but as I said I cannot think of a single situation where it would happen. This is all purely hypothetical. I don't know any women wearing a burka who want to teach. It would be a first in Quebec.
"We are talking about fictitious situations. If you find one, let me know."
There was no immediate reaction from the other parties to QS's shift in positions.

Call off the search; Bernard Perusse used to spend countless hours hunting through record-store racks for hard-to-find albums. Now it seems as if streaming services have made a mockery of that work. But, he suggests, there may not be a world of difference between the music geek of yesteryear and the modern-day version

Full text: Even now, I can't listen to the Kinks'unhinged rendition of Got Love if You Want It without smiling at the thought of how hard my friend Dave Riley and I worked to get it into our record collections.
We became Kinks obsessives in the early 1970s and began excitedly hoovering up the group's back catalogue, working the music-outlet delete bins, department stores and even grocery retailers. (Yep, I actually found The Kink Kontroversy and Face to Face for $2 apiece at my local Dominion, in a rack near the candy bars at the checkout.) Most of all, Dave and I seemed to live at the used-record mecca Cheap Thrills on Bishop Street.
But we had a problem: The Kinks'self-titled 1964 debut album, as released in Canada, was missing the aforementioned song, an explosive cover of the Slim Harpo blues classic.
It was common in that era for releases by British bands to be quite different in the U.K., the U.S. and Canada, with songs being dropped or added to fit marketplace dictates. Our holygrail Kinks track, as it happened, was on the U.S. version of the album, retitled You Really Got Me.
With home computers, Amazon and Discogs not even imaginable to us, there was nothing to do but search the second-hand racks with the tiniest glimmer of hope, on the infinitesimal chance that some progressive-rock zealot had decided to unload his beatgroup collection and we would strike gold.
It never happened. Sometimes the for-sale ads in the back of fanzines such as Who Put the Bomp offered a lead. And that's how, after a seeming eternity of blistering my fingers flipping through the racks, I finally emerged victorious. It involved a trip to the post office, a money order and a long wait, but I ended up with a used, somewhat battered copy of You Really Got Me, with someone's name scrawled on the back cover.
In hindsight, the hunt had been even more exciting than that moment when I placed the tonearm on the record.
I have plenty of other stories about searches for hard-to-get vinyl albums, including Frank Zappa's Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, the soundtrack for the 1967 film Privilege, with those unforgettable songs by Paul Jones, and Miss Butters by the Family Tree, a pre-Wackers band featuring Bob Segarini and Bill (Kootch) Trochim. But I can't think of a single pursuit of a recording that brought me more pulse-quickening moments than that Kinks quest.
More than 40 years later, though, it feels as if I'm making all this up. Got Love if You Want It appears to have been restored to every available edition of that debut album, and I find no evidence online that there was ever a version without it.
And if I rhapsodize about the song to anyone now, they can reach into their pocket for the phone, search for the track, put it in their library and tell Siri to play it on the way home in the car. Sometimes it feels as if streaming services have made a complete mockery of all my years of hard work.
How much do I resent all that? Not a lot, as it turns out. Changes in the music business and life in general ultimately have made the road to streaming pretty easy on me.
I have watched many people of my generation stop listening to most new music after the 1980s. The precious communal experience of rock 'n'roll became more difficult to keep alive in adulthood. For many, music stopped being their ubiquitous life soundtrack at parties, on the radio and everywhere friends gathered.
In the end, it simply stopped playing such a big role for them and became a more occasional and solitary pursuit.
The oppression of too much music was the second nail in the coffin for some. As home technology became easily accessible and the internet offered a more democratic forum for musicians, everyone who thought they had an album in them could get it heard more easily, by more people.
That was a blessing: no longer could record companies, retailers and radio programmers be the sole judges of who you get to hear. The days of there being a handful of important music releases every week we could all agree on would never come back.
But abundance was a curse, too.
Niches proliferated as audiences became hopelessly fragmented. And even putting aside the obvious quality control issues, no one could absorb even all the big-buzz albums. When it was actually my job, as the Montreal Gazette's music critic, to try to keep up with everything, I found there weren't enough hours in the day.
True to the rules of economics, a flooded market began to make the art seem less valuable.
As if technological liberation and musical inflation weren't enough, streaming services have brought the ability to acquire instantly anything you want to hear - or anything you even have a passing thought about - for nothing. And that further cheapened the currency of music. Finding that more-obscure-than-thou album no longer offers a challenge, satisfaction or credibility.
Even at Spotify Premium rates (commercials would be a deal-breaker for me), I have, more or less, the universe of sound for $11 a month. I spent more than that on all those Elton John B-sides that didn't turn up on albums.
But while I feel bad for a generation that will never experience the thrill of the hunt, I'm definitely not the cranky old guy asking these kids to get off my lawn. In fact, I paradoxically have become the happiest resident of a world that allows me to sit back on the couch and use my phone to flip between How Glad I Am by Nancy Wilson (the jazz singer, not the Heart guitarist), the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's psychedelic debut, some early Paul Revere and the Raiders sessions I had heard only on 8-track tape, Can's Monster Movie, the outof-print soundtrack for the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga and Janelle Monáe's Dirty Computer.
And I had no idea I so desperately needed the feature that keeps track of my tastes and helpfully provides a weekly playlist of things I should check out. When you're pointed to a deep-catalogue Turtles track, how long is it going to be before alarm bells go off and you realize that you've never actually heard the full Western Union album by the Five Americans? It's a click away. For the occasional album that can't be found on Spotify (there aren't many, in my experience), other streaming services generally come to the rescue.
With streaming, I'm also being quasi-successful in keeping a one-time storage-space crisis - which led me to unload a large portion of my vinyl and CD collections over the years - under control. I still buy physical discs by a few artists to whom I feel a strong sense of loyalty, such as Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Eels and Nick Lowe. There's an exception for lavishly packaged deluxe reissues of important albums, too. But the flood of jewel boxes and digipaks into my home has largely abated.
In the scope of all this, I don't want to dismiss the serious issue of equitable payment to artists by streaming services, which is highly problematic. Nor do I have any interest in debating sound quality with audiophiles (I'm not one). And I'm not blind to a major Achilles heel that comes with streaming: the random, though seemingly infrequent, disappearance of tracks - even entire albums - when permission to use is withdrawn by rights holders. Roy Budd's beyond-cool soundtrack to the 1971 crime drama Get Carter, for example, was in my library one day, gone the next. Will the Kinks be there indefinitely? Still, I tend to evangelize about streaming - not blindly, but strictly as an insatiable music consumer.
In the end, having such unprecedented musical access has deepened and broadened my interests. Phone pointed at my sound system, I sometimes find myself free-associating into the wee hours, creating new playlists and adding to old ones - some of which last longer than a drive to Maine - and fretting that I'll still be at it as it gets light outside.
Maybe there's not a world of difference between the pop nerd of yesteryear and the modern-day version. The geekery simply has moved from the discontinued-record bins to the iPhone. I still seek out pop esoterica all the time. It's just that now, the process only takes a few seconds.
But I have to admit, there are times I miss the waiting. bperusse@gmail.com

Full text: The 1938 spring breakup in the Montreal region was a difficult one, with ice jams and widespread flooding.
This photograph, published on Monday, March 28, 1938, shows river ice "in a playful mood," the caption writer observed, perhaps a little too cheerfully. In fact, the ice was piled up higher than the top of an automobile on the highway between Montreal and La Prairie.
A second photograph showed ice that had jammed against the Victoria Bridge two days earlier, although "bridge authorities reported that the bridge did not suffer any strain."
Photographic evidence to the contrary, the situation was beginning to ease.
"Flood is on the wane in Montreal area," the Montreal Gazette reported in a headline that day. It was an era of multiple headlines on every story. Here is what the other ones on the flood story said.
"Two Cartierville streets still under water but freshet receding"
"STE. THERESE NOW CLEAR"
"Chateauguay, St. Jerome and other points all report improvement - road conditions slightly better"
The article reported that the cellars of many homes in Cartierville were still filled with water but residents were able to access their houses via makeshift bridges made of planks. Dynamite was used to break up the jammed ice near Pont Viau and in Ste-Thérèse, reducing the problems.
By mid-week, the floods had disappeared from the pages of the Gazette, supplanted by news about the return of animals to the zoo at Lafontaine Park (March 31) and an anti-Fascist riot on Stanley St. (April 2).

Full text: Montreal Gazette journalist Aaron Derfel has been nominated for a National Newspaper Award for exposing violence against workers at the Montreal General Hospital.
Called Hospital (In)security( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-anatomy-of-a-nurse-attack-at-montreal-general ), the four-part series published starting in January 2018 chronicled a 2017 incident in which a nurse in the psychiatric emergency room was violently attacked and almost killed by a patient at 3:35 a.m., and a security guard was not present because the hospital had determined that one was not necessary. The investigation showed the hospital had more incidents but less security than comparable institutions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-new-safety-concerns-arise-at-montreal-general ), scaled back proposed training to deal with such incidents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-montreal-general-scales-back-code-white-training-plan ), and that such acts of violence were far from rare( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-when-a-nurse-is-attacked-others-suffer-too ).
"It is quite an honour to receive this recognition," Derfel said. "I'd like to thank my sources in the health network who showed great courage in speaking out about such an important matter of public interest."
Derfel's nomination in the investigations category( http://nna-ccj.ca/finalists-announced-for-the-70th-national-newspaper-awards/ ) is among 14 for Postmedia's journalists for the awards recognizing excellence in daily newspaper work in Canada.
Zane Schwartz was nominated in the prestigious Project of the Year category for Follow The Money( https://special.nationalpost.com/follow-the-money/feature ), an 18-month-long investigative project he worked on as the recipient of Postmedia's 2017 Michelle Lang Fellowship in Journalism. Schwartz gathered 5 million records from governments across the country to create the first searchable database of federal, provincial and territorial political donations.
The Saskatoon StarPhoenix received three nominations, with Kevin Mitchell recognized for his coverage of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash and its aftermath and Kayle Neis nominated in the news photo category for a photo of a Broncos memorial. StarPhoenix editor-in-chief Heather Persson was also nominated for editorial writing.
Postmedia journalists in Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton, Vancouver and London also received nominations.
"This year's nominations reflect the excellent work that is being done in our newsrooms across the country," said Lucinda Chodan, vice-president editorial for Postmedia. "The categories we are nominated in - from editorial writing and photography to investigative and explanatory work - are a testament to the breadth and strength of the journalism we practise."
The Globe and Mail secured the most nominations with 20, followed by the Toronto Star and Montreal's La Presse, each nominated six times.
The National Newspaper Awards, celebrating their 70th year, will be handed out at a ceremony in Toronto on May 3. The awards are given to daily newspapers, news agencies and online news sites that the NNA board of governors approve for entry.

When does spring start?

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."

The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ); the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).
"I don't want to sound alarmist, but because of the snow levels we're following things pretty closely."
In summary: hope is on the horizon, but don't let your guard down.

Quebec in 2018: CAQ's rise as steep as old parties' fall

Full text: QUEBEC - It was a year of political change in Quebec - big political change.
If 2017 was marked by doubts about the staying power of François Legault's fledgling Coalition Avenir Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-francois-legault-is-a-pragmatist-at-heart ) party, 2018 proved the naysayers wrong as his party swept the Oct. 1 provincial election in stunning fashion.
The CAQ blue wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-legault-rides-caqs-wave-couillard-in-reflection ), more of a political tsunami, swept across the province as Quebecers decided it was the right vehicle - certainly the least risky option - for the change they craved after about 12 year of Liberal government.
The results of that decision left the two traditional parties, the Liberals and Parti Québécois, in tatters. For the first time in about 50 years, neither of them formed a government. Quebec had its first CAQ government ever.
While the PQ was wiped off the map in Montreal and reduced to 10 seats province-wide, the Liberals lost everywhere east of St-Lambert with the exception of the Quebec City riding of Jean-Talon as francophones voted massively for the CAQ.
The final score was CAQ 74 seats, Liberals 29, PQ 10, Québec solidaire 10, one independent. The icing on the cake for the CAQ came Dec. 10 when they won a by-election in the riding of Roberval,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-wins-byelection-to-replace-philippe-couillard-in-roberval ) bringing its new total to 75 MNAs.
With Legault's star rising, others fell. PQ Leader Jean-François Liseé( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/jean-francois-lisee-refuses-to-concede-he-made-mistakes-in-campaign ) quit from the stage on election night. Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/couillard-to-resign-as-quebec-premier-today-after-stunning-liberal-loss ) followed him out the door a few days later. Both parties are now in reflection over their future, looking for ways to reconnect with voters.
The only folks to not get aboard the CAQ bandwagon were those in the English-speaking community. Without the sovereignty issue to motivate them, many just sat out the vote or voted Liberal as usual.
That same desire for change allowed the small left-wing Québec solidaire( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-quebec-solidaire-triples-its-caucus ) party to make an electoral breakthrough off the island of Montreal. Despite a good start, the QS year ended with the party embroiled in a controversy over the attire( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/docs-in-the-legislature-national-assembly-to-re-examine-dress-code ) of some of its new MNAs in the legislature.
IDENTITY POLITICS CONTINUES TO THRIVE
The CAQ campaigned saying it would reduce Quebec's immigration influx from 50,000 a year to 40,000 and it made good on the promise - at least on paper. But with the federal government controlling family unification and refugee programs, much remains to happen before the CAQ actually hits that target. Arduous negotiations are underway.
At the same time, Legault has stated categorically that his government will proceed with a ban on religious symbols( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/no-grandfather-clause-for-religious-symbols-premier-legault-says-as-national-assembly-reconvenes ) for persons in authority such as judges, police officers and prison guards. During the campaign Legault said action on the issue was urgent but once in power it discovered drafting such legislation is complicated. Now the government says it will table it in the new year, a plan confirmed by Legault in a year-end interview( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-defends-plans-to-ban-religious-symbols-replace-school-boards ) with the Montreal Gazette.
Meanwhile, the former Liberal government's plan for face coverings, Bill 62( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bill-62-quebec-court-to-hear-challenge-to-face-covering-law-friday ), is on hold as a result of a court challenge.
REEFER MADNESS GRIPS QUEBEC
Cannabis became legal in Canada Oct. 17. Despite plenty of media hype, it was more or less a non-event, with no major security issues or incidents to speak of. In fact, the only problem to emerge was the shortage of the product at Quebec's cannabis stores( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/itll-be-a-few-months-before-quebec-cannabis-stores-open-full-time-sqdc ). After initial long lines and a flood of online orders, the Société québécoise du cannabis decided it could only operate from Thursday to Sunday.
But while the rest of the country has moved on to other themes now that cannabis is legal, the new CAQ government moved on its election promise to revisit the issue. The Liberals' legislation, Bill 157( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-passes-probably-not-perfect-pot-bill ), set 18 as the legal age but just before the legislature recessed for Christmas, CAQ junior health and social services minister Lionel Carmant( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/cannabis-caqs-bill-2-would-raise-age-of-consumption-to-21-from-18 ) presented a bill to increase the age to 21.
PUBLIC FINANCES
The Liberals paid a price for wanting to fix the province's books with their austerity agenda but it means the new CAQ government arrvied in office with money to burn. In December, new CAQ Finance Minister Eric Girard presented a fiscal update( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-quebecs-prudent-economic-update-leaves-critics-saying-is-that-all-there-is ) that revealed Quebec's surplus in 2018-2019 will be $1.65 billion. It's that kind of money that will help the CAQ deliver on a key $700-$900 million election promise to create a flat school board tax( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-government-tables-bill-creating-flat-school-tax-for-quebec ) in 2019.
Legault's new problem for 2019 will be managing expectations.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-caq-expected-to-act-quickly-on-cannabis-legal-age-school-taxes )
LEGAULT JOINS THE 'CANADIAN CLUB'
As the year wound down, Legault, as Quebec's new premier, made his first foray into the workings of the federal system attending a meeting of the first ministers in Montreal. While some of the other premiers were squabbling with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over Ottawa's carbon tax, Legault quietly went about his business. His one slip, referring to Alberta's oil exports as "dirty energy," compared to Quebec's clean hydro energy. Reporters from English Canada struggled to get a handle on what Legault is about with one journalist referring to him as the 'wild card," of the meeting, and 'a conservative with an environmental agenda."
SOME KEY PLAYERS PASSED AWAY
The year was also marked by the deaths of many, many provincial politicians who, in their time, were household names. Among those who passed away last year were Paul Gérin-Lajoie, John Ciaccia, Lise Payette, Élaine Zakaïb, Louis O'Neill, Richard Le Hir( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-pq-cabinet-minister-richard-le-hir-dies-at-71 ) and Bernard Landry,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bernard-landry-funeral-dignitaries-gather-to-remember-former-premier ) the former premier.

Full text: "It's about the image, about an immediate emotional response."
Jack Lazare was trying to describe what makes him want to buy a work of photography, and to share it with as many people as possible. If he was having a bit of trouble articulating the criteria, perhaps it's because it's not an intellectual thing.
"I've realized lately that I'm guided subconsciously by the Keats poem (Ode on a Grecian Urn) that says, 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' " said the Montreal collector. "Any image can be beautiful if it's true."
Lazare, 83, was bitten by the photography bug relatively recently. Having done well in the travel business, and before that as a key player in the nascent Canadian music industry( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/showbiz-legends-donald-k-donald-and-terry-flood-receive-2012-mmf-canada-pioneer-award ) (in the 1970s he co-founded Aquarius Records, home to April Wine and Corey Hart), his eye was caught about 20 years ago when his daughter bought a photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron.
"That's what set me off," Lazare recalled. "I've been gradually accumulating work since then."
Julia Margaret Cameron is the star of the show by photo count, with 14 pieces, including the 1867 photograph Mary Mother.
The results of Lazare's obsession are on full display in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/museums )' remarkable new exhibition Of Individuals and Places: Photographs From the Lazare Collection. Close to 100 photographs - from the dawn of the form in the 19th century to the present day, in sizes ranging from the minuscule to the monumental and in every imaginable representational style - are united not by any forced thematic remit, but by one person's vision. Visitors are encouraged to budget more of their day than they might expect: you can find yourself forgetting about time as you stand in front of these images and ponder their truth.
"Some people say they see a sense of melancholy, of loneliness," Lazare said when asked if there's an esthetic through line in what is, on the surface, a wide-ranging collection both historically and stylistically. And while Lazare only came to see the thread in retrospect, there's something to it: human subjects here are typically seen alone, often with their back to the camera, looking at odds with their environments. Occasionally, as in Willie Doherty's Non-Specific Threat VI (Unforgiving Ruthlessness), showing a subject who looks like a cross between Joaquin Phoenix and John Malkovich having a bad day, a palpable sense of unease emanates from the image. Roads, horizon lines and transit also figure frequently.
Twentieth-century images don't get more iconic than the black-and-white work of Dorothea Lange, whose Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California, included in the show along with six other works of hers, has come to stand in the collective mind's eye as an encapsulation of the Great Depression.
Dorothea Lange's iconic Depression-era images include Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California.
Also represented are modern giants Diane Arbus, Nan Goldin, Gordon Parks and Robert Frank. (The last named, best known for his candid studies of the American underclass, is counterintuitively represented here by a photograph taken in Venice.) Montreal's thriving scene is spotlit with works by Pascal Grandmaison, Nicolas Baier, Angela Grauerholz and others.
The star of the show by photo count, with 14 pieces, is the aforementioned Cameron. A contemporary of Lewis Carroll (they both took pictures of the famous Alice) and a next-door neighbour of Tennyson, she was at the centre of a historically fecund scene. The Guardian recently referred to her as the greatest artist of the Victorian age.
"She got her first camera around 1850, a time when photography was exploding, and she was tremendously aggressive with it," Lazare said. "Anyone anywhere near her was asked to sit (for a portrait), which in those days was no small matter, requiring a long time. She invented techniques such as the close-up, and employed a kind of blurred effect which was criticized at the time for not being precise, but which was quite deliberate."
Beyond the current show, Lazare's enthusiasm shows no sign of flagging. He's in a position where he can plan his travels around his passion: in addition to frequent photo-hunting visits to London and New York, he has been a regular for the past decade at Paris Photo, the massive annual fair where nearly 200 galleries specializing exclusively in photography display their wares.
Nicolas Baier's 2004 photo An Afternoon on de Gaspe is among the Montreal works displayed in Of Individuals and Places.
"The crowds in the Grand Palais are huge, but you adjust to that," he said. "You meet dealers, they show you things, you learn from them. I enjoy it all tremendously."
A portion of the new show is taken from a group of 33 photographs that were not loaned for the exhibit, but donated outright to the museum( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/doctors-can-soon-prescribe-visits-to-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts ) last year - an act that has brought the MMFA's long-held wish to have a wing devoted entirely to photography measurably closer to reality.
"We've been growing our focus on photography considerably since about 2010," said curator Diane Charbonneau, who worked closely with Lazare in setting up Of Individuals and Places. "Our (2016-17) Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition was a big part of that, and this one is a continuation."
As for Lazare, he'll make a point of attending the show himself during regular hours to get a sense of how people are responding. It's all part of his conviction that photographs, by their very nature, are for being seen - and not just by their owners. In the same spirit, he resisted specifying any individual favourites.
"They're all my children," he said. "It has given me great pleasure to live with these images, and I'm delighted to be able to share them."
AT A GLANCE
Of Individuals and Places: Photographs From the Lazare Collection continues through April 28 at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Jean-Noël Desmarais Pavilion, Contemporary Art Square, 1380 Sherbrooke St. W. For more information, see mbam.qc.ca( https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/exhibitions/on-view/lazare-collection/ ).
Willie Doherty's Non-Specific Threat VI (Unforgiving Ruthlessness) gives off a palpable sense of unease.
A COLLECTION OF LOCAL GREATS
Collectors are the secret heroes of the art world, serving as patrons, custodians and evangelists for the works they gather. In Montreal, Jack Lazare has been far from alone in his mission. Here are a few of his fellow devotees.
Blema and Arnold Steinberg
The late couple (he was McGill University( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/mcgill-university )'s first Jewish chancellor, she a professor emeritus at the same school) were models of enlightened philanthropy, and were among only a handful of Canadians ever named by ArtNews magazine to its prestigious worldwide list of Top 200 Collectors.
Paul Maréchal
An art historian, gallery owner and pop art enthusiast, Maréchal is an international authority on Andy Warhol. This year his extensive collection was mined for Andy Warhol Ephemera, an acclaimed exhibition of the artist's illustration work at the Musée de l'imprimerie in Lyon.
Robert Landau
A stone's throw from the MMFA on Sherbrooke St., Landau Fine Art is the local public manifestation of an international life in art that has seen Landau rise to the highest echelons of a high-rolling world. In 2015 a Montreal Gazette feature described him offering a Henry Moore for auction in Europe at $35 million( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-montrealer-at-pinnacle-of-art-dealing-world ), and that's not atypical.
Lillian Mauer
Former proprietor of the gallery Lillian Mauer Contemporary Art( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/museums ), her tastes run to the contemporary cutting edge, with a particular fondness for the multidisciplinary and the socially engaged.
François Rochon
President and founder of Giverny Capital, Rochon started collecting as a child, and his interests range from impressionism to the most challenging of contemporary sub-genres. In a 2011 interview with La Presse, he said: "Buying a work of art is not an investment. It shows how we see life at a given moment."

Supply snags mean SQDC outlets will open Thursday-Sunday only

Full text: After only nine days of operations, the Société québécoise du cannabis announced on Friday that a lack of supply has forced it to reduce the operating hours of its 12 sales outlets to four days a week.
Beginning Monday and until further notice, the dozen SQDC stores in Quebec will be closed Monday to Wednesday and open during scheduled operating hours from Thursday to Sunday. The decision to reduce the operating schedule came after supply problems - present from the day the stores opened on Oct. 17 - grew increasingly worse.
As of Friday morning, more than 50 of the 68 products listed for sale on the SQDC's website were out of stock. The agency hopes the new schedule will allow outlets to "stabilize" their inventories. The SQDC said its online store will remain open, with an average of about 30 products available. Delivery will take about two to five days.
The SQDC said cannabis producers have a "colossal" job ahead of them to fill the orders it has placed.
"We're dealing with massive pent-up demand," said Allan Rewak, the executive director of the Cannabis Council of Canada, an industry association. "We've had prohibition for 90 years and when you open the tap, so to speak, there's going to be an initial flood of enthusiasm that is in excess of normal enthusiasm."
Intermittent supply issues could continue for the first year, but they are a symptom of the industry's success, he said. Limiting store hours and supply problems have raised the ire of one of the unions that has applied to represent the SQDC workers. The FTQ-affiliated Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (SCFP) has accused the SQDC of "mismanagement" and said it fears for the security of jobs, leaving the new workers in a precarious situation. In a statement issued Friday, the SQDC said no layoffs would occur because of the schedule change and that employees would also be working on days when the stores were closed in order to process deliveries.

Full text: After only nine days of operations, the Société québécoise du cannabis( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/marijuana ) announced on Friday that a lack of supply has forced it to reduce the operating hours of its 12 sales outlets to four days a week.
Beginning Monday and until further notice, the dozen SQDC stores in Quebec will be closed Monday to Wednesday and open during scheduled operating hours from Thursday to Sunday.
The decision to reduce the operating schedule came after supply problems - present from the day the stores opened( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/day-1-selfie-factor-likely-boosted-demand-for-cannabis-professor-says ) on Oct. 17 - grew increasingly worse throughout the week.
As of Friday morning, more than 50 of the 68 products listed for sale on the SQDC's website were out of stock. The agency hopes the new schedule will allow outlets to "stabilize" their inventories.
The SQDC said its online store( https://www.sqdc.ca/en-CA/ ) will remain open, with an average of about 30 products available. Delivery will take about two to five days.
The agency said there are cannabis supply problems across the country. It said it has signed supply agreements of three years or longer with producers and placed orders to meet the expected demand for cannabis in the first trimester of its operations. The SQDC said cannabis producers have a "colossal" job ahead of them to fill the orders it has placed.
"We're dealing with massive pent-up demand," said Allan Rewak, the executive director of the Cannabis Council of Canada, an industry association. "We've had prohibition for 90 years and when you open the tap, so to speak, there's going to be an initial flood of enthusiasm that in excess of normal enthusiasm."
Intermittent supply issues could continue for the first year, but they are a symptom of the industry's success, he said.
"It was impossible to accurately predict with 100 per cent certainty what the demand would be, but it has to be understood, too, that it's not like we've sold out of legal cannabis, we might sell out in a store, we might sell out in a certain strain, but it's not like licensed producers do not have, depending on the producer, more cannabis in their inventory," Rewak said.
Limiting store hours and supply problems have raised the ire of one of the unions that has applied to represent the SQDC workers. The FTQ-affiliated Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (SCFP) has accused the SQDC of "mismanagement" and said it fears for the security of jobs, leaving the new workers in a precarious situation.
However in a statement issued Friday the SQDC said that no layoffs would occur because of the schedule change and that employees would also be working on days when the stores were closed in order to process product deliveries.
But the agency also warned that while the curtailed store schedules would allow outlets to re-stock their shelves, it was always possible that not every product would be immediately re-supplied.

Legault sticks to plan on religious symbols despite Taylor's view

Full text: QUEBEC - Despite the criticism of one of the Bouchard-Taylor report's authors, Premier François Legault says the majority of Quebecers back his government's plan to ban religious symbols for some authority figures.
Legault said Charles Taylor has the right to change his mind about the report he signed in 2008 but things have evolved considerably since then. Taylor's view is the opinion of one man.
"We have to realize after the tabling of this report, support was quite large in Quebec," Legault said at his first full news conference since being sworn in as premier( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-legault-vows-to-govern-with-human-touch-but-trouble-looms ) Thursday. "That's more important than the support of one person.
"What is important is how the Bouchard-Taylor report was received by the population. There was good support, wide support.
"I understand Mr. Taylor doesn't support this report any more, it's his choice, but still the population agrees with this."
Legault was responding to comments Taylor made in an interview with the Montreal Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/dangerous-appalling-divisive-destructive-charles-taylor-on-the-caqs-religious-symbols-plan ). Taylor slammed the Coalition Avenir Québec government's plan to ban religious symbols for authority figures; judges, police officers, correctional officers and crown prosecutors.
The CAQ also wants to extend the ban to elementary, high school and CEGEP teachers even if that was not part of the original recommendations of the Bouchard-Taylor report.
"Dangerous, appalling, divisive, destructive - choose your epithet," Taylor said. "I mean it's just a terrible mistake we're moving into.
"In all societies, when a lot of people come in with unfamiliar cultures and so, people are nervous and afraid of it. They're not exactly sure what they're afraid of but they are. So you can appeal to them by saying, 'Well we're going to put restrictions on them or stop them.'
"And (Legault) in fact is doing both - he's saying we're going to cut down on immigration in general and the especially worrisome people we're going to put limits on."
Legault, however, said that while the CAQ plan goes beyond what Bouchard-Taylor recommended, that is what the party campaigned on so there has been no deceit.
"We have debated this a lot," Legault said. "I think there's a consensus in Quebec. Our position was very clear in the election campaign. We will put this in place.
"It's him who changed his mind. He signed this report. When I talk about our proposals, usually I don't talk about the Bouchard-Taylor report because we changed it. We want to add teachers to our proposal so it's a different proposal."
Legault repeated a number of times that while he is open to discussions, the CAQ's vision has not changed on this issue.
The same goes for the crucifix( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/crucifix-will-stay-in-quebecs-national-assembly-caq-says ) hanging over the speaker's chair in the National Assembly, Legault noted. The CAQ considers that cross a historical artifact( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-bishops-maintain-crucifix-is-a-religious-symbol-not-a-souvenir ) and it will stay.
"Our position is clear," Legault said. "The crucifix will stay."
Legault also announced the National Assembly will be recalled Nov. 27.
His government plans to present a number of bills - including the one on secularism - before Christmas. The session is expected to last only a few weeks.
Although Legault said he is still determined to increase the legal age to consume cannabis from 18 to 21, that also requires a bill.
Finance Minister Éric Girard also plans to present an economic update before the holiday break.
And in one of his first decisions, Legault promised to reform Quebec's system for compensating victims of natural disasters.
To that end, on Friday Legault will visit the city of Gatineau in West Quebec, which was ravaged by tornadoes in September.
"I am not satisfied with the way things are working at this moment," Legault said at a news conference held in the lobby of the premier's office.
He said he has ordered Quebec's new Public Security Minister Geneviève Guibault to prepare a new program which will eliminate bureaucratic delays, which can drag on for years for victims.
He said that some victims( https://montrealgazette.com/news/christmas-will-be-spent-in-hotel-lobbies-for-some-quebec-flood-victims ) of 2017 flooding will be waiting until 2019 for compensation.
"That means two and a half years," he said. "You can imagine the stress of people who have been wiped out or have lost a good part of things they have spent a lifetime accumulating.
"For me this is unacceptable."

Quebec election update: $1 million donated and leaders united in Gatineau

Full text: GATINEAU - Hours after a tornado ripped through Gatineau, two rivals put political differences aside to visit the disaster zone Saturday morning.
Jean-François Lisée and Philippe Couillard walked shoulder to shoulder through a neighbourhood covered in debris.
Roofing, broken glass and bricks lay scattered across the street, the storm ripped balconies from apartment buildings and forced hundreds from their homes.
"Today our presence here is about showing our solidarity," said Lisée, the leader of the Parti Québécois. "People saw their roofs blown away, they saw their walls crumble, they feared for their lives.
"We can campaign tomorrow but today we're here for them, we're here to say all of Quebec is here with you."
Couillard, the incumbent Liberal premier, announced a $1 million donation from the government to the Red Cross( http://www.redcross.ca/ ) to make sure people displaced by the tornado have somewhere to stay over the weekend.
There were about 1,600 people forced from their homes overnight, according to Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin. As of Saturday morning, over 600 people were still in emergency shelters or staying with family.
Couillard said it was a miracle that, given the scale of storm, no one sustained life-threatening injuries or died.
"It is affecting to see that, many of the people forced from their homes, they're not exactly at the top of the economic ladder," he said. "It's like they've been hit twice: They're less fortunate than others and now they've been hit by this storm."
Stéphane Tremblay was cleaning out his mother's apartment Friday when the wind gusts started to roll through. He says he looked out the window and saw roof shingles begin to fly before deciding to take cover behind a wall.
"A stick flew right through the window and everything shattered," said Tremblay. "There was glass everywhere."
Tremblay's mother recently passed away but his aunt, who lives in the same building, is staying with a relative until she's allowed back into her home.
After massive flooding in May 2017 and torrential rain last spring and fall, this is the fourth major weather event to hit Gatineau in the past 16 months.
Lisée and Couillard said this highlights the need for political parties to fight climate change.
Meanwhile, Coalition Avenir Québec's François Legault cancelled his scheduled activities Saturday to meet those affected by the storm( http://www.redcross.ca/ ). A representative for Québec solidaire said co-spokesperson Manon Massé would also be heading to the Ottawa-Gatineau area.
Hydro-Québec technicians and first responders are still on the scene, working to clear the wreckage and restore power to the tens of thousands still in the dark.
Asked if the presence of politicians and dozens of journalists might actually harm these efforts, Mayor Pedneaud-Jobin said he was heartened by their presence.
"You can't underestimate what it means - in the middle of an electoral campaign - to see the leaders on the ground," said Pedneaud-Jobin. "It sends a great message of solidarity.
"There's also a direct communication with (the premier and MNAs) that helps. There's a difference between directing a crisis from an office and being here on the ground."
As the leaders left the disaster zone, one resident shouted epithets at them, telling them to "get the f-k out of here!" Some voiced frustration at the unfolding crisis given that many are still recovering from last year's flood.
Lisée acknowledged there's work to be done in the government's long-term response but insisted that the immediate response to the tornado has been "excellent."
"It's been lightning-quick," he said. "There's a solidarity among Quebecers - of all political stripes - that's incredible to see in times like these."
After visiting a local high school and emergency command centre, Lisée hopped back on his bus and headed to Montreal to resume his campaign.
Jacob Serebrin and Canadian Press contributed to this story, which will be updated.

Full text: GATINEAU - Hours after a tornado ripped through Gatineau, two rivals put political differences aside to visit the disaster zone Saturday morning.
Jean-François Lisée and Philippe Couillard walked shoulder to shoulder through a neighbourhood covered in debris.
Roofing, broken glass and bricks lay scattered across the street, the storm ripped balconies from apartment buildings and forced hundreds from their homes.
"Today our presence here is about showing our solidarity," said Lisée, the leader of the Parti Québécois. "People saw their roofs blown away, they saw their walls crumble, they feared for their lives.
"We can campaign tomorrow but today we're here for them, we're here to say all of Quebec is here with you."
Couillard, the incumbent Liberal premier, announced a $1 million donation from the government to the Red Cross( http://www.redcross.ca/ ) to make sure people displaced by the tornado have somewhere to stay over the weekend.
There were about 1,600 people forced from their homes overnight, according to Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin. As of Saturday morning, over 600 people were still in emergency shelters or staying with family.
Couillard said it was a miracle that, given the scale of storm, no one sustained life-threatening injuries or died.
"It is affecting to see that, many of the people forced from their homes, they're not exactly at the top of the economic ladder," he said. "It's like they've been hit twice: They're less fortunate than others and now they've been hit by this storm."
Stéphane Tremblay was cleaning out his mother's apartment Friday when the wind gusts started to roll through. He says he looked out the window and saw roof shingles begin to fly before deciding to take cover behind a wall.
"A stick flew right through the window and everything shattered," said Tremblay. "There was glass everywhere."
Tremblay's mother recently passed away but his aunt, who lives in the same building, is staying with a relative until she's allowed back into her home.
After massive flooding in May 2017 and torrential rain last spring and fall, this is the fourth major weather event to hit Gatineau in the past 16 months.
Lisée and Couillard said this highlights the need for political parties to fight climate change.
Meanwhile, Coalition Avenir Québec's François Legault cancelled his scheduled activities Saturday to meet those affected by the storm( http://www.redcross.ca/ ). A representative for Québec solidaire said co-spokesperson Manon Massé would also be heading to the Ottawa-Gatineau area.
Hydro-Québec technicians and first responders are still on the scene, working to clear the wreckage and restore power to the tens of thousands still in the dark.
Asked if the presence of politicians and dozens of journalists might actually harm these efforts, Mayor Pedneaud-Jobin said he was heartened by their presence.
"You can't underestimate what it means - in the middle of an electoral campaign - to see the leaders on the ground," said Pedneaud-Jobin. "It sends a great message of solidarity.
"There's also a direct communication with (the premier and MNAs) that helps. There's a difference between directing a crisis from an office and being here on the ground."
As the leaders left the disaster zone, one resident shouted epithets at them, telling them to "get the f-k out of here!" Some voiced frustration at the unfolding crisis given that many are still recovering from last year's flood.
Lisée acknowledged there's work to be done in the government's long-term response but insisted that the immediate response to the tornado has been "excellent."
"It's been lightning-quick," he said. "There's a solidarity among Quebecers - of all political stripes - that's incredible to see in times like these."
After visiting a local high school and emergency command centre, Lisée hopped back on his bus and headed to Montreal to resume his campaign.

Quebec election: First Nations want to help fill labour shortage

Author: Curtis, Christopher

Full text: What if politicians looked to First Nations as an asset to Quebec's economy?
Since the beginning of the provincial election campaign last month, Chief Ghislain Picard has been dogging Quebec's party leaders with that question.
While the province is aging itself out of the labour market, there aren't enough skilled workers to replace them. Given that 55 per cent of Quebec's 140,000 Indigenous people are under 25 years old, it would seem logical to tap into that growing segment of the population.
Picard has been relentless on this point for weeks and it appeared to finally pay off Monday during the second leaders' debate.
"The labour shortage (in Quebec) is real and there are real ways to address it: First Nations, for example," Parti Québécois leader Jean-François Lisée said at the debate.
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard reiterated the point.
"Yesterday, I had the pleasure of seeing two party leaders finally recognize that we have an active, young population and we're ready to work," said Picard, Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Labrador-Quebec.
"First Nations are finally part of the conversation ... but we need more than just words."
While there is vast potential for Indigenous youth in Quebec, the living conditions on some remote First Nations are abysmal; education is chronically underfunded, housing shortages are rampant and access to health care is a consistent problem.
Lisée has committed to meeting with Picard and chiefs from across the province within the first 100 days of forming government.
"If we're going to come up with solutions it'll have to be together," Lisée said. "These aren't just meetings to say hello; we'll sit down and start to see how we can tackle these problems."
Lisée, in particular, has drawn praise from Picard. The PQ leader was the first to accept his invitation to a chiefs summit and has put his weight behinda clean energy project that could create 400 jobs on the Innu territory.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-for-the-innu-wind-farm-is-a-chance-to-repair-old-wounds )
He's also spoken out against new hydro electric dams that would flood and destroy large swaths of Indigenous hunting grounds. He's attacked Coalition Avenir Québec Leader François Legault for supporting new dam projects.
"Legault thinks he can just build dams on (Indigenous territory) and be greeted positively? Good luck with that," Lisée said Tuesday. "He's insulting First Nations."
Earlier in the campaign, he said a PQ government would look into establishing a parliamentary commission on high suicide rates and the housing crisis in Quebec's 14 Inuit villages.
So far, though, the PQ leader hasn't set aside any concrete promises or real political capital to back the talk.
"I know a priority, for Chief Picard, is making sure First Nations are a part our solution to the labour shortage," Lisée said. "Now how do we get that done and what are the right projects? Well we have to develop that together.
"We'll have 100 days, after forming the government, to get prepared and we plan on being ready."
There are reasons to be hopeful for Indigenous youth in Quebec. More First Nations and Inuit are enrolled in the province's universities than ever before.
Increasingly, children who grow up in the Inuit territory are learning French, English and Inuktitut.
Mayors in Quebec's faraway cities are also looking to the young, growing Indigenous population in nearby reserves to help address their labour shortages.
A few mayors lobbied the PQ leader at a meeting in Quebec City last week and raised the prospect of training programs for Indigenous youth.
But this opportunity requires an investment in education, crime prevention and a variety of health resources that don't exist in these communities. Though much of this funding comes from Ottawa, Quebec plays a role as well.
"I've met with (some) communities. In Abitibi, there's innovative projects that partner Sûreté du Québec officers and Indigenous police," Lisée said. "Those are great projects. But the challenges vary from community to community and the only way to sort that out is to meet."
In other words, there's little in the way of costed, verifiable promises.
Any conversation about labour and the economy starts with an even tougher conversation about land rights, Picard said, in a nod to the difficulties that lie ahead.
"But first, we just have to talk."

Jack Todd: This time, Nike is on the right side of history

Full text: The slogan is brilliant: "Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything."
The commercial, using former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a new kind of pitchman for Nike, is both brilliant and courageous.
And it matters. If you don't believe it, look at Lance Armstrong, who was able to carry on cheating in the face of doping authorities and lawsuits until Nike pulled the rug out from under him. Nike has real power - and this time, the corporation is using that power the right way.
As the National Football League took the field Sunday for its first full slate of games, it seemed the sports world was talking about nothing else. Even Fox News was forced to report that Nike's sales had surged 31 per cent in the wake of the ad controversy. Let the social media whackos film themselves burning Nike products: Nike and Kaepernick have clearly won this round, a watershed moment at the intersection of sports and social movements that goes back at least as far as the boxer Jack Johnson at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Kaepernick commercial is even big enough to take on, indirectly, the biggest pitchman Nike itself has ever had: Michael Jordan. "Don't become the best basketball player on the planet," Kaepernick intones, as the image cuts to LeBron James. "Be bigger than basketball."
That statement is as clear a signal as you could have that the era of Jordan and Tiger Woods is over, even as Woods continues to struggle against Father Time. Woods and Jordan were great athletes who made hundreds of millions of dollars while refusing to take a stand that might alienate the products they endorse. As Jordan said at the time, "racists wear Nikes too."
It's no longer enough to donate your tax-deductible dollars to a children's charity to burnish your image while refusing to take a political stand. The courage of Kaepernick and Eric Reid and the dozens of others who have chosen to follow them harkens back to the 1960s, to Muhammad Ali declaring that "I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Congs" before refusing to step forward for the draft when called in Houston.
The step Ali refused to take was surely as big as the step Neil Armstrong took on the moon: a step not taken for all mankind. Kaepernick, acting at a time when his country is divided as it has not been divided since the Civil War, is the legitimate heir to Ali. He is following the example and inspiration of athletes as diverse as Jim Thorpe, Jack Johnson, Joe Louis, Babe Didrikson, Jackie Robinson, Wilma Rudolph, Curt Flood, Tommy Smith, John Carlos and Ali.
Athletes of colour have all, in their various ways, had to face down the mob. This time, Kaepernick and Reid and their fellow athletes are facing an unprecedented opponent, a mob led directly from the White House itself, with Donald Trump himself acting as the spokesperson and head cheerleader for the mob.
The cause they support, the Black Lives Matter movement, is simple. It derives from the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. By insisting that black lives do matter, the protesters are calling attention to the most basic right of all, the right to go through a simple traffic stop without getting shot and killed.
The phoney, chest-thumping "patriots" who see nothing wrong with using a giant flag to sell everything from used cars to the brutality of the NFL have a huge problem with this most peaceful of protests: Taking a knee. But the athletes who choose to take part aren't attacking the flag or the anthem: They are using their position to speak out, albeit in silence - to call attention to an ongoing national tragedy and the profoundly unjust and racist system behind it.
By tacitly lending its support to the movement, Nike has taken a stand. Behind that stand, without doubt, there was a hard-headed business decision. Kaepernick is seen in a positive light by 70 per cent of consumers under the age of 40 - the demographic that actually buys Nikes, while old fogeys like myself shuffle around in our $19 bargain table specials, muttering about these ungrateful whelps refusing to stand for the anthem.
Those on the wrong side of the great divide will argue that Kaepernick, Reid, Kenny Stills, Albert Wilson, Chris Long and the others who have embraced the movement shouldn't mix politics and sports. But every time a gigantic U.S. flag is trundled out before the anthem and the honour guard representing the various branches of the military marches onto the field, that is a political statement.
For one of the major sponsors behind that commercial and political machine to break ranks by supporting Kaepernick is a watershed moment. This time, Nike is on the right side of history.
Quite beyond the needless controversy, there are messages for young people in that commercial that transcend everything, even politics. "Don't ask if your dreams are crazy," Kaepernick says. "Ask if they're crazy enough."
Crazy enough to challenge NFL owners, crazy enough to challenge the right, crazy enough to challenge a sitting president. Pretty crazy.

Quebec election: CAQ trying to rock Liberal boat in West Island

Full text: Angela Rapoport, the Coalition Avenir Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/caq-election ) candidate for Nelligan( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/documents/pdf/cartesElectorales/2011/411.pdf ), is hoping West Island voters will give the CAQ some consideration in the Oct. 1 provincial election( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-elections ).
Although West Island ridings have traditionally voted Liberal in provincial elections, Rapoport said the CAQ offers voters an alternative to the Liberals and Parti Québécois, two parties that have dominated Quebec's political landscape for nearly half a century.
Rapoport will face a stiff challenge from Liberal candidate Monsef Derraji( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/liberal-candidate-officially-announced-in-nelligan ), who is replacing outgoing Liberal cabinet member Martin Coiteux.
Coiteux was elected in 2014 with 80 per cent of the vote in Nelligan( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/electoral-map/general-information-on-the-provincial-electoral-divisions-2011.php?bsq=411#circ ) (which includes Kirkland, Pierrefonds and Île-Bizard). He served as the minister of public security and municipal affairs in Premier Philippe Couillard's cabinet, but chose to not seek re-election.
With the CAQ leading in province-wide polls, Rapoport, a newcomer to politics, said voters seem open to an alternative this time around.
"The citizens are saying we need a change," said Rapoport, whose professional background is in financial services.
Rapoport, who holds an MBA from McGill University and speaks English, French and Italian, said she is a former Liberal supporter who would like to see politics change in Quebec.
"Before there was no alternative for the anglos and some of the other allophones or the French.
"Now there is a good alternative. I have to say I was Liberal most of my life and that's why I'm joining this team because it promises to make Quebec stronger within Canada and not to hold a referendum."
She also thinks CAQ leader François Legault( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/francois-legault-says-never-never-to-quebec-sovereignty ) will make a good premier.
"I like him as a leader and I think he will get things done.
"I'm extremely comfortable with the CAQ," she added. "I'm a person of conviction and if don't believe in something or a cause, I will not even go there."
Although Rapoport does not live in the riding, she does not think it will hurt her chances of being elected on Oct 1.
"I have family and friends who do," said the Hampstead resident. "I'm familiar with the area ... and I've been going around the riding and meeting people and introducing myself."
Key issues with local voters are transportation, the spring floods of 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), and concerns of the elderly, she said.
She thinks Legault has distanced himself from his past as a PQ minister and sovereigntist.
"At this point, most people are very familiar with the CAQ and François Legault," she said.
"My feeling and the reaction that I got from the population is that it's time for a change."
The CAQ has also named its candidates for the other West Island ridings, which are were all won by the Liberals in 2014.

Laura Azéroual( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/caq-candidate-asks-west-islanders-to-give-francois-legault-a-chance ) will run against Liberal finance minister Carlos Leitão in Robert-Baldwin( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/electoral-map/general-information-on-the-provincial-electoral-divisions-2011.php?bsq=413#circ ) (Dollard-des-Ormeaux) riding, while Karen Hilchey( https://coalitionavenirquebec.org/fr/blog/equipe/karen-hilchey/ ) will face an uphill battle in Jacques-Cartier( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/electoral-map/general-information-on-the-provincial-electoral-divisions-2011.php?bsq=409#circ ) against Greg Kelley( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/another-kelley-to-carry-liberal-torch-in-west-island-riding ), son of outgoing and longtime MNA Geoff Kelley.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-islands-geoff-kelley-calls-it-quits-his-son-is-ready-to-campaign )
Hilchey is a former ministerial assistant of Geoff Kelley( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-veteran-mna-geoffrey-kelley-leaves-office-on-his-own-terms ).

Full text: "Vive l'indépendance du Québec!"
Manon Massé delivered that line with a wink and a smile Friday as she prepared to meet with dairy farmers over the future of supply management in Canada.
One of the sticking points in negotiations for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement could deliver a blow to the province's dairy industry. The United States wants Canada to do away with supply management - a policy that bolsters 120,000 jobs in Quebec's agricultural sector.
Massé, the Québec solidaire co-spokesperson, says this just proves that federalism isn't working for Quebecers.
"When we're not an independent nation, we don't have a seat at the table - it's that simple," said Massé. "Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau has no idea how peeved the people of Quebec will be if this goes forward."
Representatives from Quebec's four major parties were in Longueuil( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-elections-couillard-lisee-and-masse-join-to-support-quebec-farmers ) Friday to meet with the province's farming lobby and show a united front in favour of supply management.
It was a fleeting moment of solidarity during an otherwise raucous election campaign.
Quebec produces about 50 per cent of Canada's dairy, and its agricultural sector is roughly the size of Ontario's automotive industry. To oppose supply management would be political suicide, in other words.
But the conversation also breathes life into the argument that Ottawa has the power to sell out Quebec farmers at the negotiating table, said Parti Québécois Leader Jean-François Lisée.
NAFTA talks are ramping up and there could be a new agreement as of Friday. What appears to be at play right now is a deal that would establish minimum wage for Mexican auto workers - a net benefit for the U.S. and Ontario - but one that could also open Quebec's markets to a flood of foreign dairy products.
"Quebec has been abandoned again, and now we have to present a united front to make sure Canada doesn't abandon us again," said Lisée. "If to win a better trade deal for Ontario (the prime minister) abandons Quebec, he'll do it. That's what he wants."
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard said Friday that, if re-elected, his government would not ratify any agreement that isn't approved by Quebec's dairy farmers. But given that trade deals are negotiated between countries, there's little legislative weight behind this threat.
Lisée pointed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals that, he claims, put the interests of Alberta beef farmers and British Columbia ahead of Quebec.
"If federalism works, then Alberta, the West Coast and Quebec are all benefiting equally from these trade deals," he said. "But we aren't."
Lisée and Massé's poll numbers have them trailing the Liberals and Coalition Avenir Québec by a wide margin. And opinion surveys suggest Quebec sovereignty is less popular now than it has been in generations.
But Lisée has also suggested that the right set of external factors - like a blow to the dairy sector - could cause Quebecers to reconsider that stance.
Marcel Groleau, the head of the Union des producteurs agricoles, said supply management is the backbone of the economy in many regions.
"In my community, in the 'rangs' where we live, five farms support 12 families," he said. "That's supply management. It's our way of life."

Full text: Every election campaign has its frontrunners.
So far, the polling numbers for the Quebec elections indicate that the Coalition Avenir Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/live-quebec-election-caq-headed-for-comfortable-majority-poll-analysis ) (CAQ) is topping the list, with the Quebec Liberals sitting in near second and the Parti Québecois struggling in a distant third.
In the West Island, the Quebec Liberals have dominated at the polls for decades. So much so, that it is understandable that some West Island voters may not be aware that there are smaller parties with candidates on the campaign trail.
Running in its first provincial election is the New Democratic Party of Quebec. The NDPQ was registered in 2014 and is not affiliated with the federal party. A previous incarnation which functioned as a provincial wing of the federal party existed from 1963 to 1991.
NDPQ candidates in the West Island:
Jacques-Cartier candidate France Séguin grew up in Pointe-Claire. She has travelled the world and holds a master's degree in International Development from the University of Ottawa. Séguin applied her socio-economic expertise during 25 years spent in Africa and South America working in the public, private and institutional sectors. She returned to Pointe-Claire in 2013 and joined the federal NDP, working on the 2015 federal election and promoting proportional representation with the Mouvement Démocratie Nouvelle (MDN). She is a founding member of NDPQ.
In her campaign statement, Séguin stated her running for the NDPQ is a logical next move in her quest to best represent the needs of her riding and to find progressive solutions to social problems. She describes herself as "a committed social-democrat with clear and unequivocal leftist political orientations (and as) a determined, dynamic and pragmatic woman."
Nelligan candidate Leslie Eric Murphy is a software developer in the health-care industry. He is now a resident of Pierrefonds, but was living in Ste-Geneviève when the historic floods hit the region in 2017. His rented home flooded and he was forced to relocate.
Leslie Eric Murphy is the NDPQ candidate for Nelligan.
With the campaign underway, Murphy has been going door to door and listening to frustrated flood victims who found the government aid-application process impossible to navigate.
"During the flooding, the government press conferences did not reflect what was happening on the ground," Murphy said.
He said people are asking about what happens if the flooding occurs again.
"In this era of climate change, we experience rain on snow. The water accumulation is huge," Murphy said. "This needs to be reflected in (government preparations). We need the government to be transparent about its (preparedness plan)."
Recent interruption of service and reduced service on the Deux-Montagnes commuter line caused by the construction of the REM (light-rail) network is also a hot topic in the riding Murphy said.
And he said people are not happy with the budget cuts experienced at the Medistat Clinic in Pierrefonds.
"The clinic has been told to send patients to a super clinic. But then the super clinic is full," Murphy said.
Luca Brown is the NDPQ candidate for Robert-Baldwin.
Robert-Baldwin candidate Luca Brown lives in Pierrefonds and is a political science student at McGill University. During the summer, fellow NDPQ candidate Séguin saw him give a presentation on food security during a event organized by the social-outreach organization Table de quartier sud de l'Ouest-de-l'Île. Following the presentation, she asked him to run for the party.
"I had already been involved with the federal NDP, so the offer seemed like a natural extension of my interest in politics and in social justice," Brown said.
John Symon is the NDPQ candidate for Marquette. Photo courtesy of the NDPQ
Marquette candidate John Symon lives in Lachine and works as a translator and author. He is a community activist and environmentalist who opposes the REM, saying it is a prohibitively expensive project which will not serve the residential areas in either Lachine or Dorval. He said the arrival of the REM will signal the demise of the commuter lines which serves residents below Highway 20.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Frank Zampino preliminary inquiry begins( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/frank-zampino-preliminary-inquiry-begins )
The preliminary inquiry began on Monday for Frank Zampino, the former No. 2 politician at Montreal city hall, and others who are accused of participating in a system of awarding municipal engineering contracts in exchange for kickbacks in the early and mid-2000s.
The hearing, which is under publication ban, is to continue on Friday. The media are not permitted to report any evidence heard at the hearing because of the publication ban.
Zampino was chairman of the city executive committee and right-hand man to three-term mayor Gérald Tremblay from 2002 to 2008.
Zampino was arrested by Quebec's anti-corruption squad, UPAC, in September along with former political fundraiser Bernard Trépanier, former Montreal civil servant Robert Marcil and five former heads or employees of engineering consulting firms.
One of the engineers, Yves Théberge, formerly of CIMA+, has since pleaded guilty.
They were arrested under a branch of a broader investigation into municipal corruption in Montreal, dubbed Fronde.
The accused face one charge each of municipal corruption, fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. Zampino and Marcil each face an additional charge of abuse of trust by a public officer.
Montreal unveils resiliency strategy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-unveils-resiliency-strategy )
From flooded neighbourhoods to drivers stranded all night on a highway in a blizzard, Montreal has had its share of events that show what happens when a community is not prepared for emergencies.
Mayor Valérie Plante said on Monday the city now has a strategy for dealing with extreme weather and other unforeseen events, from train derailments to terrorist attacks.
"We're very well prepared, that's for sure," Plante said at a press conference at city hall where she unveiled Montreal's resilient city strategy.
In 2014, Montreal was the first city in Canada to join 100 Resilient Cities, a movement pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, she noted. Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver jumped on board the next year.
In addition to emergencies, the strategy also addresses poverty, inequality and aging infrastructures.
Actions so far have included promoting awareness of emergency preparedness, setting up the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence, identifying emergency shelters across the city, promoting urban agriculture and revising urban planning to mitigate flood risks.
Daughter of Mom Boucher faces new charges( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/daughter-of-mom-boucher-faces-new-charges )
The daughter of former Hells Angels leader Maurice (Mom) Boucher was arrested by the Sûreté du Québec on Saturday, a little more than a month after she was sentenced to house arrest for being in possession of cash generated by a major drug-trafficking ring linked to the biker gang.
Alexandra Mongeau, 28, appeared before a judge Monday afternoon at the Longueuil courthouse where she faces two charges alleging she was driving while impaired in Candiac. She was ordered to remain detained for a bail hearing to be held on Tuesday.
On May 11, Mongeau pleaded guilty to being in possession of cash collected by drug dealers who were part of a network that sold drugs in eastern Montreal. According to a summary of facts read into the court record, Mongeau was paid a cut (referred to as rent or taxes) of the profits on drugs sold in the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough between 2011 and 2015. Her cut worked out to $1,000 per month and came from traffickers who sold drugs like cocaine in neighbourhoods her father ruled over when he was the leader of the Hells Angels in Montreal during the 1990s.

Plante noted that while the city is better prepared for weather-related emergencies, other catastrophes like terrorist threats are harder to plan for.
The city, she added, lacks jurisdiction over some aspects of emergency planning, like rail transportation, to prevent disasters like the 2013 Lac-Mégantic derailment that killed 47 people when a freight train carrying crude oil derailed near the Maine border.

Alouettes OT Xavier Fulton takes mistaken release in stride

Author: Zurkowsky, Herb

Full text: Xavier Fulton slept in Sunday morning and said he doesn't own a cellphone.
The Alouettes' offensive-tackle was unaware of the temporary storm created on social media when he was released because his name was "mistakenly included" in a release of transactions the team dispatched. But his wife fielded a flood of calls.
"I'll be honest, I missed a good portion of all that craziness," he said following Monday's practice, laughing. "That's the nature of this business. When that time comes, it comes. But as long as I'm here, I'm going to give everything I have. Make sure I'm on top of my game."
When the Als legitimately released left offensive-tackle Jovan Olafioye on the day before training camp last month, and then Fulton, who has been practicing with the starting offence most of training camp, it raised eyebrows.
For the record, general manager Kavis Reed on Monday said it was a clerical error that won't happen again and shouldn't have occurred. He and the organization apologized to Fulton.
Offensive-tackle Xavier Fulton.
The 6-foot-5, 287-pound Fulton is expected to protect the blind side of first-string quarterback Drew Willy Saturday night, when the Als launch their regular season at Vancouver. But nothing's set in stone. Indeed, the team utilized numerous combinations up front on Monday, still seeking the strongest five-man unit.
Potentially hampering the decision is right-guard Ryan Bomben recovering from a broken right hand and working with a cast, making his status questionable. Head coach Mike Sherman said the line remains a work in progress.
"It's tough to play with a cast on the offensive line," Sherman said. "You use that hand as a guide hand a lot of times. You're not holding, but the extension of your fingers braces you a bit. That'll be a challenge, but I've had players play with casts before."
Willy, who played the entire first half on Saturday against Hamilton, as well as one series of the third quarter, was sacked twice. Fulton didn't have his best game and, on one play, was driven back into Willy by defensive-end Adrian Tracy.
"My footing was all over the place," admitted the 31-year-old, a seven-year Canadian Football League veteran who has played for Saskatchewan and the Tiger-Cats. "It wasn't pretty, but I knew where I was going. It was just getting there. It seemed like I was getting in my own way a lot.
"I'm penciled into the (left-tackle) spot. I've played this game for a long time. Maybe I've lost a step or two in some ways, but my game wisdom has allowed me to maintain that level of game speed and intensity."
Willy, who was under pressure despite the Ticats leaving a number of their starters at home, predictably said he believes the line will come together.
"We'll get it figured out," he said. "They want to keep me protected. I know the effort's going to be there. I know they're going to fight to the end for me."
It behooves the Als to keep Willy healthy and upright. His backup, Matt Shiltz, has a muscular problem in his lower back and is expected to miss two games. That means Antonio Pipkin, a rookie who briefly played in the last 2017 regular-season game, becomes Willy's understudy.
In other news, veteran rush-end John Bowman was limited on Monday due to an ankle injury. The Als still are hopeful he'll play against the Lions.
Defensive-back Greg Henderson, who played 11 games last season for Montreal, has been released along with defensive-tackle Alan-Michael Cash and receiver Jamal Robinson, who was acquired from Hamilton along with Bomben. Cash might resurface on the practice roster in the future.

Community centre's eco-friendly design reflects nature

Full text: The expansion of the Dollard-des-Ormeaux( https://ville.ddo.qc.ca/en ) Community Centre both reflects nature in its design and harnesses nature to help it keep cozy or cool. The wood, glass and brick expansion was officially unveiled last week.
The structure was completed last summer but the inauguration was postponed until everything was in its place, including the furniture which arrived just last month. The 16,000 square foot addition doubles the size of the facility.
A crowd gathered for the inauguration in a multi-use gathering spot dotted with tables and chairs and equipped with a state-of-the-art kitchen where cooking classes are offered.
Infrastructure grants from the federal and provincial governments covered $5.2 million of the project's $5.4 million cost.
"I'd say we got the good end of the stick in this situation," Mayor Alex Bottausci( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/mayor-elect-in-dollard-des-ormeaux-wants-to-build-on-the-good ) said to the gathering.
Construction was completed during the mandate of former mayor Ed Janiszewski,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-janiszewski-has-been-dollard-mayor-since-84-will-he-run-again ) who was on hand last week to help unveil the inaugural bronze plaque.
Bottausci acknowledged Janiszewski's leading role in bringing the project to life.
"I thank the mayor for his leadership and the last council for having the vision to build this extension," Bottausci said.
An estimated 25,000 people use the community centre every year. The senior population alone has grown precipitously in recent years.
"The senior's program has grown from 500 to 1,000 participants," Bottausci said. "We needed more room."
The structure is made of Quebec-sourced wood. An eight-metre high curtain wall of large glass panels soars two-storeys. Angular metal mullions set in an uneven pattern to mirror the random nature of a forest give the curtain wall its distinctive look. The interior main staircase continues the nature theme with railings that mirror the irregular shape of tree branches.
Minimalist in line and practical in design, the furniture and interiors adhere to a calm palette of pale wood and white accents.
Architect Héloïse Thibodeau produced the drawings and project manager Guy Dubé and head city engineer Érick Laliberté oversaw every detail of the construction.
Generous spruce beams are installed throughout the interior of the building, again referencing nature. The elevator, doors and washrooms are all wheelchair accessible, as is the rooftop terrace.
"The concept was to bring a warmth to the interiors, to give the feeling that you are at home," Laliberté said during a tour of the facility. "And it was designed to be accessible to all ages (and mobility levels.)"
Grand windows installed throughout the three levels flood the building with natural light.

A multi-media, conference room is fully-wired for mobile devices and furniture in the workshop can be reconfigured to suit large or small groups. The temperature in the yoga/aerobic studio is adjustable to suit the situation - warmer for yoga, cooler for aerobics.
The building is both heated and cooled by geothermal energy drawn from the earth with the help of a system of wells and pipes installed 500 feet underground. The eco-friendly setup reduces energy costs by 40 per cent.
The upper level has a gathering space for special events, a kitchen and access to the terrace which is illuminated after dark. The rooftop terrace is dotted with flower pots and a grouping of free-standing planters will be planted with vegetables in the coming days.

Full text: It was past checkout time at the Residence Inn by Marriott on Thursday and Yvrose Gédéus didn't know where she would spend the night.
The grandmother has been living with her extended family in this or that hotel ever since record flooding all but destroyed her Île-Bizard home more than a year ago.
Her youngest granddaughter, Anastasia, was born during the floods.
But two weeks ago Gédéus, 63, was told the Quebec government would no longer pay her food bills. Then she was told she would have to leave the hotel.
This, despite the fact that work on her home - where the ceiling is caving in and the entire foundation has to be redone - has not yet begun.
This, despite the fact the family of seven had nowhere to go; their belongings were packed into two cars.
"The government made the decision from one day to the next to cut off our funds for food. Then two weeks ago they said we had to find a house on our own," Gédéus said. "But no one wants to rent us a house for one or two months... I paid $240 for one room here last night. But now I have to go."
By 4:30 p.m. Thursday, the Red Cross, which provides help to victims on behalf of the Quebec Ministry of Public Safety, had informed the family it would after all pay for another nine days in a hotel - until May 19 - to allow them to find a more permanent home.
Unfortunately, by then all the rooms at the Residence Inn near Trudeau International Airport were taken. They were trying the Holiday Inn.
It's not clear what had changed in those five hours. Carl Boisvert, a spokesperson for the Red Cross, said he couldn't divulge any details about the particular file, but said the Red Cross simply carries out the ministry's orders.
The ministry will continue to provide $20 per person per day for housing for victims once they are out of the hotel. That's $140 per day for Gédéus and her family, or $4,200 per month.
But Gédéus has not been able to find a home to rent. She thought she had found a home in Île-Bizard for $2,200 per month but the landlord wanted six months rent - up front and in cash - and for her to provide a $20,000 lien on her house.
She said no.
Then the government found her a house in Île-Perrot, she said. But there's no public transit there - how would her grandchildren get to school?
According to Public Safety Ministry spokesperson Olivier Cantin, there are 16 families still living in hotels as a result of flooding last spring that left 6,000 property owners dealing with sustained damage.

Cantin wouldn't say why a decision was made, then reversed, to not allow Gédéus to stay. Information on particular files is confidential, he said.
"We are here to support people and help them. We normally help people find places to live. I don't know what's happening with this family," Cantin said. "But if people think the decision taken in their file is not fair, they can contact us."
Part of the problem stems from the scarcity of rental housing in the West Island, where Gédéus's two 14-year-old grandchildren go to school.
Alema Ziuleva, the executive director of the group Table de quartier sud de l'ouest de l'ile said there's an acute shortage of community and affordable housing in the West Island.
"It creates a lot of obstacles to any type of individual or family looking for affordable housing," Ziuleva said. "For a family of seven, it's even more complicated."

The proportion of rental housing in the West Island is very small, and shrinking, Ziuleva continued. The proportion of affordable rental housing is practically non-existent.
"Most of the time we're hearing stories from people who are not necessarily in crisis due to a natural disaster, but people who lose a job or lose their income after the death of their partner or they get sick or have a hard time meeting needs and have to stop working," Ziuleva said. "That's when people get in touch with us. They want to stay in the West Island; it's their home and where they were born. But they can't afford to stay here."
There is also no emergency housing available on the West Island, unless you're a victim of domestic abuse or an adult in crisis, said Lindsay Patrick, of the West Island Community Resource Centre.
"The only emergency housing we have is the crisis centre, and it's not for people with kids," Patrick said. "We have to send a lot of families downtown."
Gédéus said her family is certainly in crisis.
"I didn't think the government would do something like this, not from one day to the next. It really hurts. It's not easy to live like this, and it's not just me, it's the kids who are trailing behind me all day and who refuse to go to school.
"It's having to move all the time and going back and forth," Gédéus said - the Marriott was their fourth hotel in a year. "It's the humiliation and how people speak to us. This is not our fault. Everyone has the right to get help to rebuild and now they want to throw me out. I don't understand it."

City renting out Formula E barriers for G7 summit

Full text: Montreal is renting out 1.5 kilometres of concrete barriers and metal fences purchased for last summer's Formula E race for use at the G7 summit in La Malbaie next month.
The city's executive committee approved a draft contract to rent 375 sections of concrete barriers and 375 sections of metal fencing to the Sûreté du Québec, which is handling logistics for the meeting of world leaders on June 8-9.
The rental, from May 15 to June 30, will bring in $120,000 in revenue - a pittance compared with the $7.5 million the city spent to buy the barriers in 2017 from Deric Construction Inc.
When it was in the municipal opposition, Valérie Plante's Projet Montréal party criticized the high cost of the barriers, saying it would have been cheaper to rent them.
The SQ must bring them back clean, graffiti-free and in good condition, or it will have to pay for them, under the rental contract.
Éric Alan Caldwell, the executive-committee member responsible for transportation and urban planning, told reporters after the meeting that the city is pleased to rent out the barriers any time they are wanted.
"We're happy to get a little revenue for these barriers," he said.
In January, Plante suggested that the barriers could possibly be used for flood control.
In December, she pulled the plug on the 2018 edition of the Formula E race, saying it was too costly and brought too few benefits to the city. Two-thirds of the 45,000 tickets were given away last year( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-formula-e-10000-more-freebies-than-previously-revealed ).
About 8,000 members of the Canadian Armed Forces, plus the RCMP and Sûreté du Québec will provide security in La Malbaie, 400 kilometres northeast of Montreal. Three-metre-tall security fences have already been erected around the Manoir Richelieu and the Casino de Charlevoix, where the summit will take place.
The meeting will be U.S. President Donald Trump's first official visit to Canada.

Environmental groups to push agenda during Quebec election campaign

Full text: A coalition of 11 leading environmental organizations vowed Sunday to hold politicians' feet to the fire during the Quebec election campaign on issues from climate change to protection of forests, agricultural land and waterways.
"It's the first time we've done this collectively," said Steven Guilbeault, co-founder of the environmental organization Équiterre.
"By working together, we've covered a wide array of issues," Guilbeault said in an interview after a press conference by the coalition, which also includes the David Suzuki Foundation, WWF-Canada, Vivre en Ville, Greenpeace Canada, Nature Québec, SNAP Que?bec, Vélo Québec, Trajectoire, the Regroupement national des conseils régionaux de l'environnement du Québec and the Regroupement Vigilance Hydrocarbures Québec.
The coalition will press all parties in the Oct. 1 election to set bold environmental targets in the coming months. Its campaign( https://www.vireauvert.org/nos23demandes ), titled "Vire au vert" (Go green), consists of 23 demands. They include:
Prohibit increases in fossil fuel production
Promote energy-efficient buildings and use of electric vehicles
Implement a stormwater management policy and flood-prevention plans
Reduce GHG emissions in transportation by 50 per cent by 2030
Adopt a moratorium on rezoning agricultural land
Promote active and collective transportation
Tax sales of high fuel-consumption vehicles
Reduce pesticide use and encourage organic farming
Increase marine-protected areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and protect biodiversity and endangered species
Preserve mature forests
Guilbeault said 250,000 Quebecers support environmental groups and their votes could make a difference in some 23 ridings across the province.
The environmental crisis - from extreme weather events to the destruction of natural environments and loss of species - makes it urgent to act, he said.
"The situation is getting worse, not better. We need to act more decisively than we have before," he said.
Studies show that politicians usually respect about 70 to 75 per cent of the promises they make, so it's important to get candidates to commit to sustainable policies, he said.
The movement is non-partisan and does not support any particular parties or candidates, he said.

Still waiting for Quebec to pay; A year after the floods, this Pierrefonds couple have drained their life savings

Full text: After the basement in their Pierrefonds home was flooded on May 7, 2017, Zofia and Ped Malek cashed in their life savings and rolled up their sleeves to do the repairs themselves.
The Maleks were among about 6,000 property owners who sustained damage during last year's historic flooding in the Montreal area.
Now nearly a year later, the Maleks are still waiting for the province to come through with money promised by the disaster relief fund set up in the wake of the flooding.
Zofia, 68, is earning a government pension, while Ped, 64, is unemployed but not yet eligible to retire, so they depend on the rental income from two units in their triplex on Des Maçons St.
Immigrants from Poland, the Maleks said they were exhausted as they logged 12-hour days between May and September, spending 590 hours in total to get their basement rental apartment repaired, and another 110 hours to repair their own basement family room and the utility room that has the furnace and hot-water tanks that serve their home and the two rental units.
"We haven't received even a penny from the provincial government," a sobbing Zofia told the Montreal Gazette on Thursday, showing copies of a six-inch high pile of papers she has submitted to the province. "It's been so much stress, and we had to file so much paperwork."
Greg Domagala, the couple's son-in-law who helps manage the property, said they received a quotation from a contractor to replace drywall and flooring, rebuild two bathrooms and replace hot-water tanks, but it was far too expensive.
"The estimate came in at $80,000," Domagala said. "They almost fell off their chairs when they saw it."
Since the government wouldn't pay upfront and their financial status probably made them ineligible for a line of credit or a new mortgage on the property, the Maleks said they felt they had no choice but to dip into their savings to pay for the repairs.
The Maleks received about $20,000 from their home insurance to cover some personal possessions, but they were promised by the government they would be covered for the materials needed to rebuild the basement.
The couple also lost rental income. The total for repairs and lost rent comes out to more than $50,000, Domagala estimates.
But the Maleks have received no payment from the government, and they now fear they'll never receive that money because the disaster relief fund gives applicants a one-year deadline from the time the claim is opened to complete repairs, which in their case gives them until the end of May. However, without any more money coming in, the Maleks can't afford to replace their furnace that was damaged in the flood.
"The furnace could go out, and then they will really be in trouble," Domagala said.
"They also have a few other unresolved issues, but they don't want to go into debt because they don't know if they will ever get paid. They have lost faith."
Domagala has been managing communication with the province because the Maleks aren't fluent in French or English.
He's made numerous calls to Quebec's public security ministry, which manages the disaster relief fund, but hasn't yet received an answer on why it's taking so long for the government to pay.
A month ago, a provincial inspector came to the house to assess the repairs, and the Maleks were told a cheque would be arriving in a week, but they're still waiting.
"We have submitted everything the ministry has asked for: all the bills, all the time that they spent doing the renovations, and any purchase as small or as large as they come," Domagala said. "We have had acknowledgment that the ministry received the documents."
Last Friday, the Maleks missed a phone call from a ministry claims handler. When Domagala called back on Tuesday, the worker refused to speak with them.
"We spoke to his secretary, and he wouldn't even come onto the phone," Domagala said.
Vincent Richard, who has been living in the Maleks'basement unit for 18 years, said he's forever grateful to the couple for being good landlords and for doing the repairs so quickly. Richard was lodged at the Marriott airport hotel for four months while the repairs were being done.
"These people really came through for me," Richard said. "When I think of it, I get really emotional. They managed to get me out of the hotel in four months, but the government has not come through for them."
Richard said if he were still being lodged in a hotel, as was the case for about 44 families last month, it would have cost the government another $40,000 in hotel fees and food allowance.
The Maleks aren't the only flood victims still waiting for payment. Others on the same street have also not received compensation. The public security ministry claims nearly all flood victims have received at least some payment, saying 86 per cent of claimants received between 75 and 90 per cent of the financial aid requested as of April 10.
However, when asked specifically how many files have been closed, Louise Quintin, a spokesperson for the ministry, said only 26 per cent of claimants were fully paid as of April 10.
The ministry wasn't able to provide specific answers about why the Maleks haven't yet received any payment. jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

However, when asked specifically how many files have been closed, Louise Quintin, a spokesperson for the ministry, said only 26 per cent of claimants were fully paid as of April 10.
The ministry was not able to provide specific answers about why the Maleks did not yet receive any payment.

Full text: In the wake of an apartment complex fire that uncovered numerous prohibited rooming houses, the borough of Côte-des-Neiges- Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is trying to ensure the residents don't lose their homes.
"The people that were living there, at least they had a place to stay," borough manager Stéphane Plante said Thursday. "If we go there in a couple days and say 'Too bad, we're closing the place,'we will end up with people in the street. Obviously, that is not what we want to do."
The owner of the building is facing tens of thousands of dollars in fines after inspections of his properties Wednesday and Thursday showed the presence of cockroaches, mice and mould and more prohibited rooming houses.
Twenty-one residents fled their apartments Sunday after a fire broke out in a Linton Ave. building in Côte-des-Neiges. No one was injured, but authorities discovered separate rooms in five out of six apartments were being rented out to individuals paying $400 to $500 a month. As many as four people were renting rooms in each apartment.
The apartments, typically composed of five rooms and a bathroom, normally rent out for $700 to $950 a month. Some long-term tenants pay as little as $620 a month. Under borough regulations, the person who holds the lease can rent a maximum of three rooms in their apartment as long as he or she is also living there. In the burned-out Linton Ave. building, one individual was renting five apartments, then renting rooms in each unit to as many as four people. In some cases, doors had been added to entrances of living rooms to convert them into a separate bedroom (although they hadn't been subdivided with a wall down the middle, as had previously been reported, borough officials said).
The arrangement falls under what the borough classifies as a rooming house, which requires special permits, said borough urban planner Lucie Bédard.
Building owner Habibur Rahman says he rents out 250 apartments and owns more than 10 apartment buildings in the city, including five in a row on Linton Ave. between Côte-des-Neiges Rd. and Legaré St. that hold 24 units each. He said the Régie du logement allows the person who has signed a lease to rent out rooms, (the Régie confirmed this information to the Montreal Gazette). Rahman said he was not aware municipal laws banned the practice without a rooming house permit.
After paying bills for electricity, internet and cleaning services, the individual who was renting out the rooms - identified by the owner only by his first name, Sayed - was only earning $200 to $300 a month on each apartment, and even less if he couldn't find renters, Rahman said.
The building owner said he was aware his tenant was renting to others, and said he did not earn any extra money from the arrangement.
"No, I wasn't getting extra. This is Canada, you cannot get anything extra," Rahman said.
The arrangement worked well because it ensured he received his rent on time and saved him from dealing with tenants who don't pay their rent, he said.
Rahman has the option of applying for a permit to run a rooming house, which would require expensive alterations like putting a sink in each room, borough manager Plante said. He could convert the apartment back to its original state and rent to a single person, but that would mean putting the current tenants out on the street. Or he could allow the tenants to co-sign on the lease and share the rent, lowering their current monthly payments.
"That would be the best option," Plante said.
Borough inspectors investigated the buildings on Linton Ave. owned by Rahman starting Wednesday morning, borough Mayor Sue Montgomery said. They turned up numerous cases of mould, mice and cockroach infestations, and things like missing faucets and evidence of other apartments rented by the room. Fines for the infractions vary from $650 to $6,000 each. Rahman has 30 days to make the repairs.
Tenants rights organization L'Oeil said Rahman has been the subject of several complaints from tenants over the years for unsanitary living conditions and abusive treatment. Problems persist, l'Oeil director Annie Lapalme said, because boroughs lack the budgets for inspectors and the courage to fine lawbreakers.
Tenants in buildings on Linton Ave. owned by Rahman told the Montreal Gazette the owners were quick to ask for rent, but slow to respond to complaints about issues like flood-destroyed ceilings, cockroaches and faulty toilets. One man who has lived in a Linton Ave. building for more than 20 years said his building was clean and well-run until Rahman purchased it three years ago. He said Rahman has been slow on repairs and cleaning and tried to push out long-term tenants paying lower rents like himself in order to rent out the apartments by the room. Several of Rahman's buildings have apartments where people rent by the room, he said.
"It's a nightmare for many people," said the tenant, who did not want to give his name for fear of repercussions.
Rahman responded that he has never received any official complaints or fines from the city.
"People can complain, but if they're complaining, why hasn't the city given me any notice or letter or anything? I have had no fines or punishments from the city," he said.
Borough manager Plante said Rahman received notices of numerous infractions in 2016 in his Linton Ave. apartments. He repaired them quickly before receiving fines.
Montgomery noted that the fact many of the issues resurfaced in this week's inspections indicate the previous repairs were not well done. rbruemmer@postmedia.com twitter.com/renebruemmer

WICS tops $13 million in donations over 20 years

Full text: West Island Community Shares (WICS( http://www.communityshares.ca/ )) had a couple of good reasons to celebrate last Thursday.
The local fundraising organization marked its 20(th) year of operation in the West Island with a record-breaking donation total of $1.345 million dollars.
The funds are distributed to dozens of local community groups, said Leanne Bayer( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/dorvals-leanne-bayer-returns-home-to-lead-west-island-community-shares ), executive director of WICS.
"We had a record-breaking year," she said. "We distribute all that money to the 40 non-profit groups all based in the West Island. So we felt very good; we were very proud about that."
"It's also nice because it's our 20(th) anniversary year. It was April of 1998 when West Island Community Shares was created. So it was quite a celebration on Thursday (at the Auditorium Serge Nolet in Dorval)."
Since its inception in 1998, WICS has raised and distributed more than $13 million to local community groups.
Bayer said donations began coming in a big way last spring when it raised near $100,000 for flood relief.
"About this time last year, we created a special fund called 'Neighbours in Need' and it was for the flood. So we did raise $95,000 early in our fiscal year. But even if you take out the $95,000, it's still about $1.25 million, and that's more than we've ever raised regardless."
Bayer said the flood relief efforts helped raise public awareness about WICS, which relies on both private and corporate donations.
"I think the floods kind of sparked it and gave us some momentum. That also gave us more visibility in the community, which helped us. Maybe some new people learned who we were."
Although the West Island of Montreal is considered to be relatively affluent community, Bayer said one in five West Islanders turns to a community group for assistance every year. The majority (60 per cent) of them are children or youth. They face a myriad of personal challenges, including hunger, cancer, autism, bullying, substance abuse and mental illness.
Bayer said part of the success of WICS is that it is dedicated to serving the West Island community.
Its fundraising motto is: "Live Here, Give Here."
"We think it's catchy," Bayer said." It's to fundraise in the West Island for West Island non-profits."
John Helou, president of Pfizer Canada( https://www.pfizer.ca/ ) and co-chair of the WICS fundraising campaign, said giving back to the community is a core value.
"At Pfizer, we are committed to giving back to the communities where colleagues live and work," he said. "Twenty years ago, we were asked to help in the start-up of West Island Community Shares and they have since then distributed more than $13 million dollars to the West Island."
Russell Williams, a founding member of WICS, speaks at the West Island Community Shares annual cheque distribution event on April 26, 2018.
"Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this year's campaign," added Nada Nasreddine, the outgoing president of WICS.
About 300 people attend the WICs fundraising gala, including founding WICS member Russell Williams. The former Nelligan MNA was joined by past WICS presidents Pierre Arvisais, Claude Papasian, Vincent Lamoureux and Roger Morin.

Montreal's soggy spring drier than 2017, year of the great flood

Full text: It has been a cool, wet spring in Montreal.
Hopefully, April showers will bring May flowers to a city coping without Stanley Cup playoff hockey or much sunshine.
If you thought April was wetter than usual, you were right.
About 102 millimetres of precipitation fell in Montreal in April, compared with the average of 68 millimetres.
But this April pales in comparison with last April, when about 160 millimetres of precipitation fell on Montreal, contributing to the great flood of 2017.
Things were much worse a year ago. In fact, on May 5 last year, Quebec called in the Canadian Army to help in flooded areas.
But Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, notes that April 1996 was even wetter, with 178 millimetres of precipitation recorded for Montreal.
Take Our Poll( http://polldaddy.com/poll/9992214 )
Parent said temperatures should slowly rise in May after being a few degrees below normal in April. But don't expect pitchers of beer and sangria to start appearing on sun-washed terraces just yet.
"There might be a few showers, even thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday," Parent said. "But the amount of rain for the Montreal area for the next five or six days, I would say between maybe 10 and 20 millimetres at the most. Unless we're really unlucky."
More rain means sump pumps could be working overtime in some areas.
"In some places, it's pretty bad now," Parent said. "The Beauce got over 100 millimetres of rain with the last two events of Thursday and Saturday. So it's not a surprise the Chaudière River is flooding right now. Plus, they had some snow left on the ground. When you have rain and snow, it's not a good mix.
"There is some surveillance north of Montreal on the Rivière des Mille Îles. Lake of Two Mountains as well. There is some minor flooding in Terrebonne."
But warmer weather is forecast for, ahem, sometime this summer.
"We'll be back to normal soon," Parent said. "The next few days we're slightly above, and then back to normal for the weekend."
Which means the winter coats can finally go in the closet.

Pat Hickey: Canadiens should deal No. 3 pick in package for top centre

Full text: In the moments after the Canadiens moved up to the No. 3 spot in the NHL draft lottery on Saturday night, general manager Marc Bergevin discussed the options leading up to the June 23 entry draft.
"At No. 3, you get a player (from the draft) that's probably going to play sooner than later," said Bergevin, who went on to concede that he might be willing to trade the pick. "Anything's possible, but you suffer a lot to get that pick, so it has to be a pretty good offer to move that pick."
There should be no debate. If the Canadiens are hoping for a quick turnaround, Bergevin must explore all options to plug the gaping hole at centre and the first option should be to see what's available via a trade.
Throughout his Canadiens tenure, Bergevin has preached the importance of building through the draft, of picking the best player available with few concessions to the team's needs.
The results have been underwhelming. The roster includes only three bona fide NHL players who were drafted by the Canadiens in the first round - Carey Price, Max Pacioretty and Alex Galchenyuk. Three other first-rounders - Noah Juulsen, Nikita Scherbak and Michael McCarron - are still trying to prove themselves, with only Juulsen standing out so far.
There is a built-in excuse because the Canadians have often been drafting late in the first round but, with the exception of the very top picks, the draft remains a crapshoot as all teams try to project the future development of 17-year-olds who are more familiar with a stick blade than a razor blade.
Boston's Brady Tkachuk (27) battles Cornell's Alex Rauter during NCAA college tournament regional game in Worcester, Mass., on March 24, 2018.
Bergevin is right when he says the No. 3 spot should produce a pick who's going to play, but there are no high-end centres - most scouts have Drummondville QMJHL star Joe Veleno outside the top 10 - and the talent level for defencemen falls off after consensus No. 1 pick Rasmus Dahlin of Sweden. The various mock drafts have the Canadiens looking at wingers Filip Zadina, a Czech playing for Halifax in the QMJHL, or Brady Tkachuk from Boston University.
Zadina, a 6-foot, 196-pounder, had 44 goals and 82 points in 57 games for the Mooseheads, while Tkachuk, a 6-foot-3, 196-pounder, had eight goals and 31 points in 40 games as a freshman at BU. Those are good numbers but consider that, in his draft year, Canadiens forward Jonathan Drouin had 41 goals and 105 points in only 49 games with the Mooseheads and Sabres star Jack Eichel produced 26 goals and 71 points in his freshman year at Boston University.
It's difficult to imagine Zadina or Tkachuk having an immediate impact in the NHL, particularly in Montreal where the culture is risk averse when it comes to hastening a player's development. And, if they did crack the lineup, there's no indication they would address the team's top priority, which is to score more goals.
Bergevin's task would be simpler - and there would be less pressure to hit a home run in the draft - if there were some assurances that New York Islanders impending unrestricted-free-agent centre John Tavares could be lured to Montreal. It's almost certain Tavares will escape from the dysfunctional situation in New York and the word is that the Canadiens are prepared to open the vault for Tavares. But there will be more attractive offers for Tavares, who is looking for a chance to play hockey in May and June.

With no other standout UFAs - the list of available centres includes 38-year-old Joe Thornton, Paul Stastny, Tyler Bozak and former Canadien Tomas Plekanec - and no NHL-ready centres in the draft, a trade remains the only solution to finding a top-end centre. There are players out there and the challenge is to put together the right package with the No. 3 pick as the key component. If the deal has to include Pacioretty, so be it. It will be difficult to part with a perennial 30-goal scorer who loves to play in this city. And it's sad that, on a team that has some players who don't care enough, Pacioretty struggled last season because he cares too much.
The good news for Bergevin is that he doesn't have any thorny free-agency issues as he did last summer with Alex Radulov and Andrei Markov. And, with the salary cap going up, he'll have plenty of money to throw at free agents even with star goalie Carey Price getting a hefty $4-million raise to US$10.5 million a season. The hope is he has learned that if you keep some money for a rainy day, you might find yourself in a position where you have to clean up after a flood.
Bergevin might have been right when he said there was nothing left after the first round of free-agent dealing last summer but, in hindsight, it might have made sense to use the $1 million he gave Mark Streit to sweeten his lowball offer to Markov.
As for the rest of the off-season, Canadiens fans have nothing to do but to cheer for P.K. Subban and the Nashville Predators while hoping that Price figures out what ails him, Shea Weber leaves his motorized wheelchair and that a knee injury is the least of Andrew Shaw's worries.

Full text: Some Quebec rivers overflowed Friday, notably in the Beauce and Gaspé regions.
In Ste-Marie-de-Beauce, the Chaudière River is overflowing, forcing 19 people to leave their homes. About 100 houses have been isolated, and 250 homes have had to pump water, according to Urgence Québec.
The municipality opened a relief centre for flood victims, Mayor Gaétan Vachon said.
Citizens can check water levels in their areas by going to the civil security department's Vigilance site, at geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/( http://geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/ ).

Quebec Liberal cabinet minister Martin Coiteux to leave politics

Full text: A high-profile member of Premier Philippe Couillard's Quebec Liberal government won't seek another mandate.
At a news conference in Montreal Friday afternoon, Martin Coiteux confirmed the departure speculation from earlier in the day, saying he is leaving for personal reasons.
Earlier in the day, Couillard paid tribute to Coiteux.
"He has made a significant contribution to Quebec," Couillard said. "If you look at the public finances, if you look at the three laws that he introduced to really transform the relationship between Quebec City and municipalities, the way he acted during the big flood that we had, unfortunately, last year."
The premier played down the significance of Coiteux's departure just over five months before the Oct. 1 provincial election. "Every person has to think about this; there's no other significance. There will be departures; there will be arrivals as well."
The premier also addressed rumours that longtime MNA Geoff Kelley, the minister responsible for native affairs, would also be leaving politics. Kelley has represented the West Island riding of Jacques-Cartier since 1994.
"I haven't spoken directly with Geoff about this," Couillard said. "Everyone has to make these decisions at each election."
Coiteux was among a trio of candidates recruited in 2014 by Couillard to form an "economic team" tasked with reforming the government's finances.
As head of the treasury board, the MNA for the riding of Nelligan presided over two years of government spending cuts that saw billions slashed from government programs. As municipal affairs minister, he was in charge of legislation that saw special status bestowed on Montreal as the province's economic centre.
Most Montrealers, however, particularly those living in the West Island, will recall him as the cabinet minister in charge of relief efforts during last year's spring floods.

Full text: Busy day? Here's what you might have overlooked.
A young couple who say they were the victims of police violence for "walking while black"( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/couple-fined-444-each-for-talking-loudly ) are calling on the mayors of Montreal and Plateau-Mont-Royal to take responsibility for "excessive force, abuse of power and racism." Both were given $444 tickets for making excessive noise. At a news conference Saturday organized by the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), Brian Mann and his girlfriend, who chose not to give her name for fear it could hamper her career, said they were walking down St-Laurent Blvd. near Roy St. on Saturday, April 7 at about 10 a.m., talking and laughing, when a police cruiser pulled alongside. The two officers told the couple they were being too loud. Mann, who is 31, white and the executive director of Concordia University Television (CUTV), said he asked the officers if there was a law against talking and laughing. They responded they would decide what defines too loud, Mann said.
Carlos Vela scored from the penalty spot in the 83rd minute as expansion-side Los Angeles FC overcame an Ignacio Piatti hat trick to defeat the 10-man Montreal Impact 5-3 at Saputo Stadium on Saturday afternoon.( http://montrealgazette.com/pmn/sports-pmn/carlos-velas-penalty-kick-leads-lafc-past-10-man-montreal-impact-5-3/wcm/7c93b4c1-1567-43a4-b448-3de8ba66b5f4 ) Los Angeles (4-2-0) scored four unanswered second-half goals for their second consecutive victory. Montreal (2-5-0) has lost three straight. Laurent Ciman scored in his return to Montreal, his first game back since being traded to Los Angeles in the off-season. Benny Feilhaber and Latif Blessing added goals for the visitors while Impact defender Jukka Raitala scored an own goal. It was the first all-time meeting between the Impact and LAFC. Montreal went down a player in the 31st minute when Victor Cabrera was shown a straight red card for a tackle on Marco Urena in the penalty box. Urena stepped up to the spot but Evan Bush got his fingers on the low, powerful shot. Montreal was leading 2-1.
The risk of flooding is minimal this weekend, but Quebec's civil security department is warning that higher temperatures( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-begins-in-quebec-as-temperatures-rise ) forecast for the coming week could spur a faster melt of the snow cover and ice on rivers and lakes. The department is closely monitoring water levels around the province. Water levels are presently below normal conditions throughout the province, but regional civil security organizations are in constant contact with municipalities situated near rivers, and are ready to intervene.

Quebec to announce Highway 19 extension north of Montreal

Author: Bruemmer, Ren

Abstract: [...]was the reaction of Coalition 19 that was formed by area businesses and municipalities in 2006 to push for the extension, in a news release. "Even it if helps in the short-term to alleviate traffic jams, we are of the feeling that any highway that encourages people to take their cars instead of leaving them at home is in contradiction to the mobility policy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/shorter-commutes-fewer-emissions-feature-in-quebecs-12-year-transit-plan ) that the government announced just a few days ago." Ériscar Brechelin's tidy white bungalow sits at the northern edge of Montreal where Highway 19 ends and funnels into the narrower Papineau Ave. The three lanes in front of his house are backed up from 6:30 to 9 a.m. each weekday as commuters flood in, and again during the evening rush hour.

Full text: Friday's announcement that Quebec will go ahead with the extension of Highway 19 was met with a sigh of relief by the citizens of Laval and municipalities north of there who have been pleading for over 40 years for a more efficient conduit into Montreal.
For residents of neighbourhoods like Ahuntsic and Villeray who will be on the receiving end of the expected increase in traffic creeping down already congested Papineau Ave., the news conjured up exclamations of exasperation.
"When the Jacques Cartier Bridge is blocked, the traffic backs up to here," said Jean-Louis Murad, owner of the compact Nettoyeur Jean-Louis dry cleaning and tailor shop on Papineau Ave. located five kilometres north of the bridge. Just south of his store, Papineau narrows to one lane of traffic in either direction, with compact duplexes and modest stores and bars lining the road. "Of course the effects of the new highway will be negative here. We would prefer to have peace."
Premier Philippe Couillard announced Friday the long-awaited, oft-promised extension of Highway 19 between Autoroute 440 in Laval to just past Highway 640 north of Laval would be built, with soil testing starting this spring and calls for tenders coming soon after. The highway will feature three lanes running in each direction, with one lane reserved for buses, electric vehicles and car-sharing services. Four interchanges and a parking lot serving a bus service will also be built. Previous cost estimates for the eight-kilometre extension and interchanges put the price at $600 million.
Highway 19 currently starts in the north of Montreal at the end of Papineau Ave. and runs into Laval just beyond Highway 440. After that it turns into Highway 335, a secondary road with only one lane in each direction that is often bottlenecked at rush hour. Extending Highway 19 would cut the commuting time for growing communities north of Laval like Rosemère and Bois-de-Filion, allow emergency vehicles to pass and speed public transit that is typically stuck in traffic, northern mayors argue.
"Finally," was the reaction of Coalition 19 that was formed by area businesses and municipalities in 2006 to push for the extension, in a news release. The government described the new highway as "road infrastructure adapted to the needs of families" which at the same time will make public transit more effective.
Members of Montreal's ruling Projet Montréal party have long contested the project as a "monumental waste of money" that will increase congestion in the city, but please voters in the swing ridings north of Laval. Quebecers go to the polls on Oct. 1. Projet Montréal had pushed for a form of "urban boulevard" instead of a highway, with stoplights that would lessen traffic rates and allow commercial businesses to sprout up on either side. Northern mayors said that would be too slow.
Friday's announcement leaves many questions unanswered, Projet said.
"It's certain the residents of Bois-de-Filion would like more fluidity, but in Montreal we are already at full capacity for cars," said Jérôme Normand, city councillor for Ahuntsic-Cartierville. "Even it if helps in the short-term to alleviate traffic jams, we are of the feeling that any highway that encourages people to take their cars instead of leaving them at home is in contradiction to the mobility policy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/shorter-commutes-fewer-emissions-feature-in-quebecs-12-year-transit-plan ) that the government announced just a few days ago."
While the plan for Highway 19 promises a reserved lane for buses, it's still unclear whether the buses will unload passengers at métro stations in Laval or in Montreal, and what will be done to alleviate pressure on the already over-crowded métro Orange Line, Normand said. The government seems to be announcing piecemeal projects instead of looking at the big picture, he said.
"We need to bring some relief to the road system, and the public transit system in Montreal."
Ériscar Brechelin's tidy white bungalow sits at the northern edge of Montreal where Highway 19 ends and funnels into the narrower Papineau Ave. The three lanes in front of his house are backed up from 6:30 to 9 a.m. each weekday as commuters flood in, and again during the evening rush hour. A taxi driver, it can take him several minutes to be able to turn into his driveway, or cross the street to take his children to school.
"For Laval it's good, but for Montreal it's not so good," he said. "It's going to be like another Notre-Dame St. (the perennially traffic-clogged east-west corridor on the southern edge of the city). It's going to be even more crowded here."

Abstract: On the surface, that might not seem like such a huge deal, except that Abu is an intensely personal film about Khan trying to reconcile with his fragmented Pakistani Muslim family and to grapple with sexual abuse within the family. [...]I had the hardest time with my mother, who felt the film was going to bring shame to the family. [...]it's more of a surreal, dark satire about Canada's war on terror in the aftermath of 9/11.

Full text: Montreal director Arshad Khan has just returned from a theatre in Istanbul after taking in the Turkish première of his debut documentary feature Abu. On the surface, that might not seem like such a huge deal, except that Abu is an intensely personal film about Khan trying to reconcile with his fragmented Pakistani Muslim family and to grapple with sexual abuse within the family. And, oh yeah, it's also about his coming out as gay.
Needless to say, this would still be pretty controversial material in many Western countries. Even in a relatively more liberal Muslim country like Turkey, it's risqué.
This is the first time the multi-award-laden film has been shown in a Muslim country, and Khan didn't know what kind of response to expect.
"But, oh my God, the reaction was just amazing," Khan says in a phone interview. "I got ovations. People were crying. They were hugging me. They were telling me that everything I had gone through within the conservative and secular tug of war, they had gone through as well."
Abu - which opens Friday in Montreal - means father in Urdu. And it's Khan's abu who plays a pivotal role in the film.
ABU (Father) Official Film Trailer 2017( https://vimeo.com/206168265 ) from arshad khan( https://vimeo.com/arshadfilms ) on Vimeo( https://vimeo.com ).
Khan concedes he spent much of his life struggling to win his father's approval. It wasn't an entirely successful mission. It didn't help that his father had told Khan when he was a kid he would either bring him "great fame or great shame" - and his father was expecting the latter.
"It's really a miracle that this film got made at all, because, definitely, Pakistani families don't like to talk about themselves," Khan says. "I had huge struggles with this, because I didn't want to make an exploitative or a sensationalized film. And I didn't want to make a film about sexual abuse, because it's too hard and too personal, and I didn't want to share that with the world.
"I had to talk to my family (about everything) as I proceeded. There was re-edit after re-edit, because there were things they weren't OK with. There were a lot of compromises, but I still had to tell my story, and I did. But that's why it took me five years to make. The film was even more explosive before."
Suffice it to say, it's still pretty incendiary now.
"Actually, I had the hardest time with my mother, who felt the film was going to bring shame to the family. I told her it would bring just the opposite. She asked me why I couldn't make a film and use actors instead. So I said: 'Well, Mom, if I as a Pakistani brown man had those kinds of resources, don't you think I'd be making fiction films? No, I'm going to exploit my family instead, because that's all I have,'" cracks Khan, whose mother wasn't entirely amused with his rationale. "But it was never my intention to make her feel bad.
"When I was in film school, one of the first things I learned was to work with what you have. And our family had this huge, unbelievable wealth of images - videos and photos.
"So, with the encouragement of friends and my sister, I went ahead, even though many times I got cold feet and stopped. As my recent partner said to me: 'If your sister can be so brave, grow a pair of ovaries and move on.' So I did."
Khan's mother avoided taking in the first screening of the film, but caught it later at a Toronto festival showing.
"To my right at that screening, I had someone laughing all the way through and to my left, I had my mom crying all the way through," recalls Khan, whose dad had died a few years earlier.
"At the end, she said: 'Oh, it was not so bad, and it's even kind of funny in parts.' She then told me she was proud of me, and then came a flood of tears. Then I told her that the purpose of this film was not to demonize people, but simply to show who I am."
Khan grew up in Islamabad, but as a young man he moved with his family to Mississauga, before he settled solo in Montreal. Although he had worked a series of jobs - including a stint as a flight attendant - he had long been fascinated by film and was accepted into Concordia University's esteemed cinema program. In 2012, he won a top prize at school for his short documentary, Zen, about a young boy with cerebral palsy.
"Interestingly, my father had been obsessed with film his whole life. I recently came across a trove of letters he had written to my mother over the years, and in every one, he talks about his love for movies - be they about Clark Gable, Greta Garbo or Westerns. That passion has been passed down. That helps with a complicated grieving process and coming to terms with a parent with whom I had such a difficult relationship."
Khan plans to follow up Abu with a comedy - of sorts.
"Actually, it's more of a surreal, dark satire about Canada's war on terror in the aftermath of 9/11. I was very angry with the association with the word 'terror' and my identity. That's really why I first wanted to become a filmmaker."

Abstract: While announcing Cliffe's candidacy on Monday, CAQ leader François Legault said West Islanders will now have an alternative to the Quebec Liberal party when they go to the polls in October. Cliffe, an entrepreneur and marketing specialist, ran unsuccessfully for a seat on Kirkland's city council in last November's municipal election.

Full text: Karen Cliffe will be the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) candidate for the riding of Nelligan in next fall's provincial election.
While announcing Cliffe's candidacy on Monday, CAQ leader François Legault said West Islanders will now have an alternative to the Quebec Liberal party when they go to the polls in October.
"Karen, along with many citizens of the West Island of Montreal, is tired of being taken for granted by the Liberals," Legault said in a statement.
"The citizens want to talk about economic development, jobs, and health. They do not want to endlessly debate the sovereignty of Quebec.
"The CAQ project is inside of Canada," Legault added. "The citizens of the West Island of Montreal now have an alternative: the CAQ."
Cliffe will be tasked with trying to unseat Liberal incumbent Martin Coiteux in Nelligan, a riding that includes Kirkland, the borough of Île-Bizard-Ste-Geneviève as well as part of Pierrefonds-Roxboro.
Coiteux easily won the riding in 2014 with over 80 percent of the vote, compared to 9.47 per cent for CAQ runner-up Albert Bitton.
Aside from being the Minister for the Montreal region, Coiteux is also Minister of Public Security and Minister of Municipal Affairs in Premier Philippe Couillard's government.
Cliffe, an entrepreneur and marketing specialist, ran unsuccessfully for a seat on Kirkland's city council in last November's municipal election.
She said access to health care motivated her to become a candidate for the CAQ. She also criticized the provincial Liberals for its handling of last year's spring flood crisis.
"In the greater Montreal area, a large number of people are still waiting to be compensated by the Liberal government. In Pierrefonds, the memory of the floods is still present," Cliffe said in a statement.
"And what will happen this spring if more floods occur? The authorities must be ready to deal with this kind of emergency. The CAQ has mentioned it several times: it is necessary to facilitate the processing of the files of the victims, so that the families can undertake or finish the repairs of their house as soon as possible."
Cliffe also plans to "accompany the municipal authorities" for the construction of an urban boulevard linking Pierrefonds and Kirkland, between Highway 40 and Gouin Blvd.
"With the REM to be built in the next few years, we will need more fluid access to the new station that will be built," she said. "This is essential for the quality of life of the citizens of the area and I will work with the municipal authorities to build the urban boulevard."

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Expect to see more Bixis on Montreal streets this spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-expand-bixi )
The city of Montreal hopes to expand the Bixi bike-sharing service to more neighbourhoods next year, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We intend to enlarge the zone that is served to make the service available in more boroughs, to ensure that in areas that are less well served, people can try it and take advantage of this service," the mayor said at a meeting of the executive committee.
Plante said expanding to more boroughs won't happen until next year, but she would announce some surprises for this year's edition of the bike-sharing program at a news conference on Tuesday to kick off the Bixi season, which runs April 15 to Nov. 15.
"I know that Montrealers are waiting impatiently. They are very excited about the idea of getting back on their bikes," she said.
Workers have already started installing Bixi stations around the city - a harbinger of spring despite the snow flurries expected Wednesday evening, Plante noted.
After the meeting, Éric Alan Caldwell, the executive committee member responsible for urban planning, transportation and the Office de consultation publique de Montréal, said Montrealers can expect to see more Bixis in the streets this year.
"A signal was clearly sent from the first days of our administration that we like Bixi, that we want Bixi to be part of mobility in Montreal, that we want to develop the model, that it belongs in the city and it belongs in Montreal," he said.
Montreal getting ready for influx of asylum seekers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-influx-of-migrants )
The city of Montreal is braced for a new influx of asylum seekers in the coming months, but will not be housing them in the Olympic Stadium, the executive-committee member responsible for housing and diversity said Wednesday.
"We're expecting a flood when the nice weather arrives," Magda Popeanu said to reporters at city hall after a meeting of the city's executive committee.
"We're prepared. We've been working with the office that was set up last year to deal with the migrants who came across the border," she said.
"We have an action plan for housing them and taking care of them and we've also been working hard with the Quebec Department of Immigration and Diversity," Popeanu said.
The city will use a variety of buildings, such as schools, to house the newcomers, she said. But unlike last year, when beds were set up in the Olympic Stadium, it will not requisition the Big O, she said.
Bon Jovi's Montreal concerts postponed due to illness( http://montrealgazette.com/news/bon-jovis-montreal-concerts-cancelled-due-to-illness )

The concerts have been rescheduled for May 17 and 18, Evenko said.
Those who have tickets for the April 4 show will be able to attend May 17, while those who were going to the April 5 show will see Bon Jovi on May 18.

Coalition wants to abolish time limit for sexual assault complaints

Author: Authier, Philip

Abstract: QUEBEC - Victims, lawyers and opposition politicians have teamed up to pressure the Couillard government to abolish the statute of limitations on allegations of sexual assault. In a report published last year, Quebec's ombudsman's office also urged( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ombudsman-backs-call-to- end -time-limits-in-sexual-assault-cases )the government to abolish it( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ombudsman-backs-call-to- end -time-limits-in-sexual-assault-cases ). "The imposing of a statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault represents a disgrace for Quebec," said Marc Bellemare, another lawyer (who is also a former Liberal cabinet minister) involved in such cases.

Full text: QUEBEC - Victims, lawyers and opposition politicians have teamed up to pressure the Couillard government to abolish the statute of limitations on allegations of sexual assault.
Arguing it's a question of dignity and humanity, the group said the fact Quebec is just about the only province still imposing a time limit for victims to launch such cases is a "disgrace."
While 11 provinces and territories have abolished their limits, Quebec's Civil Code has a 30-year limit, increased from three years in 2013.
Prince Edward Island still has a statute in place and it is for three years. Most of the provinces have also made such recourse retroactive, the group noted at a Quebec City news conference.
The group said they want action before the current legislature is dissolved June 12 as Quebec heads into a provincial election on Oct. 1.
"Why does the statute need to be abolished?" asked lawyer Alain Arsenault. "To allow the victims to heal."
"It's not the amount (of compensation) that matters the most. It's this recognition (that they are victims)."
Arsenault, who has acted on behalf of many victims in legal pursuits against religious orders, had statistics to support the assertion that many cases never get dealt with because time runs out.
He said on average one woman in three is a victim of assault in her lifetime as is one man in six. That represents about 25 per cent of the population or 2.1 million people.
But only one in 10 victims ever comes forward and that can take a very long time as the victim wrestles with all the emotions that follow such assaults before confiding in anyone.
In the recent class action suit against the Congrégation Ste-Croix( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-long-and-tortuous-road-catholic-brothers-guilty-plea-brings-relief-for-victim-but-not-closure ), the time between the assaults and the launching of the case was about 43 years which means many victims and potential criminals were not dealt with under the 30-year rule.
The idea of abolishing the statute is not entirely new. In a report published last year, Quebec's ombudsman's office also urged( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ombudsman-backs-call-to- end -time-limits-in-sexual-assault-cases )the government to abolish it( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ombudsman-backs-call-to- end -time-limits-in-sexual-assault-cases ).
Nothing has happened with Arsenault speculating one reason the government has not acted is because it fears a flood of new cases.
"Maybe the real reason is a lobby by the religious institutions and the possibility that the government itself is found to be responsible as an employer of these institutions," Arsenault said.
Sébastien Richard, spokesperson for the coalition pressuring Quebec to act, estimates that based on assault statistics, abolishing the statute could spark between 10,000 and 20,000 new cases.
But Wednesday the focus was on pressuring the government.
"The imposing of a statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault represents a disgrace for Quebec," said Marc Bellemare, another lawyer (who is also a former Liberal cabinet minister) involved in such cases.
"There is no reason for a limit. I ask the question: Who is the government protecting, who does it want to protect?"
"For us, it's a question of humanity, a question of dignity," added Véronique Hivon, deputy-leader of the Parti Québécois in announcing her party is part of the coalition.
Representatives of the Coalition Avenir Québec and the Québec solidaire were also on hand.
But late Wednesday, a spokesperson for Quebec Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée indicated the government sees no need to change the rules and said the group is creating confusion.
There is, in fact, no statute of limitations on criminal cases, the official said adding the Criminal Code is a federal responsibility.
Comparing Quebec to the other provinces is not fair because the other provinces do not have a civil code. If you compare Quebec to other countries with a civil code, such as France or Belgium, Quebec's statute of limitations is actually more generous.
And it was the PQ itself which proposed the 30-year limit when the code was modified in 2013, the official said.
The statute of limitations under the Civil Code also kicks in the moment the person realizes they were victims of assault, not the date of the act which means there is more time than the 30-year limit.
That means a person who is a victim at age 15 but not does not realize it constituted assault until age 40 during therapy or counselling would be able to press a case, the official said.

Montreal getting ready for influx of asylum seekers

Abstract: The city of Montreal is braced for a new influx of asylum seekers in the coming months, but will not be housing them in the Olympic Stadium, the executive-committee member responsible for housing and diversity said Wednesday. About 15,381 asylum-seekers, mostly from Haiti, were intercepted by the RCMP trying to enter Quebec from the United States between November 2016 and November 2017, Canada Border Services said last November( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heated-trailers-in-place-near-lacolle-border-as-haitians-in-u-s-ponder-future ).

The flood of migrants into Montreal last summer forced city officials to set up temporary accommodation in the Olympic Stadium and the former Royal Victoria Hospital.
Last year, the U.S. government cancelled a temporary residence program for almost 60,000 Haitians in the U.S.
The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to Haitians who fled to the U.S. following the earthquake in 2010. It allows Haitians to live and work in the U.S. until conditions in Haiti have improved enough to return home.
When the program ends for Haitians in July 2019, Haitians in the U.S. will have to leave, live underground or apply to stay in the U.S. using another immigration program.

Abstract: From stacks of self-help books to competing philosophies to know-it-all blogs to self-styled gurus (who promise they can sleep-train your baby in a week if you pay up and follow their patented system), there has never been so much information about parenting. Academics who study topics like helping children manage stress, autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, navigating the digital world and that persistent challenge, sleep, will be sharing their knowledge. [...]in many cases the school system won't even allow a failing grade.

Full text: Are you a Tiger Mother( http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043477,00.html ) or an Elephant Mom( https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/12/elephant-mom-timeof-tigermother/383378/ )?
Do you practise attachment, free-range, mindful or helicopter parenting?
Did you let your baby cry it out or did you co-sleep? Did you baby-wear or baby-led wean?
Yelling is the new spanking( https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/fashion/22yell.html ) when it comes to the long-term scars of child discipline. And dirty is the new clean when it comes to protecting our kids from lethal superbugs, according to the new book Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving Your Child From an Oversanitized World( https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/nikki-fotheringham/dirty-kids-are-healthy_b_14057410.html ), by microbiologist B. Brett Finlay.
Welcome to the age of angst-ridden parenting, where the most important job of our lives has become a high-stakes blood sport of competing (and often contradictory) styles, philosophies and choices that we're convinced will make or break our kids.
While our own parents' child-rearing resources were limited to Dr. Spock, the parents of today are addled by ever-shifting advice that is making us anxious, guilt-ridden and mistrustful of our own instincts. From stacks of self-help books to competing philosophies to know-it-all blogs to self-styled gurus (who promise they can sleep-train your baby in a week if you pay up and follow their patented system), there has never been so much information about parenting. Or so much confusion.
Fortunately for Montreal-area moms and dads, McGill University is here to try to help us make some sense of it all. For the second year in a row, it is running a lecture series( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-lecture-series-will-help-people-who-are-parenting-in-the-digital-age ), starting this week, intended to cut through the noise that is causing so many of us so much grief.
Academics who study topics like helping children manage stress, autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, navigating the digital world and that persistent challenge, sleep, will be sharing their knowledge. Parents will get practical guidance and have a chance to question the experts. It costs $75 for all the talks and you must register ahead of time( https://www.mcgill.ca/edu-ecp/ep2018 ).
Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, chair of the department of educational and counselling psychology at McGill, said parents today crave accurate advice about how to raise healthy, happy, well-adjusted children.
"Parenting is one of the most difficult things we do in life and yet we get no training," he said.
Derevensky said he gets cold calls "all the time" from members of the public seeking his counsel and input on how to handle various issues with their kids. And when the department has run parenting conferences in the past, the events grew from 70 participants to more than 800.
"It kind of tells you how desperate parents are for information," Derevensky said. "Parents call me as a child psychologist and ask me 'what do I do about this?' We all live in a very hurried world and we're all looking for shortcuts and easy answers."
We parents tend to put a lot of pressure on ourselves - and feel social pressure - to make sure we are doing right by our kids. We often feel responsible, not only for making sure we don't screw them up, but for ensuring their optimum development on every level.
As Montreal writer Bunmi Laditan - author of the MomLit bestseller Confessions of a Domestic Failure, a children's book called The Big Bed, and the searingly funny @HonestToddler Twitter account - so aptly put it (tongue-in-cheek)in a Facebook post that has since gone viral( https://www.facebook.com/BunmiKLaditan/posts/1899244270322560:0 ):
The work of a modern parent is to "make sure your children's academic, emotional, psychological, mental, spiritual, physical, nutritional and social needs are met while being careful not to overstimulate, understimulate, improperly medicate, helicopter or neglect them in a screen-free, processed foods-free, GMO-free, negative energy-free, plastics-free, body positive, socially conscious egalitarian but also authoritative, nurturing-but-fostering-of-independence, gentle-but-not-overly permissive, pesticide-free, two-storey, multilingual home, preferably on a cul-de-sac, with a backyard, and 1.5 siblings spaced at least two years apart for proper development. Also don't forget the coconut oil."
There are so many conundrums and caveats, it's hard enough to maintain our sanity. Yet the judgment of society and other parents when we do try to follow our own guy often seems to confirm our fears that we're doing everything wrong.
We try to breastfeed to optimize our babies' brain development, but we are shooed to the public restroom if we lift our shirts. We want to raise children who are independent. Yet parents have been arrested( https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/free-range-parents-cleared-in-second-neglect-case-after-children-walked-alone/2015/06/22/82283c24-188c-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html?utm_term=.e2199028e2f3 ) for letting their kids walk to the park by themselves. Meanwhile,Utah just passed a law( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/28/utahs-free-range-parenting-law-said-to-be-first-in-the-nation/?utm_term=.b48a7ac44053 ) protecting the rights of free-range parents to do just that.
Giving your kid a timeout( https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/16/health/time-out-parenting-go-ask-your-dad/index.html ) is as good as abandoning our children when they need you most, we're now told. But if we don't set limits and impose consequences, they'll grow up spoiled, entitled and depressed. The virtues of teaching our children grit are extolled, but we're afraid to let them fail. In fact, in many cases the school system won't even allow a failing grade.
Derevensky said parents today are often left feeling "inadequate" by the constant comparisons and the flood of unsolicited recommendations. But our Type-A approach to parenting may be leading many of us to commit some rather predictable mistakes.
The tendencies to overschedule our children's lives and "overdiagnose" normal kid problems as serious pathologies are two examples, Derevensky cited. But most crucially, he warned: "I'm also not convinced we listen to our kids as well as we should."
Perhaps it's because many of us are coming to parenthood later in life. (The average age of new mothers rose to 30( https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2014002-eng.htm ) for the first time in 2011). And we're having fewer children than in the past. So maybe that makes them all the more precious to us on a subconscious level and worthy of our all-in emotional, physical and financial investment.
Whatever the cause of our mania, the prescription for good parenting is probably a big dose of common sense.
"Parents as a whole have to sit back and spend time with their children," Derevensky said. "And listen to their children."

Full text: Some victims of last year's floods say they are still in bureaucratic hell, waiting for public agencies to provide promised compensation.
Several of those residents took to the microphone at a public meeting in Pierrefonds-Roxboro Tuesday night to voice frustration with what they say has been terrible communication and poor co-ordination between public agencies.
About 150 people attended the meeting of the city's public security committee, held in ground zero of last year's flooding, the Pierrefonds Cultural Centre. Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux said this month that roughly 80 per cent of the people affected by last spring's floods have received some compensation, worth $135 million.
However that was little solace to some who came out to the public meeting.
"We are real people and we're suffering, going through mental torture and nightmares," said Taussef Bhatti, an Île-Bizard resident who has been living in a hotel with his wife and children since last May. Bhatti is still waiting for a permit to rebuild his house and has received no cash advances from the province to do so. "What is a reasonable time period that we should be allowed to suffer?" Alex Norris, the chairperson of the public security committee, said while he can't address specific questions, he pointed out that it is difficult for different public bodies to co-ordinate when someone's house has been flooded and must be rebuilt.
While communication seems to be a problem for flood victims trying to get back on their feet, communication was also problematic during the response to the disaster, the city's public security commission heard at the meeting Tuesday.
Roughly 1,100 citizens were affected when 430 homes were flooded last year in Pierrefonds- Roxboro, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Île-Bizard during the historic floods. The city declared a state of emergency on May 7, and the army was called in to respond to a disaster on the island for the first time since the ice storm of 1998. A total of 36 families remain lodged in hotels while their homes are being repaired.
"The rapidity of the phenomenon made it seem that our plan and our capacity to respond was not sufficient to face this emergency; that's when we declared a state of emergency," Louise Bradette said at the meeting.
Bradette, the city's chief resilience officer, presented a report with 46 recommendations on how the city can improve its response to disasters, based on what went wrong last May.
Among the problems she identified were different agencies, like the police department, the fire department and the city, all working on their own emergency response plans without proper co-ordination between the departments.
She also said there was confusion among the city and the boroughs on whose job it was to acquire sandbags and the city's 311 telephone line was not equipped to handle a high volume of calls from citizens needing help.
To help attenuate future disasters, Bradette said the city has to redo its mapping of flooding risk areas, identify problems caused by building in flood zones and come up with a better way to forecast risks in the future.
At the meeting, several citizens also voiced concerns about the borough permitting development in the flood zones, saying it could contribute to future flooding risks.
Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough Mayor Jim Beis told the Montreal Gazette prior to the meeting the borough is conscious of the risks and will not be developing anywhere that could lead to further risks.
"No one is building on wetlands," Beis said. "If there ever is an eventual project on any part of Pierrefonds West, for example, all that is for debate. By no means will we build at any cost."
Beis said he believed a 5,500-unit housing development proposed by former Montreal mayor Denis Coderre's administration for the area near wetlands in the western sector of Pierrefonds could be developed responsibly. However the project seems to have fallen out of favour with Mayor Valérie Plante.
Beis added the borough has shored up dikes in the area, and has been making preparations over the last 10 months to ensure it can prevent future disasters and respond better in the event of a repeat occurrence. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder

Full text: The mayor of Pierrefonds-Roxboro is keeping his fingers crossed that residents in his borough will never experience another crisis like the great flood of 2017.
But borough Mayor Jim Beis said the level of preparedness for residents will be enhanced by a new guide that contains precautions, pertinent advice and information in the event of another flood from Rivière des Prairies.
Beis unveiled the bilingual 24-page "Residents' Guide: In Case of a Flood, Be Prepared!" last Thursday at the borough hall.
There are plans to distribute 2,500 copies of the guide to homes in the areas vulnerable to flooding. (The guide can also be viewed online( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ARROND_PIR_EN/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/BROCHURE%20-%20EN%20CAS%20D'INONDATION%20ANG%20LR_0.PDF ) on the borough's webpage.)
Beis and other borough councillors plan to go door-to-door to deliver the guide in the coming weeks.
"We're going to revisit some of the areas and see some of the folks we hadn't seen for many months, and show them that not only have we done a lot of stuff on the ground . . . but we're also looking out for their welfare by providing them with some important information that will help them, and at least put them at ease that we're doing something for them."
The guide contains a lot of useful information for residents in the event of a flood. It offers recommendations and actions to be taken before a flood, during an evacuation, after returning home and during clean-up operations.
Another section explains how residents can develop their own emergency plan and which items to include in a 72-hour emergency kit. The guide also provides a list of resources, including telephone numbers, online services and automated alert message services to stay informed
Beis said providing important contact information should help citizens during a crisis. "A lot of people know these resources exist but they didn't have the contact information."
The key for residents during that initial 72-hour period is preparedness, said Beis. "I didn't even know where my candles were at home, but I do now. Once you live through a crisis, you start looking at all this stuff. You start looking at insurance to see if you're covered for these kinds of things. So this is reminder for folks to situate themselves if there is another crisis."
Beis said the borough is better prepared for a flood on its river-lined territory than it was a year ago.
Residents row past an abandoned pick-up truck on 5th Ave. N. in Roxboro on May 9, 2017.
"We purchased 15,000 sand bags. We purchased 4x4x4 industrial bags that we placed already in locations on Fifth Ave., and an area in the west as well as a precaution so that in case there is water that comes up in those areas, at least we won't have to put out 20,000 bags. We have these walls that are put up with these bags," Beis said.
"When the emergency measures plan is declared, the city's responsibility at that point is purely operational. Civil security handles a lot of the rest of the coordination. Our role at that point is operations," he added.
"We are overseen by the Croix Rouge, who coordinate the big machine. But we do the operations on the grounds. It's really an orchestra with the maestro being civil security."
Beis said civic officials are closely monitoring water levels.
"It's 1.5 metres lower than it was last year. And the weather, the way it's been, because it's gradually thawing, is allowing for the free flow of the river and allowing it to go where it is supposed to and not accumulate in this area.
"So we're optimistic, but we never know," Beis said.

Borough to plant 300 trees to replace canopy

Abstract: Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis says the borough is committed to reaching the goals laid out in its local Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) for 2018. Environmental concerns are part of the plan, which calls for a reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions.

Full text: Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis says the borough is committed to reaching the goals laid out in its local Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) for 2018.
Beis said the second edition of the local SDP plan is meant to dovetail the first edition, launched in 2012.
Environmental concerns are part of the plan, which calls for a reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions.
The Agglomeration Council of Montreal adopted the Sustainable Montreal Plan in 2016 which called for three challenges or target to be met. It included reducing GHGs by 80 per cent by 2050.
It also called upon the city and its boroughs to make Montreal more equitable in terms of improving access to services and facilities, and to "fight inequalities and promote inclusiveness."
Beis said the first local plan led to the "implementation of mechanisms for administration and decision-making that have guided us ever since in our everyday practices, operations planning and development of new projects."
The mayor said the borough has taken hundreds of actions to fulfill the plan's broad challenges.
"We looked at our last sustainable plan and we looked at over 250 actions we did on the territory, and we looked at the percentage of what were able to achieve the last three years, and then asked, 'How do we move forward with other elements added to it'? So it's not like we're forgetting something."
Beis said last year's flood hampered efforts to deliver more SDP actions.
"The year of the flood stopped a lot of aspects of what we do. The public works and services were so overwhelmed with all of that. A lot of stuff was put on the back-burner," he said. "But even with that, we are able to accomplish a lot. Over 250 actions were complete in the borough in the last three years."
Environmental issues are part of the SDP. Beis said the borough plans to plant 300 trees in the next year, but many of them will be to replace dead or dying trees.
"With the whole Emerald Ash Borer (insect) killing Ash trees, that's why you see the environment a lot in there. It's because the number of trees we've had to cut down. We've had to create an action plan on tree planting in the borough in order to replenish the cover and canopy. So that is a priority."
Mobility issues, including public transportation and accessibility, are also priorities, Beis said.

Full text: February's spring tease was just that, the Weather Network says. There are chilly days ahead for most of Quebec in the early spring, coupled with a higher-than-usual threat of winter storms.
Those storms will bring above-normal amounts of precipitation across Eastern Canada, but the extended thaw in late winter means much of the snow in the south of Quebec has already melted, reducing the possibility of severe flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ). The Weather Network expects March to be colder than normal in Quebec, then bounce back in April.
"While dramatic swings in weather are a normal part of the season, this spring looks to have a particularly volatile mood," says Chris Scott, chief meteorologist with The Weather Network.
Also coming this spring is the second of 2018's two blue moons. That's coming overnight March 30-31.

Abstract: More than 600 people have signed a petition calling on the government to allow victims of natural disasters to use money from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to rebuild or relocate, without penalty. The petition called "upon the Minister of National Revenue to amend the law governing RRSPs so that anyone who has experienced a natural disaster such as a tornado, fire, flood or earthquake can withdraw their RRSP without being subject to taxation, penalties or a maximum withdrawal amount, and that the repayment period shall be 15 to 20 years, retroactive to May 6, 2017."

Full text: As much of a nightmare as the floods of 2017 were to live through, the ongoing horror that some survivors are still experiencing is arguably worse. Almost an entire year after the floods that ravaged Pierrefonds, Rigaud, Gatineau and other communities in the western part of Quebec, some families remain in hotel rooms, living with relatives or relying on aid. They are exhausted in every sense of the word. All they want now is their home.
While the wheels of bureaucracy turn frustratingly slowly, there is one proposed measure that could help get them back on their feet: More than 600 people have signed a petition calling on the government to allow victims of natural disasters to use money from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to rebuild or relocate, without penalty. The petition called "upon the Minister of National Revenue to amend the law governing RRSPs so that anyone who has experienced a natural disaster such as a tornado, fire, flood or earthquake can withdraw their RRSP without being subject to taxation, penalties or a maximum withdrawal amount, and that the repayment period shall be 15 to 20 years, retroactive to May 6, 2017." This would be similar to the first-time home buyers plan.
That initiative deserves support. Those who have the means should be allowed to, in effect, lend themselves their own money from their retirement savings.
Families have lost their homes, photo albums and childhood keepsakes. Entire families were rescued in canoes. These are homeowners who had worked hard for their nearly half-million dollar properties (in some cases), and paid taxes on them. However, their insurance policies generally did not cover this kind of flooding. In some cases, their properties have been rezoned and they are not allowed to rebuild. Government compensation cheques have generally covered a fraction of the value of their homes - one-quarter for those who are lucky. In other cases, family homes that may eventually be rebuilt sit wrecked, frozen and in disrepair, partly as a result of red tape.
Even for the luckier flood victims, the experience has been traumatic. I remember the shrill fear in my sister's voice when she called me last May. She told me the water level was rising fast and that the firefighters had warned them to get out. She sent her kids to stay with family while she and her husband stayed behind to help save their own house and the houses of their neighbours. Almost every home on my sister's street got flooded. Some were complete write-off's, others just a mess. Thankfully, strategically placed sandbags, fantastic volunteers and divine intervention kept her own home mostly dry. Others were not quite so lucky.
In the months that followed, driveways in her Pierrefonds neighbourhood were littered with construction dumpsters, the way most driveways would otherwise be filled with children's bikes on a warm summer day.
As the weeks went by, stories of heroism, loss, sadness and triumph emerged. We heard of strangers helping strangers, we heard of volunteers filling sandbags, and so much more. Our city came together as one can only do in times of crisis and we stood shoulder to shoulder with our neighbours in need.
Millions have been raised for flood relief, government money has been put aside and fundraiser upon fundraiser has been held. It is mind-boggling to know that there are still many families that have yet to see much if any of those funds. Tens of millions of dollars are sitting earmarked for flood victims, yet families continue to suffer.
It should not solely be up to the government or for charitable citizens to foot the bill when we're dealing with the devastation of this magnitude, however. Allowing homeowners to dip into their own hard-earned cash should be part of the response.

Full text: Re: "Quebec unveils plan to improve disaster relief" (Montreal Gazette, March 2) Quebec's declaration that it will subsidize new urban flood maps is welcome, but the government has yet to declare its support for conserving the remaining, yet significant wetlands on the island of Montreal.
Since wetlands are crucial in preventing flooding and are important areas of biodiversity, Quebec and Montreal should act quickly to preserve the Technoparc wetlands in St-Laurent and the large wetland area in west Pierrefonds, among others.
There is no need to destroy more eco-territories for the sake of condos and industrial buildings that can be built elsewhere.

Researchers say spring flooding is a reality of climate change

Author: Greenaway, Kathryn

Abstract: According to climate-change experts Ursule Boyer-Villemaire and Philippe Gagnon, it isn't a question of whether it will flood again in the spring, it's a question of how bad the flooding will be. During a recent interview with the West Island Gazette, the two were measured with their optimism, but agreed that there are positive steps being taken in parts of Europe to cope with the realities of climate change and that this part of the world might well take a closer look to see what could be applied here. [...]the ground was frozen solid, so the run-off from the combination of rain and melting snow flowed into rivers or pooled on land.

Full text: According to climate-change experts Ursule Boyer-Villemaire and Philippe Gagnon, it isn't a question of whether it will flood again in the spring, it's a question of how bad the flooding will be.
Boyer-Villemaire and Gagnon are both working at Université du Québec à Montréal - he as a professor and she as a research associate - and both have PhDs in environmental science.
During a recent interview with the West Island Gazette, the two were measured with their optimism, but agreed that there are positive steps being taken in parts of Europe to cope with the realities of climate change and that this part of the world might well take a closer look to see what could be applied here.
Historic flooding affected thousands throughout the province last spring. Hard hit West Island and Off-Island communities included Hudson, Rigaud, Île-Mercier in Île-Bizard, Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue. Some people have yet to return to their homes because repairs are not complete. At least four residents of Pierrefonds-Roxboro were told their homes will have to be destroyed.
Gagnon said last spring's disaster was due to a perfect storm of weather incidents which, piled one on top of the other, resulted in a "high-intensity" weather event.
In March, there was snow. Then came heavy rain and a rapid melt. But the ground was frozen solid, so the run-off from the combination of rain and melting snow flowed into rivers or pooled on land.
"There is no doubt that with climate change, with warming conditions - there is more humidity in the atmosphere which can result in high-intensity events during the winter and the spring," Gagnon said. "Our capacity to manage the water cycle is strongly affected by the warming trend."
Water levels in Lake Ontario are high and the thaw has yet to begin. Ice jams and slush can also cause banks to be breached. The Moses-Saunders Power Dam near Cornwall and the Carillon Dam near Rigaud will be called upon to walk the delicate water-management tightrope.
Boyer-Villemaire said planting vegetation on the shoreline helps slow run-off. Combining vegetation with modest rock barriers installed by professionals is the next step. A more substantial, man-made barrier is also an option, but she said the bigger the barrier, the greater the chance that holding the water back on one property could result in water problems on neighbouring properties.
"Whatever is built has to be proven to be for the common good," she said.
Last week, the Quebec government released a 24-point action plan to improve the response to disasters. Better communication between the province and municipalities is part of the plan.
"That's good, but we also need easier access to crucial information for citizens," Boyer-Villemaire said.
She said real estate agents in France are compelled by law to inform potential buyers of any risk attached to a piece of land or a property before a deal is signed. Also in France, a percentage of each real estate deal is added to a fund which can be used to deal with the impact of climate change.
Boyer-Villemaire also spoke of a long-term evacuation plan in the United Kingdom. People who are living in what are now deemed flood plains are given up to 20 years to come to terms with the reality, take the time to grieve, and then look for a place to set down new roots.
The network of dikes in the Netherlands is considered to be the best in the world, built to last by experts in flood defence.
Boyer-Villemaire said drawing on expertise from a variety of sources is necessary as the province fine-tunes its response to disasters.
"And academics should be involved in the planning," she said. "We have knowledge to offer."

Stigma Of Addiction; Physician talks about guidelines to treat drug abuse

Full text: Early Monday morning, every physician in Canada with an email account got notice of a new set of guidelines for managing patients who show up with a drug addiction to a powerful narcotic such as heroin or fentanyl.
Drug deaths numbered about 4,000 in Canada last year, fuelled by a combination of physician overprescribing and a flood of illegal drugs on the streets, including synthetically produced fentanyl and its more powerful cousin, carfentanil.
Published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the guide aims to stem the public health emergency by streamlining "best practices" for treating opioid users seen by specialists and family physicians.
It recommends giving addicts a drug substitution therapy as a first line of treatment, said lead author Julie Bruneau, a Université de Montréal physician. "So a physician who has a drug user in front of him or her has to do something, rather than say, 'Oh, I don't do this.'" The first line of treatment whenever possible should be Suboxone, a pill combining mostly buprenorphine with a touch of naloxone, to prevent users from crushing the pill to inject. When injected, naloxone cancels the effect of buprenorphine and acts like a narcotic antidote.
"We hope we're not opening a loose conversation, but real dialogue to change regulations at the provincial and local levels," Bruneau said told the Montreal Gazette.
The interview was condensed and edited for space. Q Why was there a need for national guidelines? A If fatalities in the opioid crisis are dramatic, they are also the tip of the iceberg. In Canada, there are many places where access to treatment for opioid use disorder is not easy, and the best treatments are not readily available. So the opioid national guideline is to be seen as tool for the best evidence-based treatment. What is the best option given the patients'circumstances? What should be the standard of care for this population? It's the same type of pragmatic approach that should be used for every disease and condition. Q Why is addiction not treated with the same seriousness and consideration as other diseases? A Addiction is sometimes seen as just a question of motivation. The person is choosing to be addicted. Then there's the illegal nature of the activity that makes the person more of a criminal than a patient. A lot of discrimination is ingrained in our attitudes. Diabetes at the beginning of the last century was seen as weakness of people eating too much sugar - before insulin was discovered. Now we know that addiction is a brain disease, a neurobiological condition. The other reason is the lack of training for most health-care professionals who don't know what to do or don't feel well-equipped to treat people who are using drugs. The guideline is a tool to mainstream opioid disorder and put its treatment on an equal footing as any other disease, which is not the case right now. Q You say that a lot of treatment in Canada is not based on scientific evidence when it comes to addiction. For example? A We strongly recommend not doing short-term withdrawal for opioid use disorder - under a month of tapering down - but it's still practised in many places even though a quick detox is associated with high relapse and risky behaviours that can lead to overdose and transmission of HIV and other infections. When you have someone who is taking drugs, the popular thinking is that he should go into rehab, fix his problem, and stop taking the drug. Q Why is buprenorphine recommended as a first line of treatment for addiction? A What we did in this guideline, which hasn't been done before, is put treatment options in relation to a continuum of care. Not just for specialists but for family physicians and health-care professionals in general. It's first line because the scientific literature said it's the best treatment and with the best outcome. On top of it, it's preferred because this medication is easier to prescribe. It's safer and less toxic and has fewer side-effects. It's more suitable for use in primary care. There's no reason why a drug user can't be treated in a doctor's office. And if it is not stabilized, then the patient can be referred to a specialist, as with any other disease. Q From the perspective of the patient, what are some obstacles for those seeking treatment? A There is a lot of stigma and discrimination associated with drug use. By the time they come to a hospital or clinic, patients are distrustful of the system. They don't feel welcome. Just getting health care is really hard. If you have access to primary care, you have access to screening, prevention and treatment for your other conditions. It's not an on/off situation where a patient comes to a doctor's office, gets stamped as drug user, and is referred directly to treatment for addiction. A patient is a person with lots of complex issues, and drug use is one issue. Good-quality primary care (at the family physicians clinics) could make a big difference in their lives - and the landscape of what is happening with the opioid crisis. Q From the perspective of public health, what are some of the challenges of treating narcotic addictions? A There are several. It's a complex and chronic condition. But we often think of it as something that has to be treated acutely, like short-term detox. But from a public health perspective, it needs more of a harm-reduction approach - because of HIV, hepatitis and other infections associated with drug injection. Q How did these guidelines come to be? A Based on a review of the scientific literature (meta-analysis of studies and randomized trials), we outlined draft recommendations that have been through two cycles of revisions by experts in Canada. And then after those two, they were reviewed by international experts and groups of patients and other people affected by drug use. They have to be in line with the preferences and values of patients where they're supposed to be applied. cfidelman@postmedia.com

Abstract: While many firms have committed to reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to help control climate change, others are still under the misguided notion that only profit matters. Given that organizations rely on stakeholders (employees, suppliers, community support) and access to water, trees or other environmental resources to succeed, it makes sense for them to take care of these resources for the long-term survival of the business. Catherine McKenna, Canada's minister of environment and climate change, maintains that we need systems in place to both protect the environment and support the economy, ensuring opportunity for all, and has worked to embed this philosophy throughout the federal government.

Full text: BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm, recently issued a wakeup call to CEOs. The firm, whose investment decisions have a major impact on the economic health of major companies, advised them that their success depends on embracing sustainability and responding to climate change.
How can a corporation make a profit, satisfy shareholders and protect the planet, all at the same time? This appears to be a tall task, but do these interests really conflict?
Those questions are made urgent by the fact that our climate is changing, and the scientific community agrees we are the cause. With rising temperatures comes increased flood risks in some areas and droughts in others. Here in Quebec, we recently had scores of citizens affected by a greater than one in 100-year flood( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ). Meanwhile, Alberta was experiencing a dramatic heatwave, more intense than any in recent memory. These changes bring with them any number of serious consequences, including for agriculture. While many firms have committed to reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to help control climate change, others are still under the misguided notion that only profit matters.
Organizations often cite pressure to create returns for shareholders. But to say the only thing shareholders want is a return on their money is simplistic. Yes, I want to earn a return on my investment, but not at the expense of the air I breathe, the water I drink or the wellness of myself or my neighbours.
And shareholders are not the only ones whose views should be considered. In 2008, Canada's Supreme Court was asked whether a board of directors should consider other stakeholders beyond shareholders. It found that stakeholders should be considered. It also confirmed that the law does not require that shareholders be prioritized over other groups. A board has broad discretion to make decisions in the best interest of the company as a whole. Given that organizations rely on stakeholders (employees, suppliers, community support) and access to water, trees or other environmental resources to succeed, it makes sense for them to take care of these resources for the long-term survival of the business.
In any case, contrary to popular belief, sustainability isn't necessarily costly for businesses in the short term. Research by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer, published in the Harvard Business Review, outlines how incorporating sustainability into company strategy can help identify new opportunities. The case of clothing and gear company Patagonia provides a good example. Company founder Yvon Chouinard created a successful business making products that people can use for life, while countering the throwaway culture, treating his employees well and sourcing sustainable materials.
Catherine McKenna, Canada's minister of environment and climate change, maintains that we need systems in place to both protect the environment and support the economy, ensuring opportunity for all, and has worked to embed this philosophy throughout the federal government. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains recently backed this up with a $700 million investment to develop Canada's green technology industry, combining job creation and environmental protection.
Sustainability, investing and profit do not need to exist in conflict; they can be mutually supportive. Ignoring these issues, however, would be a big mistake for organizations: it will affect their business model. Sustainability ensures we have what we need in the future.
Consumers can drive profits to sustainable companies that provide living wages by buying products that are recyclable, reusable, and have low environmental impact. Investors can achieve strong returns and open the door to new opportunities by pressing companies to be more sustainable. Boards can ensure long-term corporate viability by taking a holistic view of the business, protecting its social and environmental resources. We all have a role to play, and the time to take action is now.

Abstract: In the wake of 2017's historic flooding, the Quebec government said it will pour more money into disaster preparedness, and make it easier for future victims to get compensation. Other measures included improving disaster plans in cities, simplifying information for victims on the province's website, and revisiting urban plans to ensure there is no new development within floodplains. Coiteux also didn't address how he would lighten the bureaucratic process for disaster victims, Benoit Charette, the CAQ MNA for Deux-Montagnes said the city of Deux-Montagnes has been asking the ministry to build a new dike that can prevent future flooding, but has so far been stonewalled. jmagder@postmedia.com( mailto:jmagder@postmedia.com ) Twitter.com/JasonMagder( http://Twitter.com/JasonMagder ) Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist( http://Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist ) Related More of our 2017-2018 flood coverage( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) CREDIT:

Full text: In the wake of 2017's historic flooding, the Quebec government said it will pour more money into disaster preparedness, and make it easier for future victims to get compensation.
That was the gist of a new 24-point plan( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/securite-civile/publications-et-statistiques/plan-action.html ) to improve the response to disasters unveiled Thursday.
Other measures included improving disaster plans in cities, simplifying information for victims on the province's website, and revisiting urban plans to ensure there is no new development within floodplains.
Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux said his department was overwhelmed by a deluge of people claiming damages in last spring's floods( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), with more than 6,000 claimants, compared to the usual 100 or so per year. He said because of that volume, the ministry had to hire and train new staff, which caused delays for victims to receive compensation for their damages.
He said for future incidents the ministry will train employees that are already on staff in other governmental departments to work with disaster victims so that if there is a major incident, they can be pressed into action.
"It will allow us to have a permanent squad so we don't have to hire as many temporary employees," Coiteux said.
He said the province will also allow cities and towns to handle claims if they wish to do so, and that could make it faster and more efficient for victims to get compensation.
The plan also comes with $20.5 million for cities to update floodplain maps that are in some cases woefully out of date, and another $20 million to come up with updated disaster relief plans.
"The work will take several years, and we have to start right now," Coiteux said.
The Montreal Metropolitan Community issued a statement on Thursday welcoming the news. The MMC will receive $5.5 million to update floodplain maps in the region, according to the plan. The MMC added it is also working to put in place a tool that will allow it to forecast river levels three days in advance.
Springtime flooding in 2017 affected more than 5,300 homes over 291 cities and towns, the government said, forcing more than 4,000 people to leave their homes. As of Thursday about 100 people were still being housed in hotels because repairs on their homes are not yet complete, Coiteux said. About $135 million had already been paid to about 80 per cent of the people claiming damages.
Coiteux pointed out that the damages from last year's flooding was unprecedented, and he doesn't expect the situation to be as drastic this year( http://montrealgazette.com/news/at-risk-areas-of-quebec-are-on-flood-watch-coiteux-tells-reporters ). However, he said the ministry will be better prepared for future disasters.
Quebec's new disaster plan was not welcomed by everyone.
The Coalition Avenir Québec said in a statement the plan did not say how the government would mobilize more forces to help in the wake of a disaster. Coiteux also didn't address how he would lighten the bureaucratic process for disaster victims,
Benoit Charette, the CAQ MNA for Deux-Montagnes said the city of Deux-Montagnes has been asking the ministry to build a new dike that can prevent future flooding, but has so far been stonewalled.

Abstract: With the memory of last spring's flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) still fresh and the sound of freezing rain crackling on Quebec City( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-100000-in-the-dark-as-freezing-rain-coats-quebec-city-region ), provincial Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux told reporters on Wednesday that at-risk areas of the province have been put on flood-watch status. "In the Eastern Townships, in certain parts of the Montéregie - particularly in the area of the Yamaska River - I think it's clear that we're in a state of alert and our teams on the ground are in contact with (risk-prone) areas," he said.

"There's an increased surveillance on all the waterways concerned."
Coiteux said the lessons learned from last year's flooding - which hit especially hard in Rigaud, Île-Bizard and Pierrefonds - included a more effective plan to allow the provincial government to work with cities in towns in the wake of a flood.
"I expect very soon to have an action to show you and it will contain very, very concrete measures," he said.
The Couillard government and Coiteux specifically were blasted for how they handled damage compensation and accused of entangling flood victims in red tape. As of last month, less than 10 per cent of the more than 6,000 claims had been fully processed nearly a year after the flooding.

Dorval public works poised for action while monitoring water levels

Author: Greenaway, Kathryn

Abstract: Lawrence River Board spokesman Jacob Bruxer said Lac St. Louis is 35 cm higher than usual for this time of year, but that there remains 40 additional centimetres of wiggle room before there is any danger of flooding and that regulating the outflow at the Moses-Saunders Dam near Cornwall, Ont. would prevent the lake water from reaching that danger point. Overflowing sewage and storm-water pipes also wreaked havoc last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/ile-bizard-family-still-reeling-after-spring-flood-damages-home ).

Full text: Dorval Mayor Edgar Rouleau knows people are nervous. Around 20 mm of rain was forecast to fall Tuesday through Wednesday. The ground is frozen solid. Ice and snow abound. Temperatures are above normal. And memories of record-breaking spring flooding in 2017 are still fresh.
"The trucks are loaded with bags and public works is monitoring the (lake) water levels closely," Rouleau said. "We want people to know we are ready for action."
Dorval uses crushed stone instead of the conventional sand. The stone is crushed finely enough to pack well and prevent water seepage.
Rouleau said the city has more than 800 bags at the ready. Last year, at the peak of the flooding, the city had distributed between 500 and 550 bags. The mayor said some citizens opted to keep the bags they used last spring.
"We only had a handful of homes affected by flooding last year and most of them had slanted driveways," Rouleau said. "Those homes are a priority because they are the most vulnerable."
International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board spokesman Jacob Bruxer said Lac St. Louis is 35 cm higher than usual for this time of year, but that there remains 40 additional centimetres of wiggle room before there is any danger of flooding and that regulating the outflow at the Moses-Saunders Dam near Cornwall, Ont. would prevent the lake water from reaching that danger point.
Bruxer said the heavy rains in March and April of last year were the tipping point that unleashed the massive spring flooding. He said that a spate of heavy rain like the region experienced last year is impossible to predict so far in advance, but that the situation is well under control at this stage.
Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pierrefonds-roxboro-monitoring-riviere-des-prairies-water-levels ) told the West Island Gazette last month that a series of measures were already being put in place in at points in the borough most vulnerable to flooding. Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa said water levels are being rigorously monitored and that an information session for citizens concerning flood preparedness will be held in March. Date to be determined.
Lakes are not the only source of flooding. Overflowing sewage and storm-water pipes also wreaked havoc last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/ile-bizard-family-still-reeling-after-spring-flood-damages-home ).
"Public works has been out clearing ice away from manholes and out of pipes," Rouleau said. "(On Monday) we received between 45 and 50 calls from residents. Some just needed reassurance that we were doing something to prepare for flooding. Others reported water accumulating in the streets."
Rouleau said the preparations( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows ) in Dorval are not only for this week's thaw and rain, but for the spring thaw on the way.
"People are anxious," he said. "They can call us. We are ready to help."

Update: Heavy rain probably won't cause major flooding, meteorologist says

Abstract: The rain combined with the runoff from the melting snow could cause localized flooding near small rivers, but won't lead to major flooding of homes on larger rivers such as Rivière des Prairies and the Ottawa River, said Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist from Environment Canada "Last spring, we had several weeks of rainfall and warm temperatures that created the flooding (of homes)," Parent said. Following last spring's widespread flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), officials who monitor river levels are paying close attention to the height of the rivers and the upcoming forecasts, he said.

Full text: Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area, warning of "significant rainfall" in the area over the next three days, precipitation that could lead to localized flooding.
The statement, issued Monday, covers the Châteauguay-La-Prairie area, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Montreal Island, and notes that southern Quebec will see "a significant warming trend along with significant rainfall amounts."
The rain combined with the runoff from the melting snow could cause localized flooding near small rivers, but won't lead to major flooding of homes on larger rivers such as Rivière des Prairies and the Ottawa River, said Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist from Environment Canada
"Last spring, we had several weeks of rainfall and warm temperatures that created the flooding (of homes)," Parent said.
"An event like this one (where we have) two or three days, of warm temperatures could have some impacts near small rivers."
Following last spring's widespread flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), officials who monitor river levels are paying close attention to the height of the rivers and the upcoming forecasts, he said.
In the town of Rigaud, where more than 300 homeowners were flooded last spring, a spokesperson said officials are not expecting the upcoming rainfall to cause flooding.
"The rain will remove the snow that's on the ice, but the ice on the river is still thick and the rain won't melt the ice," said Marie-Andrée Gagnon, a town spokesperson.
Officials will patrol the area near the Ottawa River, just in case. As it does every year, the town has ordered 15,000 sandbags in case the river bursts its banks. Gagnon said some basements in homes close to the river flood every spring and residents are used to the inconvenience.
A warm front from the central United States is expected to move across the province over the next few days and temperatures are expected to gradually rise before reaching more than 10 degrees on Wednesday. Montreal experiences temperatures above 10 C in February about once every four years, Parent said. The record high for Feb. 21 is 14 C, which was recorded in 1981.
Rainfall amounts between 20 and 30 millimetres are expected between Monday evening and Wednesday. The rain combined with the runoff from the melting snow could cause localized flooding.
The forecast for Monday calls for a mix of sun and cloud with a high of 6 degrees Celsius, with rain beginning in the evening. Tuesday has a forecast high of 4 C, while on Wednesday it could rise to 11 C.

Editorial: City should listen to opponents of Mount Royal traffic plan

Full text: It seems it might be easier to move mountains than to move Luc Ferrandez away from his plan to prevent cars from crossing Mount Royal from one side to the other. His announcement earlier this month elicited a groundswell of outraged opposition, which continues. But based on his reported comments( http://www.lapresse.ca/debats/chroniques/marie-claude-lortie/201802/13/01-5153785-la-montagne-cul-de-sac.php ) in recent days, it seems clear that the mind of the executive committee member responsible for large parks is made up.
In a flood of letters to the editor and elsewhere, citizens have raised any number of objections to the plan to have eastbound cars stop at Beaver Lake and westbound cars stop at Smith House, creating two cul de sacs.
The plan, it has been pointed out, effectively will erect a barrier between the eastern and western halves of the city. It will be harder for western Montrealers to show off the lookout to visitors, and for families from the east to reach Beaver Lake.
Forcing cars to take the longer route around the mountain will just create more traffic tie-ups and increase greenhouse-gas emissions.
The new arrangement, which is presented as intended to increase safety on the mountain, appears to be an over-reaction to the tragic death of a young cyclist on Camillien-Houde Way who was hit by a vehicle making an illegal U-turn. But to anyone familiar with Ferrandez's record as mayor of Plateau Mont-Royal borough - in which street-direction changes and other measures were enacted to make the area a hostile one for drivers and discourage through traffic - the plan for the mountain seems of a piece.
Certainly, it is hard to see how this would be the best way to increase safety. Many people have suggested that if illegal U-turns are a problem, they could be prevented by installing a concrete median - perhaps using barriers no longer needed for the Formula E race. As well, the city already has an arsenal of "traffic calming" measures that could be applied - though please, no more speed bumps - to slow vehicular traffic.
There were indications this past week that there might be some form of belated public consultation, or at least, Montrealers would be presented with an impact study before the plan is implemented. Certainly, the lack of public consultation prior to the announcement - or even consultation of key stakeholders like Les Amis de la montagne - was deeply disappointing coming from a party that had promised to do better.
During the election campaign, Projet Montréal took umbrage at suggestions by then-mayor Denis Coderre that Projet would "Plateau-ize" Montreal. Suddenly, that seems less far-fetched.

Abstract: To date, all flood victims have received some level of compensation, Coiteux told reporters. Armed with numbers provided by access to information requests, the CAQ MNA for Mirabel, Sylvie D'Amours, held a news conference on Tuesday to say that as of Jan. 18, only 89 of the 1,026 claims filed by victims in the Montreal region in the wake of floods in April and May of last year had actually been closed. Joining her for the news conference, CAQ leader François Legault ripped into the government.

Full text: QUEBEC - The Couillard government accused the opposition Coalition Avenir Québec of misleading Quebecers by claiming less than 10 per cent of damage claims from last year's spring floods have been compensated by the government.
Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux said there can be all kinds of reasons the files are not closed, like there is still work to be done or people have delayed making a decision about whether they want to rebuild.
In other cases, victims opted to do work in the spring rather than winter, so their files are not closed. In still others, the victims are challenging their settlements.
But Coiteux said it's dead wrong to say - as the CAQ did in a press release - that the victims have been abandoned by the Liberal government.
To date, all flood victims have received some level of compensation, Coiteux told reporters. Quebec has, in fact, handed over a total of $118 million to 6,000 people, and the account is still open.
"The CAQ is presenting numbers in a completely meaningless fashion," Coiteux said. "It is totally untrue to say people have not received money."
Armed with numbers provided by access to information requests, the CAQ MNA for Mirabel, Sylvie D'Amours, held a news conference on Tuesday to say that as of Jan. 18, only 89 of the 1,026 claims filed by victims in the Montreal region in the wake of floods in April and May of last year had actually been closed.
The situation is similar across the province, the CAQ said. Of the total 6,036 files opened, only 452 (7.5 per cent) have been settled.
Joining her for the news conference, CAQ leader François Legault ripped into the government.
"It makes no sense," Legault said. "These files are jammed up in the Liberal bureaucracy. It's time (Premier) Philippe Couillard personally handled these flood victim files.
"You know Mr. Couillard went there (to the site of floods) with his big boots and said, 'Hey, I'm taking charge of this personally.'
"Its about time he gets involved. There people have suffered a lot of stress. In many cases they lost their homes and are still living in hotels."
But when D'Amours raised the issue later in the legislature and asked why nine months after the flood 100 families are still living in hotels, Coiteux fought back with zeal.
"With respect, I think she does not understand the situation of these victims," Coiteux said. "Does she want to them to go back and live in unsanitary houses where the cleanup work has not been done?
"This is out of the question. I even issued directives to keep some in hotels longer than the regulation allows as a humanitarian gesture.
"Is she saying we should close these files and not give any more financial compensation?"
But D'Amours said the CAQ is not done with the issue and noted in the case of other floods in recent years victims have waited as long as two years to get compensation.

Abstract: Despite repeated claims by the Quebec government that it has tried to fast-track compensation claims by those who suffered damage or displacement by last year's spring floods( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), less than 10 per cent of the more than 1,000 claims made in the Montreal area have been successfully completed, the Coalition Avenir Québec charged on Tuesday. D'Amours, who saw much of her riding of Mirabel swamped by floodwaters, described the success rate as evidence that the Liberals had mismanaged the post-flood relief effort.( http://montrealgazette.com/news/our-patience-has-run-out-quebec-flood-victims-feel-abandoned-by-government ) "How can (Premier) Philippe Couillard tolerate that families ... are still being crushed by Liberal paperwork and bureaucracy nearly a year after the flood?" she wrote.

Formula E: 10,000 more freebies than previously revealed

Author: Magder, Jason

Abstract: During her election campaign, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante promised to move the event from downtown for the remaining two years of the city's contract with Formula E. In December, her administration announced it was pulling the plug altogether( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/in-the-wake-of-bombshell-reports-mayor-to-address-formula-es-future-in-montreal ), saying it was costing taxpayers too much. Formula E, the race's parent body, issued a demand letter to the city and MCE( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/formula-e-organizers-to-take-legal-action-against-montreal ) in December for amounts unpaid, and for breach of contract for cancelling the second and third years of a three-year contract. Spokesperson Olivier Lachance said the party is sticking with its position from December, saying the decision to cancel the race seems justified, but the party would like to know the event's final cost. jmagder@postmedia.com( mailto:jmagder@postmedia.com ) Twitter.com/JasonMagder( http://Twitter.com/JasonMagder ) Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist( http://Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist ) CREDIT:

Full text: It turns out 30,000 tickets - not 20,000( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20000-of-45000-formula-e-tickets-were-given-away-organizers-say ) - were given away for last summer's ePrix, the non-profit agency running the Formula E revealed Monday.
Formula E, featuring all-electric single-seater cars, was conceived in 2012 as a means to showcase the potential of sustainable mobility. As such, ePrix races are meant to be held where the electrification of transport is needed most - in dense, urban areas, and not on traditional racetracks.
However, the Montreal event held on the eastern edge of downtown last July drew complaints from residents, merchants and motorists during the nearly month-long period of setting up and taking down the temporary circuit.
During her election campaign, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante promised to move the event from downtown for the remaining two years of the city's contract with Formula E. In December, her administration announced it was pulling the plug altogether( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/in-the-wake-of-bombshell-reports-mayor-to-address-formula-es-future-in-montreal ), saying it was costing taxpayers too much.
In unveiling its final financial results Monday, Montréal c'est électrique (MCE) reported a deficit of $13.55 million, including $8.1 million in promised subsidies the organization never received from the city. If the corporation had received that subsidy, the deficit would only have been $5.45 million - which falls within the original projections, said the organization's director general, Simon Pillarella.
Including the deficit, the debt and the city's $10-million credit line, Montréal c'est électrique spent $20.5 million on the event, MCE spokesperson Patrice Attanasio said.
However, the city spent an additional amount on security, police, communications and logistics, which were not part of the MCE budget. The city's portion of the event also included the controversial concrete barriers embossed with Montreal's logo, which were purchased at a cost of $7.5 million( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-formula-e-to-flood-breaks-plante-mulls-recycling-pricey-concrete-barriers ).
Plante told reporters Monday she did not know what the final tally would be.
"We're in the process of finalizing the numbers," she said. "But one of the reasons we pulled the plug is that we needed to stop the hemorrhage."
Reacting to the news Monday, Coalition Montréal councillor Marvin Rotrand said he's disappointed in the event, calling it a financial fiasco, but he's equally upset that it took more than six months for the race's financial details to be made known. He said councillors were stonewalled when they tried to find out how much the city was spending on it because MCE was conceived as a separate corporation and although it was spending public funds, it was not accountable to city council.
"As bad as the loss is in terms of revenue and what this means for the taxpayer, what's even worse is that in a democratic system of responsible government, you are supposed to be responsible to council, and when you do not give the information that councillors have a right to have, you're subverting democracy," Rotrand said.
A total of 45,000 people attended the July 29-30 race, but the overwhelming majority got in for free.
Pillarella told the Montreal Gazette only 15,000 of the tickets were purchased at the box office at full price, while another 15,000 were given away for free, and 15,000 others were given away as part of sponsorship deals with the organization. Still, he said, the race was a success when you compare it with the two-day Formula E event held in New York City that attracted just 18,000 fans.
"I think it was a good achievement for an event that was marketed only six months before and was virtually unknown," Pillarella said. "Formula E has told us the ticket sales were tremendous compared to other cities."
MCE is filing for bankruptcy, with debts of $6.9 million. It owes $6.3 million to the Formula E parent body for licensing, marketing, broadcasting and transportation fees, and another $600,000 to Evenko for fees associated with managing the race. However, since the company has no assets, it can't pay those debts. It will be up to the trustee, PwC Canada( https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html ), to decide how or if those parties will be repaid, Pillarella said.
It will also be up to the trustee to settle any potential cancellation fees. Formula E, the race's parent body, issued a demand letter to the city and MCE( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/formula-e-organizers-to-take-legal-action-against-montreal ) in December for amounts unpaid, and for breach of contract for cancelling the second and third years of a three-year contract. The final amount owed to Formula E will probably be settled through negotiations between lawyers.
On Monday, Plante said the city doesn't intend to pour more money into the event.
Montreal's Opposition party, Ensemble Montréal, said it had no comments to make about the event on Monday. Spokesperson Olivier Lachance said the party is sticking with its position from December, saying the decision to cancel the race seems justified, but the party would like to know the event's final cost.

Agglo and flood waters took toll on Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue budget

Abstract: Do the calculations using the average price of a home - $379,489 - and the tax rate hike translates into the homeowner paying $79.62 more in 2018. The town has also applied for a federal grant which would pay 50 per cent of costs connected to coming up with long-term plans to deal with the impact of climate change. The three-year capital investment plan sees $5.2 million in projects for 2018, including $326,250 to be invested in various park upgrades, $750,000 of work planned for the replacement of underground electrical cables along Blvd. des Anciens-Combattants and $840,000 of underground water-pipe work on Legault St. Hawa said two priorities for 2018 are preparing a Special Planning Program for the transferred hospital land and the moving forward of the project to extend Morgan Blvd.

Full text: Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue presented its 2018 budget for consideration last week. The meeting to officially adopt the $17.9 million operating budget took place after the West Island Gazette deadline, Tuesday.
The numbers presented for consideration were as follows:
The $17.9 million operating budget is down 0.52 per cent, or $93,844, from 2017.
For a residential property, the mill rate increased 2.1 per cent to 0.9148 per $100 in valuation in 2018 from 0.8960 per $100 in valuation in 2017. Do the calculations using the average price of a home - $379,489 - and the tax rate hike translates into the homeowner paying $79.62 more in 2018.
Like all other West Island municipalities that pay the Montreal Agglomeration Council for shared services, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue was left scrambling at the last minute after Montreal announced an average 5.3 per cent hike in agglo fees earlier this month. Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue was the only suburb to experience a drop in agglo payments, but the drop was not as deep as the town had expected, so last-minute adjustments had to be made.
"If the agglo had done what it had said it would do, the (tax-rate hike) would have been lower, around 1.7 per cent," Mayor Paola Hawa said.
Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa.
It was during a study of the fiscal impact the transfer of the Ste. Anne Hospital from federal to provincial jurisdiction would have on Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue that a glitch in the agglo formula which calculated the theoretical land wealth of a municipality was uncovered. That glitch meant the majority of the suburbs had overpaid the agglo for years. A more equitable equation was put in place and it was decided that the suburbs would be credited over three years. The credit for Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue ended up being $284,287 less than had been previously calculated.
"It's a case of give with one hand and take away with the other," Hawa said. "We negotiated with the province and the city for two years to come up with the new formula. And then, lo and behold, they take away our lunch money. I am very upset about it. Our compensation (for the transfer of the hospital) runs out in 2019. (The credits) were supposed to hold us over until we could build on (hospital-adjacent) land and begin to generate revenue."
(The transfer of a piece of developable land near the hospital was part of the hospital-transfer deal.)
Spring flooding last year also put a strain on the town's coffers, to the tune of $180,000. There is now a $10,000 flood reserve in place and the mayor said they would be holding information sessions in March to help citizens prepare for the possibility of flooding. The town has also applied for a federal grant which would pay 50 per cent of costs connected to coming up with long-term plans to deal with the impact of climate change.
"We'll talk about everything from how to properly stack sandbags to what kind and how many pumps a homeowner should have," Hawa said. "And we will ask everybody to register for our Code Red program. One of the problems we had last spring was getting in touch with everybody."
The three-year capital investment plan sees $5.2 million in projects for 2018, including $326,250 to be invested in various park upgrades, $750,000 of work planned for the replacement of underground electrical cables along Blvd. des Anciens-Combattants and $840,000 of underground water-pipe work on Legault St.
Hawa said two priorities for 2018 are preparing a Special Planning Program for the transferred hospital land and the moving forward of the project to extend Morgan Blvd. The extension is necessary in order to be able to develop land north of Highway 40.

Flooding A city of Montreal report, obtained by the Montreal Gazette last week, indicates the city was ill-prepared for major flooding last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows ), in part because of outdated flood maps. Municipal Affairs Minister Martin Coiteux, who attended the Couillard-Plante meeting, told reporters the province is "working together with our municipal partners to improve our capacity to respond" to future flooding.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante is hoping for provincial cash for the Pink Line and pot-legalization expenses.
But after her first meeting with Premier Philippe Couillard at Montreal city hall Thursday, she came away with hope but no cheques.
The two held a press conference after their meeting. Here's what they had to say about:
Public transit
Couillard noted Quebec and Montreal are working together on transit, pointing to last week's joint announcement about the purchase of 300 buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) for the Société de transport de Montréal by 2020.
He said the long-discussed extension of the métro Blue Line to Anjou "is going to happen. We are really in the final stages of getting to an announcement."
And Couillard said he hopes work will start by the summer on the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM), which will connect downtown Montreal with the South Shore, Deux-Montagnes, the West Island and Trudeau airport.
But he was less specific when it came to helping fund Plante's pet project - a métro Pink Line, with 29 stations stretching between Montreal North and Lachine.
"I'm very happy that this idea came up during the (Montreal election) campaign," Couillard said, adding he understands the logic of adding a new line to relieve pressure on the Orange Line.
"Of course we will be there, but first work has to be done regionally," he added, noting the idea must first be presented to the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain, which oversees transit planning.
Plante said she understands the Blue Line and REM will come first.
"The needs are big," she said. "I'm going to continue to think big" on transit.

Montreal says pot legalization is expected to cost the city between $4.7 million and $9.3 million per year in new costs related to policing and public education.
Couillard said he's open to sharing money collected in pot taxes with municipalities, but no deal has been reached yet.
"Of course we want to have an agreement with Montreal on sharing money to better manage this transition," Couillard said.
Plante said she came away from the meeting "very confident and we think it's clear enough that we'll have the sums necessary" to deal with the legalization.
Amazon
Couillard and Plante said they were dismayed that online retailing giant Amazon did not put Montreal on the short list( http://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/montreal-doesnt-make-short-list-for-amazons-hq2 ) of cities it's considering for a new $5-billion, 50,000-employee second headquarters. Toronto made the short list.
"I'm disappointed, very disappointed," Couillard said, noting Montreal has many attributes, including its status as an artificial intelligence hub, and its universities, technology sector and quality of life.
"We thought we had a good shot to at least be on the short list."
Plante said the work Montreal International did on a proposal to woo Amazon will be used to attract other companies to Montreal.
"I'm disappointed, but I'm an optimistic type of person," Plante said. "We're in a very good position in attracting companies, and we have been doing so," Plante said. "I'm not so worried."
Flooding
A city of Montreal report, obtained by the Montreal Gazette last week, indicates the city was ill-prepared for major flooding last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows ), in part because of outdated flood maps.
Municipal Affairs Minister Martin Coiteux, who attended the Couillard-Plante meeting, told reporters the province is "working together with our municipal partners to improve our capacity to respond" to future flooding.
He said the "question of better maps of areas at risk of flooding" is a priority.
"We have to update them, and we're working toward being able to present an action plan by the end of February," Coiteux said.
Denis Coderre
The premier was asked about a rumour former mayor Denis Coderre may run for Couillard's Liberals in the October provincial election.
"I haven't spoken to Mr. Coderre recently. I last spoke to him after the election to thank him for his public service," Couillard said.
He dismissed as "hypothetical" a follow-up question about whether he wants Coderre on his team.

Abstract: Rivière des Prairies water levels are being carefully monitored and Pierrefonds-Roxboro Borough Mayor Jim Beis wants residents to know that lessons have been learned in the wake of the disastrous flooding last Spring and that the necessary resources are at hand if the riverbanks should breach. Even with these measures in place, reports of winter flooding in parts of Quebec, caused by ice jams and heavy snow and rain, are causing some anxiety in the borough. Beis and other mayors from municipalities affected by the spring flooding attended a government roundtable discussion in Quebec City to discuss flood-related infrastructure issues last month.

Full text: Rivière des Prairies water levels are being carefully monitored and Pierrefonds-Roxboro Borough Mayor Jim Beis wants residents to know that lessons have been learned in the wake of the disastrous flooding last Spring and that the necessary resources are at hand if the riverbanks should breach.
"I feel confident that at least some of the areas of concern have been addressed," Beis said Monday.
A city report to be released this week and written about by Montreal Gazette reporter Andy Riga in Saturday's paper, said that Montreal was not prepared for the flooding which caused wide-spread damage, destroyed homes and turned people's lives upside down.
Beis said that valuable lessons were learned at the borough level during the crisis.
"We learned that we didn't have the necessary resources - the manpower, the machinery - in place," he said. "We learned that this sort of crisis could occur more often moving forward. So we have been working since the fall to put temporary measures in place."
Beis said that temporary measures have been put in place in the areas flagged as most vulnerable to flooding, but what he doesn't know is if these temporary measures will shift the problem to other areas.
Beis listed Des-Rivières, Noël and Dauville streets and Château-Pierrefonds Ave. in Pierrefonds and 5th Ave. N. in Roxboro as some of the areas where workers have dug temporary dikes, stacked industrial-sized sand bags or installed an inflatable water-gate system.
Beis said some valves have also been installed to help control the flow of water in the borough's underground network of pipes.
Even with these measures in place, reports of winter flooding in parts of Quebec, caused by ice jams and heavy snow and rain, are causing some anxiety in the borough.
"Civil security is monitoring water levels and we are so much better equipped with the knowledge of how to apply our resources now," Beis said. "But everybody with property on the waterfront is nervous."
Beis and other mayors from municipalities affected by the spring flooding attended a government roundtable discussion in Quebec City to discuss flood-related infrastructure issues last month. The session was webcast.
He was challenged by former councillor Justine McIntyre at Monday's council meeting about his comments during that roundtable. McIntyre had watched the session online.
She suggested his comments during the session about allowing people to rebuild on floodplains because of a technology available which prevents water from infiltrating a home were misplaced. She said people are living in an ever-shifting scenario brought on by climate change and that she had a problem with his suggestion residents could rebuild on floodplains.
Beis said the roundtable was an opportunity to ask questions.
"I respect the government and its decisions, but the session was about voicing opinions and asking questions," he said. "Let's at least explore options, so that if people want to rebuild using the latest technology, it might be considered."
The mayor said a public post-mortem of the 2017 flooding in the borough is still in the works.
"Will it be an evening event or will we ask residents to write to us or post comments online? We want to advance the file in a constructive fashion," Beis said.

From Formula E to flood breaks: Plante mulls recycling pricey concrete barriers

Abstract: Plante mused about recycling the barriers during a presentation by the city's civil protection department( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/documents/Adi_Public/CE/CE_DA_ORDI_2018-01-17_08h30_Inondations_2017.pdf ) to the executive committee detailing the city's response to last year's spring flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) and its costs. The committee was told the emergency response teams and resources deployed during the month-long flooding cost more than $8 million, and while the response was, on the whole, successful, more could be done to improve communications between emergency personnel and the borough authorities.

Full text: What do you do with $7.5 million worth of publicly funded concrete barriers bought for a road race that will no longer take place( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-elect-plante-martin-coiteux-explore-ways-to-keep-montreal-moving ) in Montreal?
As far as Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante is concerned, you could repurpose them in time for the next round of flooding.
"While we're talking about various forms of (flood barriers), about sandbags and more sophisticated forms of technology, I think the borough of Ville-Marie has some creative suggestions on this subject," Plante told Wednesday's meeting of the city's executive committee. "I think I'll share it with you because I think it's quite creative - mobile dikes in the form of concrete barriers, because we have a lot of them in stock."
While Plante's suggestion drew some laughter, including from herself, she repeated the suggestion on her Twitter account even as the meeting continued, writing that "The concrete barriers purchased for the #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FormuleE ) could serve as temporary dikes during the next round of flooding. Thanks to the creativity of our team in Ville-Marie (borough)."
The purchase of the barriers raised eyebrows - and the ire of Plante, then head of the official opposition - when their $7.5-million price tag became known just days before last July's Formula E race. Critics pointed out the barriers could have been rented for considerably less, although the administration of Denis Coderre argued they could be reused for other events.
One of Plante's first major acts as mayor of Montreal was to announce last month that the Formula E race had been cancelled after it became clear the event had been less than a success despite the city's $24-million investment.
Plante mused about recycling the barriers during a presentation by the city's civil protection department( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/documents/Adi_Public/CE/CE_DA_ORDI_2018-01-17_08h30_Inondations_2017.pdf ) to the executive committee detailing the city's response to last year's spring flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) and its costs.
The committee was told the emergency response teams and resources deployed during the month-long flooding cost more than $8 million, and while the response was, on the whole, successful, more could be done to improve communications between emergency personnel and the borough authorities.
The report also recommended that more be done to identify areas vulnerable to flooding and measures taken to mitigate damage once the flooding occurred.

Abstract: On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?

Full text: Thirty-eight minutes of panic( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/01/13/being-a-mother-in-hawaii-during-38-minutes-of-nuclear-threat-terror/?utm_term=.c342edf3cbd9 ) gripped the tropical paradise of Hawaii Saturday morning when emergency management authorities accidentally triggered an erroneous alert that ballistic missiles were racing toward the archipelago.
Terror has since turned to outrage over the false alarm among residents who legitimately feared their lives were ending. It has cast serious doubt on the credibility of the state's emergency systems. Authorities certainly owe Hawaiians some explanations - and perhaps an apology.
But one thing this fiasco should do, no matter where we live, is cause us to ask: Am I ready if disaster strikes?
The nuclear threat level hasn't been this high since the Cold War era, thanks to the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un. However the fallout from a nuke attack is only one kind of emergency we ought to be prepared for. From earthquakes to ice storms, floods to blizzards, major blackouts to toxic spills, too few of us have the necessary supplies, let alone the knowledge, to react in the case of even a minor crisis.
I include myself in this category. I arrived home with my children on Friday evening to a run-of-the-mill power outage. This incident was more inconvenient than urgent, but we were still bumbling around in the dark using my iPhone to locate candles, matches and a real flashlight.
On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?
How many of us have emergency provisions in our car should a vicious storm leave us stranded, like the one last March that trapped hundreds of motorists on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-happened-on-highway-13-during-the-montreal-snowstorm ) for hours overnight?
How quickly our memories fade. How swiftly cautionary tales are forgotten. We are predisposed to think the next major hurricane, tsunami, mudslide or wildfire will happen to others, never to ourselves.
But potential apocalypse lurks high and low. Garnering many fewer headlines than the Hawaii mayhem - but deserving no less of our attention here in Montreal - is a report issued last week by the Swiss Re Institute on the earthquake threat in Quebec.
The report, Earthquake Risk in Eastern Canada: Mind the Shakes,( http://institute.swissre.com/research/overview/expertise_publication/earthquake_risk_in_eastern_canada_mind_the_shakes.html ) found that though the fault line in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec City corridor is one of the most seismically sensitive in the country, we are woefully unaware - and unprepared. Only a tiny fraction - just 3.4 per cent - are properly insured for a tremor despite the fact 70 per cent of Quebec's population resides in this zone.
"According to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe model, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in the Charlevoix seismic zone near Quebec City could cause private residential property losses of up to $10.6 billion," noted the institute, which does research for the insurance industry. "And a repeat today of the magnitude 5.8 earthquake in the city of Montreal in 1732 would lead to even higher losses, estimated at $45 billion."
These findings echo an earlier, equally alarming, study by the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/ns/resources/studies/air-study ) in 2013 that estimated the total losses from a 7.1 magnitude quake in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec area at a staggering $61 billion. The IBC report pegged the probability of a major convulsion along the eastern Canadian fault line at 5 to 15 per cent in the next 50 years.( http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/EQ_brochure_EN-at-a-glance.pdf )
If so few of us are insured, it stands to reason nowhere near enough of us have taken precautions to increase our chances of surviving the big one.
Do you know the safest place to take cover if the ground starts shaking? How many days' worth of water and food do you have stockpiled? Do you have a manual can-opener or flashlight close at hand? Do you have a prearranged rendezvous point to meet up with your loved ones if you are apart when the earth rattles?
The Quebec public security department( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters.html ) provides tips on what to do in the event of all sorts of situations, including earthquakes.( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters/earthquake.html ) While it's not the role of authorities to stoke unnecessary alarm about impending disaster, surely civil security could do more to urge Quebecers to take stock of their advice ahead of time.
The terrifying 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), which examined the devastating scenarios for the Pacific Northwest if the precarious Cascadia Subduction Zone gives way, helped raise awareness among ordinary citizens about their own readiness levels( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes ).
Perhaps a scare like the one inflicted on Hawaiians, heart-stopping and inexcusable though it was, will have a silver lining. Though the state has been testing air raid sirens recently, many people realized in the throes of the chaos they had no clue what steps to take( https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/selfdecon_wash.asp ) in the event of a missile strike.
Let this be a wake-up call to all of us: expect the unexpected and prepare for the worst - now, before it's too late.

Full text: An agency tasked with monitoring the effectiveness of rules that regulate the outflows from Lake Superior and Lake Ontario wants to hear from shoreline property owners on how much of an impact last spring's flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) had on their homes and businesses.
The online survey, conducted for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management (GLAM) Committee, asks a variety of questions on the extent of flooding, erosion, damage to shoreline structures, and related damage to residential and business shoreline properties. Respondents will also have an opportunity to upload pictures to document the extent of flooding/erosion impacts on shoreline properties.
Officials note that while Lake Ontario residents have been quick to respond to the survey, the response rate along the St. Lawrence River so far has been low. As a result, the deadline in Quebec for completing the survey was extended to Jan. 31.
The survey should take 10-25 minutes to complete, depending on extent of damage being reported on, and can be found at the "Take the Survey" link at www.ijc.org/en_/GLAM.( http://www.ijc.org/en_/GLAM )

Abstract: The notice informed students of a meeting held Friday afternoon by members of the administration - including Kate Sterns, coordinator of the Creative Writing program, Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy and Dean of Students Andrew Woodall - to inform students in the Creative Writing program "of remedial actions the university has decided to take, as well as to respond to questions." The notice also warned students that faculty members have a potential conflict of interest and recommended students not treat the meeting as a forum to share experiences, but rather as an opportunity to demand change.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Just stay home: Montreal faces another weather warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my )
It seems winter is testing us. And maybe even testing our emergency preparedness, with warnings from the SQ, Urgences Santé and others advising us to just stay home. After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days. Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.

Concordia University has reassigned courses that were to be taught this term by professors who have been the subjects of recent high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct while those allegations are being investigated, according to a notice sent to students in the English department by their student association. "We are deeply upset and appalled that this university has allowed sexual misconduct to harm students for so long in what should have been a safe and professional environment," says the notice, signed by the executive of the Concordia Association for Students in English (CASE). The notice informed students of a meeting held Friday afternoon by members of the administration - including Kate Sterns, coordinator of the Creative Writing program, Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy and Dean of Students Andrew Woodall - to inform students in the Creative Writing program "of remedial actions the university has decided to take, as well as to respond to questions." The notice also warned students that faculty members have a potential conflict of interest and recommended students not treat the meeting as a forum to share experiences, but rather as an opportunity to demand change.

Montreal was ill-prepared for spring flooding, city report shows( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows )
Outdated flood maps. Emergency vehicles sidelined because they had low floors. No inventory of city equipment and materials. Not enough inspectors to check flooded homes. A 911 system inundated with calls because the city help line went down for four hours. A city report shows Montreal was ill-prepared for disaster in the spring of 2017, when the island suffered its worst flooding in 40 years. The document, obtained by the Montreal Gazette, is to be made public next week. The 55-page report, by the Montreal fire department's civil-security unit, reviewed the city's response and includes recommendations on how to improve emergency readiness. The flooding began in early May when the previous winter's heavier-than-usual snowfall started melting due to warm weather and heavy rain, raising water levels around Montreal and other parts of Quebec. Then-Mayor Denis Coderre declared a state of emergency on May 7, the same day 300 members of the Canadian Armed Forces arrived to help with flood relief. Over several days, more than 430 homes were evacuated in boroughs and suburbs on Montreal Island's north shore, along the Rivière des Prairies.
Quebec gangster can leave halfway house, return home to Trois-Rivières( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-gangster-can-leave-halfway-house-return-home-to-trois-rivieres )
One of Quebec's most notorious gangsters has succeeded in his efforts( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/timeline-raymond-desfosses-long-road-to-conditional-release-he-violated ) to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months. "I am chained like a dog to a halfway house. So if someone wanted to kill me it is very easy for them to find me," Raymond Desfossés, 67, said during a hearing Friday morning at a federal penitentiary in Laval. Desfossés was addressing a question put to him by Michel Lafrenière, the parole board member who presided over his hearing, as to how he would handle the possibility of someone seeking revenge for the crimes that led to his 18-year prison term. Lafrenière said it is the kind of stressful situation that could prompt a career criminal, like Desfossés, to use violence to protect himself. Such a situation could put public safety in jeopardy, Lafrenière said. He has good reason to be concerned because part of his sentence involves how he hired Gerald Gallant, 67, a hit man, to kill six of his rivals( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-hit-man-tied-to-west- end -gang-prepares-for-parole ) between 1980 and 2001. While he was initially charged with six counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder, he was able to plead guilty to taking part in a general conspiracy to commit murder. On Feb. 20, 2014, his sentence for the conspiracy was combined to one he was already serving and turned into an 18-year prison term.
Raymond Desfossés was successful on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018, in his bid to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months.

Full text: Outdated flood maps. Emergency vehicles sidelined because they had low floors. No inventory of city equipment and materials. Not enough inspectors to check flooded homes. A 911 system inundated with calls because the city help line went down for four hours.
A city report shows Montreal was ill-prepared for disaster in the spring of 2017, when the island suffered its worst flooding in 40 years. The document, obtained by the Montreal Gazette, is to be made public next week.
The 55-page report, by the Montreal fire department's civil-security unit, reviewed the city's response and includes recommendations on how to improve emergency readiness.
The flooding began in early May when the previous winter's heavier-than-usual snowfall started melting due to warm weather and heavy rain, raising water levels around Montreal and other parts of Quebec.
Then-mayor Denis Coderre declared a state of emergency on May 7, the same day 300 members of the Canadian Armed Forces arrived to help with flood relief. Over several days, more than 430 homes were evacuated in boroughs and suburbs on Montreal Island's north shore, along the Rivière des Prairies.
The report says:
Montreal Island municipalities spent about $8 million dealing with the emergency.
The Montreal region has no flood map for the Rivière-des-Prairies. Instead, it relies on one created by a provincial department based on "outdated" technical documents created in 1978. The report recommends updating flood maps with newer information, including data gathered during recent flooding. It also suggests the city should "consider the degree of uncertainty associated with climate change, which influences the probability of flooding."
Some areas where flooding is expected every zero to 20 years were not flooded during the spring of 2017, while some areas prone to flooding only every 20 to 100 years were flooded.
Some of the inundated 20-to-100-year flood zones was home to sensitive infrastructure, including health institutions that had to be evacuated, as well as a fire station, a police station and a public works yard, all of which had to be closed.
Some emergency vehicles proved useless during the crisis. "Police and ambulance vehicles quickly became unusable in some sectors since they were too low for the water levels. Consequently, they could not ensure adequate service coverage for certain sectors. The need for high boots and waterproof pants for field workers was also quickly recognized."'
Many items had to be purchased during the flooding by various city departments but
"some difficulties were encountered when specific equipment was required for outside vendor hours. Following the floods, it is now possible to create a list of potential suppliers for each type of equipment that can be used during a future disaster. In addition, it will also be helpful to produce a register of equipment and materials available to the city so that it can be quickly mobilized when needed."
Many Montrealers had trouble reaching the city's 311 help line during the flooding, resulting in a deluge of calls to 911. At the peak of the flooding, on May 7, the 311 line went dead for four hours. The report recommends boosting 311 so it's ready in case of another emergency.
As homeowners and business owners prepared to return to their buildings after the flooding, "the number of city inspectors available was insufficient for the number of inspections to be carried out."
Mayor Valérie Plante's office said the city will work to improve the city's readiness, particularly when it comes to communicating with the public.
The snafu that shut down 311 "shows we must not only learn from this situation but we must also put in place measures to better face a future event of this magnitude," a source in Plante's office said.
"Severe climate phenomena will happen more frequently in the future and that will create extra pressure on our human and financial resources."

Montreal General doctor sued for harassment; Allegations include explicit texts and lewd comments made at work

Author: Fidelman, Charlie

Full text: He sent explicit sex messages, made lewd comments at work and tried to caress her in the operating room. He offered her thousands of dollars to sleep with him. Sometimes, he followed her after work.
These allegations of harassment are outlined in a legal suit filed in Quebec Superior Court Wednesday. A McGill University Health Centre respiratory therapist alleges anesthesiologist Richard Robinson harassed her from 2014 to 2016. The suit alleges that the abuse started when she was 21, a recent graduate who had just landed her first job in 2013 at the Montreal General Hospital, and Robinson, almost three times her age, was her boss.
Despite complaining to her direct superiors, the hospital union and human relations, and finally, to the MUHC director of professional services, the sexting abuse continued, the suit alleges.
The woman, who cannot be identified because of a court-ordered publication ban on her name, claims he sent her more than 200 explicit texts.
"I literally sought help everywhere," the woman, now 26, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview this week. "I'm feeling heartbroken."
The hospital refused to comment publicly. The MUHC does not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace, has comprehensive harassment policies and treats all such complaints diligently, officials said in a statement. The hospital denied it failed to protect its employee until 2016, when she took legal action.
However, the suit alleges that Dr. Robinson ignored at least two warnings in 2014 from hospital officials, including Ewa Sidorowicz, director of professional services (DPS), to end his inappropriate behaviour, and that the victim's colleagues and superiors were aware of the ongoing harassment.
Initial feelings of relief that the situation was being handled quickly faded, the woman said. The court documents allege Robinson cornered her at the hospital, saying that he was untouchable because of his "thick skin."
The woman alleges he sent her a Christmas card in 2014 with an image of a Paul Klee painting of two naked children by a fireplace: "You and me in a past life ... we had 10 children (six girls) and lots of sex."
Despite demands she not be assigned shifts with Robinson, she on occasion had to work evenings and weekends when he was the only anesthesiologist in the operating room. "It was terrifying sitting behind sterile drapes with the monitors," she told the Montreal Gazette. "I felt so helpless."
He offered her money to sleep with him, the suit alleges. Afraid of finding herself alone with him, the woman arranged for colleagues to accompany her in hospital hallways, to the elevator and to her car. She claims in her suit colleagues told her that Robinson frequently asked them personal questions about her, particularly about her love life.
She worked for a few weeks at another MUHC hospital, but the suit alleges he continued to text her. The claim goes on to allege he wrote of his desire for her, remarking on her beauty, admitting his shame at her distress, and describing his sexual fantasies. At times, he apologized for being so stupidly besotted with her, the suit alleges, texting "I just wanted to kiss you, hold you, make love to you."
According to claims in the lawsuit, which have not been proven in court, the texting continued unabated, sometimes dozens a day: "I want to wrap my legs around you."
"If we were lovers you would be so comfortable with me."
"Felt creepy after I stroked your arm and said you were nice (that's) not really me I just I never get to talk to you - probably - hence all my texting."
According to the suit, he sent her an image of his naked legs, with the message, "This picture would be much better if your legs were in it kicking mine! Night Night E."
A giant bouquet of flowers delivered Dec 2015 at the operating room for her, unsigned but everyone knew it was from Robinson, she alleges. In the lawsuit, she claims he followed with a text: "I mean - I'm trying to persue you. Persue means - persistently trying to form a sexual relationship Oxford duct, Sophie was persued by a number of good looking men. (sic)" Horrified, she told him to stop.
She informed hospital officials, again, including the head of anesthesiology. The suit alleges she was then called to a meeting, in January 2016, with Sidorowicz, head of professional services. The therapist showed Sidorowicz explicit text messages from Robinson.
Sidorowicz put the woman's phone aside and only asked about 'his professional competencies,'" the lawsuit alleges. "I felt like a rat in a cage."
The abuse continued, she alleges.
The union suggested she take a medical leave of absence. They told her they could file a grievance, but the professional order of Quebec physicians, the College des medecins, rarely investigates.
In fact, Robinson is under investigation for misconduct by the College des medecins, and is expected to be called before the College disciplinary committee in early 2018.
The woman said she suffered nightmares, depression and suicidal thoughts. "I felt helpless. I went from being a bubbly and happy person to someone depressed. It affected my family and my work."
Malpractice lawyer Jean-Pierre Menard filed a complaint Jan. 2016 with the MUHC medical examiner who then demanded the hospital disciplinary committee look into the matter. In its questioning, the committee asked "if I wore sexy clothes, big earrings, perfume. Was I flirty?" the woman recalled. "I couldn't believe it. We all wear scrubs!" The burden of proof is terrible on the victim, Menard said. "As if what she wore could justify anything," he added. "There should be zero tolerance for sexual abuse."
Menard is suing Robinson for $260,000 in damages for his client. "It's been 20 months since the MUHC disciplinary committee got involved, and it's come to nothing," said Menard, who expects this case to start a flood in the health milieu similar to the #metoo hashtag of women coming forward that rocked the entertainment field.
"We took this case as a matter of principle," Menard said.
Robinson is currently working at the Montreal General's intensive care unit.
Menard's client is currently on maternity leave.
Had she known all that she would have to go through by coming forward, she would have quit working there, she says. But she also helps train young respiratory therapists, and wants to help them avoid any possible future issues because they resemble the eager student she once was, she said. "They look like me." cfidelman@postmedia.com

Full text: In 1974, when moving from St-Laurent to the West Island, our real estate agent advised us to consider the flood plains of Montreal when choosing to live here.
Later or around that same time, the Montreal Gazette published an image of those well-known areas.
Though I sympathize with people who are awaiting government help, they also must realize they compromised their situation by moving to and living in those fragile places.
Perhaps when help comes, they will reconsider remaining where they are and move elsewhere.
The view might not be the same, but at least they will not see the water so close up.

Arcade Fire headline raised my eyebrows; Use of 'fake news' as a verb is an example of 'conversion'

Full text: In July, the British newspaper The Guardian lavished four reviews and articles on the Montreal band Arcade Fire, who played a live concert in Manchester just before the release of their new album, Everything Now. The headline of one of those articles stopped me in my tracks: "Did Arcade Fire just fake news themselves with a spoof gig dress code?" My eyebrows rose only a little at the last four words, all one-syllable nouns; headline writers often rely on shortcuts to deliver meaning in a limited space. But since when was "fake news" a verb? In 2014, the expression "fake news" did not appear once in the Montreal Gazette. So far this year, it has featured in at least 74 articles. (Thank you, Mr. Trump.) Sometimes the phrase is followed by nouns like "media" and "stories." On other occasions it stands alone, but never before have I seen "fake news" deployed as a verb. You are hereby warned.
A single headline is not enough to count as a trend, yet recently I've come across a variety of other examples of what linguists call conversion.
The process has nothing to do with religious belief; it entails a word being changed into a different part of speech. Often the conversion involves "verbing," where nouns or adjectives turn into verbs. A few weeks ago, a Watchwords reader, Leena Sandblom, wrote to ask: "Just heard a brand new one on CTV noon news: 'are efforting to.'Have you seen any instances of 'effort'used as a verb?" No, I hadn't. But some assiduous Googling alerted me to a few examples. In a San Francisco newspaper: "Even ol'Silent Cal'Coolidge would have efforted a thin, fake smile, but Trump just glared at the dais."
On a website about junior hockey players: "'Stas'grew up in a single-parent home in Russia with a mother who efforted to advance her son's fledging hockey career." People have occasionally used "effort" as a verb before - one case was even recorded in the 17th century - but there's no need to do this ("try" and "attempt" mean the same thing). Even so, I wouldn't rule out success. English is full of old conversions that are now part and parcel of the language. Among the verbs in this column, "lavish," "feature" and "alert" are examples.
Conversion has also affected "banner." In May, news sources reported that "Milrem, the Estonian technology company, is bannering its Titan multi-purpose unmanned ground vehicle for military use." Apart from its familiar role as a noun, "banner" has long been a recognized verb in journalism, meaning to display a news item under a big headline. Now, it appears, "to banner" may have become a synonym for "to promote."
Sometimes old forms of words reappear unexpectedly after lying dormant for decades. That's the case with a verb used by Sgt. David Hornung of the Gila County sheriff's office, who was quoted on BBC News in July after a flash flood swept through an Arizona canyon, killing 10 people. Hornung said: "A large family group was down by the river recreating." At first this struck me as absurd, but in truth "recreate" has a long history as a verb, meaning to refresh, indulge or amuse. "There are many illustrious youths," wrote a London journalist in 1712, "who frequently recreate themselves by driving of a hackney-coach." For hackney-coach, three centuries later, read SUV.
A verb rising to prominence in our troubled age is "dox" - to obtain private information on the internet, especially about a person whose political beliefs you disagree with, and then to embarrass or shame that person by publishing the details.
"Doxing" was born between 2000 and 2005, after an initial shortening of the noun "documents" to "docs."
It, too, is a product of verbing.

Full text: Quebec will be holding public consultations Monday in areas touched by spring flooding.
The spring floods affected 5,300 homes in 278 municipalities. Between 500 to 800 of those were either destroyed or deemed uninhabitable. More than 4,000 Quebecers were evacuated. In the Montreal area, severely affected regions include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Ile-Bizard-Ste-Genevieve, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue and Senneville.
Seven weeks after the floods, the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal led by its musical director Kent Nagano, held a free concert at Pierrefonds city hall in support of flood victims. The June 29 concert hit just the right note to ease morale, residents of Pierrefonds-Roxboro told the Montreal Gazette, but many residents said they feel frustrated by the city and the provincial government's slow move to help them.
The goal of Monday's public meetings is to hear from individuals and organizations on the government's proposal to create a special intervention area in zones prone to flooding. The proposal also aims to establish urban planning rules to apply in specific zones.
Most meetings are scheduled for 7 p.m. For floods affecting Montreal, the hearings will be held at Holiday Inn Pointe-Claire, 6700 Trans-Canada Hwy. For the Laval area, it will be at the Chateau Royal Convention Halls, 3500 Souvenir Blvd. In the Monteregie, it will be College Bourget, 65 St-Pierre St., Rigaud.
For the complete schedule, go to the Quebec government website, mamot.gouv.qc.ca.

Abstract: The level of flooding that has hit Montreal and other parts of Quebec, brought on by the annual snow melt and unusually high amounts of rainfall, has been described as a once-in-a-century event. The dazed look of this woman inside her garage, while flood waters flow down her street, captures the "sense of resignation," says Pierre Obendrauf.

2,426 homes flooded, 1,530 people have left their homes in 146 Quebec municipalities

Full text: The Canadian Red Cross has started a fundraising campaign to provide financial support to Quebec flood victims when they eventually return home.
"The money could be used to buy food, furniture, make small repairs to the house, children's needs and personal services," said Pascal Mathieu, vice-president of the Red Cross in Quebec.
Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux asked Quebecers to contribute to the campaign.  
"I encourage every Quebecer to be generous and make a donation," he said at a press conference in Montreal.
Coiteux announced that the Quebec government is contributing $500,000 to the fund and will cover all the administrative fees.
"Every dollar you put in this fund will go to the victims of the flood," he promised.
The Red Cross says it has helped more than 1,400 residents who have had to flee their homes during record flooding in the province.
The Red Cross is putting residents up in hotels and offering food vouchers for families in need.
Red Cross volunteers are working in 12 welcome centres across Quebec that have been set up to help victims of flooding.
Donations can be made on the Red Cross's website at www.croixrouge.ca or by calling 1 800 418-1111.
Flood waters expected to peak by Wednesday
 
Earlier, Coiteux said Quebec's flood waters are expected to reach their peak between Monday and Wednesday and then will gradually begin to drop.
But Coiteux couldn't say when residents who have been forced from their homes will be able to return.
"We have to be prudent, the water is flowing quickly," he told a press conference in Montreal. He said the problems will last for a number of weeks.
Transport minister Laurent Lessard said the nine dams and reservoirs along the Ottawa River basin are structurally sound, but are being used to their maximum to try and slow the flow of water.
"We are talking about historic levels of water because of the important snow up north and the rains that have come down continuously in April and this past week in May," Lessard said.
"With the dams, we have been able to slow down the flow (of water) by over 2 ,500 cubic metres per second."
The water level on Lake of Two Mountains has increased by one metre because of the amount of water in the rivers this spring, said David Heurtel, Quebec's Environment Minister.
Couteux defended the government's handling of the flooding situation. "At one point, the forecast changed and we immediately asked for the support of the armed forces," he said. "The deployment was swift and efficient."
About 90 per cut of the troops are on the front line working with the firefighters, the police and volunteers to help the people, said Hercule Gosselin, a commander with the armed forces.
The head of Quebec's civil protection services said psychologists will be made available to speak with distressed homeowners who are victims of flooding.
Heurtel said the province is dealing with a historic water flow, and that dams on the Ottawa rivers have been able to reduce the amount of water in the river.
A spokesperson for the provincial police cautioned motorists to stay away from washed out roads.
A 37-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter are missing in the Gaspé after the man drove on a road that had been closed.
By the end of the day, there will be about 1,600 members of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground helping out, said Hercule Gasselin, a commander with the armed forces.
Coiteux said he has been impressed by the number of volunteers who have come out to help their neighbours. "I was in Île Bizard and there were people from Ontario helping," he said.
Flood victims who don't have family or friends to stay with are being taken care of by the Red Cross and municipal authorities, Coiteux said. 
"In every municipality, they have housing facilities and we are working with the Red Cross everywhere," he said.
"When people go to their local centre they get information from the Red Cross. Nobody is left out. Everybody has a place to go and has food and Transport Minister Laurent Lessard couldn't say when the Galipeault Bridge, which connects Montreal Island with Ile Perrot, will reopen.
"We will do daily evaluations," he said.
To help drivers who can't use the Galipeault Bridge, Transport Quebec has announced that the Highway 30 toll bridge will be free today.
Hope on the horizon
 
As flood-weary West Island residents woke up to unseasonably cold temperatures and frost warnings Monday, the firm that has been monitoring Quebec's historic flooding over the past month threw a new element into their daily inventory of water levels: hope.
Hydro Méteo reported that while the Outaouais, Laurentians and Montreal area would see slight increases in water levels Monday, "the beginning of stabilization is expected today."
That possible respite coincides with the arrival of what Environment Canada described as "an unseasonably cool airmass" that moved over southern and western Quebec overnight Sunday, revising a five-day forecast that had called for a week of rain to one where the possibility of precipitation doesn't exceed 30 per cent until Saturday.
Downriver, however, riverfront municipalities between Montreal and Quebec City can expect to see flooding for the next few days as the St. Lawrence continues to rise.
Monday's forecast comes after Laval and Montreal declared states of emergency and Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed on the West Island to aid residents and civil protection workers shore up dams and sandbags from Rigaud to Pierrefonds-Roxboro.
In total, flood waters have damaged more than 2,400 homes in 146 municipalities across Quebec and forced 1,500 people to leave their homes.
High water levels also forced Transport Quebec on Sunday night to close the Galipeault Bridge linking the western tip of Montreal with Île-Perrot. The shutdown forced eastbound motorists heading for Montreal to detour onto Highway 30 and cross the Île-aux-Tourtes bridge onto Highway 40. As of 7 a.m. there were reports the detour was already adding an hour to commuters' travelling time.

Montrealers surveying damage after flooding

Full text: MONTREAL -- When Mario Ballerini's wife went to bed at midnight on Tuesday, the street was dry in front of his house in Montreal's Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, despite the torrential rains that fell Monday.
By 3 a.m. his neighbour was banging on the door of the De Gaulle St. home to say the water from the Riviere-des-Prairies was rising around their homes at the rate of a foot an hour, and he had to get his cars out of his garage to save them. By the morning, there was more than three feet of water in his finished basement.
Ballerini joined his neighbours Thursday in surveying the damage done to their homes and taking stock of their lives after the worst flooding in 43 years hit their neighbourhood, about a kilometre west of where St-Charles and Gouin Blvds. meet. Some used rowboats to get to their homes, or get their kids to school.
Ballerini, who opened his basement door Thursday to find his fridge floating in four feet of rank brown water and his couches submerged, says he is one of the luckier ones -- he's fairly certain he's insured. His insurance company is so busy they're only sending someone out on Monday.
Ballerini's riverfront house is about 120 feet from the water. At the end of his lawn is an eight-foot high stone wall, and a small beach on the other side, beyond which the water lies. This year, the river rose over the eight-foot wall, ran all the way up his sloped backyard and into his basement.
Some of his neighbours say they are not insured, because they're in a once-in-20-years flood zone, and have the spectre of paying out of pocket to repair mould-infested basements soaked in filthy water.
"This is not easy for us because we are retired," said Carole Grimard, who lives four houses up from the river in a home she's spent the last 20 years renovating, adding a second storey a while back so their daughter could live with them. The water came in from the river with such force in the middle of the night it caved in the bottom of their ground-level garage door, ruining the electric tools her husband stores there. But they were able to save their cars and motorcycle because a tow-truck driver from the local American Auto Centre took their vehicles out for them in the middle of the night - free of charge. ("Please mention them," Grimard says.)
Grimard's insurance company told her she was not covered. Blessedly, they have an unfinished basement, but the flood marks on the side of her trim blue-and-white home show the water Tuesday night came to within six inches of her ground floor. She's worried about Friday, but there's little she can do. The pumps can't work fast enough to empty her basement. Large-sized pumps brought in from the city were able to lower water levels in the street during the last days.
Local security officials and firefighters like Gilles Henri, who normally works out of a station in Town of Mount Royal but is now working on a rotating schedule in Pierrefonds-Roxboro with fellow firefighters from Anjou and Montreal North, were busy installing pumps in some residents' homes and checking the generators running them day and night to refill them with gas. Most are flooded, he said, with the exception of a new house built by the contractor who owns it. His foundation is waterproof and his basement dry, despite the fact his house is sitting in the middle of a small lake.
The water levels in the street had dropped a bit because of the drier conditions Wednesday and Thursday, but residents busy sandbagging their homes and pumping out their basements worried the forecast for heavy rains means their relative relief will be short-lived. Some residents haven't been able to use their toilets and showers for days, due to fears of water backing up.
Andrew Szyngiel, whose father built the house he has lived in since he was born in 1968, was busy rowing neighbours kids, household items and occasionally journalists to and from his home Wednesday and Thursday. His father bought the boat in 1978, after earlier severe flooding. Insured? Maybe, he said. Not sure.
Many of the neighbours place the blame for the flooding on the Carillon Hydro-Quebec power generating dam upriver on the Ottawa River, saying officials chose to open the chutes to spare people upstream, at their expense.
Ballerini's wife wants him to sell the place. After a fire and a break-in last year, she think's it cursed.
"There's ghosts in this house," she says. "For me, it's not so bad. There's worse things that can happen in life."
But, acknowledging he has insurance, he adds: "I'm one of the lucky ones."

Full text: Re: "Stranding on Highway 13 'unacceptable': Coderre" (Montreal Gazette, March 16) Too often I wake up to a headline from a far away place about an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster, with devastating consequences for the population there.
Within hours, we start to see news reports about the rescue efforts, the lives saved, the volunteers who arrived to lend a hand, the pledges of international aid - all this often in geographic areas where there is little or no infrastructure. Then came the headline about hundreds of motorists stranded overnight on Highway 13. I am beyond angry that this could have happened here. Did the mayor put in a call to the minister of transport, or were both their cellphones turned off? Do we not have an islandwide disaster plan? A spokesperson for the Surete du Quebec is quoted as saying "at the end of the day, it wasn't a tragic event because everyone was safe for the whole event." Safe? The transport ministry has been riddled with problems for years. I hope there will be more than finger-pointing coming out of the external investigation ordered by Premier Philippe Couillard.

Life in the slow lane: Construction at McGill, again

Full text: Publication: The McGill Tribune, McGill University, Montreal QC.
In Montreal, construction has long since become the rule, rather than the exception. As such, it is fitting that Montreal’s 375th birthday next year is being brought to us by more orange cones, roadblocks, and detours for the construction of the Promenade Urbaine Fleuve-Montagne project. Perhaps it really is time for Montreal to take a recent Montreal Gazette call to rebrand itself as “The City of Cones” seriously. Additionally, given Montreal’s history of behind-schedule construction projects (the Olympic stadium comes to mind), the birthday wish we should all make this year is that the project actually gets completed before the city’s birthday has come and gone.
By virtue of its location, McGill’s downtown campus is often subject to such construction projects. Which leads one to wonder—has the inevitability of a city under construction simply become a part of the student experience? Indeed, Montreal’s endless construction escapades have become a running joke amongst the McGill community. The email sent to explain that McTavish is once again being dug up, this time for the City’s Fleuve-Montagne birthday project (it has been barely a year since the last time it was torn apart), was met with eye rolls, groans, and pitiful laughter from students. But, surely, nobody would have been surprised. In many ways, the never-ending construction site that is McGill’s downtown campus is the best metaphor for the academic experience.
For one, continual roadblocks and detours ensure that students never set their standards too high—both on the way to and seated in class. Construction work is like an average B to B+ essay: It might not be perfectly polished, but it addresses most of what it needs to and shows some signs of effort and improvement. Sure, you may have missed a few points and made a couple mistakes, but the stone on the Arts Building crumbles from time to time and it’s still standing—it even manages to remain one McGill’s most iconic buildings!
During the 2015-2016 year, McTavish was finally clear of construction and freshly paved. It didn’t even flood, and getting to Quesada or Bento was no longer a huge hassle. Even the Arts Building was uncovered last year, and some began to believe that McGill had finally moved beyond the days of decline and disrepair. This was the A essay—the one you get back after working especially hard on and find, to your amazement, that the hard work actually paid off. You build up some confidence—finally, you think to yourself, you have figured out this whole university thing. Maybe you lined up a nice summer job, too, and feel pretty good. Then, just as things seem to be improving, another curveball gets thrown at you. Whether it’s just missing the 24-hour quota to get one of your three successive exams moved, or receiving notice that McTavish is going to be under construction yet again (along with parts of Sherbrooke, University, and Dr. Penfield), McGill and Montreal like to keep you on your toes.
So begins another school year of navigating papers, midterms, and the trenches of McTavish. Inevitably, the elusive pathways across campus will never be in the same place you swore they were yesterday. This, incidentally, explains why you always seem to be late to class. But no matter how frustrating life at McGill can be, one can only hope that it will build character for when we finally have to enter the ‘real world.’
So thank you, McGill, and thank you, Montreal, for never failing to surprise. If nothing else, these detours and roadblocks ensure that our expectations are kept low, allowing us to truly appreciate the small victories. After all, construction does imply that hard work will (eventually) pay off.

Full text: Publication: The McGill Tribune, McGill University, Montreal QC.
September, 2012 - PQ Elected
On Sept. 4, 2012, the Parti Québécois was elected into a minority government. The elections occurred after months of student protests against the former Liberal government’s proposed tuition increases.
As part of their platform, the PQ promised to cancel the tuition increases. The new premier, Pauline Marois, did so by decree during the provincial government’s first cabinet meeting on Sept. 29, 2012.
On Sept. 28, Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Morton Mendelson published a statement on the McGill Student Accounts website which confirmed that the university would return the increased tuition fees to students.
However, McGill had created its budget for the 2012-2013 school year with the tuition increases in mind. Provost Anthony Masi predicted that McGill would lose $90 million over the following five years due to the freeze.
November, 2012 - Arthur Porter
Arthur Porter, former McGill professor and director general and chief executive officer of the McGill University Health Center , was involved in a financial scandal that received national attention.
McGill decided to pursue legal action against Porter in November 2012 after he failed to pay back over half of a $500,000 loan from the university and $30,131.63 in salary overpayment following his resignation in December 2011.
Despite receiving a second salary as a professor in the department of oncology on top of his $350,000 salary as head of the MUHC, Porter is alleged not to have taught in that department.
In the midst of this scandal, Porter’s whereabouts were unknown. He finally surfaced in the Bahamas, as reported by The Montreal Gazette , where he claims he was treating himself for cancer at his own medical facility.
Quebec’s anti-corruption squad was also looking for Porter in order to question him about the MUHC’s procurement of a $1.3 billion contract for his superhospital project.
The CBC also discovered that Porter had come to Montreal from Detroit—where he served as the CEO of the Detroit Medical Center—to work for the MUHC following the wake of similar scandals at his previous institution.
December, 2012 - Budget Cuts
In mid-December 2012, the PQ announced that it would impose extensive budget cuts to the operating budgets of all Quebec universities. McGill was told that it would need to cut $19.1 million from its operating budget by April 2013.
In February, the PQ announced that the cuts would continue into the next fiscal year and that McGill would be expected to cut an additional $19.1 million by April 2014.
After contesting this move for several weeks, the McGill administration released official plans for the cuts in late March 2013. To date, the administration has implemented salary and hiring freezes, introduced a voluntary retirement package to administrative and support staff aged 60 and above, and reduced the operating budgets of senior administrators’ portfolios. A second phase of plans—which, according to the administration, will likely include layoffs—is expected but has not yet been released.
(Luke Orlando / McGill Tribune)
January, 2013 -   Flood
On the afternoon of Jan. 28, a 48-inch water main burst under Doctor Penfield Ave., flooding McGill’s downtown campus. That evening, several buildings were evacuated, and classes and activities were cancelled.
The water main broke just outside the McTavish Reservoir, which was undergoing a second phase of renovations. The City of Montreal started the project in October 2012, and predicts it should be completed in August 2013. The estimated cost of the renovations is $16.4 million. The City concluded that construction crews who were shifting the earth around by the pipe caused the break.
The water damage to certain buildings on campus was vast. The hardest hit was the James Annex, which required extensive repairs, according to Director of Internal Communications of McGill’s Media Relations Office Doug Sweet.
Classes in the Wong building were relocated in the following weeks, and classes in Wilson Hall and Birks Hall were cancelled. The James Administration Building and Service Point were also closed. Most buildings reopened that same week. The Students’ Society of McGill University’s [SSMU] Winter Activities Night was rescheduled, having been originally scheduled for the afternoon of Jan. 28.
February, 2013 - Protest protocol documents
On Feb. 4, McGill released two documents that detailed its procedure for dealing with protests and demonstrations. The Operating Procedures document stipulates the conditions under which the university will intervene in on-campus protests, including guidelines for when protests are considered peaceful, while the Statement of Values and Principles addresses students’ rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The Operating Procedures went into effect immediately, requiring approval from neither the Senate nor the Board of Governors (BoG).
The Statement of Values and Principles will eventually replace the provisional protocol released in Feb. 2012 in response to the five-day student occupation of the sixth floor of the James Administration Building. Senate passed the Statement of Values and Principles on Mar. 20. It will next go to the BoG on Apr. 26 for final approval.
February, 2013 - Tuition Indexation
On Feb. 25 and 26, the PQ held a two-day Summit on Higher Education, where it announced an annual 3 per cent tuition increase for students—whether they are Quebecois, out-of-province, or international students. The indexation of tuition intends to mirror the increase in the disposable income of Quebecers.
Throughout both days of the event, Montrealers expressed their dissatisfaction with the structure and results of the Summit through protests in the downtown area. 1,500 people demonstrated on Feb. 25, and 10,000 people took to the street on Feb. 26 in a protest organized by L’Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ). On both occasions, the Montreal Police attempted to disperse the demonstrators after declaring the protests illegal.
March, 2013 - New Principal
On Mar. 5, McGill’s Board of Governors (BoG) appointed Suzanne Fortier as McGill’s 17th principal. The Board’s Advisory Committee for Nomination of the Principal, consisting of representatives from the BoG, Senate, support staff, the faculty, and the student body, recommended Fortier’s appointment after a months-long search that began last spring.
Fortier, a two-time McGill graduate, will replace current Principal Heather Munroe-Blum and begin her five-year term in September. Fortier’s experience includes several positions in Queen’s University’s senior administration, as well as her most recent position as President of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
(Simon Poitrimolt / McGill Tribune)
March, 2013 - New SSMU exec elected
On Mar. 19, the 2013-2014 SSMU Executive was announced. Katie Larson was elected SSMU President, after defeating Chris Bangs for the position. Tyler Hofmeister was elected Vice-President Finance and Operations, Joey Shea will take on the position of VP University Affairs, and Brian Farnan will become VP Internal. Samuel Harris and Stefan Fong, the only two candidates who ran uncontested, were elected VP External and VP Clubs and Services, respectively. Nearly 30 per cent of the undergraduate student body voted in the elections—the same voter turnout as last year—even though fewer candidates ran this year.

Full text: In the spring of 1997, the Red River flood hit. It was truly
the flood of the century.
It was a terrible disaster, the worst to hit the people of Manitoba
since the early 1800s.
Three people were killed. Half a million acres were flooded. Nearly
30,000 Manitobans were evacuated from their homes and damage costs
reached close to $1 billion.
The flood was massive and officials were clearly overwhelmed. To
cope, Manitoba's government called in the armed forces, the RCMP and
the Department of National Defence.
Now, at the time, I was three provinces away, in B.C. I had made
the foolhardy decision to run as the Liberal Party candidate in
North Vancouver where I lived. The Grits hadn't won the riding in a
generation, and the Reform Party MP had money and incumbency on his
side. But I figured that with a solid national campaign and a lot of
luck I might eke out a win.
Calling an election during the midst of the Manitoba flood was a
mistake, I felt, but it wasn't my decision to make. So the campaign
kicked off.
One sunny day, I approached a door in a North Van apartment
building. Behind it, my clipboard told me, was an elderly couple,
longtime Liberal voters. I knocked. A kindly older woman answered
the door. Before I could make my pitch, this is what happened. "I
know who you are, dear. You don't have tell me," she said, smiling
sweetly. "And we think you and Mr. Chretien should be ashamed of
yourselves, calling an election while the poor people of Manitoba
deal with that flood. Do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, ma'am," I croaked.
"Good," she said, and closed the door. And that was precisely the
moment I knew I'd get my keester kicked, beaten decisively by a
Reform Party candidate the Canadian Press called an "elf."
Beaten by an elf. That unpleasant (but educational) door-stop
encounter came back to me recently in the sad aftermath of Elliot
Lake mall collapse.
Everyone in Canada knows about the catastrophe that has been
unfolding in Elliot Lake, midway between Sault Ste. Marie and
Sudbury, in Ontario's North. It has been a terrible, terrible
tragedy. People have died, and many have been hurt.
Unfortunately, some in the media and in the political opposition
have been looking for someone to blame in Elliot Lake. They've
suggested Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Prime Minister Stephen
Harper should have hustled up there right away. To do what? We know
not. But McGuinty and Harper have been lambasted by some for not
travelling to Elliot Lake.
Jean Chretien, as I recall, travelled to Manitoba during the 97
flood. "An infamous PR disaster," the Montreal Gazette later
intoned. A "photo opportunity stunt," declared the Vancouver Sun.
"Appalling insensitivity," said the Edmonton Journal.
However, in the end, Chretien still won a majority -- albeit a
reduced one. Some of his western candidates (like, um, me) certainly
paid a price. But the Liberal leader ended up with more seats in
Manitoba than any other party.
The paradox, I remarked to my campaign team at the time, is this:
If you don't go to the site of a disaster, you'll get hammered for
staying away and being insensitive. And if you travel to the site of
a disaster, you'll get hammered for coming for a photo op and
therefore being insensitive. You can't win, in other words.
The best people to deter-mine what politicians should or shouldn't
do are the people of Manitoba, or the people of Elliot Lake, or
wherever. If they say come, you come. If they say stay away, you
stay away.
In situations like Elliot Lake, or Manitoba, it's the people on the
ground who are the boss. What they say counts most.
Not anyone else.

? The Globe and Mail's was recognized with six prizes last night at the 59th National Newspaper Awards in Toronto, more than any other news organization in the country.
The newspaper had 15 nominations among the 21 categories heading into the annual dinner that salutes the best of Canadian print journalism, also the highest number among Canadian news organizations for the ninth year in a row.
"We are proud of our journalists and the intelligence, wit and courage with which they pursue their journalism," said the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Edward Greenspon, Friday night. "They often work in difficult and pressured circumstances in ensuring they fulfill our duty to create an informed citizenry."
The Globe's sweep spanned across the journalism continuum, from Stephanie Nolen's win in the explanatory work category, to John Lehmann's award for news feature photography.
The Report on Business team of Boyd Erman, Jacquie McNish, Tara Perkins and Heather Scoffield clinched the business-writing category.
Meanwhile, Roy MacGregor won his fifth National Newspaper Award for a short feature, and Ian Brown won his fourth for a long feature.
Graeme Smith was rewarded for his international reporting, while The Globe and Mail's deep commitment to international issues as a whole was recognized by the newspaper's three nominations in the category.

Abstract: Like all business enterprises, the pharmaceutical industry must constantly expand. It does this through innovation in product and marketing. If well regulated both in terms of advertising and costs, drugs can positively affect people's lives.

Full text:   In a manner of speaking, the twenty-first century equivalent to the traveling huckster who preyed on ignorance and insecurity to sell patent medicines and other concoctions of dubious efficacy may be the multinational pharmaceutical industry. There is Viagra for women, drugs for the concocted "illness" of decreasing bone density of aging women, cure for hyperactivity disorder in adults, sixty new obesity pills, Prozac for seven year olds, and a pill to curb the urge to shop.
Like all business enterprises, the pharmaceutical industry must constantly expand. It does this through innovation in product and marketing. The latter is seen as more cost effective and much less prone to regulatory interference. The money spent on drug advertising is truly astounding-estimates are no longer in the billions but in the tens of billions, and increasing rapidly. According to a December 12, 2002, New York Times article, "Promotional spending in the United States by the 14 largest [pharmaceutical] companies increased at an average annual rate of 32.4 percent from 1998 to 2001." In 2000 Merck spent $161 million on advertising for one drug, Vioxx, which is more than was spent in advertising for Pepsi ($125 million) or Budweiser ($146 million). The most important, though rarely analyzed, way in which drug firms advertise is in one-on-one conversations with doctors, which increases the budget. According to a June 24, 2002, Wall Street Journal article, "There is little dispute that drug makers spend big money-more than $16 billion in 2001, according to one estimate-cultivating physicians and medical students."
Advertising to doctors takes many forms. Traditionally, company representatives (who are often attractive women) meet with doctors to discuss the drug, provide information, and frequently give free samples. There has been a proliferation of these representatives in recent years. According to a February 15, 2003, article in the Economist, "The number of drug reps in America alone has almost tripled since 1995, to some 90,000 last year, even though the number of doctors has barely budged." Likewise, the amount and types of gifts physicians receive is increasing. Sometimes company representatives wine and dine them or take them golfing. Trips to the spa and ski holidays have also been made available. As the Economist article reports, "Police in Verona, [Italy,] raided the offices of GlaxoSmithKline; now 40 staff and 30 doctors are under investigation for comparaggio-prescribing drugs in exchange for gifts, such as computers and lavish trips."
According to a December 18, 2002, Wall Street Journal article, in addition to wooing doctors individually, the drug industry
hires as consultants leading doctors as "thought leaders" who talk up the pills or the science behind the pills at medical meetings.... The big drug makers provide 60% of the financial support for continuing medical education classes, often using the sessions to promote medicines as doctors keep their credentials up to date. They provide funding for patient-advocacy groups that in turn help to promote newer, moreexpensive medicines. And they use sophisticated marketing campaigns to persuade doctors and patients to switch to new, but similarly effective compounds when patents on big-selling drugs are about to expire.
There is no legitimate reason for companies to give physicians gifts. U.S. government regulators are currently working on a voluntary guidance proposal for interactions between drug firms and doctors, but such regulation makes little sense-gifts from drug companies should be illegal. On the other hand, some well-regulated drug advertising might be a way to keep physicians educated. One would hope that physicians-people who help us make life and death decisions-prescribe drugs based upon science, not manipulation. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. The December 12, 2002, Wall Street Journal article quotes a 1982 study conducted by Jerry Avorn and colleagues at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts:
Although the vast majority of practitioners perceived themselves as paying little attention to drug advertisements and [salespeople], as compared with papers in the scientific literature, their belief about the drugs revealed quite the opposite pattern of influence.
The article explains the importance of this study today: "Not much has changed since then except the drug industry's spending on promotion" has increased.
Beyond courting medical professionals, drug companies in the United States can engage in direct-toconsumer (DTC) advertising. Changes to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in 1997 sparked a flood of DTC advertising of prescription drugs on television and radio. Now American viewers and listeners are bombarded with the wonders of a multitude of new nostrums. The European Union is currently debating the issue, and Israel Asper--Canada's leading media mogul-recently denounced government regulation on DTCs. While DTC advertising seems to have improved the health of drug companies, has it done the same for the health of the general population?
Treatments for hyperactivity disorder is a good example of the dangers of drug company advertising aimed at consumers. According to a January 5, 2003, Montreal Gazette article, "The market for hyperactivity treatments grew to $1.1 billion in 2001 from $400 million in 1995 as Shire and others started to advertise and promote their treatments more widely. Companies put ads in such magazines as People just before the start of the school year, for instance, urging parents to see their physicians about concerns over their child's behavior." In effect, drug companies decided they could make money by exploiting parental insecurities, causing parents to medicate their children.
Pharmaceutical companies are now eyeing the adult hyperactivity market. The FDA recently approved a couple of hyperactivity drugs for adults despite the scientific debate about whether this is even a valid medical condition, and drug companies are pushing adult and child hyperactivity "disorder." The issue of hyperactivity drug abuse was well summarized by Lawrence Diller, a physician quoted in the January 5, 2003, Montreal Gazette article. He says, "We're looking at a major stimulant-abuse problem in the next five or 10 years."
The pharmaceutical industry often benefits from the branding of new illnesses. For example, twenty-five years ago depression was a problem seldom considered in the medical world. Today, however, it is generally accepted as a serious illness-a positive development for sufferers and a huge help to the bottomline of the drug industry. Pharmaceutical companies can claim to be progressive when promoting drugs for new illnesses, but it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between genuine medical advancement and vested interests pushing their products.
Drug companies claim that hyperactivity drugs help children learn, which may be true. It is certainly true that it is in the drug industry's interest to simplify a complex issue. Some childhood hyperactivity has been linked to problems with the education system-energetic children forced to sit and concentrate for long stretches when they should be given more freedom-but complexity is overlooked for a short-term fix, since this is more profitable to the pharmaceutical industry.
The drive to drug is part of a deeper problem with the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the United States. Ever-expanding pharmaceutical advertising, which is mainly due to DTC advertising, is only profitable within a liberalized price structure. In the United States there is little in terms of price controls on pharmaceuticals. Companies free to charge high prices can spend huge sums on advertising and still maintain large profits. Aside from directly regulating advertising, price controls are a way to reduce it. According to the December 12, 2002, New York Times article, drug companies "spend 12 times as much to promote their prescription products in the United States than in Europe's largest medicine market, Germany." This is a significantly larger sum since the United States is little more than three times the size of Germany Increased German restrictions on drug advertising as well as price controls are important factors. In fact, while drug advertising has been skyrocketing in the United States, the Times reports "in France and Britain, marketing spending fell at an annual rate of around four percent from 1998 to 2001. Both countries have laws that limit drug marketing and prices."
Still many will argue that some good comes out of all this pharmaceutical industry spending. High profits could mean more research, but to whose benefit? Drug companies are complicit in a serious imbalance in world health resources. Medical health officials call it "the 10/90 gap." This describes the current state of affairs in which less than 10 percent of the investment in worldwide health research is spent to study 90 percent of the world's health problems. This misallocation of funds manifests itself in many ways. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres' writing in the May 13, 2002, Scientist,
Of 137 drugs in the pipeline to treat infectious or parasitic disease, one targeted sleeping sickness and one, malaria. Yet eight drugs are in clinical trials for erectile dysfunction, seven for obesity, and four for sleep disorders. The most neglected diseases affect predominantly people in the Southern Hemisphere who do not contribute to the pharmaceutical market.
If well regulated both in terms of advertising and costs, drugs can positively affect people's lives. Better drugs to prevent or cure malaria and sleeping sickness could save millions. Most likely, however, these won't be discovered anytime soon because it isn't profitable enough to do so. According to a May 30, 2002, New York Times article, business investment flows where profits are greatest; "highly innovative new medicines-those with new chemical ingredients that offer significant improvements over existing drugs-made up only 15 percent of those approved" between 1989 to 2000. Nancy Chockley, president of the National Institute for Health Care Management, said, "This is more evidence that the pharmaceutical companies are turning into marketing companies."

Full text: EUROPE
BOSNIA: NEW GOVERNMENT
Bosnia is to have its first non-nationalist central government in more than 10 years, after deputies of the federal Parliament approved a new government made up of representatives of multi-ethnic and reformist parties. The three main nationalist parties that have dominated politics in the Muslim, Serbian and Croatian regions will be excluded. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
CROATIA: EX-GENERAL DENIES CHARGES
A war crimes suspect, former Gen. Mirko Norac, appeared before a court in Zagreb and denied allegations that he was involved in the 1991 killings of Serbian civilians. General Norac, 33, who gave himself up after two weeks in hiding on the condition that he would not be transferred to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was remanded in custody until March 11. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
BRITAIN: CONCERN OVER KURDS
Concerned about the flood of refugees from France, Home Secretary Jack Straw telephoned his French counterpart, Daniel Vaillant, left, to ask him to help ensure that the 900 Iraqi Kurds shipwrecked on the Riviera did not try to travel to Britain. Many of the Kurds, who have been freed so they can file asylum applications in France, seem more interested in trying to settle in Germany and Britain, which have larger Kurdish populations than France does. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
BRITAIN: FOOT-AND-MOUTH PLEA
Officials continued to search for the source of the foot-and-mouth disease that struck pigs and cows in Essex, keeping five farms under quarantine and urging the public to avoid areas where livestock live and graze, lest they spread the disease to other animals. No new cases have been reported. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
UKRAINE: KUCHMA FIRM
President Leonid Kuchma said he would not comply with opposition demands that he resign over allegations that he ordered the kidnapping of a journalist, later found dead, and that he manipulated the 1999 election in which he won a second term. ''More than 16 million people voted for me, and I do not have the right to betray them,'' he told the newspaper Fakti. Meanwhile, opposition deputies failed to carry a motion of no confidence in Prosecutor General Mikhailo Potebenko, accused of mishandling the investigation into the journalist's killing. Patrick E. Tyler (NYT)
MIDDLE EAST
YEMEN: DEATH TOLL RISES
Six people were killed in postelection violence, raising the toll since the vote on Tuesday to 16, government and opposition officials said. Yemen's first municipal elections, combined with a referendum on extending the terms of the president and members of Parliament, have been marred by violence and opposition charges of widespread irregularities. (Reuters)
AFRICA
CONGO: PULLBACK AGREED
Ministers of all the African nations involved in the war in Congo welcomed a United Nations Security Council resolution that sets up a phased pullback and withdrawal of foreign and rebel troops in the country. The 15-to-0 Council resolution ended two days of talks with ministers from nations with troops in Congo: Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the side of Congo, and Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi in opposition. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
ZIMBABWE: JOURNALIST LEAVES
A Uruguayan journalist ordered out of Zimbabwe left for South Africa, saying she would fight to return and accusing the government of repression. ''This is part of the general onslaught, the wave of repression that is turning Zimbabwe into a country very much like Albania under Stalinist rule,'' said Mercedes Sayagues, of The Mail & Guardian in South Africa. A BBC reporter left on Monday after being ordered out. (Reuters)
ASIA
INDIA: 3-MONTH CEASE-FIRE
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said the third extension of India's unilateral cease-fire in Kashmir, which began in November, would last three months, rather than one, apparently to remove the incentive for a monthly cycle of attacks intended to provoke India. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
SRI LANKA: REBELS EXTEND TRUCE
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, fighting for a separate homeland since 1983, extended their unilateral cease-fire, which began on Christmas Eve, for an additional month. They appealed to the United States, Britain, the European Union and India to press Sri Lanka to reciprocate. President Chandrika Kumaratunga has said she will consider a cease-fire only after peace talks have begun. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
INDONESIA: DEADLY CLASHES
The government sent hundreds of police officers and soldiers to Kalimantan, where more than 100 people have died in clashes between Dayak tribesmen and settlers. The police said the violence centered on Sampit, a commercial hub, where witnesses reported widespread rioting, looting and beheadings. Since 1999, thousands have died in attacks on Madurese settlers by Malays and Dayak tribesmen, who resent the outsiders. A navy boat is scheduled to arrive in Sampit today to remove refugees. Calvin Sims (NYT)
THE AMERICAS
CANADA: BALLOT REVIEW DENIED
The Supreme Court has turned down a bid by a Montreal newspaper to review thousands of rejected ballots from the extremely close 1995 referendum on Quebec independence. The Montreal Gazette, the largest English-language paper in the largely French-speaking province, has tried for several years to see 86,501 ballots that were not counted because of irregularities. Separatist officials have been accused of indiscriminately rejecting the votes of English-speaking Quebecers. In 1995, the secessionists were defeated by 54,288 votes. Anthony DePalma (NYT)

Abstract: William Safire On Language column reviews words chosen by various newspapers to describe steep decline in stock market without encouraging a panic (M)

Links: https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=ProQ:&amp;issn=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;title=On+Language%3B+The+Non-Crash&amp;spage=&amp;date=1997&amp;atitle=On+Language%3B+The+Non-Crash&amp;au=&amp;id=&amp;isbn=

Full text: Like the conservative New Year's Eve celebrator who wanted to purchase a noisemaker that wasn't too loud, headline writers were recently faced with a challenge: how to deal with a precipitous (''steep,'' not precipitate, ''abrupt, rash, headlong'') decline in the stock market without encouraging a panic. (Come to think of it, precipitate would be accurate, too, if you wanted to describe the behavior of the professional investors rather than the graph showing stock movement. Celebrator is New York Times style for celebrant.)
The onomatopoeic crash was a word that Wall Street Journal editorialists were unafraid to use, but the front page of that publication chose a verb less evocative of 1929: ''Stocks Plummet 7 Percent.'' (That verb was formed in this century from the noun plummet, a weight used to sound, or fathom, the depth of water; in Shakespeare's ''Tempest,'' Prospero says, ''Deeper than did ever plummet sound/I'll drown my book,'' a sentiment quoted by excessively modest authors.)
''Massive Sell-Off'' was the choice of USA Today. The adjective massive lent urgency to the stock-market term sell-off, a noun first reported in 1937 by the Baltimore Sun and still specialized enough to retain its hyphen in most citations. The New York Times disagrees; the bank, or infixed subhead, of its Hong Kong article read, ''The Hang Seng sets the scene for a global selloff,'' unhyphenated. USA Today also used the noun rout (military origin) and the verb dived (from swimming, with that past tense preferred to dove). Its columnist, Walter Shapiro, later used a less-alarmist word picture: ''Watching the Dow snow-plow down the mountain.''
Plunge (from a 1380 use about baptism by immersion) got a nice play in the Baltimore Sun (but if I first reported the use of sell-off, I'd stick with it proudly). In Newsweek, C. K. Binswanger and Lucy Howard noted the panic prevention in newspapers: drop (International Herald Tribune), tailspin (Jiji Press Ticker of Tokyo), tumble (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) and tremble (Montreal Gazette).
In the synonymy of the bears, decline, sag, sink and slump are mildest; drop, more sudden; tumble, not shocking; dive and plunge, precipitous; plummet, precipitate; sell-off, technical; correction, interpretive or euphemistic; free fall, alarming; collapse, sudden and steep, and crash, better lock that window.
Television journalists, who could immediately affect the market with their demeanor, were careful; NBC called it ''the Big Drop'' and Fox chose ''Blue Monday.''
Now we are into the color of the day. Oct. 19, 1987, was called Black Monday on the analogy of Black Thursday of Oct. 24, 1929, and Black Tuesday of Oct. 29, 1929. These were antedated by Black Friday of Sept. 24, 1869, when Jay Gould drove brokers into bankruptcy with his attempted corner of the gold market. It all began with Blue Monday in the Middle Ages, supposedly the first Monday before Lent, when revelers felt hung over from pre-Lenten flings; later, it became the day to feel depressed about returning to work after a weekend. Several commentators dubbed last month's sell-off (in retrospect, that seems the best word, but who knew at the time?) to have happened on a less-than-calamitous day: Gray Monday.
I confess to having used the euphemistic correction two months before October's financial fibrillation. My technical analysis went, ''You're going to see a correction one of these days that will curl your hair.'' This was an obscure allusion to a figure of speech that sent a shiver through the financial markets 40 years ago. In a 1957 news conference (in those days called a press conference), Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary, a former steel man named George Magoffin Humphrey, was asked if he saw any hope of cutting defense spending in the coming years. He replied that such spending was ''a terrific tax take we are taking out of this country,'' and that if we did not reduce defense expenditures, ''over a long period of time, I will predict that you will have a depression that will curl your hair.''
I enjoy making arcane allusions like that; a few in the codger crowd catch them. One such is Herbert Stein, who once noted how a fellow economist, Sol Fabricant, described a period of less-than-robust expansion by calling it a growth recession. Stein satirized this at the time with an imaginary conversation:
Stein: That's a handsome dog you have there, Sol.
Fabricant: That's not a dog. It's a horse.
Stein: But Sol, it's so small.
Fabricant: It's a growth horse.
Since that time, just as brokers have eschewed the word crash, economists have avoided the word recession, especially those in which hair is curled to depression levels. In 1982, I asked a couple of economists how they would define depression. Alan Greenspan said, ''A depression is either a 12 percent unemployment rate for nine months or more, or a 15 percent unemployment rate for three to nine months.'' Prof. Alfred Kahn of Cornell defined it as unemployment above 10 percent with two quarters of consecutive decline in real G.N.P.
When serving in the Carter Administration, Kahn was chastised for even using the word depression in public. He vowed to White House spinmeisters that whenever he had to refer to such a calamity, he would substitute the word banana.
I still think the market is due for a hair-curler one day, but not so severe as to lead to anything like the Great Banana.
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
''As I travel around the country,'' said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, ''people ask me, 'What's in the water in Tennessee these days, with so many Presidential contenders?''' These include Vice President Al Gore for the Democrats and Senator Fred Thompson and the former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander for the Republicans.
That led to the metaphor of the month from the former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, a Tennessean who now lobbies in Washington: ''If Al Gore runs for President,'' Baker said, ''and Lamar Alexander and Fred Thompson run for President, we'll pump so much money out of Tennessee that the surface will subside and the Mississippi River will run in and flood us all.''

Abstract: William Safire comments on the language the news media used to avoid calling the fall in stock prices in late Oct 1997 a stock market crash, which might evoke comparisons with the 1929 stock market crash.

Full text:   Like the conservative New Year's Eve celebrator who wanted to purchase a noisemaker that wasn't too loud, headline writers were recently faced with a challenge: how to deal with a precipitous (''steep,'' not precipitate, ''abrupt, rash, headlong'') decline in the stock market without encouraging a panic. (Come to think of it, precipitate would be accurate, too, if you wanted to describe the behavior of the professional investors rather than the graph showing stock movement. Celebrator is New York Times style for celebrant.)
The onomatopoeic crash was a word that Wall Street Journal editorialists were unafraid to use, but the front page of that publication chose a verb less evocative of 1929: ''Stocks Plummet 7 Percent.'' (That verb was formed in this century from the noun plummet, a weight used to sound, or fathom, the depth of water; in Shakespeare's ''Tempest,'' Prospero says, ''Deeper than did ever plummet sound/I'll drown my book,'' a sentiment quoted by excessively modest authors.)
''Massive Sell-Off'' was the choice of USA Today. The adjective massive lent urgency to the stock-market term sell-off, a noun first reported in 1937 by the Baltimore Sun and still specialized enough to retain its hyphen in most citations. The New York Times disagrees; the bank, or infixed subhead, of its Hong Kong article read, ''The Hang Seng sets the scene for a global selloff,'' unhyphenated. USA Today also used the noun rout (military origin) and the verb dived (from swimming, with that past tense preferred to dove). Its columnist, Walter Shapiro, later used a less-alarmist word picture: ''Watching the Dow snow-plow down the mountain.''
Plunge (from a 1380 use about baptism by immersion) got a nice play in the Baltimore Sun (but if I first reported the use of sell-off, I'd stick with it proudly). In Newsweek, C. K. Binswanger and Lucy Howard noted the panic prevention in newspapers: drop (International Herald Tribune), tailspin (Jiji Press Ticker of Tokyo), tumble (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) and tremble (Montreal Gazette).
In the synonymy of the bears, decline, sag, sink and slump are mildest; drop, more sudden; tumble, not shocking; dive and plunge, precipitous; plummet, precipitate; sell-off, technical; correction, interpretive or euphemistic; free fall, alarming; collapse, sudden and steep, and crash, better lock that window.
Television journalists, who could immediately affect the market with their demeanor, were careful; NBC called it ''the Big Drop'' and Fox chose ''Blue Monday.''
Now we are into the color of the day. Oct. 19, 1987, was called Black Monday on the analogy of Black Thursday of Oct. 24, 1929, and Black Tuesday of Oct. 29, 1929. These were antedated by Black Friday of Sept. 24, 1869, when Jay Gould drove brokers into bankruptcy with his attempted corner of the gold market. It all began with Blue Monday in the Middle Ages, supposedly the first Monday before Lent, when revelers felt hung over from pre-Lenten flings; later, it became the day to feel depressed about returning to work after a weekend. Several commentators dubbed last month's sell-off (in retrospect, that seems the best word, but who knew at the time?) to have happened on a less-than-calamitous day: Gray Monday.
I confess to having used the euphemistic correction two months before October's financial fibrillation. My technical analysis went, ''You're going to see a correction one of these days that will curl your hair.'' This was an obscure allusion to a figure of speech that sent a shiver through the financial markets 40 years ago. In a 1957 news conference (in those days called a press conference), Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary, a former steel man named George Magoffin Humphrey, was asked if he saw any hope of cutting defense spending in the coming years. He replied that such spending was ''a terrific tax take we are taking out of this country,'' and that if we did not reduce defense expenditures, ''over a long period of time, I will predict that you will have a depression that will curl your hair.''
I enjoy making arcane allusions like that; a few in the codger crowd catch them. One such is Herbert Stein, who once noted how a fellow economist, Sol Fabricant, described a period of less-than-robust expansion by calling it a growth recession. Stein satirized this at the time with an imaginary conversation:
Stein: That's a handsome dog you have there, Sol.
Fabricant: That's not a dog. It's a horse.
Stein: But Sol, it's so small.
Fabricant: It's a growth horse.
Since that time, just as brokers have eschewed the word crash, economists have avoided the word recession, especially those in which hair is curled to depression levels. In 1982, I asked a couple of economists how they would define depression. Alan Greenspan said, ''A depression is either a 12 percent unemployment rate for nine months or more, or a 15 percent unemployment rate for three to nine months.'' Prof. Alfred Kahn of Cornell defined it as unemployment above 10 percent with two quarters of consecutive decline in real G.N.P.
When serving in the Carter Administration, Kahn was chastised for even using the word depression in public. He vowed to White House spinmeisters that whenever he had to refer to such a calamity, he would substitute the word banana.
I still think the market is due for a hair-curler one day, but not so severe as to lead to anything like the Great Banana.
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
''As I travel around the country,'' said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, ''people ask me, 'What's in the water in Tennessee these days, with so many Presidential contenders?''' These include Vice President Al Gore for the Democrats and Senator Fred Thompson and the former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander for the Republicans.
That led to the metaphor of the month from the former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, a Tennessean who now lobbies in Washington: ''If Al Gore runs for President,'' Baker said, ''and Lamar Alexander and Fred Thompson run for President, we'll pump so much money out of Tennessee that the surface will subside and the Mississippi River will run in and flood us all.''
