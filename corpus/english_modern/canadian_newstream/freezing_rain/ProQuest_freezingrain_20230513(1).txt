Full text: Environment Canada is forecasting a "rainy and windy" Christmas that will see anywhere from 20 to 50 millimetres of rain that will then freeze and render local roads and highways slippery.
In a special weather statement issued at 5 a.m. Tuesday for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Châteauguay - La Prairie, the federal agency notes that starting "Christmas Eve, a strong southerly flow will bring mild temperatures, sustained winds and rainfall over the whole province. These conditions will spread from west to east until Christmas day. Areas north of the St. Lawrence River will receive the most significant amounts of rain."
That rain may cause flash floods and pooling on roads, the statement warns.
On Christmas Day, the temperature is expected to drop below the freezing mark and a transition from rain to snow may cause icy road conditions.
The forecast high for Thursday, Dec. 24 is 9 C. while that for Christmas Day is 12 C.
The temperature will then drop to a high of -3 C. on Dec. 26 with a mix of sun and cloud.

Full text: Eastern Quebec has been hit with winter storm warnings Sunday morning.
Environment Canada meteorologists are expecting heavy snowfall in the Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie and Côte-Nord regions, leaving an accumulation of 15 to 30 cm in places.
The sudden precipitation and blowing snow along the river could complicate travel.
Weather conditions are expected to improve during Sunday evening.
Storm surge warnings have also been issued by the federal agency due to higher than normal water levels and large waves near the coast. A minor overflow was expected by midday.
Other areas further west were expected to receive less than a millimetre of ice early in the day, before the temperature rose above freezing.

Full text: Cloudy, five degrees above zero. That meteorological period between the cozy walks of fall and the snowy wonder of winter will continue for the next few days. If you want to get out, though, today will be the day to do it because Saturday and Sunday will be rain and snow. There's even a special weather statement from Environment Canada warning of potential freezing rain, but they don't have a clear forecast for it yet.
Tonight, we're predicting a low of zero.
The sun isn't expected to return until next Tuesday, but by then temperatures will have plummeted with lows in the minus-teens.

Full text: Environment Canada on Friday issued a special weather statement for Montreal and Laval forecasting a "possible snowfall on Sunday."
The statement, issued at 10:45 a.m., notes that a low pressure system over the U.S. Midwest will affect southwestern Quebec beginning Sunday afternoon.
"This system will intensify as it makes its way to the province," according to the statement. "Depending on its track, which is still uncertain, this low pressure system could give significant snowfall amounts and cause strong winds over southern and central Quebec Sunday night, especially over regions along the north shore of the St-Lawrence River. It will then spread to eastern Quebec on Monday."
The precipitation is expected to begin as snow, then gradually change to rain with a risk of freezing rain during the changeover on Monday morning over most areas.
Environment Canada will update its statement as more details become available.

Full text: OK, it won't be skate-to-work slippery in Montreal at least, but there will be a risk of iced, slippery sidewalks and roadways this morning. And we're definitely in for precipitation, especially outside Montreal.
Environment Canada started the day at 4:47 a.m. with freezing-rain and winter-storm warnings. The freezing rain( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) will likely wrap up for Montreal by late morning, but could last into the evening in the Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville, Joliette, St-Jérôme, Nicolet, Trois-Rivières, La Tuque, Victoriaville, Quebec City, Lévis, St-Georges and Montmagny areas. Between five and 10 cm of precipitation could fall. In Montreal, rain might continue into the evening, with a high of 8 C.
Meanwhile, 15 to 25 cm of snow is forecast in the communities of Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, Trois-Pistoles and La Malbaie. Strong winds will accompany the snow in Saguenay and the North Shore, including Tadoussac, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles.
Tonight: Rain ending in the evening, then mainly cloudy. Low -4 C. Wind chill -9 C overnight.

Full text: Good morning and welcome to the provincial budget-day edition of While You Were Sleeping. You can follow our pre-budget stories and coverage of the budget being handed down this afternoon right here( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-politics ).
It's icy on some sidewalks and roadways, so be careful!( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-dont-forget-the-umbrella ) Environment Canada issued a freezing-rain warning just before 5 a.m. that could last through the morning. The rain will continue through the evening.
C.D.N.-N.D.G. mayor Sue Montgomery suspends borough director days after her political attaché quit( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/suspension-resignation-in-montgomerys-office ): Unrest continues in the borough office as mayor Sue Montgomery has suspended her borough director, while her press attaché has resigned, the Montreal Gazette has learned. The newspaper has also learned that Montgomery is seeking an injunction in Quebec Superior Court against the city of Montreal in connection with an internal city report alleging that her chief of staff, Annalisa Harris, harassed two civil servants in her office. Montgomery will ask the court to order the city of Montreal to hand over a report on the alleged harassment by the city's comptroller general, Alain Bond. She will also argue that Bond overstepped his authority by placing a civil servant in her office on a paid leave of absence as a result of the harassment report. By "his actions, the comptroller general of the city of Montreal, Mr. Alain Bond, is overstepping his powers and disturbing the operations of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce," the injunction request says. Read Marian Scott's full story right here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/suspension-resignation-in-montgomerys-office ).
Plane carrying Canadians from Grand Princess cruise ship arrives in Canada: A plane carrying Canadians who were on a cruise ship with a cluster of novel coronavirus cases arrived back in Canada this morning. The government-chartered aircraft landed at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, in Ontario, where the passengers will spend two-weeks in quarantine. The exact number of Canadians on the flight was unknown because they had to pass a screening process before being allowed to board the flight. There were 237 Canadians among the 3,500 passengers and crew on board the Grand Princess cruise ship.
Futures rebound after oil gains on stimulus hopes: After yesterday's volatility, Canada's main stock index futures rebounded on Tuesday as oil prices gained on hopes of economic stimulus and possible OPEC talks. March futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 4.57 per cent at 7 a.m. ET. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX index closed down 10.27 per cent at 14,514.24 on Monday, its biggest drop since the October 1987 stock market crash. The recovery in oil prices comes a day after their biggest rout in nearly 30 years, as investors eyed the possibility of economic stimulus and Russia signalled that talks with OPEC remained possible. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 4.14 per cent at 7 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 4.34 per cent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 4.54 per cent.

Full text: A snowfall warning issued for the Montreal area is forecasting a mix of rain and snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-rain-freezing-rain-welcome-to-the-rest-of-montreals-week ) Wednesday night that will coalesce into "sustained snow" in time for Thursday's morning rush rush hour.
A total of 15 to 20 centimetres of snow is expected to fall over the region over the next 24 hours. And the warning from Environment Canada,( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#702177391744273262202002260504ww1070cwul ) issued at 5:01 a.m. Wednesday, cautions motorists to expect "poor travelling conditions due to low visibility and rapidly accumulating snow on roads, especially Thursday morning. Consider changing your travel plans. ... There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas."
The forecast for Wednesday afternoon calls for a high of 0 degrees Celsius with a windchill of minus-8 C and an accumulation of 2 centimetres of snow. Things will get dodgier this evening, with snow becoming mixed with rain overnight. While about 5 cm of snow is expected in Montreal, twice that amount could fall in Laval.
The forecast high for Thursday morning will be 2 degrees C. Expect snow mixed with rain in the morning and blowing snow in the afternoon.
Environment Canada's warning for the Montreal area is one of several issued for those regions of Quebec in the path of a low-pressure system originating in the American southwest.
Heavy snowfall is being predicted for regions north of the St. Lawrence Valley.
Accumulations of snow varying from 20 to 40 centimetres are forecast for the Outaouais and Mauricie regions, the Laurentians as well as the Lanaudière, Beauce, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspé and Côte-Nord regions and from Baie-Comeau to Natashquan.
In the Quebec City region, as much as 45 centimetres of snow is being forecast.
Precipitation is expected to be much milder in Sherbrooke, Victoriaville, Lac-Mégantic, Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville and Thetford Mines.

Full text: A special weather statement issued for the Montreal area is warning of a meteorological cocktail that will include snow, rain and freezing rain beginning Wednesday night and continuing into Thursday.
The statement, issued at 4:24 p.m. Tuesday, forecasts a winter storm for much of the province that in southwestern Quebec will manifest itself as rain and freezing rain on Wednesday night before turning into snow on Thursday.
"This system will bring heavy snow over most areas, with general amounts upwards of 15 centimetres that could reach more than 25 cm over some areas," according to the statement. "Additionally, this system will bring strong winds that are likely to produce blowing snow over many exposed areas, especially along the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St Lawrence."
Motorists are warned that they should expect "poor travelling conditions due to low visibility and rapidly accumulating snow on untreated roads, especially Thursday morning. Consider moving ahead or postponing your travel plans."
The weather system is expected to slowly roll across the province for 73 hours and reach eastern Quebec by Friday. As is usual in the case of such statements, more detailed information is expected over the course of the week as the track of the system becomes more certain.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Hanes: Is Montreal ready for the Big One?( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-is-montreal-ready-for-the-big-one )
Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature. Mercifully, the freezing rain storm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/less-freezing-rain-than-expected ), though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers. On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/did-the-earthquake-wake-you-up-it-was-magnitude-3-4-near-valleyfield ) rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately, it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Brownstein: Harry and Meghan living in Montreal? A jolly good idea!( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-harry-and-meghan-living-in-montreal-a-jolly-good-idea )
Have we got a castle for you, Harry and Meghan! Now that Queen Elizabeth has "reluctantly" agreed to the couple living a more independent future and splitting time between both sides of the pond, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle should forget about moving to Toronto or Vancouver but instead come to Montreal where the gin and tonics flow, the food is decidedly finer and the real estate is relatively reasonable. The latter, of course, is a major consideration since the Sussexes seek to be financially independent and work for their daily crumpets.
As Montreal's vacancy rate plummets, Mayor Plante seeks funding help( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-addresses-housing-crisis )
Montreal's rental vacancy rate has dropped to 1.5 per cent while rents have risen by 3.6 per cent, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. That marks a 15-year low in the city, where finding a reasonably priced apartment is harder than ever. The average rent in the city is now $841 a month, according to a report( https://eppdscrmssa01.blob.core.windows.net/cmhcprodcontainer/sites/cmhc/data-research/publications-reports/rental-market-reports/2019/rental-market-reports-montreal-64411-2020-a01-en.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=r&se=2021-05-07T03:55:04Z&st=2019-05-06T19:55:04Z&spr=https,http&sig=bFocHM6noLjK8rlhy11dy%2BkQJUBX%2BCDKzkjLHfhUIU0%3D ) on the 2019 rental market released Wednesday. The average rent for a vacant two-bedroom apartment in Greater Montreal is about $1,080 - about 25 per cent more than the average for units that are presently occupied. Mayor Valérie Plante called on the federal and provincial governments to open the purse strings to help solve the growing housing crisis.
Ensemble Montréal calls for ban on e-scooters( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ban-scooters-boost-bixi-opposition-urges )
Montreal's opposition party is calling on the administration to pull the plug on electric scooters after last year's pilot project resulted in widespread shirking of helmet and parking laws. "From what we've seen, it's clear that it was a failure," Ensemble Montréal Leader Lionel Perez said Thursday after a press conference at city hall. In August, Lime introduced 430 e-scooters in Montreal, followed by Bird, with 250 scooters. The two-wheeled devices were popular, with Lime averaging 1,500 rides a day. However, compliance with parking rules was so poor, the city announced in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-e-scooter-e-bike-riders-to-be-fined-50-for-illegal-parking ) it would impose $50 tickets on riders caught in the act of parking illegally.
Thérèse Tanguay Dion in 2008.
Maman Dion was 'the mother of all of Quebec'( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/maman-dion-was-the-mother-of-all-of-quebec )
Thérèse Tanguay Dion wasn't just the mother of Québécois pop superstar Céline Dion. She was also a much-loved Quebec personality in her own right, which is why so many people here reacted so emotionally when news broke Friday morning that she had died( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/maman-dion-celines-mother-has-died-at-age-92 ). Maman Dion, as she was affectionately known, died Friday at the age of 92. No cause of death was announced, but her daughter Claudette said she had been in failing health for several months. "She's like the mother of all of Quebec because everyone wants to have a Maman Dion as their mother," said TV host and producer Julie Snyder. "Céline was the darling of Quebec, but she was the mom of Quebec. And she's the most famous mom in the world. There is no star who has a famous mom like her. You don't know the mom of Paul McCartney. You don't know the mom of Beyoncé."

Snow expected to wreak havoc with Thursday morning rush hour

Full text: A special weather statement by Environment Canada forecasting 15 centimetres of snow that could coincide with the Thursday morning rush hour has been amended - and the news isn't good.
While it was earlier suggested snow would begin Wednesday evening, the statement issued at 5:03 a.m. Wednesday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#105024780154021011202001140504ws1070cwul ) is depressingly more precise, warning "snow will begin near midnight (Thursday) and intensify early in the morning."
"Areas south of a line extending from Montreal to Sherbrooke may see total snowfall amounts of up to 15 centimetres.
"This snow could be accompanied by blowing snow locally. Driving conditions will be hazardous during morning rush hour Thursday in Montreal and its suburbs."
The City of Montreal has taken precautionary measures in anticipation of the latest dump of precipitation, launching a snow clearing operation on Monday to remove the 11 centimetres of sleet and ice that accumulated during last weekend's cocktail of rain, freezing rain and ice pellets.
Meanwhile, local police forces took to social media to urge motorists to adapt their driving habits to the imminent spate of bad weather and remind them to clear snow off their car before embarking on roads Thursday morning.
Other bad-weather driving tips: ensure your car's windshield wiper reservoir and gas tank are topped up before you find yourself trapped in a traffic jam; have an ice scraper close at hand should your windshield white out because of the snow; and, if possible, ignore car travel altogether and use public transit.

Jean-François Parenteau, the city executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, said 11 centimetres of sleet and ice had fallen since Saturday night. "Since this heavy snow won't melt, there is no advantage to wait for further precipitation. ... So it will be picked up and we'll preserve access to our sewer drains."

Hanes: Is Montreal ready for the Big One?

Full text: Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature.
Mercifully the freezing rain storm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/less-freezing-rain-than-expected ), though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers.
On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/did-the-earthquake-wake-you-up-it-was-magnitude-3-4-near-valleyfield ) rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Montreal actually sits on a continental "weak spot," explained Christie Rowe, a professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University and the Canada Research Chair in Earthquake Geology, making it prone to seismic activity.
"The St. Lawrence lies in a very old fault zone. It's pretty wide. It goes from the Laurentians basically down to the U.S. border. And the fault formed when the Atlantic Ocean was opening, so hundreds of millions of years ago," she said. "But faults in continents never fully heal. So it's always this weak spot."
The last "Big One" to rattle the area occurred in 1732, said Rowe, but predicting the next one is notoriously difficult.
"We don't understand the timing of earthquakes when they're not on a plate boundary," she said. "They're totally unpredictable. We know looking back in history that there've been a few since Europeans arrived. That could mean we have one tomorrow, it could mean we don't have another one for 500 years."
The rarity and lack of certainty around their timing may make the risk easy to ignore compared to more imminent threats like spring floods or blizzards, but even a moderate earthquake could be incredibly damaging in Montreal.
"I can only imagine what would happen to the Olympic Stadium," Rowe said. "We're not built for this type of risk."
In 2013, the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/on/resources/studies/air-study ) released an eye-opening and sobering study examining earthquake risk in the two seismically volatile regions that are home to 40 per cent of the population.
It estimated that a 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami in British Columbia could cause as much as $75 billion in damages. Meanwhile a major convulsion of magnitude 7.1 along the St. Lawrence fault line could cause losses in excess of $60 billion, while crippling the economy.
The IBC research outlined the dual threats in financial terms. Journalist Kathryn Schulz chronicled the humanitarian and civilizational toll, if - or likely, when - the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Pacific coast gives way. The piece, published in the New Yorker( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.
At once understated in tone and alarming in effect, the article might have jolted cities on the West Coast into action and prompted people in the Cascadia danger zone to stock up on First Aid kits( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-really-small-ones ).
Montrealers may know how to confront the ravages of an Ice Storm after shivering through 1998. And we are commemorating the devastation of the quake that hit Haiti 10 years ago, given Montreal's close ties to that country. Yet it seems there is little awareness about what to do if the ground starts trembling here.
"We 100 per cent don't take it seriously enough," said Rowe, who grew up in California, where readiness is second nature.
"The immediate risks during the shaking and then during any aftershocks, would be from falling objects and that could be part of the building, it could be windows breaking. So if you start to feel shaking, get under a heavy table or desk so that falling objects won't hit you," she advised. "If people do feel an earthquake in the city, if they're in a modern building that has steel stairwells, those are some of the safest parts of modern buildings. And just stay away from the frontage of any building, stones could be falling."
Rowe suggested holding earthquake drills in Montreal that include schools, public authorities, willing businesses and ordinary citizens. She also invited those who experienced Monday's seismic event to go to Did You Feel It?( https://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/dyfi-lavr/known-connu-en.php ) on Earthquakes Canada's website (earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca) and share their observations to help scientists like herself gather data.
"I'd like the community to know that there are researchers who are working on this and we are trying to better our understanding of it with the hopes of making us safer," she said.
Freezing rain may be a frequent peril for Montrealers, but the latest tremor should be a wake-up call.

Montreal spared worst of storm

Full text: With the Montreal area avoiding the worst of the weekend storm, the number of Quebec households without power was down from a high of 140,000 to below 14,000 by Sunday night, most of them on the South Shore.
The cause of the outages there was "galloping" power lines, said Cendrix Bouchard, a spokesperson for Hydro-Québec. This can occur when freezing rain creates icicles on transmission lines and towers, and high winds lift them up, creating a galloping, or jumping, motion.
Repair crews had to wait for high winds to subside before they could repair the lines, Bouchard said.
"The winds have dropped and we have made good progress."
On Sunday morning, Hydro-Québec had some problems with its computer system, which was giving inaccurate numbers on outages, but the issue was resolved by afternoon, Bouchard said.
Environment Canada had issued weather warnings Saturday forecasting freezing rain, turning to ice pellets overnight Saturday to Sunday.
That's what we got, but the switch to ice pellets happened sooner than expected, said meteorologist Simon Legault of Environment Canada.
That meant streets, sidewalks and highways in Montreal were not as treacherous as feared, he said.
"It's less slippery this morning than what it could have been," Legault said.
The city of Montreal issued a statement Saturday saying it was closely monitoring weather conditions and would spread abrasives on streets and sidewalks as needed.
The less-than-expected amount of freezing rain also decreased the risk of branches falling on power lines, Legault said.
While the South Shore, Quebec City and other regions were hit by major outages, widespread blackouts were averted in Montreal and Laval.
"In the Montreal area, it's less impactful than what we expected," he said.
The ice pellets formed a layer on roads that some drivers said felt like driving on sand over a thin layer of ice.
Transports Québec warned drivers to be wary of slippery conditions, especially on the South Shore and highways along the St. Lawrence River.
By the end of the month, the weather is expected to turn to more typical winter conditions, with bitterly cold temperatures and little precipitation, Legault said. Postmedia News

Full text: With the Montreal area avoiding the worst of the weekend storm, the number of Quebec households without power was down to 16,648 by 8 p.m. Sunday.
Most were on the South Shore, where almost 130,000 households had been without power Sunday morning. There were 13,500 customers still in the dark by 8 p.m., mainly in Brossard, St-Hubert, St-Bruno-de-Montarville and St-Hilaire. Also affected were the Eastern Townships, with 1,677 households lacking power; the Quebec City area, with 81; and Chaudière-Appalaches, with 1,059.

Full text: Two cars swerved off a highway overpass in St-Eustache, north of Montreal, on Saturday night, ending up on a roadway below.
The crash occurred about 7:15 p.m. The two cars were heading east on Highway 640 when they crashed through a guard rail and ended up on 25th Ave. below, said Sûreté du Québec spokesperson Hugues Beaulieu.
The people in the cars suffered minor injuries, he said.
The cause of the crash was not known, Beaulieu said. Heavy rain and freezing rain may have played a role.

Full text: With the Montreal area avoiding the worst of the weekend storm, the number of Quebec households without power was down to 35,656 by 4 p.m. Sunday.
Most were on the South Shore, where almost 130,000 households had been without power Sunday morning. There were 24,895 customers still in the dark by 4 p.m., mainly in Brossard, St-Hubert, St-Bruno-de-Montarville and St-Hilaire. Also affected were the Eastern Townships, with 2,351 households lacking power; the Quebec City area, with 1,703; and Chaudière-Appalaches, with 5,747.
The cause of the outages on the South Shore was "galloping" power lines, said Cendrix Bouchard, a spokesperson for Hydro-Québec. This can occur when freezing rain creates icicles on transmission lines and towers, and high winds lift them up, creating a galloping, or jumping, motion.
Repair crews had to wait for high winds to subside before they could repair the lines, Bouchard said.
"The winds have dropped and we have made good progress."
On Sunday morning Hydro-Québec had some problems with its computer system, which was giving inaccurate numbers on outages, but the issue was resolved by afternoon, Bouchard said.
Environment Canada had issued weather warnings Saturday forecasting freezing rain, turning to ice pellets overnight Saturday to Sunday.
That's what we got, but the switch to ice pellets happened sooner than expected, said meteorologist Simon Legault of Environment Canada.
That meant streets, sidewalks and highways in Montreal were not as treacherous as feared, he said.
"It's less slippery this morning than what it could have been," Legault said.
The city of Montreal issued a statement Saturday saying it was closely monitoring weather conditions and would spread abrasives on streets and sidewalks as needed.
The less-than-expected amount of freezing rain also decreased the risk of branches falling on power lines, Legault said.
While the South Shore, Quebec City and other regions were hit by major outages, widespread blackouts were averted in Montreal and Laval.
"In the Montreal area, it's less impactful than what we expected," he said.
The ice pellets formed a layer on roads that some drivers said felt like driving on sand over a thin layer of ice.
Transports Québec warned drivers to be wary of slippery conditions, especially on the South Shore and highways along the St. Lawrence River.
Weather conditions continued to delay some flights at Trudeau airport.
Environment Canada ended its freezing rain warning Sunday morning and was calling for snow until afternoon, with a couple centimetres of accumulation.
By the end of the month, the weather is expected to turn to more typical winter conditions, with bitterly cold temperatures and little precipitation, Legault said.

There were 74,407 customers still in the dark early Sunday afternoon, mainly in Brossard, St-Hubert, St-Bruno-de-Montarville and St-Hilaire. Also affected were the Eastern Townships, with 2,064 households lacking power; the Quebec City area, with 4,399; Chaudière-Appalaches, with 5,782; and the Laurentians, with 3,085.

The last decade has seen a steep increase in the number of athletes achieving personal bests in their 40s and beyond. This group of dedicated older athletes has redefined the idea of aging, rewriting the record books with performances in the pool, on the track, and in the saddle. So remarkable are their achievements, exercise scientists have been busy studying their training and lifestyle habits to see if they can gather more information on what successful aging looks like.

By the time the earth stopped shaking, Marcus Jasmin was surrounded by death.
He'd been chatting with classmates at Université d'État d'Haïti just a few moments earlier. But most of them were dead or buried under mounds of debris when the dust cleared.

Fitness: A healthy - and well-timed - diet fuels muscles of master athletes( https://montrealgazette.com/health/diet-fitness/fitness-a-healthy-and-well-timed-diet-fuels-muscles-of-master-athletes )
The last decade has seen a steep increase in the number of athletes achieving personal bests in their 40s and beyond. This group of dedicated older athletes has redefined the idea of aging, rewriting the record books with performances in the pool, on the track, and in the saddle. So remarkable are their achievements, exercise scientists have been busy studying their training and lifestyle habits to see if they can gather more information on what successful aging looks like.

Full text: Authorities say they are ready to respond to treacherous road conditions and widespread power outages as the weather is expected to turn ugly Saturday night into Sunday.
Rain is expected to change to freezing rain overnight Saturday, but in some areas outside of Montreal, there were already slippery conditions reported early Saturday. At least 10 cars slid off the road in the Quebec City region Saturday morning, but there were no serious injuries or damage, said Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau.

She warned people to stay home if they don't have to travel when the roads are slippery.
Environment and Climate Change Canada( https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html ) has forecast that rain will be changing to snow( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), accompanied by freezing rain Saturday night into Sunday. Accumulations in some spots could exceed 25 centimetres of snow, but only about five cms are forecast for the Montreal region. More snow is expected later in the week.
Transport Quebec teams were out Saturday, and the city of Montreal issued a statement saying it is prepared to act to keep the roads safe in the wake of the changing weather conditions, by salting and plowing.
Nos équipes surveillent l'évolution des conditions météo et sécurisent du mieux possible les 10 000 km de rues et de trottoirs.
Malgré les efforts déployés, les conditions météorologiques rendront les déplacements difficiles. La prudence est de mise.

On its website, Hydro-Québec( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) said it had 100 teams ready to intervene as strong winds could knock down hydro poles or cause tree branches to fall on wires. The utility said there could be many outages in the next few hours, with the regions most at risk being Montreal, the Laurentians, the Montérégie and Outaouais.

Full text: Construction will road closings involving the Turcot and Angrignon interchanges on Saturday.
However, provincial transport authorities warn also any and all construction could be postponed in case of poor weather, a distinct possibility given the weather cocktail expected to descend on Montreal on Saturday and Sunday.
The following closings are planned to be in effect until 5 a.m. Monday.
Construction on the Turcot Interchange Jan. 10-13, 2020, weather permitting.
. Eastbound Highway 20 between the Turcot Interchange and the access ramp for de la Cathédrale and Notre-Dame St. W.
. The ramp from southbound Highway 15 for eastbound Highway 720.
. The ramp from westbound Highway 20 for Exit 65 for Route 138 E. / Angrignon Blvd. / St-Jacques St.
. Access to eastbound Highway 20 from Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Blvd.
If those road closing do not deter you from weekend travel on local roads, just remember the condition of those roads are expected to be subject to rapid and perhaps treacherous change over the next 73 hours.
Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a "significant" amount of precipitation.
In a special weather statement for the Montreal area that was updated at 3:49 p.m. Friday, the federal weather service said rain throughout the day on Saturday will be followed by freezing rain on Saturday evening.
"Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant and make surfaces such as highways, streets and sidewalks treacherous.
"Strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are also expected on Sunday, and may possibly impact icy structures such as tree limbs and power lines."
The Outaouais, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions could also see significant amounts of snow and ice pellets.

Full text: Transport Quebec is warning motorists that infrastructure work will see road closures imposed in the areas of the Turcot and Angrignon interchanges.
However, provincial authorities warn also that any and all construction could be postponed in case of poor weather, a distinct possibility given the weather cocktail expected to descend on Montreal Saturday and Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-freezing-rain-heavy-winds-expected-on-weekend ).

Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a "significant" amount of precipitation - 20 to 35 millimetres of rainfall and melting snow on Saturday, and 15-30 millimetres of freezing rain on Saturday evening and Sunday, with wind gusts of 60-70 km/h on Sunday.
"Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery," the agency warned on Friday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ). "Public Safety Canada encourages everyone to make an emergency plan and get an emergency kit with drinking water, food, medicine, a first-aid kit and a flashlight."
The Outaouais, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions could also see significant amounts of snow and ice pellets.

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning of significant amounts or rain and freezing rain expected to fall over the Montreal area this weekend.
The statement, issued late Wednesday, covers the areas of Montreal, Laval, Gatineau, the Eastern Townships, much of the Montérégie, St-Jérôme, Ste-Agathe-des-Monts, Joliette, Sorel-Tracy and Drummondville. Environment Canada forecasts that the precipitation will begin Saturday in the form of rain, turning into freezing rain Saturday evening. The amount of freezing rain could be heavy and render highways, streets and sidewalks extremely slippery.
The outlook for Sunday is equally daunting, with wind gusts of up to 70 km/h that could have an impact on ice-covered trees, power lines and buildings.
Environment Canada notes that uncertainty over the precise course of the low pressure system could have an effect on the amounts of precipitation received.

Full text: Good morning and welcome to Thursday's edition of While You Were Sleeping.
No arrests after a man shot early Thursday in Dorval( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-wounded-in-dorval-industrial-parks-second-shooting-in-five-weeks ): A man in his 50s was shot in an industrial section of Dorval early Thursday morning, police are reporting. The victim is in stable condition. No arrests have been made so far. Two suspects were seen fleeing in a dark-coloured SUV. An investigation is in progress.
Iran says crash jet tried to turn back, while Ukraine probes missile theory: The Boeing Co. jet that crashed near Tehran Tuesday tried to turn back after takeoff, Iran revealed in an initial report as Ukraine said it's examining scenarios including a missile strike and terrorism. At least six Quebecers were among 176 who died when a Boeing 737-800 crashed shortly after takeoff( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-were-among-those-killed-on-plane-that-went-down-in-iran ). Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 disappeared from radar screens at 8,000 feet, and witnesses said they saw it on fire in the air, according to Iran's Civil Aviation Organization. The flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders were damaged but their core memory appears to be accessible, the report said. The findings are the first officially released from a probe fraught with difficulty amid heightened U.S.-Iranian tensions. Ukraine added to confusion around the crash, saying it's looking at whether the jet was downed by a missile or bomb after Iran had insisted it fell victim to a technical failure or engine fire. The scenarios are among several put forward to explain the disaster, National Security & Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Facebook, pointing to supposed evidence of missile debris found near the crash site and circulated on the Internet. Others include a collision with a drone or other object, as well as destruction of an engine due to technical reasons, he said.
Entrepreneurial spirit ignites concern, possible 'citation' in Las Vegas: The Associated Press is reporting that some enterprising individual appears to have set up an illegal homemade gas station in the backyard of a home. A hose from backyard storage tanks was long enough to reach to the street, the department said on Facebook, "for possible curbside fill ups.( https://www.facebook.com/lasvegasfd/posts/3427960793888003?__xts__[0]=68.ARBoyFvPM9kOzrMvq8aJsRl-aa7n0xKdGM-I7FG8ftNWsvwR9DCMwgIStrmsVgAlKEfnrFfwB_mZwFdPX25GHnLKLlmG9_JZD1qJkpzXCrXL0I9fDxqKiOsenzos6Nn-0BEtci0CZESqxZowSRjFOP32R7-KfVY7-snAazzABJdm0MsLql23V_M9RLUNGn9hBuZIVRkJEGFaOZwfdkm54oXaDYuhX9AtcnYa5kJA3sUktpJT_q3BuhSXxbL4K7-6m2xxQi1bk5NcW2jJENU-CvWWh2BNRBl-W5BrliVeXtC8Updrd2hIft30XKZNreycyFRAoqvrwIXDZpntHSdzIv2hcw&__tn__=-R ) ... This is not only illegal in the city, it is a hazard to neighbours and first responders who may respond there for an emergency, like a fire.

The scenarios are among several put forward to explain the disaster, National Security & Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Facebook, pointing to supposed evidence of missile debris found near the crash site and circulated on the Internet. Others include a collision with a drone or other object, as well as destruction of an engine due to technical reasons, he said.
Entrepreneurial spirit ignites concern, possible 'citation' in Las Vegas: The Associated Press is reporting that some enterprising individual appears to have set up an illegal homemade gas station in the backyard of a home.

Strike adds to Montreal airports’ woes: About 100 Swissport refuellers walk off job after talks with union fail as Trudeau, Mirabel cope with weather

Full text: The unionized workers responsible for refuelling planes at Montreal’s two airports walked off the job Tuesday morning, raising the prospects of more flight delays and cancellations amid freezing rain and snow.
About 100 employees of Swissport Canada went on strike after rejecting on Friday a tentative agreement reached between the employees and their union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
Refuelling operations are continuing to use trained managers and workers from other airports, but the operator of Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and Mirabel International Airport warned the strike could cause flight delays.
“Aéroports de Montréal [ADM] regrets that passengers … find themselves, through no fault of their own, in the midst of a labour dispute between Swissport Fuelling and its employees responsible for refuelling aircrafts,” the airport authority said in a statement.
Dozens of flights were cancelled at Trudeau airport on Monday amid freezing rain and snow that prompted the airport to limit takeoffs and landings. At noon on Tuesday, several flights were posted as delayed or cancelled.
Air Canada, the biggest airline at Trudeau airport, said it took actions ahead of time to ensure its operations are not affected by the strike.
“In anticipation of possible job action, we undertook several measures to ensure we continue to transport our customers, including tankering extra fuel and arranging alternate fuel suppliers,” said Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Montreal-based Air Canada.
“We are also working closely with ADM and Swissport, which has made contingency plans to maintain its operations.”
A union representative was not available.
Zurich-based Swissport provides fuelling and ground handling services at 10 Canadian airports, and operates worldwide.
Swissport issued a statement that accused the union of failing to bargain in good faith.
“Our proposal included compensation increases for all employees that met the majority of the union’s demands,” Swissport said.
Swissport said the Canada Industrial Relations Board heard the complaint on Monday, but has yet to make a ruling.
In its statement, Swissport said airport operations are unaffected “so far.”
“Anyone working for or on behalf of Swissport Canada has received thorough safety and jobspecific training appropriate to their role,” Swissport said.
“Our management team is actively engaged in the onboarding process because we have an obligation to our workforce and our partners to maintain a safe environment at both” Montreal airports.

The Canada Industrial Relations Board ruled Tuesday afternoon that the union could maintain its strike, but had to drop the new demands made on Sunday.
The board also ordered the union "immediately" back to the negotiating table with Swissport. Both sides say they have not yet set a date for negotiations to restart.
Federal Labour Minister Filomena Tassi called on both sides to continue bargaining.
"I am disappointed that the parties have been unable to resolve their differences and I urge them to continue their efforts to reach a negotiated settlement," she said in a release. "We are monitoring the situation closely."
Salaries and work-life balance are the main points of contention between Swissport and its Montreal-area workers, who have been without a contract since August.

Inuit pop singer Kelly Fraser, who died by suicide, had been seeking help for PTSD
The singer-songwriter who garnered worldwide attention with her Inuktitut cover of Rihanna'sDiamondsdied by suicide at the age of 26 on Christmas Eve,her family said.
"Kelly suffered from PTSD for many years as a result of childhood traumas, racism and persistent cyberbullying," the family's statement said. "She was actively seeking help and spoke openly about her personal challenges online and through her journey."
Fraser blended her cultural influences, singing and rapping in both English and Inuktitut. She was nominated for a Juno and was recently crowdfunding for her third album, Decolonize.
Inuit have among the highest suicide rates in the world; in 2017, the rate was 106 for every 100,000 people.
In the wake of Fraser's death, NDP MP Charlie Angus reiterated his call for a national suicide-prevention strategy.

Dozens of flights have been cancelled in Montreal and Ottawa
Freezing rain and snow prompted Air Canada and WestJet to scrap or delaytrips during the busy holiday season. More than 70 departures were cancelled in Montreal alone as the airlines sought to cancel shorter flights that would disrupt fewer passengers.
Freezing rain poses a greater safety risk than snow because it gets on every part of a plane, an Air Canada spokesperson said.
Travellers leaving Montreal are also bracing for further disruptions should workers who fuel planes launch a strike action on Jan. 1.
Nissan's former chairman has fled Japan for Lebanon as his trial looms
Carlos Ghosnhas landed in Beirutmonths ahead of an expected trial for charges of hiding income and financial misconduct.
"I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution," he said in a statement, blaming a "rigged" Japanese justice system.
Ghosn holds French and Lebanese passports. Still, it's unclear how he was able to leave Japan while he was under heavy surveillance. Lebanon doesn't have an extradition treaty with Japan.
The 65-year-old's lawyers have said the charges are rooted in a conspiracy to oust him from Nissan in order to prevent a merger with France's Renault SA.
The repatriation of Canadarm-maker MDA comes at a critical time in the new space race
The acquisition by Jim Balsillie, John Risley and their investor group takes place just as global tech heavyweights prepare to launch thousands of satellites into orbit in the hopes of beaming internet services from space - initiatives that could use MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Inc. gear.
The purchase also solves some sticky problems for Ottawa,Jeffrey Jones writes: "It would have been much more troublesome for the Trudeau government to fund, say, a new Canadarm for NASA's next project - the Lunar Gateway space station - if the main contractor for the Maple Leaf-emblazoned grabber was being sold to another foreign buyer, in a deal requiring heightened national security scrutiny."

Global equities driftedon Tuesday while the U.S. dollar ended 2019 on a subdued note following a buoyant year of stock market gains, driven in recent weeks by hopes of an imminent U.S.-China trade deal.

In Europe, equity markets were mixed in early trading, with Britain's FTSE slipping 0.4 per cent while France's CAC was little changed in thin trading. Germany's DAX was closed.

MOMENT IN TIME
Guy Lombardo plays Auld Lang Syne for the last time
Dec. 31, 1976: For almost half a century, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians helped millions of people usher out the old year and bring in the new with their classic rendition of Auld Lang Syne, the beloved Scottish tune about the importance of cherishing lifelong friends. As a kid growing up in London, Ont., which had a large Scottish community, Lombardo had adopted the tradition of saluting the end of a year withAuld Lang Syne, a song everyone intrinsically loves but few actually know the lyrics to. When he and his band moved to New York in the late 1920s, they brought the custom with them, performing it for the first time at a New Year's concert at the Roosevelt Hotel. Thousands of New Yorkers heard the radio broadcast and loved it. Auld Lang Synebecame Lombardo's de facto theme song, earning him the nickname "Mr. New Year's Eve." In 1959, the Waldorf Astoria hotel wooed him away and, for the next 17 years, he and his Royal Canadians did a live TV broadcast from its Grand Ballroom that was seen in homes around the world. Lombardo died in November of 1977, at the age of 75. The ancient Scottish song he helped to popularize lives on, however, and still plays after the ball drops in Times Square. -Gayle MacDonald

Full text: Update: A day after Bo-Pelouse announced it was ceasing operations, volunteers mobilized to help West Island seniors get out from under 20 centimetres of snow. Tap here for the details( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/volunteers-mobilize-to-shovel-snow-for-stranded-west-island-seniors ).
With a snowstorm bearing down, thousands of West Island homeowners, many of them elderly, have been left in the lurch after one of the area's largest snow removal companies( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) has ceased operations.
Marc Guindon, the owner of Bo-Pelouse, sent an email to employees announcing the abrupt closing: "Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo-Pelouse will be ceasing its operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
Guindon had gained the trust of many customers and suppliers after operating in Pointe-Claire and Dorval for decades.
After a small snowfall before Christmas, 26 tractor drivers fuelled up at Frank Mancuso's garage on Donegani Ave., as they have done for the last 20 years. But Mancuso suspected something was amiss when Guindon failed to pay him and didn't return a phone call.
"It's very sad," said Mancuso, who owns Donegani Service Station Inc. "It's a lot of money. We have a lot of customers who are older and they paid (Bo-Pelouse) in advance. The drivers didn't know anything and a lot of them haven't been paid."
Guindon worked hard over the years and had a lot of responsibility, Mancuso said.
The Bo Pelouse offices on Monday, Dec. 30, had a notice about the holiday season, but no announcement that they're ceasing operations.
Pointe-Claire city councillor Eric Stork, a friend of Guindon's, posted Guindon's email message to staff on his Facebook page because he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-20 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
The company has about 5,500 customers in Pointe-Claire, Dorval and Beaconsfield.
Guindon could not be reached for comment.
However, on Monday afternoon, he posted a message on a website( https://www.bo-pelouse.com/ ) apologizing for letting down his customers. "For the last 4 years the company was struggling but I was always able to get it back on track." he wrote. "I was still in discussions and trying to find a solution yesterday. I have lived, participated, donated, created employment and raised my family in this community. I know that some of you are as angry and disappointed as am I."
He said rumours that he had taken money and moved abroad are false.
The sudden closure had hundreds of Guindon's customers scrambling to sign a snow removal contract with one of his competitors.
John Bradley turned up outside the company's office on Donegani Ave. after a neighbour told him that Bo-Pelouse had shut down its operations. The office was closed and there was a message posted outside saying: "We are closed for the holidays from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3. We are open during snow removal operations. Happy Holidays."
Bradley, 59, said he paid the company $275 in October to have snow cleared from his driveway in Pointe-Claire because his stepbrother has a bad back and can no longer shovel.
"I have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)," he said. "If I do anything to exert (myself), I am done."
Bradley's elderly father has colon cancer and they can't afford to pay another snow removal company because they're on a fixed income.
He said he's disappointed that he hasn't received an email or a phone call from the company.
Donald Chainey said the company has provided a good service during the three years he has been with them. He paid $175 upfront this summer to get an early bird special and fears he won't get his money back.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for a few days.
The owners of Grizzly snow removal, Bo-Pelouse's main competitor in Pointe-Claire, called in several family members Monday to handle 500 emails and hundreds of phone calls from people desperate to obtain a snow removal contract.
Alanna Roszkowski, co-owner of DLC Landscaping, which purchased Grizzly in 2017, said they were shocked by the demise of their rival. She said her husband began receiving text messages from former Bo-Pelouse drivers over the weekend.
Grizzly hopes to be able to service about 1,000 new customers in Pointe-Claire after they take care of their existing customers, she said. They have hired several Bo-Pelouse drivers and are renting tractors from a supplier on Highway 40 to do the work. It costs about $255 a year to clear a double driveway.
The owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that Bo-Pelouse was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo-Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.
"I have to take care of my own customers," said Marc-Antoine Tozzi, owner of Syljack. "After the storm, we will see what happens. We are too busy to make a move at the last minute."
However, a landscaping company called Southwest Garden and Snow, said it's preparing a service route for homeowners in western Pointe-Claire. "Please be patient, we will have a competitive price in play for the balance of the season," says a message on the firm's Facebook page.
Last winter, Bo-Pelouse made headlines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) after about 72 of the firm's driveway markers went missing in Dorval.
Norm Aubé, who owns a record store next door to Bo-Pelouse's office, said he was surprised to learn that the company has closed. He said he saw Guindon about 10 days ago and nothing seemed amiss.
"A lot of customers were very happy with the service," he said.

Full text: Most Montrealers hunkered down Monday as a snow storm of ice pellets and freezing rain blanketed the city, turning some downtown streets into rivers of slush, causing collisions on the highways and resulting in the cancellation of more than a hundred flights at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.
Environment Canada maintained a snowfall warning Monday night, forecasting two to four centimetres of snow for the Montreal area Tuesday, with winds gusting to 40 kilometres per hour. Scattered flurries are expected on New Year's Eve.
Given the nasty weather throughout Monday, many Montrealers chose to stay at home during the holiday period, with road traffic much quieter than usual.
"It's been that way all day long," said Const. Caroline Chevrefils of the Montreal Police Department.
Likewise, Urgences-Santé did not report a spike in calls, as is usually the case when streets and sidewalks become icy.
"We didn't receive that expected surge in calls," spokesperson Antoine Ortuso said. "People are probably staying at home."
Still, the city's hospital emergency rooms were busy as usual. Ste-Justine Hospital's ER was the most overcrowded as of 7:30 p.m., with an occupancy rate of 169 per cent.
Off Montreal Island, the Sûreté du Québec reported more than a dozen highway accidents, although none involving serious injuries. Provincial police urged motorists to adapt their driving to the sometimes treacherous road conditions.
Transport Quebec noted that Highways 15 and 20 were partly snow covered.
Highways 13, 15 and 440 in Laval, and Highways 10, 15, 30, 132 and 138 on the South Shore were also partly snow covered.
About 50 flights scheduled for departure at Trudeau airport were cancelled Monday morning in anticipation of the snowfall in Montreal, as well as freezing rain and snowstorms elsewhere along the eastern seaboard.
By Monday night, the arrivals and departures of dozens more flights were either delayed or cancelled.

Snow and freezing rain prompt flight cancellations in Montreal and Ottawa

Full text: An icy end to 2019 has thrown air travellers’ holiday plans into chaos, as snow and freezing rain caused the cancellation of dozens of flights in Ottawa and Montreal.
More than 70 departures were cancelled and several flights were delayed on Monday at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport amid freezing rain and snow. Marie-Claude Desgagnés, a spokeswoman for the Montreal hub, said the snowy weather in Ontario and the northeastern United States has slowed or stalled flights at the airport, Canada’s third-busiest.
Environment Canada issued a snowfall alert for Montreal and the surrounding region, warning of strong winds and saying 15 to 20 centimetres of snow could accumulate between Monday afternoon and Tuesday night. Ottawa is under a warning of freezing rain or ice pellets, hazards that could change to snow later on Monday, Environment Canada said.
Airlines and airport operators are advising travellers to call their carriers to check on the status of their flights, and to arrive at the airport well in advance of their flight to leave time for lengthy check-ins.
Krista Kealey, a spokeswoman for Ottawa International Airport, said airlines cancelled a combined 42 of 262 arrivals and departures amid freezing rain on Monday. Some flights were cancelled ahead of the storm, she said. “It’s the cumulative effect of what’s happening at other airports and the weather in other cities,” Ms. Kealey said. “The system, once it gets disrupted, there’s a ripple effect that goes through the system and it takes a while to get it back on track, but hopefully the freezing rain will stop and we can play catchup.”
Peter Fitzpatrick, an Air Canada spokesman, said freezing rain poses a greater safety risk than snow because it gets into every niche on a plane and must be melted with de-icing fluid.
The storm caused the Montreal airport to limit Air Canada to 15 flights an hour on Monday, down from the usual 36 to 40, for safety reasons, he said. This meant the carrier had to select which flights to scrub. Typically, the airline will cancel shorter flights and protect long-haul flights on larger planes to avoid inconveniencing greater numbers of holiday travellers, and will try to fly bigger jets on other routes to get as many people to their destinations as possible.
The airline also implemented its no-charge rebooking policy.
WestJet Airlines said it cancelled 33 Monday flights in Eastern Canada before the storm arrived, including three between Montreal and Toronto and one between Montreal and Calgary.
“We continue to closely monitor the system and additional cancellations and delays are possible,” said Morgan Bell, a spokeswoman for the Calgary-based airline.
In an e-mail, Sunwing Airlines said it expects delays but no cancellations because of the bad weather in Ontario and Quebec.
“As a leisure vacation provider, it’s extremely rare to cancel our flights, and we are doing everything within our control to ensure our customers’ vacations plans are not disrupted,” Sunwing said.
Travellers out of Montreal are also bracing for a possible strike on Jan. 1 by the workers who fuel the planes at Trudeau and Mirabel airports. The employees of Swissport Canada, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, on Friday rejected a tentative contract proposal.
The vote sets up a possible walkout on Wednesday.
Swissport said in a statement it is “surprised and disappointed” by the contract’s rejection.
“Travellers, customers, stakeholders and airport authorities can rest assured that our team will dedicate every effort to reach an agreement and continue the refuelling service during this busy period as we go back to the negotiation table,” Swissport said.

Full text: An icy end to 2019 has thrown air travellers' holiday plans into chaos, as snow and freezing rain caused the cancellation of dozens of flights in Ottawa and Montreal.
More than 70 departures were cancelled and several flights were delayed on Monday at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport amid freezing rain and snow. Marie-Claude Desgagnés, a spokeswoman for the Montreal hub, said the snowy weather in Ontario and the northeastern United States has slowed or stalled flights at the airport, Canada's third-busiest.
Environment Canada issued a snowfall alert for Montreal and the surrounding region, warning of strong winds and saying 15 to 20 centimetres of snow could accumulate between Monday afternoon and Tuesday night. Ottawa is under a warning of freezing rain or ice pellets, hazards that could change to snow later on Monday, Environment Canada said.
Airlines and airport operators are advising travellers to call their carriers to check on the status of their flights, and to arrive at the airport well in advance of their flight to leave time for lengthy check-ins.
Krista Kealey, a spokeswoman for Ottawa International Airport, said airlines cancelled a combined 42 of 262 arrivals and departures amid freezing rain on Monday. Some flights were cancelled ahead of the storm, she said. "It's the cumulative effect of what's happening at other airports and the weather in other cities," Ms. Kealey said. "The system, once it gets disrupted, there's a ripple effect that goes through the system and it takes a while to get it back on track, but hopefully the freezing rain will stop and we can play catch-up."
Peter Fitzpatrick, an Air Canada spokesman, said freezing rain poses a greater safety risk than snow because it gets into every niche on a plane and must be melted with de-icing fluid.
The storm caused the Montreal airport to limit Air Canada to 15 flights an hour on Monday, down from the usual 36 to 40, for safety reasons, he said. This meant the carrier had to select which flights to scrub. Typically, the airline will cancel shorter flights and protect long-haul flights on larger planes to avoid inconveniencing greater numbers of holiday travellers, and will try to fly bigger jets on other routes to get as many people to their destinations as possible. The airline also implemented its no-charge rebooking policy.
WestJet Airlines said it cancelled 33 Monday flights in Eastern Canada before the storm arrived, including three between Montreal and Toronto and one between Montreal and Calgary. "We continue to closely monitor the system and additional cancellations and delays are possible," said Morgan Bell, a spokeswoman for the Calgary-based airline.
In an e-mail, Sunwing Airlines said it expects delays but no cancellations because of the bad weather in Ontario and Quebec. "As a leisure vacation provider, it's extremely rare to cancel our flights, and we are doing everything within our control to ensure our customers' vacations plans are not disrupted," Sunwing said.
Travellers out of Montreal are also bracing for a possible strike on Jan. 1 by the workers who fuel the planes at Trudeau and Mirabel airports. The employees of Swissport Canada, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, on Friday rejected a tentative contract proposal. The vote sets up a possible walkout on Wednesday.
Swissport said in a statement it is "surprised and disappointed" by the contract's rejection. "Travellers, customers, stakeholders and airport authorities can rest assured that our team will dedicate every effort to reach an agreement and continue the refuelling service during this busy period as we go back to the negotiation table," Swissport said.

Full text: With a snowstorm bearing down on Montreal, thousands of West Island homeowners, many of them elderly, have been left in the lurch after one of the area's largest snow removal companies( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) has ceased operations.
Marc Guindon, the owner of Bo-Pelouse, sent an email to employees announcing the abrupt closing: "Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo-Pelouse will be ceasing its operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
Guindon had gained the trust of many customers and suppliers after operating in Pointe-Claire and Dorval for decades.
After a small snowfall before Christmas, 26 tractor drivers fuelled up at Frank Mancuso's garage on Donegani Ave., as they have done for the last 20 years. But Mancuso suspected something was amiss when Guindon failed to pay him and didn't return a phone call.
"It's very sad," said Mancuso, who owns Donegani Service Station Inc. "It's a lot of money. We have a lot of customers who are older and they paid (Bo-Pelouse) in advance. The drivers didn't know anything and a lot of them haven't been paid."
Guindon worked hard over the years and had a lot of responsibility, Mancuso said.
The Bo Pelouse offices on Monday, Dec. 30, had a notice about the holiday season, but no announcement that they're ceasing operations.
Pointe-Claire city councillor Eric Stork, a friend of Guindon's, posted Guindon's email message to staff on his Facebook page because he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-20 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
The company has about 5,500 customers in Pointe-Claire, Dorval and Beaconsfield.
Guindon could not be reached for comment.
However, on Monday afternoon, he posted a message on a website( https://www.bo-pelouse.com/ ) apologizing for letting down his customers. "For the last 4 years the company was struggling but I was always able to get it back on track." he wrote. "I was still in discussions and trying to find a solution yesterday. I have lived, participated, donated, created employment and raised my family in this community. I know that some of you are as angry and disappointed as am I."
He said rumours that he had taken money and moved abroad are false.
The sudden closure had hundreds of Guindon's customers scrambling to sign a snow removal contract with one of his competitors.
John Bradley turned up outside the company's office on Donegani Ave. after a neighbour told him that Bo-Pelouse had shut down its operations. The office was closed and there was a message posted outside saying: "We are closed for the holidays from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3. We are open during snow removal operations. Happy Holidays."
Bradley, 59, said he paid the company $275 in October to have snow cleared from his driveway in Pointe-Claire because his stepbrother has a bad back and can no longer shovel.
"I have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)," he said. "If I do anything to exert (myself), I am done."
Bradley's elderly father has colon cancer and they can't afford to pay another snow removal company because they're on a fixed income.
He said he's disappointed that he hasn't received an email or a phone call from the company.
Donald Chainey said the company has provided a good service during the three years he has been with them. He paid $175 upfront this summer to get an early bird special and fears he won't get his money back.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for a few days.
The owners of Grizzly snow removal, Bo-Pelouse's main competitor in Pointe-Claire, called in several family members Monday to handle 500 emails and hundreds of phone calls from people desperate to obtain a snow removal contract.
Alanna Roszkowski, co-owner of DLC Landscaping, which purchased Grizzly in 2017, said they were shocked by the demise of their rival. She said her husband began receiving text messages from former Bo-Pelouse drivers over the weekend.
Grizzly hopes to be able to service about 1,000 new customers in Pointe-Claire after they take care of their existing customers, she said. They have hired several Bo-Pelouse drivers and are renting tractors from a supplier on Highway 40 to do the work. It costs about $255 a year to clear a double driveway.
The owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that Bo-Pelouse was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo-Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.
"I have to take care of my own customers," said Marc-Antoine Tozzi, owner of Syljack. "After the storm, we will see what happens. We are too busy to make a move at the last minute."
However, a landscaping company called Southwest Garden and Snow, said it's preparing a service route for homeowners in western Pointe-Claire. "Please be patient, we will have a competitive price in play for the balance of the season," says a message on the firm's Facebook page.
Last winter, Bo-Pelouse made headlines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) after about 72 of the firm's driveway markers went missing in Dorval.
Norm Aubé, who owns a record store next door to Bo-Pelouse's office, said he was surprised to learn that the company has closed. He said he saw Guindon about 10 days ago and nothing seemed amiss.
"A lot of customers were very happy with the service," he said.

Marc Guindon, the owner of Bo-Pelouse, sent an email to employees announcing the abrupt closing: "Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo-Pelouse will be ceasing its operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
Guindon had gained the trust of many customers and suppliers after operating in Pointe Claire and Dorval for decades.
After a small snowfall before Christmas, 26 tractor drivers fuelled up at Frank Mancuso's garage on Donegani Ave., as they have done for the last 20 years. But Mancuso suspected something was amiss when Guindon failed to pay him and didn't return a phone call.
"It's very sad," said Mancuso, who owns Donegani Service Station Inc. "It's a lot of money. We have a lot of customers who are older and they paid in advance. The drivers didn't know anything and a lot of them haven't haven't been paid."
Guindon worked hard over the years and had a lot of responsibility, Mancuso said.
The Bo Pelouse offices on Monday Dec. 30, 2019 had a notice about the holiday season, but no announcement that they're ceasing operations.
Pointe Claire city councillor Eric Stork, a friend of Guindon's, posted Guindon's e-mail message to staff on his Facebook page because he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-20 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
Bo-Pelouse's website has been taken down and the voicemail inbox is full. Guindon could not be reached for comment. The company has about 5,500 customers in Pointe Claire, Dorval and Beaconsfield.
Hundreds of West Island residents were scrambling on Monday to try and sign up with one of Guindon's competitors. Others posted their frustrations on Facebook.
John Bradley turned up outside the company's office on Donegani Ave. after a neighbour told him that Bo-Pelouse had shut down its operations. The office was closed and there was a message posted outside saying: "We are closed for the holidays from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3. We are open during snow removal operations. Happy Holidays."
Bradley, 59, said he paid the company $275 in October to have snow cleared from his driveway in Pointe Claire because his step-brother has a bad back and can no longer shovel.
"I have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)," he said. "If I do anything to exert (myself), I am done."
Bradley's elderly father has colon cancer and they and can't afford to pay another snow removal company because they're on a fixed income.
He said he's disappointed that he hasn't received an email or a phone call from the company.
Donald Chainey said the company has provided a good service during the three years he has been with them. He paid $175 upfront this summer to get an early bird special and fears he won't get his money back.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for a few days.
The owners of Grizzly snow removal, Bo-Pelouse's main competitor in Pointe Claire, called in several family members Monday to handle 500 emails and hundreds of phone calls from people desperate to obtain a snow removal contract.
Alanna Roszkowski, co-owner of DLC Landscaping, which purchased Grizzly in 2017, said they were shocked by the demise of their rivals. She said her husband began receiving text messages from former Bo-Pelouse drivers over the weekend.
Grizzly hopes to able to service about 1,000 new customers in Pointe Claire after they take care of their existing customers, she said. They have hired several Bo-Pelouse drivers and are renting tractors from a supplier on Highway 40 to do the work. It costs about $255 to clear a double driveway.
The owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that Bo-Pelouse was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.
"I have to take care of my own customers," said Marc-Antoine Tozzi, owner of Slyjack. "After the storm, we will see what happens. We are too busy to make a move at the last minute."
However, a landscaping company called Southwest Garden and Snow, said it's preparing a service route for homeowners in western Pointe Claire. "Please be patient, we will have a competitive price in play for the balance of the season," says a message on the firm's Facebook page.
Last winter, Bo Pelouse made headlines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) after about 72 of the firm's driveway markers went missing in Dorval.
Norm Aubé, who owns a record store next door to Bo-Pelouse's office, said he was surprised to learn that the company has closed. He said he saw the Guindon about 10 days ago and nothing seemed amiss.
"A lot of customers were very happy with the service," he said.

Full text: About 50 flights scheduled to leave Montreal-Trudeau airport in Montreal were cancelled Monday morning in anticipation of a major snowfall here and freezing rain and snowstorms elsewhere along the Eastern Seaboard.
Meanwhile, Jean-Lesage airport in Quebec City had cancelled four flights.
The cancellations are the first signs of a rough day in store for commuters and travellers, as 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected to fall between Monday afternoon and Tuesday night in the Montreal and Quebec City areas.
By 10:30 a.m. the Sûreté du Québec was calling for caution on area highways after freezing rain began to fall over the Montreal area, urging motorists to adapt their driving to the road conditions.
About 90 minutes after that warning from provincial police, that precipitation was followed by snow and the freezing ran warning lifted.
Transport Quebec was reporting that road surfaces were beginning be covered on Highways 15 and 20 on the island of Montreal, Highways 13, 15 and 440 in Laval and on Highways 10, 15, 30, 132 and 138 on the South Shore.
Environment Canada also warns( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1911592041984294974201912290504ww1070cwul ) that strong wind gusts will also be a part of Montreal's weather cocktail, potentially causing white outs and reducing visibility on local roads and highways.
At 9 a.m., Environment Canada added a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1834404071984294974201912290504ww1070cwul ) to the snowfall warning it had already issued for the Montreal area.
Monday's forecast( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-747p ) calls for cloudy skies with snow at times mixed with ice pellets beginning in the morning morning. There is a risk of freezing rain and a 10 cm. accumulation of snow and ice pellets. The forecast high of minus 2 C. and a wind chill of minus 12.
This evening's forecast calls for another 10 cm. of snow, a temperature of minus 2 C. and a wind chill of minus 9 C.

Full text: With a major snowstorm bearing down on Montreal, thousands of West Island homeowners have been left in the lurch after one of the area's largest snow removal companies( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) has ceased operations.
The owner of Bo Pelouse, which has been operating in Pointe Claire and Dorval for decades, sent an email to his employees announcing the company was going out of business.
"Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo Pelouse will be ceasing it's operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
The message was sent by owner Marc Guidon and posted on the Facebook page of Pointe Claire city councillor Eric Stork.
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-25 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
Stork, who is a customer of Guidon's, said he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
The company's website has been taken down and the voicemail inbox is full. Guidon could not be reached for comment. The company has about 5,500 customers in Pointe Claire, Dorval and Beaconsfield.
Several West Island residents were scrambling on Monday to try and sign up with one of Guidon's competitors. Others posted their frustrations on Facebook.
John Bradley turned up outside the company's office on Donegani Ave. after a neighbour told him that Bo Pelouse had shut down its operations. The office was closed and there was a message posted outside saying: "We are closed for the holidays from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3. We are open during snow removal operations. Happy Holidays."
Bradley, 59, said he paid the company $275 in October to have snow cleared from his driveway in Pointe Claire because his step-brother has a bad back and can no longer shovel.
"I have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)," he said. "If I do anything to exert (myself), I am done."
Bradley's elderly father has colon cancer and they and can't afford to pay another snow removal company because they're on a fixed income.
He said he is disappointed that he hasn't received an email or a phone call from the company.
Donald Chainey said the company has provided a good service during the three years he has been with them. He paid $175 upfront this summer to get an early bird special and is worried that he won't get his money back.
Chainey noted that the Bo Pelouse usually parks its trucks on the property of a local garage, but he said they have been moved.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for several days. The owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that the company was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he's following the situation closely, but said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.

Full text: About 50 flights scheduled to leave Montreal-Trudeau airport in Montreal were cancelled Monday morning in anticipation of a major snowfall here and freezing rain and snowstorms elsewhere along the Eastern Seaboard.
Meanwhile, Jean-Lesage airport in Quebec City had cancelled four flights.
The cancellations are the first signs of a rough day in store for commuters and travellers, as 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected to fall between Monday afternoon and Tuesday night in the Montreal and Quebec City areas.
By 10:30 a.m. the Sûreté du Québec was calling for caution on area highways after freezing rain began to fall over the Montreal area, urging motorists to adapt their driving to the road conditions.
About 90 minutes later that precipitation was followed by snow.
Transport Quebec was reporting that road surfaces were beginning be covered on Highways 15 and 20 on the island of Montreal, Highways 13, 15 and 440 in Laval and on Highways 10, 15, 30, 132 and 138 on the South Shore.
Environment Canada also warns( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1911592041984294974201912290504ww1070cwul ) that strong wind gusts will also be a part of Montreal's weather cocktail, potentially causing white outs and reducing visibility on local roads and highways.
At 9 a.m., Environment Canada added a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1834404071984294974201912290504ww1070cwul ) to the snowfall warning it had already issued for the Montreal area.
Monday's forecast( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-747p ) calls for cloudy skies with snow at times mixed with ice pellets beginning in the morning morning. There is a risk of freezing rain and a 10 cm. accumulation of snow and ice pellets. The forecast high of minus 2 C. and a wind chill of minus 12.
This evening's forecast calls for another 10 cm. of snow, a temperature of minus 2 C. and a wind chill of minus 9 C.

Longtime West Island snow removal contractor goes out of business

Full text: With a major snowstorm bearing down on Montreal, thousands of West Island homeowners have been left in the lurch after one of the area's largest snow removal companies( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) has ceased operations.
The owner of Bo Pelouse, which has been operating in Pointe Claire and Dorval for decades, sent an email to his employees announcing the company was going out of business.
"Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo Pelouse will be ceasing it's operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
The message was sent by owner Marc Guidon and posted on the Facebook page of Pointe Claire city councillor Eric Stork.
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-25 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
Stork, who is a customer of Guidon's, said he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
The company's website has been taken down and the voicemail inbox is full. Guidon could not be reached for comment.
Several West Island residents were scrambling on Monday to try and sign up with one of Guidon's competitors. Others posted their frustrations on Facebook.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for a couple of weeks. Over the past few days, the owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that the company was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he's following the situation closely, but said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.
"I have to take care of my own customers," said Marc-Antoine Tozzy, owner of Slyjack. "After the storm, we will see what happens." He suggested that homeowners who need their driveways plowed contact his company after the storm. "We are too busy to make a move at the last minute," he said.
Bo Pelouse has between 5,000 and 6,000 customers in Pointe Claire and Beaconsfield, Tozzy estimated.
However, a landscaping company called Southwest Garden and Snow said it's preparing a service route for homeowners in western Pointe Claire. "Please be patient, we will have a competitive price in play for the balance of the season," says a message of the firm's Facebook page.
Last winter, Bo Pelouse made headlines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) after about 72 of the firm's driveway markers went missing in Dorval.
This story will be updated.

Full text: Anyone in Montreal who complained about not having a white Christmas can expect to be rewarded with plenty of snow on Monday.
Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning, saying the Montreal area, including Laval, Longueuil and Châteauguay, might receive up to 20 centimetres of snow.
"Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 centimetres are expected beginning Monday afternoon into Tuesday afternoon," Environment Canada noted in the statement posted on its website Sunday afternoon. "Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations."
The temperature for Monday is expected to hover around minus 2 Celsius for most of the day.

Full text: Anyone in Montreal who complained about not having a white Christmas can expect to be rewarded with lousy weather on Monday.
Environment Canada has issued a statement saying the Montreal area, including Laval, Longueuil and Châteauguay, might receive up to 25 centimetres of snow.
"An intense low-pressure system will reach the Great Lakes Monday and bring a mixed bag of snow and ice pellets over southwestern Quebec. Snowfall amounts could approach 15 to 25 centimetres," Environment Canada noted in the statement posted on its website.
It also forecasts that strong easterly winds will blow the snow around as it falls. Some of the precipitation could come down as freezing rain, especially in parts of southern Quebec at the Ontario border. It is the type of precipitation that makes roadways messy, so Environment Canada advises motorists to leave earlier than they would otherwise and to avoid non-essential travel.
But the weather service also stated that the low-pressure system is difficult to track and that estimates on how much rain or snow will fall could change.
The temperature for Monday is expected to hover around -2 C for most of the day.
Snow is expected to fall in the Montreal area on Tuesday as well.

Full text: As Environment Canada on Friday morning extended its freezing rain warnings across eastern Quebec, at least 17 Montreal and Laval residents found themselves seeking help from first responders after slipping on icy sidewalks and secondary streets.
"Since early this morning we've seen an increase in the number of calls for people who took a fall because of the freezing rain," said Urgences Santé spokesperson Stéphane Smith. "We've also seen an increase in the number of calls for people involved in minor automobile accidents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) linked to the weather."
As of 10:30 a.m. a total of 17 calls for falls on ice-covered sidewalks and thoroughfares had been received by Urgences Santé in its patrol territory. "When you consider it's a Friday and a lot of people have the day off, that's more than usual( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/slip-sliding-away-and-breaking-bones-on-montreals-icy-sidewalks )," said Smith. "If you can avoid going out today, that would be a good idea."
Montreal police spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant said that as of Friday morning his department had received just one call concerning an accident involving no injuries but demonstrably caused by the weather: a car in Dollard-des-Ormeaux slid into a low wall.
A visually impaired elderly man uses his white cane to follow the tire path on 5th Ave. in Verdun. The sidewalks were covered in ice Dec. 27, 2019.
"The sidewalks are the worst part of it," said Brabant. "The primary roads and highways are in pretty good shape. But the side streets and sidewalks are really slippery and you have to be cautious out there."
The Sûreté du Québec was reporting no major accidents on the highways in regions affected by the freezing rain alerts.
In Abitibi-Témiscamingue the freezing rain had turned into rain by Friday morning but road conditions on Highways 117 and 111 remained treacherous.
In the area surrounding Montreal Island, road conditions have improved since Thursday night and while roads were wet, visibility was good.
However, Highway 30 remained icy in the region of Sorel-Tracy, Transport Quebec reported.
Further east along the St. Lawrence Valley, freezing rain is expected to continue over the course of the day and Environment Canada maintained or extended its warning for Saint-Jérôme, Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Mont-Tremblant, Maniwaki, Mont-Laurier, Joliette, Trois-Rivières, La Tuque, Saguenay, Québec, Victoriaville, Thetford Mines, Saint-Georges, Montmagny, Rivière-du-Loup, Trois-Pistoles, La Malbaie and Tadoussac.

Full text: A freezing rain warning that covers the Montreal and Laval regions was issued by Environment Canada Thursday.
Up to five millimetres of rain and freezing drizzle are forecast for Thursday night beginning in the Lower Laurentians and Montreal. The freezing precipitation is expected to turn to rain showers on Friday, though more dangerous conditions could persist in central Quebec and the Saguenay area.
Environment Canada issues warnings when freezing rain has the potential to create a dangerous buildup of ice, and urges caution for those who must walk or drive.
The forecast high for the Montreal area on Friday is 5 degrees Celsius, and should remain above zero until Sunday.

Spring flooding was Quebec's major weather event of 2019

Full text: Spring flooding that disrupted thousands of lives was the major weather event in Quebec in 2019, not only because of the scale of the flooding, but for its after-effects, some of which are still being felt today.
A catastrophic convergence of heavy rains following a snowy and cold winter that prevented run-off from being soaked into the ground led to the forced evacuation of thousands of Quebecers across the province. Water levels were high enough to force the evacuation in April of the town of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge when it seemed a local dam would not hold. The event reached its peak when, on April 27, a sector of the town of Ste-Marthe-sur-le-Lac was evacuated after a dike broke. The Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) reported claims from damage linked to the flooding in Quebec totalled $185 million.
Pierrefonds resident Nicolas D'Alessandro walked down to the Rivière des Prairies in the Pierrefonds area of Montreal on Saturday, April 27, 2019, to monitor the flooding situation. His residence was not immediately in peril.
In total, 310 municipalities across Quebec were affected by the flooding. While the province's public security ministry has yet to compile all the statistics recorded in the towns damaged or disrupted by the floodwaters, te Presse Canadienne calculated on April 30 that 9,070 homes and 273 businesses were flooded, more than 12,000 persons displaced, 82 landslides linked to the flooding were recorded and 760 roads and highways were washed out or damaged.
Figures compiled by the province's civil protection authorities show 7,500 claims for compensation were filed with the government with $211 million paid out to claimants as of Dec. 9. About half of the claims have been settled.

In Laval and the regions of the Laurentians and Lanaudière, the floods followed an episode of freezing rain at the beginning of April that dropped 20 mms of precipitation in those areas, the same low-pressure system also dropping 15 to 25 cms of snow between between the Abitibi and Beauce regions. The weather system also saw about 310,000 Hydro-Québec customers lose their electricity, some of them for three days.
The second-place weather event occurred at the end of October, the so-called "Halloween" storms because the threat of heavy rain and high winds caused Montreal and several other municipalities to urge parents to postpone their children's trick or treating until Nov. 1( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/josh-freed-weather-hysteria-ruined-montreals-halloween ).
N.D.G. resident Keith Wilson is wondering what kind of turnout there will be for this year's Halloween in Montreal on Thursday, Oct. 31, 2019.
A strong cold front dumped 40 to 60 mms of rain across the province, with some areas seeing as much as 80 to 110 mm, courtesy of regional deluges that caused flooding in the Eastern Townships and in the Chaudière-Appalaches regions. However, the weather event's real punch was in wind gusts over 100 km/h that knocked out power to nearly one million Hydro-Québec customers, the biggest outage since the Ice Storm of 1998. The IBC reported $250 million in claims were made in eastern Canada because of the weather system, $189 million of it in Quebec.
The start of 2019 was also marked by heavy snowfalls, with 25 to 40 cms falling across the province on Feb. 13, accompanied by wind gusts that led to white-outs in many parts of the province. Schools and roads were closed, flights delayed or cancelled and mail delivery stopped for the day.

Only a few weeks earlier, between Jan. 20-22, about 20 to 50 cms of snow fell in many regions of Quebec in a weather system marked by high winds and exceptionally cold temperatures that contributed to several multi-car accidents across the province. And the winter of 2019-2020 is shaping up to be equally demanding, with 15 to 25 cms of snow falling on Nov. 11, an early start to the snow season that caught many motorists still driving on all-season tires( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/after-early-storm-montreal-starts-snow-removal-operations-wednesday ). The weather system was also punctuated by wild swings in temperature that broke records for maximums and minimums across the province.

Quebec came close to recording its first tornados of the year on June 2, when two of them touched down near Ottawa with one of the twisters causing severe damage in the Orléans district in Ottawa. But the first tornado to strike the province did so on July 11, when a string of storms rampaged across Quebec in a front that stretched from Chibougamau to Toronto. An F1 tornado (138-178 km/h winds) touched down in the Lanaudière region and carved a trail of damage through 3 kilometres of trees, buildings and a campsite. Neighbouring regions were battered by heavy rains and wind gusts that left 100,000 Hydro-Québec customers without power.

On July 30, a second F1 tornado touched down at a camp site in Lac-aux-Sables in the Mauricie region that left three persons slightly injured. The third F1 tornado was recorded Aug. 21 near Mont-Laurier that caused some material damage, followed by an F2 tornado (179 to 218 km/h) that hit the small town of Ste-Rose-de-Waterford, devastating 20,000 maple trees in orchards cultivated by local syrup producers.

Pop icon Céline Dion ended her 16-year residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in June. But if there is another city that could host a residency, it is surely Montreal, in Dion's hometown province.
Monday night, Dion - fully recovered from a throat virus that forced her to reschedule the Montreal concerts on her Courage World Tour( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/celine-dions-courage-tour-and-album-marks-beautiful-new-chapter ) - headlined the first of six highly anticipated concerts at the Bell Centre. Full concert review here( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/celine-dion-at-the-bell-centre-it-feels-so-good-to-be-home ).

Full text: After days of threatening snow and freezing rain, the slippery weather arrived Tuesday morning.
A freezing rain warning was issued by Environment Canada, which forecast two to five millimetres of freezing precipitation during the morning. The warning covers Montreal, Laval and Longueuil-Varennes. Similar warnings were issued for several parts of southern Quebec, including the Eastern Townships and Lanaudière.
Icy roads make school-bus travel more dangerous. Some school boards cancelled classes and daycare service for the day, including the Eastern Townships School Board, the Commission scolaire de Saint-Hyachinthe, Commission scolaire des Hautes-Rivières and Commission scolaire Val-des-Cerfs.
Ugences-santé said Tuesday morning that it was experiencing a high volume of calls and encouraged citizens to get themselves to clinics if they were not in danger. The 811 phone line is available 24 hours a day, allowing people to speak with a nurse.
Nous recevons un très haut volume d'appels à la suite de la pluie verglaçante. Si vous pouvez vous rendre par vous-même à la clinique ou si votre vie n'est pas en danger, appelez plutôt le 8-1-1 pour parler à une infirmière compétente qui pourra vous guider.
- Urgences-santé (@Urgences_sante) November 19, 2019( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/1196781667496726528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
The temperature was expected to hover around minus-1 Celsius most of Tuesday, with flurries in the late morning that were expected to taper off by evening. Wednesday and Thursday were forecast to hit the freezing mark, with rain and a high of 6 C expected by Friday.

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning of a mixed bag of precipitation( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#101738801593906667201911160504ws1070cwul ) over southern Quebec starting Sunday, including freezing rain by Monday afternoon.
The warning for the areas in and around Châteauguay-La Prairie, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and the island of Montreal blames the incoming heavy weather on a low-pressure system tracking up from the U.S. eastern seaboard starting Sunday. Freezing rain is expected Monday afternoon or evening, changing to snow overnight.
"Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant over several areas Monday and make roads and other surfaces very slippery," the statement read, adding, "The exact track of this system remains uncertain, which may influence areas at risk. Further details will be provided in future forecasts."

Rain washes out Oct. 31 Halloween celebrations in some Quebec towns

Full text: With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least seven Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the cities of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes ,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes )Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ), St-Lambert, Mont-St-Hilaire and St-Colomban are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante joined the chorus. "Weather advisory: I invite little and big Montrealers to have Halloween on Friday because of the rain and strong winds announced tomorrow," Plante said via Twitter.
Avis météo: j'invite les petits et grands Montréalais.e.s à passer l'#Halloween( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halloween?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) vendredi en raison de la pluie et des vents violents annoncés demain. Nos services seront au rendez-vous, et faites preuve de prudence comme à l'habitude.

As of 3 p.m., the city of Montreal has not asked residents to postpone Halloween.
But in Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 mm, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.

Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upwards of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.

Full text: With torrential rain and high winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least five Quebec municipalities are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the towns of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) and Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ) are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.
As of 12:30 p.m., the city of Montreal has not asked residents to postpone Halloween.
But in Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 mm, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said. The town of Mont-St-Hilaire is also postponing celebrations.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.

More rain expected to hit flood zones: With new evacuation orders in place, Ottawa plans provincial talks on solutions to recurring climate problem

Full text: Up to 40 millimetres of rain is expected to drench flood zones in Quebec and Ontario by the weekend, slowing the retreat of floodwaters and testing the resilience of weary residents.
While people in some communities began returning to waterdamaged homes on Wednesday, others were responding to new evacuation orders. The Quebec municipality of Pontiac, northwest of Ottawa, ordered about 20 residents out of their houses as the waters of the Ottawa River reached citizens' doors. It brought the number of people pushed from their homes to 500.
"For some people, all they have is their home and what's inside it, and we're asking them to leave," Pontiac Fire Chief Richard Groulx said. "You have to empathize with them. For them, it's a nightmare."
An overview of April's weather helps explain how spring spawned a flooding disaster for several communities from Ottawa to Montreal.
A snowy winter with below-average temperatures meant about twice the normal average amount of snow was still on the ground in mid-April, according to Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
Then, temperatures began to warm, remaining above freezing day and night.
Finally, rain was falling every two or three days by mid-month.
Montreal alone had 128 mm in April, while it usually gets 82 mm.
"We had ideal conditions for a catastrophe," Mr. Cantin said.
With rain falling in parts of the flood zone on Wednesday and more forecast for Friday, hopes for a quick respite dimmed.
The Trudeau government said it wants to meet with the provinces to find solutions to the recurring problem.
"We'll have to think about where we build and how we build," said federal Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne.
"Because one thing is clear: ... Climate change is real and the intensity and frequency of events is becoming evident to every Canadian who is watching the news," Mr. Champagne said in Ottawa.
"Either you invest in adaptation - otherwise you'll have to spend on remediation year after year."
He said he wants to channel federal infrastructure funds faster to cities and provinces seeking to invest in adaptation measures.
On the ground, residents who witnessed floods in 2017 have an exhausting sense of deja vu.
"It's worse this time. It looks like a ghost town around here. No one's walking the street, there are no dogs, nothing," Cheryl Nolan, 60, said from the Quebec village of Quyon, which is part of Pontiac.
Ms. Nolan recalls springtime flooding in her youth that required residents to take to canoes to navigate the streets. But water levels never reached homes like they have this year.
"It's a bit scary to think the water could come up this high. There are more houses being destroyed this year," said Ms. Nolan, a lifelong village resident.
Meanwhile, other communities have begun dealing with the aftermath of disaster. In SainteMarthe-sur-le-Lac, northwest of Montreal, some of the 6,000 residents ordered to leave after a dike broke on Saturday returned to houses filled with mud-covered detritus and plates of food abandoned during rushed evacuations.
In all, more than 10,000 people remained out of their homes in Quebec on Wednesday, and 7,000 residences were flooded.
Threats remained in parts of Ontario. On Tuesday, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority issued a water safety notice for rivers and streams as well as a hazard warning for the Lake Ontario shoreline. The city's rivers and streams are not expected to flood, but rising Lake Ontario water levels are showing early impact signs on both lake and river shorelines, including pooling on beaches and parks. Shorelines, rivers and streams within the GTA should be "considered hazardous," according to the TRCA.
Peak levels do not typically occur until late May or early June.
"We do know that the water level is going to continue to rise," said TRCA spokesperson Rehana Rajabali. "Whether or not they actually reach those same levels [as] in 2017 will really depend on how the next couple of weeks play out."
Preventive measures are under way at Toronto Island, city spokesperson Brad Ross said in an e-mailed statement, including pre-pumping of low-lying areas.
Two hundred feet of aqua dam and 20 industrial water pumps are all in place, and sand bags have been prepositioned for easy deployment to prevent a repeat of 2017, when the popular tourist spot was closed for three months owing to flooding.
Because of work done since then, including upgrading the ferry dock infrastructure, "staff anticipate that normal operations will continue," he said.
Mississauga also warned of rising lake levels on Wednesday. It asked residents to stay away from the waterfront, particularly parks and trails. The city has closed access to several parks, the Marina Park boat launch and the Lakeshore Road pedestrian underpass.
In Muskoka, the town of Bracebridge declared a state of emergency last week. The municipality said on Wednesday in a news release that the number of Canadian soldiers assisting in relief efforts doubled on Tuesday to 200.
The release also said Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark was activating the Disaster Recovery Assistance for Ontarians program to help Bracebridge residents with basic cost recovery related to flood expenses.

Climate change is costing Hydro-Québec millions, director-general says

Full text: It seems that ecologists are not the only ones concerned by climate change - their worries are shared by the man in charge of Hydro-Québec.
In an interview with the Presse Canadienne, Hydro-Québec president Éric Martel( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bonuses-increase-by-13-per-cent-at-hydro-quebec-reach-29-3-million ) said he was "very worried by climate change, to be honest," if only because the vagaries of nature and weather are costing the Crown corporation millions.
Overtime claims last year at Hydro-Québec reached $165 million, boosted by severe storms and the subsequent hours spent dealing with 24,478 power failures - an increase of 4,500 compared with 2017. That's four times as many incidents as in the 1980s.
"It's clear that climate change is having an impact on our business," said Martel, who is speaking up at a moment when the issue of climate change is becoming a major topic of public concern. Almost daily, pressure is building on the Legault government to do more to fight greenhouse gas emissions.
Martel suggests that the social costs of climate change are simply going to increase. He cites as an example the cost of tree maintenance for Hydro-Québec. Given that trees are growing more quickly, those costs have jumped from $65 million to $73 million in the space of one year - a spike of about 15 per cent.
"Since 2000, a tree in Montreal grows about five inches a year, and the vegetation is growing more quickly," said Martel. "These changes were once occurring over the space of millennia, now its happening in 18 to 19 years. That's why we're asking for increases to the Energy Board budget."
The utility describes itself as being "in action" on the issue of climate change. Besides seeking more funding for the increased costs, Hydro-Québec has hired about a dozen meteorologists to examine such weather phenomena as freezing rain, which paralyzes some regions of Quebec.
"What kind of precipitation will we be seeing in the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years? Will we be seeing more or less?" asks Martel, who adds he has no idea what the long-term effects will be on the utility's equipment. "Our transformers, for example, will they last as long? Will the equipment in our stations become more vulnerable if there's freezing rain more often?"
Martel cites the flooding seasons( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) as creating problems for his employees, who are required to monitor the rate of snow melt and the water levels of each river. Hydro-Québec fills its reservoirs when needed, the installations allowing water levels and flow rates to be controlled.
Without Hydro-Québec's water controls, the floods of 2017 would have been far worse, Martel said, noting that those who were flooded in the south of the province would have "easily had an extra metre more."
"There would have been a lot more people flooded."

Full text: Tens of thousands of Quebecers found themselves on Wednesday morning with heat, light and electric power after spending more than a day without any of it( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ) as Hydro-Québec repair crews continued to repair the damage done to its power grid Monday by freezing rain and high winds.
As of 10 a.m., the utility reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) a little more than 108,000 homes and businesses without power and in the dark - including 39,354 in the Lanaudière region, 39,599 in the Laurentians and 28,476 in Laval (28,476) - in the wake of a series of freezing rain showers and high winds that at, its height, left 313,000 clients in the dark.
But even though Hydro-Québec hopes to have nearly all of its clients back in the network sometime Wednesday, the utility, which has deployed 500 repair crews in the region, warned that some zones further from urban centres might have to wait until Thursday before the grid was completely operational.
Despite the fact nearly 30,000 clients were still without power in Laval, overnight repairs succeeded in returning 60,000 homes and businesses - as well as the city's police station - to the grid.
Officials in Laval said Tuesday that police were patrolling the city as phone service was down in some neighbourhoods. Sylvain Gariepy, operations chief for the Laval fire department, said firefighters went door-to-door to check on seniors and other vulnerable people.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged families and neighbours to look out for one another. "If you have members of your family - parents, brothers, sisters - who are in a zone that's lacking electricity, check in on their situation to make sure we're not forgetting someone in distress," Demers said.
Gariepy warned people of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning from barbecues and generators. Four adults and five children were taken to hospital in three separate cases after using barbecues indoors or having generators too close to their homes.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide in the homes in each case, but no major injuries were reported.
"Another family was taken to the hospital today - three children and a mother," Gariepy said Tuesday afternoon. "The problem we're dealing with is people are putting barbecues in their house to heat or eat, they're using propane stoves or putting generators too close to the house."
The city of Laval opened up two community centres for residents needing a place to stay warm, charge phones or have a shower. About 130 people were staying at the two temporary shelters.
Despite that progress the Commission scolaire de Laval (CSDL) said its elementary and secondary schools would remain closed on Wednesday, although some professional training centres would remain open.
The Commission scolaire des Affluents in the Lanaudière will also keep its schools closed on Wednesday.
The Sûreté du Québec reported that Tuesday night's snow flurries caused several vehicles to skid off the road but no serious injuries were reported.
On westbound Highway 30 near St-Constant, nine vehicles - two tractor trailers, a cement mixer and six cars - were involved in a chain collision that saw six person taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Sunshine to return after snowfall; Double-digit high expected Friday

Full text: There is sun at the end of the snowswept tunnel.
After several weeks of see-sawing temperatures, full-fledged winter returned on Tuesday and was expected to dump up to 10 centimetres of snow on Montreal.
That's nowhere near a record. On April 9, 2000, Montrealers had to shovel 34 centimetres of snow.
Environment Canada issued a weather statement for the Montreal area on Tuesday morning, noting snow "could bring an additional weight on structures and trees that are already covered in freezing precipitation."
Areas north of Montreal were still recovering from freezing rain and strong winds that took down many power lines on Monday. As of 9:30 p.m., more than 143,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without power, most of them in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region.
Spring should gradually return in the coming days. In Montreal, highs are expected to reach double-digits by Friday and Environment Canada's forecast calls for a sunny Sunday, with a high of 11 Celsius.
On Tuesday, the weather conditions impeded Canada Post mail delivery in the Montreal region.
"While every effort is being made to deliver the mail, some customers may not receive mail today," the postal service said. "Delivery will resume once it's safe to do so."
The weather also led the City of Montreal to cancel the launch of a flood-prevention campaign on Tuesday. The city had planned to start an effort to visit more than 3,000 homes affected by spring flooding in 2017.

'I saw the transformer on my street explode'; Hydro-Québec crews busy restoring power to more than 143,000 customers

Full text: As a blizzard swept across southern Quebec Tuesday, technicians from throughout the province scrambled to restore power to more than 143,000 homes and businesses still in the dark as of 9:30 p.m.
The bulk of those Hydro-Québec clients live in Laval, Laurentian and Lanaudière regions - all of which were battered by freezing rain overnight Monday.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. just after 8 a.m. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said waitress Monique Lécuyer. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled among construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home, but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
There were more than 800 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.
Additional technicians came into the Montreal area from Sherbrooke and the state of Vermont, according to Hydro-Québec.
Across the island of Laval, police went door to door checking to make sure families were safe Tuesday, particularly in areas hardest hit by the outages: Auteuil, Fabreville and Duvernay.
There have been two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since the ice storm began. In one, a family of four was hospitalized after using a propane-fuelled barbecue to warm their home. The other involved only one person.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide inside both homes. Neither case was life-threatening, according to Urgences Santé.
Families crowded into the Carrefour Laval mall early Tuesday to drink hot coffee and get out of their cold homes. Some children sat with their smartphones plugged into electrical outlets, logging onto social media to catch up on the latest news and gossip. "It's better than being in class," said one highschool student from Chomedey.
Outside, a thick coat of ice bent trees and weighed down electrical wires. Busy intersections were left without functioning traffic lights, visibility was blotted out by snow and traffic slowed to a crawl along both sides of Highway 440. The storm also stalled mail delivery in and around Montreal.
Quebec's Public Security Minister, Geneviève Guilbault, said Tuesday she would be monitoring the situation closely.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hoped to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board closed all of their schools on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Across the island of Laval, police went door to door checking to make sure families were safe Tuesday, particularly in areas hardest hit by the outages: Auteuil, Fabreville and Duvernay.
There have been two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since the ice storm began.
In one, a family of four was hospitalized after using a propane-fuelled barbecue to warm their home. The other involved only one person.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide inside both homes. Neither case was life-threatening, according to Urgences Santé.
Families crowded into the Carrefour Laval mall early Tuesday to drink hot coffee and get out of their cold homes. Some children sat with their smartphones plugged into electrical outlets, logging onto social media to catch up on the latest news and gossip.
"It's better than being in class," said one high-school student from Chomedey.
Outside, a thick coat of ice bent trees and weighed down electrical wires. Busy intersections were left without functioning traffic lights, visibility was blotted out by snow and traffic slowed to a crawl along both sides of Highway 440.
The storm also stalled mail delivery in and around Montreal. Quebec's Public Security Minister, Geneviève Guilbault, said Tuesday she would be monitoring the situation closely.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hoped to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board closed all of their schools on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the ??Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Full text: There is sun at the end of the snow-swept tunnel.
After several weeks of see-sawing temperatures, full-fledged winter returned on Tuesday and was expected to dump up to 10 centimetres of snow on Montreal.
That's nowhere near a record. On April 9, 2000, Montrealers had to shovel 34 centimetres of snow.
Environment Canada issued a weather statement for the Montreal area on Tuesday morning, noting snow "could bring an additional weight on structures and trees that are already covered in freezing precipitation."
Areas north of Montreal were still recovering from freezing rain and strong winds that took down many power lines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ) on Monday. As of 6:30 p.m., more than 192,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power, most of them in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region.
Spring should gradually return in the coming days. In Montreal, highs are expected to reach double-digits by Friday and Environment Canada's forecast calls for a sunny Sunday, with a high of 11 Celsius.
On Tuesday, the weather conditions impeded Canada Post mail delivery in the Montreal region.
"While every effort is being made to deliver the mail, some customers may not receive mail today," the postal service said. "Delivery will resume once it's safe to do so."
The weather also led the City of Montreal to cancel the launch of a flood-prevention campaign on Tuesday.
The city had planned to start an effort to visit more than 3,000 homes affected by spring flooding in 2017.

Full text: As a blizzard swept across southern Quebec Tuesday, technicians from throughout the province scrambled to restore power to more than 192,500 homes and businesses still in the dark.
The bulk of those Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients live in Laval, Laurentian and Lanaudière regions - all of which were battered by freezing rain overnight Monday.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. just after 8 a.m. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said waitress Monique Lécuyer. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled among construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home, but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
Fallen branches littered the streets of Laval on Tuesday.
There were more than 800 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.

Full text: As a blizzard swept across Montreal's North Shore Tuesday, technicians from across the province scrambled to restore power to the 250,000 homes and businesses still in the dark.
More than 230,000 Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions were still without electricity Tuesday afternoon after freezing rain battered the province Monday. A Montreal-area forecast showed no sign of the weather waning, with a mix of freezing rain and snow expected into the night.
In Deux-Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday, but Tuesday? This is a first," said Monique Lécuyer, a waitress. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled between construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Beaudet said it was a large tree branch, weighed down by ice, that snapped and hit the power lines, causing the explosion.
"Firefighters were already at the scene, trying to clear the lines," he said.
There were over 700 service interruptions across the province Tuesday afternoon, according to Hydro-Québec. That means crews had to be deployed to hundreds of sites, where they would evaluate the damage and begin their repairs.
Emergency crews were brought to the Montreal area from Sherbrooke and the state of Vermont, according to Hydro-Québec.
Across the island of Laval, where a thick film of ice covered power lines and branches, police went door to door checking to make sure families were safe Tuesday, particularly in areas hardest hit by the outages: Auteuil, Fabreville and Duvernay. There have been two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning since the ice storm began.
In one, a family of four was hospitalized after using a propane-fuelled barbecue to warm their home. The other involved just one person.
Firefighters reported high levels of carbon monoxide inside both homes. Neither case was life-threatening, according to Urgences Santé.
Families crowded into the Carrefour Laval mall early Tuesday to drink hot coffee and get out of their cold homes. Some children sat with their smartphones plugged into electrical outlets, logging onto social media to catch up on the latest news and gossip.
"It's better than being in class," said one high-school student from Chomedey.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages, to ensure they are all right.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hope to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated Monday by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire Wilfrid Laurier and the Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Iles announced on Tuesday that all of their schools were closed for the day.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the ??Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

The efforts of repair crews were complicated Monday by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain. As of 11:45 a.m. Hydro-Québec listed 232,000 homes and businesses without power in the three regions, more than 85,000 of them in the Lanaudière region, 74,000 in the Laurentians and a little over 72,000 in Laval.

Full text: The effects of freezing rain and high winds that swept north shore Montreal on Monday were still making themselves felt Tuesday morning, with more than 240,000 Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions without electricity and a Montreal-area weather forecast that calls for a mix of freezing rain and snow.
A family of four in Laval suffered from an apparent case of carbon monoxide poisoning early Tuesday after apparently using a barbecue to try to heat the inside of their home.
The incident occurred at 2:30 a.m on Bédard St. in the city's Vimont district. Firefighters arriving at the home found one child unconscious and three other occupants suffering from headaches. An scan of the premises by firefighters found high levels of carbon monoxide.
The four people - two adults and two children aged 11 and 13 - were taken to hospital and their lives are not deemed to be in danger.
Laval police and firefighters said Tuesday that patrols would be conducted in the sectors hardest hit by the outages - an area that includes Autueil, Fabreville and Duvernay - and that door-to-door checks would be made.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged residents to check in with their neighbours, particularly older residents and those less able to deal with the outages, to ensure they are all right.
In Deux Montagnes, one of the hardest-hit areas north of Montreal, people lined up outside a greasy spoon on Oka Rd. to get their first warm meal since the power went out Monday afternoon.
"Normally we're busy like this on a Sunday but Tuesday? This is a first," said Monique Lécuyer, a waitress. "They called me in at the last minute to handle this rush. We've got to turn on a dime and roll up our sleeves, I guess."
The restaurant staff hustled between construction workers, seniors and parents whose smiling children just found out they'd be missing school Tuesday.
"I saw the transformer on my street explode," said Maxime Beaudet, who stood in line outside the restaurant. "It was an explosion of blue and the power went out on our block. It's just my dogs and me at home but we're snuggling and keeping warm."
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hope to have power re-established to most clients by the end of the day. The efforts of repair crews were complicated Monday by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain. As of 9:30 a.m. Hydro-Québec listed 243,052 homes and businesses without power in the three regions, more than 88,000 of them in the Lanaudière region and 76,000 of them in Laval.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire Wilfrid Laurier and the Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Iles announced on Tuesday that all of their schools were closed for the day.
Laval police said Tuesday morning that while some traffic lights had been affected by the outages no major traffic problems had been reported.
"We have patrol officers watching major intersections (in case traffic lights have failed) and checking to see if there are any fallen hydro wires," said police spokesperson Évelyne Boudreau.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the ??Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Full text: The effects of freezing rain and high winds that swept north shore Montreal on Monday were still making themselves Tuesday morning, with more than 240,000 Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) clients in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions without electricity and a Montreal-area weather forecast that calls for a mix of freezing rain and snow.
As of 7:30 a.m. Hydro-Québec listed 243,248 homes and businesses without power in the three regions, more than 88,000 of them in the Lanaudière region and 76,000 of them in Laval.
Hydro-Québec officials said Tuesday morning they hope to have power re-established to most clients by noon and power fully restored by the end of the day. However, the efforts of repair crews were complicated Monday by the damage done to the power grid by fallen trees and fallen wires coated in ice by freezing rain.
"We recorded 10 to 15 millimetres of freezing rain in some areas along with high winds," said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty, adding that the weather system that caused the damage cut a swath from the lower Laurentians to north of Montreal. "That corridor saw a lot of trees and branches fall on the (power distribution) network."
The Commission scolaire de Laval, Commission scolaire des Affluents, Commission scolaire Wilfrid Laurier and the Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Iles announced on Tuesday that all of their schools were closed for the day.
Laval police said Tuesday morning that while some traffic lights had been affected by the outages no major traffic problems had been reported.
"We have patrol officers watching major intersections (in case traffic lights have failed) and checking to see if there are any fallen hydro wires," said police spokesperson Évelyne Boudreau.
Meanwhile, the city of Laval announced it had opened two community centres for residents without power in need of warming up or a shower. The centres are: the Centre Communautaire Accès at 6500 Arthur Sauveé Blvd. in Laval-Ouest and the ??Centre Communautaire de Lausanne at 455 Lausanne St. in Vimont.

Full text: A combination of wind and slow but steady freezing rain left about 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers without electricity on Monday evening.
As of 8 p.m., the hardest hit was the Laurentides region with close to 94,000 clients off the grid, while power was out for just over 20,000 customers on the island of Montreal.
There were about 90,000 homes in the Lanaudières region, just northeast of the island, still without power on Monday night. Meanwhile, Laval had more than 80,000 businesses and homes without electricity as of 8 p.m.
South of the island, the Montérégie region had 12,000 clients affected by the blackout.
While Montreal Island outages were to be repaired by late afternoon, Hydro-Québec could only assure customers in Laval and the Laurentians that repair crews were on route and would try to re-establish power as quickly as possible.

Full text: Good morning. Here are some stories from the overnight news desk. Have a good one and mind the Montreal-area weather and traffic warnings below.
Rwanda somberly marks the start of genocide 25 years ago: Rwanda on Sunday somberly commemorated the start, 25 years ago, of its genocide in which some 800,000 people were killed, as the country continues to grapple with the lasting consequences of the mass killings. President Paul Kagame and first lady Jeannette Kagame laid wreaths and lit a flame at the mass burial ground of 250,000 victims at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center in the capital, Kigali. Those attending the ceremonies included the leaders of Chad, Congo Brazzaville, Djibouti, Niger, Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, as well as the African Union and the European Union. "I am moved beyond words at this memorial to tragedy," said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. There will be a procession through the capital to Kigali's National Stadium where are many as 30,000 are expected to participate in an evening candlelit ceremony. "Twenty-five years ago, Rwanda fell into a deep ditch due to bad leadership, today, we are a country of hope and a nation elevated," Agnes Mutamba, 25, a teacher who was born during the genocide told The Associated Press in Kigali.
From left to right, Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, Rwanda's First Lady Jeannette Kagame, and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, light the flame of remembrance at the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Kigali, Rwanda Sunday, April 7, 2019.
Animal welfare group evacuates 40 animals from Gaza zoo: An international welfare group is evacuating dozens of animals languishing in a ramshackle Gaza zoo to sanctuaries abroad. Vets and volunteers from Four Paws International loaded some 40 animals and birds Sunday and headed to the Israeli border in the northern Gaza Strip en route to resettlement in Jordan and Africa. The rescued animals include lions, foxes, monkeys and pelicans. It marks the fourth and largest Gaza rescue mission by the Vienna-based organization since Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the Palestinian enclave in 2007. The blockade and three wars between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers have made life dire for Gaza's 2 million residents, let alone its animals who were already mistreated. Some died of cold and hunger in makeshift zoos as keepers failed to provide adequate care.
Forty animals including five lions and this monkey are being rescued from squalid conditions in the Gaza Strip, an animal welfare group said. The zoo hit the headlines in February this year when the cash-strapped owner revealed he had declawed one of the lions there, so that customers could pay to play with her.
India restricts key Kashmiri highway to military use only 2 days a week: Authorities in India's portion of disputed Kashmir on Sunday began enforcing a ban on the movement of civilian vehicles on a key highway to keep it open exclusively for military and paramilitary convoys two days a week. Soldiers patrolled the highway and erected barricades by steel and razor wire at intersections with neighbourhood roads. India's government issued the order this past week, reserving a 270-kilometre (170-mile) stretch of the highway for the movement of government forces vehicles on Sundays and Wednesdays until the end of May. The order follows the Feb. 14 suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy that killed 40 soldiers and brought rivals India and Pakistan to the brink of war. Civilian traffic was already being disallowed along the highway during the movement of troops' convoys after the attack. The order said the ban was called to prevent any attacks by anti-India rebels "keeping in view the large movement of security forces on the national highway" during India's multi-phase general election, which begins on Thursday.

Full text: Good morning. Here are some stories from the overnight news desk. Have a good one and mind the Montreal-area weather and traffic warnings below.
Rwanda somberly marks the start of genocide 25 years ago( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/rwanda-somberly-marks-the-start-of-genocide-25-years-ago/wcm/5148a917-4381-4c73-9d49-a1f4159ec5fc ): Rwanda on Sunday somberly commemorated the start, 25 years ago, of its genocide in which some 800,000 people were killed, as the country continues to grapple with the lasting consequences of the mass killings. President Paul Kagame and first lady Jeannette Kagame laid wreaths and lit a flame at the mass burial ground of 250,000 victims at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center in the capital, Kigali. Those attending the ceremonies included the leaders of Chad, Congo Brazzaville, Djibouti, Niger, Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, as well as the African Union and the European Union. "I am moved beyond words at this memorial to tragedy," said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. There will be a procession through the capital to Kigali's National Stadium where are many as 30,000 are expected to participate in an evening candlelit ceremony. "Twenty-five years ago, Rwanda fell into a deep ditch due to bad leadership, today, we are a country of hope and a nation elevated," Agnes Mutamba, 25, a teacher who was born during the genocide told The Associated Press in Kigali.
From left to right, Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, Rwanda's First Lady Jeannette Kagame, and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, light the flame of remembrance at the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Kigali, Rwanda Sunday, April 7, 2019.
Animal welfare group evacuates 40 animals from Gaza zoo( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/animal-welfare-group-evacuates-40-animals-from-gaza-zoo/wcm/2f037c92-4fd2-4837-966f-d6e56cde1d9e ): An international welfare group is evacuating dozens of animals languishing in a ramshackle Gaza zoo to sanctuaries abroad. Vets and volunteers from Four Paws International loaded some 40 animals and birds Sunday and headed to the Israeli border in the northern Gaza Strip en route to resettlement in Jordan and Africa. The rescued animals include lions, foxes, monkeys and pelicans. It marks the fourth and largest Gaza rescue mission by the Vienna-based organization since Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the Palestinian enclave in 2007. The blockade and three wars between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers have made life dire for Gaza's 2 million residents, let alone its animals who were already mistreated. Some died of cold and hunger in makeshift zoos as keepers failed to provide adequate care.
Forty animals including five lions and this monkey are being rescued from squalid conditions in the Gaza Strip, an animal welfare group said. The zoo hit the headlines in February this year when the cash-strapped owner revealed he had declawed one of the lions there, so that customers could pay to play with her.
India restricts key Kashmiri highway to military use only 2 days a week: Authorities in India's portion of disputed Kashmir on Sunday began enforcing a ban on the movement of civilian vehicles on a key highway to keep it open exclusively for military and paramilitary convoys two days a week. Soldiers patrolled the highway and erected barricades by steel and razor wire at intersections with neighbourhood roads. India's government issued the order this past week, reserving a 270-kilometre (170-mile) stretch of the highway for the movement of government forces vehicles on Sundays and Wednesdays until the end of May. The order follows the Feb. 14 suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy that killed 40 soldiers and brought rivals India and Pakistan to the brink of war. Civilian traffic was already being disallowed along the highway during the movement of troops' convoys after the attack. The order said the ban was called to prevent any attacks by anti-India rebels "keeping in view the large movement of security forces on the national highway" during India's multi-phase general election, which begins on Thursday.

Freezing rain a reminder there's no rush to remove winter tires: CAA

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/freezing-rain-reminder-theres-no-rush-remove/docview/2200248037/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Despite the arrival of spring, the cocktail of freezing rain, rain and snow expected to hit several regions of Quebec( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-6c7N ) Saturday is a reminder that there is no reason for motorists to rush to swap winter tires for summer tires.
This is the message from CAA-Quebec, which has put together a table outlining the "realistic date" for the installation of summer tires, by region, in collaboration with MétéoMédia.
Under Quebec law, motorists have been allowed to switch to summer tires since March 16( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/if-youre-not-driving-on-winter-tires-you-are-illegal-as-of-saturday ).
What's more important than the date is the average daytime temperature, which should be 7 Celsius or higher, continuously, to ensure summer tires can get a good grip on roadways, said CAA-Quebec spokesperson Annie Gauthier.
This is also why the "realistic date" varies from one region to another, from April 5 to mid-May, she said.
"The date of March 16 for changing tires is a little utopian in Quebec's climate," said MétéoMédia meteorologist André Monette. He noted that many regions are still getting snow( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/snow ) and temperatures remain cold in many places.
Gauthier said Quebec drivers should not fear their winter tires will wear prematurely if they wait too long before swapping them.
"It's a myth," she said. "What will damage the winter tires is the very hot summer, which is not the case at this time of the year."
Realistic dates, by region, for installing summer tires, according to CAA-Quebec and MétéoMédia:
April 5 to 15: Montreal, Laval, Montérégie, Estrie, Outaouais
April 10 to 20: Laurentides, Lanaudière, Center-du-Québec, Mauricie
April 15 to 25: Quebec City region, Chaudière-Appalaches, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi-Témiscamingue
April 20 to 30: Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine
April 25 to May 5: North Shore
After May 15: Northern Quebec

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."
The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ); the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).
"I don't want to sound alarmist, but because of the snow levels we're following things pretty closely."
In summary: hope is on the horizon, but don't let your guard down.

The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."
The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal; the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one. And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)

Brutal three-day January storm cost insurers $26 million in Quebec

Full text: Canadian insurers took a multimillion-dollar hit when a storm that pummelled eastern Canada from Jan. 23 to 25( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ) resulted in $39 million in claims - $26 million of which was in Quebec.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) reports that the damages occurred during a combination of heavy snowfalls, freezing rain, rain and high winds that raged through Quebec and the Maritimes.
Faced with this latest round of claims due to repeated episodes of extreme weather, the IBC is asking all levels of government to plan for sturdier urban development to withstand similar events. The organization also wants new infrastructure in place to better deal with fires and flooding, as well as incentives to discourage development in zones deemed to be at risk from extreme weather.
The IBC calculates that the damages from the three days of extreme weather stood at $26 million in Quebec, $11 million in New Brunswick, $2.1 million in Nova Scotia and $270,000 in Prince Edward Island.
For example, while many roads were washed out by the storm in Quebec, cars were completely submerged in Miramichi, N.B., and in Moncton an apartment block had to be evacuated after high winds tore away part of its roof.
Heavy rain also caused flooding in southern New Brunswick, which led to further evacuations and road closures.
Power failures also caused damages, with 42,000 clients blacked out in Quebec, 12,000 in Nova Scotia and 5,300 in New Brunswick.
The IBC's call for improved infrastructure is not based exclusively on its own damage reports. The organization estimates that for every dollar it pays out in claims, governments must pay $3 to repair infrastructure damaged by extreme weather.
In a communiqué made public Tuesday, IBC spokesperson Pierre Babinsky noted that "the number of extreme weather events is continuing to grow. Canadians need to understand the physical and financial risks to which they're being exposed."
Babinsky added that "better building codes, a better understanding of the risks and improvements to infrastructure are necessary to reinforce the strength of our communities."

A twisted groundhog day where spring never comes; Though we've had worse weather, this is the winter of our discontent

Full text: Not last year, or the year before. Not even the fabled Ice Storm of '98. Nope. Now is the winter of our discontent.
With apologies to Shakespeare, but Richard III's Gloucester never had to deal with the hellish winter stew this city's residents have had to cope with. Maybe Gloucester had to contend with mist and a bad batch of mead. But no Brexit, either. Just the usual royal backstabbings and parlour games gone awry.
Montrealers, however, wake up every morning in some twisted version of Groundhog Day, wherein spring will never come.
It invariably starts with a "special weather statement" issued by Environment Canada: Batten down the hatches, because there will be wind gusts of nearly 100 kilometres an hour. This will be followed by ice pellets turning to freezing rain to rain, and, yes, a dump of snow, ranging from 10 to 40 centimetres. (And isn't there some sort of meteorological mercy rule where it is forbidden to snow when the thermometer hits nuclear winter climes?) In this gift from the weather gods, the temperature will rise from a few degrees above zero to far too many degrees below, meaning that all the preceding rain will turn our streets and sidewalks into skating rinks, which would even defy the dexterity of a seasoned Cirque du Soleil acrobat.
Staying vertical these days has become a losing proposition, as a marked increase in hospital emergency-room visits for busted arms, legs and hips would certainly seem to indicate.
Yes, this ongoing "fraw" - flash freezing turning to thaws - or "theeze" - the opposite of the aforementioned - can be linked to climate change. (Even the skeptical Donald Trump must have found it odd to be conducting an outdoor news conference in the White House Rose Garden - in early February.)
That said, it's safe to assume weather conditions are the same in all our boroughs and municipalities. So why, pray tell, are sidewalks and streets far more navigable in Montreal West or Westmount than they are in the city centre? Not surprisingly, the anger level in this city is palpable. Cyclists, motorists and pedestrians are all fuming/foaming.
We've had far worse weather over the years. But even in the darkest days of the Ice Storm, there was a sort of solidarity, with citizens coming to the aid of one another.
Now there's plenty of finger-pointing. My friend and fellow griper Aaron Rand recently mused that the city would invest in heated bike paths before heated sidewalks.
He was sort of joking.
Regardless, cyclists were up in arms, lamenting that conditions were far from pristine on paths through the Lachine Canal and Jacques Cartier Bridge.
Which, in turn, incurred the wrath of pedestrians, wondering why in the world the city doesn't invest in heated sidewalks - which would make so much sense for health and economic reasons - and why did it invest in seemingly useless sidewalk ice-crushers.
It's no win for pedestrians. Those who can't stay vertical on icy sidewalks have taken to the street, and have occasionally paid the price after being ticketed by overzealous cops for so doing.

This game will become even more daunting when spring comes - if it ever comes - and potholes will morph into sinkholes, which is one way to keep citizens from fleeing the city for the 'burbs.

Full text: The good news is that this year's spring is expected to be far milder than that experienced last year. The bad news is we'll have to fight our way through a few more snowstorms before we finally experience it.
The MétéoMédia weather network on Monday posted its spring forecast, predicting an end to winter that will only occur by the middle of March.
However, the spring equinox on March 20 will usher in a few days of mild weather, the network says.
"This March you can be sure we won't expect to see the 20 degree (Celsius) weather we experienced during the student strikes in 2012, where we saw unheard of temperatures like 25 ... (but) we can easily reach temperatures of 15 degrees and we think it will continue into April," said MétéoMédia chief meteorologist André Monette.
Monette also forecasts that the roller-coaster temperatures experienced over the course of this winter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-whiplash-yes-montreal-winters-are-getting-wetter-and-icier ) will persist into the spring, in which mild weather followed cold on an almost daily basis.
However the frigid April we experienced last year and that saw a snowstorm break( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sunday-storm-could-bring-24-hours-of-freezing-rain-meteorologist ) during the second half of that month is not in the forecast.
"We experienced a wintery April," said Monette. "This year, it may be far more agreeable ... (with temperatures) within the norms, but within the norms for April - 12 degrees during the day and one degree at night."
Monette cautioned however that the large accumulation of snow that blanketed all but the southern edge of the province could increase the risk of flooding in those areas.
"The Laurentians, the Mauricie and Quebec City regions had enormous amounts of snow, so the ingredients for a flood season( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) are there."
Monette said the the amount of rainfall that will be added to the runoff from melting snow will determine how devastating any flooding could be. But he added that at the moment, it's too early to make any predictions.

Full text: Not last year, or the year before. Not even the fabled Ice Storm of '98. Nope. Now is the winter of our discontent.
With apologies to Shakespeare, but Richard III's Gloucester never had to deal with the hellish winter stew this city's residents have had to cope with. Maybe Gloucester had to contend with mist and a bad batch of mead. But no Brexit, either. Just the usual royal backstabbings and parlour games gone awry.
Montrealers, however, wake up every morning in some twisted version of Groundhog Day, wherein spring will never come.
It invariably starts with a "special weather statement" issued by Environment Canada: Batten down the hatches, because there will be wind gusts of nearly 100 kilometres an hour. This will be followed by ice pellets turning to freezing rain to rain, and, yes, a dump of snow, ranging from 10 to 40 centimetres. (And isn't there some sort of meteorological mercy rule where it is forbidden to snow when the thermometer hits nuclear winter climes?)
In this gift from the weather gods, the temperature will rise from a few degrees above zero to far too many degrees below, meaning that all the preceding rain will turn our streets and sidewalks into skating rinks, which would even defy the dexterity of a seasoned Cirque du Soleil acrobat.
Staying vertical these days has become a losing proposition, as a marked increase in hospital emergency-room visits for busted arms, legs and hips would certainly seem to indicate.
Yes, this ongoing "fraw" - flash freezing turning to thaws - or "theeze" - the opposite of the aforementioned - can be linked to climate change. (Even the skeptical Donald Trump must have found it odd to be conducting an outdoor news conference in the White House rose garden - in early February.)
That said, it's safe to assume weather conditions are the same in all our boroughs and municipalities. So why, pray tell, are sidewalks and streets far more navigable in Montreal West or Westmount than they are in the city centre?
Not surprisingly, the anger level in this city is palpable. Cyclists, motorists and pedestrians are all fuming/foaming.
We've had far worse weather over the years. But even in the darkest days of the Ice Storm, there was a sort of solidarity, with citizens coming to the aid of one another.
Now there's plenty of finger-pointing. My friend and fellow Griper, Aaron Rand, recently mused that the city would invest in heated bike paths before heated sidewalks.
He was sort of joking. Regardless, cyclists were up in arms, lamenting that conditions were far from pristine on paths through the Lachine Canal and Jacques-Cartier Bridge.
Which, in turn, incurred the wrath of pedestrians, wondering why in the world the city doesn't invest in heated sidewalks - which would make so much sense for health and economic reasons - and why did it invest in seemingly useless sidewalk ice-crushers.
It's no win for pedestrians. Those who can't stay vertical on icy sidewalks have taken to the street, and have occasionally paid the price after being ticketed by over-zealous cops for so doing.
When the city is in its thaw mode, there tends to be an accumulation of slush, much of which gets sprayed on to the bodies of pedestrians by seemingly oblivious motorists speeding through our streets - when they can.
And, of course, city motorists are never happy. When not having to deal with constant gridlock and road construction, they've been engaged in the not-so-popular city sport of Dodge-the-Pothole. This game will become even more daunting when spring comes - if it ever comes - and potholes will morph into sinkholes, which is one way to keep citizens from fleeing the city for the 'burbs.
And why does the city always resort to Band-Aid solutions with half-assed pothole repairs instead of tackling the problem seriously and permanently with cement, as suggested by Robert Libman( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-lets-deal-with-potholes-once-and-for-all ) in a recent Gazette op-ed piece?
All by way of saying that the under-the-plough Plante administration is no doubt delighted there won't be a municipal election for another couple of years. The mayor is fully aware of discontent in the winter air.
The only people in town who are likely content now are those in the business of patching up flat tires - those that can be saved, that is - or selling everything from hubcaps to new tires to wheel alignments to suspension systems, for those whose vehicles haven't dodged the potholes.

More roof collapses add urgency to Quebec's warning to building owners

Full text: A week after a pair of roof collapses prompted Quebec's minister responsible for building safety to warn owners to regularly clear ice and snow off the tops of their properties, four more collapses late Sunday have added more urgency to her message.
At least four roof collapses occurred north of Montreal between late Sunday and early Monday - two in Terrebonne, where the roofs of a supermarket and a garage collapsed because of the weight of ice and snow, as well as incidents in Joliette and St-Jérôme, where a television screen factory in the former locality and a warehouse in the latter were shut down when their roofs collapsed.
There were no injuries reported in any of the incidents, which occurred at the end of a day that saw the Montreal area swept by flurries, rain, freezing rain and ice pellets.
Last Monday, Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, who is also responsible for the province's Régie du bâtiment du Québec, reminded building owners of their responsibilities and of the urgency of ensuring snow and ice did not accumulate on the roofs of balconies of their properties.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-reminds-building-owners-to-clear-the-snow-from-roofs-balconies ) That appeal followed a roof collapse at an empty commercial building in Trois-Rivières and in a grocery in Lévis that left two people slightly injured.
Quebec's association of fire prevention technicians is warning that the presence of heavy snowfall in the east of the province and that of rain on top of the snow that has fallen in its western sector has increased the threat of roof collapses across Quebec.

Montreal weather warning: Proceed with caution as winds slated to pick up

Full text: Urgences Santé warned Montreal-area residents Sunday not to make unnecessary trips after the region was hit with a mix of freezing rain, ice pellets, rain and snow.
Calls from the public tripled Sunday because of weather conditions, the emergency medical service said in a press release, urging people not to call 911 except for true emergencies.
And conditions could continue to be treacherous Monday, as dropping temperatures and strong winds turn wet surfaces to ice, said Simon Legault, a meteorologist with Environment Canada in Montreal.
"The winds are going to pick up and be very strong," he said.
"It's going to freeze quite fast."
The City of Montreal said on Sunday it has, after consulting with the 19 boroughs, come up with a plan to tackle the difficult weather conditions. The boroughs will focus on spreading salt and abrasives on Monday, which could limit snow removal operations. In addition to salt and abrasives, city workers will make sure to clear all sewers so they are properly draining. The public is encouraged to respect street signs and to be vigilant.
This winter has been noteworthy for heavy snows followed by temperature swings that have drenched the city with rain that quickly turned to ice, turning sidewalks and streets into skating rinks and causing endless challenges for snow-removal crews, Legault said.
"Temperatures have been really swinging. "The highs and lows are very different from day to day," he said.
The weather really has made it difficult to keep streets and sidewalks safe, he said.
"It's real. There's a part that is caused by the weather, which we cannot control. There's a real difficulty with weather this year."
Legault said it would be premature to attribute the yo-yo weather to climate change, since it's not necessarily significant to have constant swings in a single winter.
"This year is a very varying winter for the temperature," he said.
"We just hope it won't be like this next year or the one after."
Dozens of arrivals and departures at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport were delayed. Travellers were told to arrive three hours early for departures.
There were no widespread power outages aside from an equipment failure that left 268 customers without electricity starting at 2:05 p.m. in Plateau-Mont-Royal. Hydro-Québec had restored service by 3:#0 p.m.
Urgences Santé said people who do have to go outside should exercise caution on slippery surfaces.
Residents should spread abrasives on porches and pathways and make sure their homes are accessible from the outside, it added. People with non-urgent health queries should contact the Info-Santé line at 811, it said.
Environment Canada issued a weather alert Sunday morning warning the mix of precipitation could cause ice build-up and make streets, highways, paths and parking lots slippery and hazardous,( https://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=1ac04cc54442405c&a=55e7da3&hl=en&gl=CA&source=web )
Rain Sunday afternoon could cause local water accumulation on streets and sidewalks until it changes back to light snow Sunday evening, it said. The snow will continue into Monday, with very strong west winds and temperatures dipping to minus-16 Monday night.
"We could reach around minus-20 on Wednesday morning," said Legault, who noted the normal for this time of year is a daytime high of minus-2 and an overnight low of minus-11.
Ice crampons will be a help as temperatures dive.
"Any water on the ground is going to be freezing," he noted.
Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ).
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/weather ) is calling for a gradual rise in temperatures starting Thursday.

Full text: Urgences Santé warned Montreal-area residents Sunday not to make unnecessary trips after the region was hit with a mix of freezing rain, ice pellets, rain and snow.
Calls from the public tripled Sunday because of weather conditions, the emergency medical service said in a press release, urging people not to call 911 except for true emergencies.
And conditions could continue to be treacherous Monday, as dropping temperatures and strong winds turn wet surfaces to ice, said Simon Legault, a meteorologist with Environment Canada in Montreal.
"The winds are going to pick up and be very strong," he said.
"It's going to freeze quite fast."
This winter has been noteworthy for heavy snows followed by temperature swings that have drenched the city with rain that quickly turned to ice, turning sidewalks and streets into skating rinks and causing endless challenges for snow-removal crews, Legault said.
"Temperatures have been really swinging. "The highs and lows are very different from day to day," he said.
The weather really has made it difficult to keep streets and sidewalks safe, he said.
"It's real. There's a part that is caused by the weather, which we cannot control. There's a real difficulty with weather this year."
Legault said it would be premature to attribute the yo-yo weather to climate change, since it's not necessarily significant to have constant swings in a single winter.
"This year is a very varying winter for the temperature," he said.
"We just hope it won't be like this next year or the one after."
Dozens of arrivals and departures at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport were delayed. Travellers were told to arrive three hours early for departures.
There were no widespread power outages aside from an equipment failure that left 268 customers without electricity starting at 2:05 p.m. in Plateau-Mont-Royal. Hydro-Québec had restored service by 3:#0 p.m.
Urgences Santé said people who do have to go outside should exercise caution on slippery surfaces.
Residents should spread abrasives on porches and pathways and make sure their homes are accessible from the outside, it added. People with non-urgent health queries should contact the Info-Santé line at 811, it said.
Environment Canada issued a weather alert Sunday morning warning the mix of precipitation could cause ice build-up and make streets, highways, paths and parking lots slippery and hazardous,( https://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=1ac04cc54442405c&a=55e7da3&hl=en&gl=CA&source=web )
Rain Sunday afternoon could cause local water accumulation on streets and sidewalks until it changes back to light snow Sunday evening, it said. The snow will continue into Monday, with very strong west winds and temperatures dipping to minus-16 Monday night.
"We could reach around minus-20 on Wednesday morning," said Legault, who noted the normal for this time of year is a daytime high of minus-2 and an overnight low of minus-11.
Ice crampons will be a help as temperatures dive.
"Any water on the ground is going to be freezing," he noted.
Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ).
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/weather ) is calling for a gradual rise in temperatures starting Thursday.
Sunday night: Rain will change to light snow in the evening and continued windy at 20 km/h, gusting to 40, becoming 40, gusting to 70, in the evening, and a low of minus 4.

An intense low pressure system is causing precipitation across Quebec on Sunday and Monday, which could make travel hazardous in greater Montreal and the South Shore as well as the Outaouais region. The freezing rain will change to rain around 2 p.m., when temperatures are expected to rise above freezing.
Rain could cause local water accumulation on streets and sidewalks until it changes back to light snow Sunday evening. The snow will continue into Monday, when very strong west winds and colder temperatures could turn wet surfaces into a sheet of ice.
The weather office issues freezing rain warnings when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.
Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ). Put on or get some ice crampons for your boots.

Full text: In case the pinging sound on your windows doesn't give it away, Montreal's Sunday morning is beginning in a rain of ice pellets, changing to freezing rain later this morning. Streets, sidewalks and parked cars were crusted with ice downtown. Walking and driving are tricky.
Environment Canada's weather warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) says the freezing rain could last through to mid afternoon. A northeast wind of 30 km/h will gust to 50, becoming southeast at 40, gusting to 60 in the afternoon.
Rain this afternoon and this evening could cause water accumulations on streets and sidewalks so drivers, please mind the pedestrians trying to avoid your wave of slush. Pedestrians, be careful. Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ).

Weather whiplash: Yes, Montreal winters are getting wetter and icier

Full text: Winter-weary Montrealers basked in the sun Friday. As the temperature hovered around 0 C, some of the snow that fell the previous day melted, as did ice that has plagued many sidewalks and streets.
But the weather's about to get turbulent again. Freezing rain and regular rain are expected to fall on the weekend, followed by a return Sunday night to sub-zero temperatures and then snow and blowing snow on Monday.
Sitting in his office nine floors above McGill University's snow-covered campus, Christopher McCray was crunching Environment Canada numbers to quantify the weather whiplash Montrealers have been experiencing this winter.
McCray's conclusions will console Mayor Valérie Plante whose administration has faced an ice-rage backlash as it struggles to clear treacherous sidewalks and roads.

They back up the mayor's contention that city workers and private contractors have faced an uphill battle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-puts-ice-breaking-on-hold-as-it-goes-back-to-snow-removal ) against seesawing temperatures and a smorgasbord of precipitation.
"We've seen a lot more precipitation falling as rain than in other winters," said McCray, a PhD candidate at McGill's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences who specializes in freezing rain.
And the rain has often been followed by cold snaps. "The big problem is the rain falls, melts some of the snow and you have a lot of water everywhere - and then after that the cold quickly comes in and it all freezes."
Here's a look at McCray's numbers:
RAIN
As of Friday, about 140 millimetres of rain had fallen since December. That's 30 mm more than the average rainfall between December and February over the past two decades.
Because of climate change, the amount of rain that falls in Montreal between December and February has been increasing by about 10 mm per decade, McCray said.
In the 1940s, only about 40 mm of rain fell in Montreal between December and February.
McCray said scientists know climate change is to blame in part because of climate simulations that look at what the rainfall pattern would be if there was no increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
"We also see a constant progression (in rainfall) that we can see since the 1940s at many different weather stations - not just Montreal but across southern Quebec," he added.

TEMPERATURE
"The temperatures this winter have been very close to average, but you can get a very normal season with a lot of warm and a lot of cold, and it just kind of averages out," McCray said.
So to understand why Montreal is having so many ice-related problems, he looked at episodes where rain was followed by freezing temperatures.
So far this winter, there have been nine episodes where rain fell and then the next day the temperature stayed below freezing, likely causing the rain to freeze, he said.
That's double the average number of such episodes Montreal has experienced during a typical winter since the 1940s, McCray said.
There are fewer days when the temperature stays below freezing. Nighttime low temperatures are warming faster than daytime highs.
"What we might consider a slightly cold winter now is probably what an average winter was like in the 1970s," McCray said.
Winter is getting "noticeably shorter" in Montreal, he noted. The first 0 C day now tends to occur around Oct. 25, about two weeks later than it did before the 1990s.
SNOW
So far this winter, 194 centimetres of snow have fallen in Montreal - 36 cm more than the average snowfall by this time.
On average since 1980, Montreal has received about 205 cm of snow during an entire winter. Between 1950 and 1980, the average was about 240 cm.
Why is there more rain and less snow these days?
"The primary thing is that it's just warmer generally" due to climate change, McCray said. "When it's warmer at the surface, the snow will fall and then it'll melt before it reaches the ground."

FREEZING RAIN
Slightly more freezing rain than usual has fallen since December.
On average, Montreal experiences about 20 hours of freezing rain over six days between December and February. This winter, there have been 22 hours over 10 days, McCray said.

EMERGENCY CALLS FOR ICY FALLS JUMP 55 PER CENT
Urgences-Santé reported Friday that the number of calls the ambulance service responded to for outdoor falls in the first eight weeks of the year jumped more than 55 per cent over the corresponding periods in the last three years. Urgences-Santé received 710 calls between Jan. 1 and Feb. 20 for falls that occurred outside. In the same period last year there were 458 calls. In the year before that, there were 439 calls. The majority of calls were for broken, bruised or sprained wrists, forearms and hips, as well as head injuries. "The falls are in direct correlation with the observed winter weather conditions and ice storms we've had over the last few weeks since the beginning of the year," Urgences-Santé operations adviser Eddy Afram said, calling the rise unprecedented. Urgences-Santé, which handles close to 40 per cent of all calls in Quebec, said it had its busiest day on record on Jan. 25, receiving 1,200 calls for all types of medical emergencies. On Jan. 24, the temperature was 3 degrees Celsius and the city was drenched with 17 millimetres of rain. On Jan. 25, temperatures plunged to minus-25 C. It did not have figures for how many of those calls were related to falls.

Full text: We are smack, dab in the middle of a brutal winter, with greater Montreal receiving 180 centimetres of snow to date, when the average winter sees 210 cm. But this is a winter about more than the snow. This is a winter about the chaotic fusion of wildly fluctuating temperatures and mixed precipitation.
"We've had a big challenge this year," Dollard-des-Ormeaux Mayor Alex Bottausci said. "Between Jan. 23 and 24, the temperature went from -25º Celsius to +3º. Driveways fill up with water and there is the possibility of basements flooding."
And then the reverse would happen. In less than 24 hours, the temperature would plummet from +6 Celsius to -17 C, with rain turning to sleet then to freezing rain and then snow within the same time frame.
Pools of water froze, forming a rock-solid layer of ice which would then be covered by snow.
Battalions of blue-collar workers would head out with ploughs - big and small. Trucks circulated, spreading abrasives. Once the snow stopped, out came the snow blowers and dump trucks.
So why are people throughout the West Island( https://montrealgazette.com/category/news/local-news/west-island-gazette ) complaining that the sidewalks are icy and the roads bumpy and the roadsides are piled with a rigid mix of snow and ice? Frustrated citizens blame the mayors, councillors, the blue-collar workers. Why aren't they doing their job, people ask? Why aren't they using the salt-abrasive when it is needed most, they ask?
Not everybody understands how rock-salt abrasives work. Conditions have to right for the salt to take hold and do its job. Salt stops working at -15º Celsius. That's the science of it. And if you spread it while it's raining, it washes away. So what do you do when it rains and then there is a flash freeze?
"It's physically impossible to get to all the streets before the flash freeze hits and we don't have magic salt," Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa said.
Ste-Anne removes snow in two distinct sectors. The northern sector has wider streets, but not many sidewalks. The southern sector has narrow streets and few front yards for homeowners to pile snow they remove from front walks and driveways.
"We get more complaints from the northern sector about there not being enough salt," Hawa said. "And then we get complaints that we use too much salt and that it hurts pets' paws. What are you supposed to do? Hats off to public works. They work all hours under constant stress and people still complain. It's a thankless job."
So what about crushed rock and sand? Even woods chips are being tested as a more environmentally-friendly abrasive.
Hawa and Bottausci both said crushed rock and sand must be used in a measured fashion because during the spring thaw, the rock and sand can clog sewers and cause flooding.
And what to do about the cars? Municipalities and residents can find themselves at odds about where to park the family car during and after a snow storm. Private contractors need access to driveways to do their job, but the municipalities need vehicle-free streets to plough. In the end cars are towed at the owner's expense. Not only is it frustrating for a the car owner, the towing process slows down the ploughs.
In the midst of all these issues are budget considerations.
"It costs between $30,000 and $40,000 each time we clear the snow," Hawa said. "It's time-and-a-half or double-time on weekends and holidays. It's no wonder we're relieved when we hear that the storm is happening on a Monday. It's a delicate balancing act between public safety and budget. If I see that it's going to rain in 12 hours, do I spend the $30,000?"
And there are operational challenges.
"We spend a lot of time explaining to people the order in which the cleaning is done and why," Bottausci said.
Main roads and roads leading to hospitals and schools are cleaned first. Sewers need to be unplugged. Secondary roads come next and residential roads, last. Snow clearing around transit hubs is also a priority. And there are always emergencies to handle. It can't all be done in the blink of an eye which means if there is a thaw and flash freeze, some smaller streets turn into skating rinks and if the temperature remains low - see above.
So how about ice crushers like the ones they have in municipalities including Kirkland and Dollard?
Ice crushers can do the job, but they are large, don't fit in narrow streets and can damage the road's surface which means costly road repairs in the future.
"And the ice crushers move slowly and require larger crews," Bottausci said. "You have several trucks going down one street. So that slows down the cleaning operation elsewhere. There is no winning with this kind of winter. But I think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."
The West Island Gazette spoke with Bottausci exactly one week before the region was hit with a winter storm which dumped more than 40 cm of snow, followed one day later by a temperature fluctuation of +4 to -15 over 24 hours.

After the storm, city begins cleanup; Montreal hit with 40 cm of snow between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons

Full text: Montreal is getting back to normal after a major snowstorm closed schools, clogged roads and sidewalks and convinced many workers to take a snow day.
The cleanup is underway. Forty centimetres of snow fell between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère said. During an average snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal. So far this season, with more than two months to go, the tally is 180 centimetres, according to Environment Canada statistics.
The intense storm led all public schools on Montreal Island to cancel classes Wednesday. CE-GEPs and universities followed suit. They are all expected to reopen today. Canada Post cancelled mail delivery across Quebec due to severe weather.
Snow crews plowing roads and sidewalks were helped by the lack of students on the road and the fact that many workers heeded officials'calls to stay home or use public transit.
But Société de transport de Montréal buses were slowed by the sheer amount of snow on Montreal roads, leaving some commuters facing long delays. And many who opted for Exo commuter trains were thwarted by delays and mechanical breakdowns. Only one of Exo's six lines, Mont-St-Hilaire, was problem-free Wednesday.
The city of Montreal said workers spreading abrasives and plowing snow prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries.
Starting Wednesday evening, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles were to begin hauling away snow, an operation expected to take about a week.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration has been criticized for how it has handled snow and ice removal during a winter marked by wild temperature fluctuations and a wide variety of precipitation, from rain to freezing drizzle to freezing rain to snow.
Ensemble Montréal, the opposition party at city hall, says Montreal's poor planning is to blame for thick layers of ice found on some streets and sidewalks.
On Wednesday, Plante said it will cost between $25 million and $35 million to remove the latest snowfall.
The original plan had been to start the snow-removal operation on Thursday morning.
"We're going to start taking away all the snow (Wednesday night) because we didn't want to wait till (Thursday) morning," Plante said.
"We know a lot of people will be working tomorrow morning so if we can do as much as we can overnight, tonight, it's great. But of course it will take some time."
She said people should take the métro if possible, noting Wednesday's ride was smooth, likely because many children and their parents stayed home. Thursday's commute would undoubtedly be much busier, she said.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Wednesday morning that the province was coping with the storm and there were no deaths or major incidents.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads," Guilbault said.
Montreal's weather roller-coaster ride may continue in the coming days. Environment Canada says more snow may fall Thursday, possibly followed by rain on Friday as the temperature shoots up above zero. The forecast for Saturday: sunny with a high of -3 C.

Winter storm wallops Quebec and the Maritimes

Full text: A massive winter storm that lashed Southern Ontario this week moved through Quebec and into the Maritimes on Wednesday, closing schools, restricting travel and shuttering many businesses and offices for the day.
Few areas were spared as activities across much of Eastern Canada were disrupted, from the Dennis Oland murder trial to outdoor events at Quebec City's winter carnival.
"It's been a long day," said Troy Arsenault, who fought a losing battle as he cleared snow from the steps in front of Fredericton's Beaverbrook Art Gallery Wednesday.
"It's our third time here ... the wind keeps blowing the snow right back to where we've cleared it."
Jill Maepea, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said much of New Brunswick was expecting close to 35 centimetres of snow from the storm by Wednesday night, with more on the way.
All of New Brunswick and P.E.I., and much of Nova Scotia and Southern Quebec were under similar winter-storm warnings.
Areas of western Nova Scotia also received heavy snow Wednesday morning, but weather in much of the province had changed over to freezing rain or rain by midday. Environment Canada said winds could also gust to 80 kilometres an hour and combine with freezing rain to make travel treacherous.
Schools and universities in almost all of the region were closed or delaying their openings, along with some government offices and businesses. The courts in Saint John opened as scheduled Wednesday morning, but closed at noon because of the blizzard, adjourning Mr.Oland's retrial in his father's killing for the day.
Airports in Fredericton, Halifax and Charlottetown were reporting dozens of flight cancellations, a day after the scene played out in Toronto where there were mass flight disruptions and widespread closings of schools, tourist attractions and non-essential municipal services. A "no-travel advisory" for New Brunswick highways was issued Wednesday.
Al Giberson, general manager of MRDC - the company responsible for the stretch of TransCanada Highway between Fredericton and Moncton - said snow was accumulating as fast as four to five centimetres an hour.
"The real challenge though is the heavy snowfall, and the wind that has come with it, has made visibility very poor. Driving conditions are very treacherous," Mr. Giberson said.
Much of Southern Quebec also remained under a winter-storm warning after about 30 centimetres of snow fell in Montreal, forcing the closing of schools and major travel disruptions.
In Quebec City, the weather was bad enough that even the winter carnival was forced to close its outdoor activity sites Wednesday. Organizers said the temporary shutdown was necessary to ensure the "safety of everyone."
Between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow were expected to fall in Quebec depending on the region, with strong winds reducing visibility on some roads to almost zero. Several highways were closed Wednesday morning, including Highway 20 in both directions between Lévis and Montmagny.

Forty centimetres of snow fell between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère said.
During an average snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal. So far this season, with more than two months to go, the tally is 180 cm, according to Environment Canada statistics.
The intense storm led all public schools on Montreal Island to cancel classes Wednesday. CEGEPs and universities followed suit. They are all expected to reopen Thursday. Canada Post canceled mail delivery across Quebec due to severe weather.
Snow crews plowing roads and sidewalks were helped by the lack of students on the road and the fact that many workers heeded officials' calls to stay home or use public transit.

But Société de transport de Montréal buses were slowed by the sheer amount of snow on Montreal roads, leaving some commuters facing long delays. And many who opted for Exo commuter trains were thwarted by delays and mechanical breakdowns. Only one of Exo's six lines - Mont-St-Hilaire - was problem-free Wednesday.
The city of Montreal said workers spreading abrasives and plowing snow prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries.
Starting Wednesday evening, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles were to begin hauling away snow, an operation expected to take about a week.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration has been criticized for how it has handled snow and ice removal during a winter marked by wild temperature fluctuations and a wide variety of precipitation, from rain to freezing drizzle to freezing rain to snow.
Ensemble Montréal, the opposition party at city hall, says Montreal's poor planning is to blame for thick layers of ice found on some streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ).
On Wednesday, Plante said it will cost between $25 million and $35 million to remove the latest snowfall.

The original plan had been to start the snow-removal operation on Thursday morning.
"We're going to start taking away all the snow (Wednesday night) because we didn't want to wait till (Thursday) morning," Plante said.
"We know a lot of people will be working tomorrow morning so if we can do as much as we can overnight, tonight, it's great. But of course it will take some time."
She said people should take the métro if possible, noting Wednesday's ride was smooth, likely because many children and their parents stayed home. Thursday's commute would undoubtedly be much busier, she said.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Wednesday morning that the province was coping with the storm and there were no deaths or major incidents.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads," Guilbault said.
Montreal's weather rollercoaster ride may continue in the coming days.
Environment Canada says more snow may fall Thursday, possibly followed by rain on Friday as the temperature shoots up above zero. The forecast for Saturday: sunny with a high of -3 C.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself prepared for the snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas were expected to receive 40 centimetres.
Strong winds were also in the forecast.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision: all announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures see-sawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is forecast to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations.
He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks.
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snowstorm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city's snow-clearing budget, but didn't.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels had been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home, just do that. And we encourage every job-giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible, of course."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has learned its lessons from past storms, including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"With a big storm in the works, I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, zero risk doesn't exist, but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec had called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So, as my colleague said, we hope people will stay home or adapt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel. Phil Authier and Paul Cherry contributed to this report

Pointe-Claire homes flooded as main breaks

Full text: The winter of our discontent took another cold twist last Wednesday when a burst water main turned a Pointe-Claire neighbourhood into a flood zone.
A broken 14-inch pipe on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave., sent water gushing into streets, flooding about a dozen homes in a residential pocket just east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
For Trevor Coulton, a resident of Brunet Ave., the overnight flood led to a disturbing wake-up call on Wednesday morning. Coulton said he was awoken at 4:30 a.m. by an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
City crews managed to close the main water valve in the affected area Wednesday, but not before streams of water had already gushed down Brunet and Victoria avenues.
The burst water main also forced the temporary closure of nearby streets, including Lakeshore Rd.
While emergency crews were busy pumping water from flooded basements, city snow plows pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
The city also issued a boiled water advisory for affected residents on Victoria, Ste-Claire and Cartier avenues. It was lifted on Friday morning.
Coulton said he will likely have to gut his basement and assess other property damages.
"That's what insurance is for," he said Friday.
Pointe-Claire Mayor John Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be due to significant fluctuations in temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to be the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing rain in recent weeks.
"It had to be the weather. We had minus 25 C then plus 6 C, so that's a perfect storm for a water main to break."
"You hate to see this happen," added Belvedere, who lives nearby and had flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Property owners who sustained flood damage have 15 days to file a claim with the city.
The mayor said the city threw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including the Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire department and public works. "Even Baie-d'Urfé was here helping out," he said Coulton praised the city's efforts in dealing with the emergency situation.
"The city did a great job," he said.
"They were here pretty quick. City workers, the fire department, even volunteers. It was nice to see. "While some residents were forced to leave their homes because of the flooding that knocked out basement furnaces, Coulton was able to stay in his home Wednesday night.
"I've still got heat and electricity, so I'll be all right. A hot meal and a warm bed."
But many personal effects, such as family photographs, were probably lost in the flood, he added.
"That's the stuff you can't replace." jmeagher@postmedia.com

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels had been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home, just do that. And we encourage every job-giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible, of course."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has learned its lessons from past storms, including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"With a big storm in the works, I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, zero risk doesn't exist, but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/1095471975164715014 ) had called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So, as my colleague said, we hope people will stay home or adapt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Pointe-Claire neighbourhood floods after water main bursts

Full text: The winter of our discontent took another cold twist last Wednesday when a burst water main turned a Pointe-Claire neighbourhood into a flood zone.
A broken 14-inch pipe on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave., sent water gushing into streets, flooding about a dozen homes in a residential pocket just east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
For Trevor Coulton, a resident of Brunet Ave., the overnight flood led to a disturbing wake-up call on Wednesday morning. Coulton said he was awoken at 4:30 a.m. by an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement of his grandparent's home.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
City crews managed to close the main water valve in the affected area Wednesday, but not before streams of water had already gushed down Brunet and Victoria Aves.
The burst water main also forced the temporary closure of nearby streets, including Lakeshore Rd.
While emergency crews were busy pumping water from flooded basements, city snow plows pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
The city also issued a boiled water advisory for affected residents on Victoria, Ste-Claire and Cartier Avenues. It was lifted on Friday morning.
Coulton said the basement will have to be gutted, and other property damages assessed.
"That's what insurance is for," he said Friday.
Pointe-Claire Mayor Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be due to significant fluctuations in temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to be the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing rain in recent weeks.
"It had to be the weather. We had minus 25 C then plus 6 C, so that's a perfect storm for a water main to break."
"You hate to see this happen," added Belvedere, who lives nearby and had flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Property owners who sustained flood damage have 15 days to file a claim with the city( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/claims/ ).
The mayor said the city threw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including the Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire department and public works. "Even Baie-D'Urfé was here helping out," he said
Coulton praised the city's efforts in dealing with the emergency situation.
"The city did a great job," he said. "They were here pretty quick. City workers, the fire department, even volunteers. It was nice to see. "
While some residents were forced to leave their homes because of the flooding that knocked out basement furnaces, Coulton was able to stay in the home Wednesday night.
"I've still got heat and electricity, so I'll be all right. A hot meal and a warm bed."
But many personal effects, such as family photographs, were probably lost in the flood, he added.
"That's the stuff you can't replace."

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself prepared for the snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas were expected to receive 40 centimetres. Strong winds were also in the forecast.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision: all announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is forecast to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snowstorm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city's snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm expected to hit the city Tuesday and Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - all announced Tuesday evening their schools will be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations are expected to begin Thursday morning.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight, in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers are expected to work Wednesday. They have ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snow storm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm expected to hit the city Tuesday and Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight, in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations are expected to begin Thursday morning.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers are expected to work Wednesday. They have ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snow storm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems tonight and tomorrow is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible tomorrow and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself will show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 in when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency coordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working tonight for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road tonight. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).

He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Government officials and the provincial police force urged people to delay travel if possible during the storm.
The Sûreté du Québec said if driving, motorists should "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
At Trudeau airport, dozens of flights in and out of the city were cancelled or delayed on Tuesday afternoon.
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm. The Société de transport de Montréal said people show allow extra time for travel.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel wrote on his Twitter account that: "I am following the evolution of the storm that will move into Quebec over the next few hours. If possible, delay any travel and thank you for doing so. If not, adapt your driving (to road conditions)."
That message was echoed by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial force responsible for patrolling Quebec highways. In a statement posted soon after Bonnardel's tweet, the SQ urged motorists to "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
Meanwhile, Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm.
Bonnardel's warning, made at a little before 11 a.m., came as a winter storm warning for the Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#191837342337813415201902110504ww1070cwul ) entered its seventh hour. And even though the first lashes of snow weren't expected to be felt until 6 p.m., the effects of its passage east from Ontario were already being felt locally.
At Trudeau airport, several flights to Toronto and the U.S. Midwest were listed as delayed or cancelled, as were most of Tuesday morning's incoming flights from Toronto.
City of Montreal officials were expected to meet the press Tuesday morning to detail their plan to handle the expected pummelling from the storm system, which is expected to arrive in time for supper on Tuesday and dwell over the area until Wednesday evening, dropping about a centimetre of snow every hour during its stay. The storm will also include high winds that will blow whatever snow does accumulate into potential white-outs on the highways, adding to the urgency of Bonnardel's advice.

Full text: After facing criticism for the way it has handled removing snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm that is expected to blow into the city Tuesday afternoon.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, said Tuesday.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration with previous snow-clearing operations this winter.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are covered with thick layers of ice that will make snow clearing more difficult.
He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Pointe-Claire neighbourhood floods after water main bursts

Full text: The winter of our discontent took another cold twist last Wednesday when a burst water main turned a Pointe-Claire neighbourhood into a flood zone.
A broken 14-inch pipe on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave., sent water gushing into streets, flooding about a dozen homes in a residential pocket just east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
For Trevor Coulton, a resident of Brunet Ave., the overnight flood led to a disturbing wake-up call on Wednesday morning. Coulton said he was awoken at 4:30 a.m. by an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
City crews managed to close the main water valve in the affected area Wednesday, but not before streams of water had already gushed down Brunet and Victoria Aves.
The burst water main also forced the temporary closure of nearby streets, including Lakeshore Rd.
While emergency crews were busy pumping water from flooded basements, city snow plows pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
The city also issued a boiled water advisory for affected residents on Victoria, Ste-Claire and Cartier Avenues. It was lifted on Friday morning.
Coulton said he will likely have to gut his basement and assess other property damages.
"That's what insurance is for," he said Friday.
Pointe-Claire Mayor Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be due to significant fluctuations in temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to be the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing rain in recent weeks.
"It had to be the weather. We had minus 25 C then plus 6 C, so that's a perfect storm for a water main to break."
"You hate to see this happen," added Belvedere, who lives nearby and had flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Property owners who sustained flood damage have 15 days to file a claim with the city( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/claims/ ).
The mayor said the city threw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including the Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire department and public works. "Even Baie-D'Urfé was here helping out," he said
Coulton praised the city's efforts in dealing with the emergency situation.
"The city did a great job," he said. "They were here pretty quick. City workers, the fire department, even volunteers. It was nice to see. "
While some residents were forced to leave their homes because of the flooding that knocked out basement furnaces, Coulton was able to stay in his home Wednesday night.
"I've still got heat and electricity, so I'll be all right. A hot meal and a warm bed."
But many personal effects, such as family photographs, were probably lost in the flood, he added.
"That's the stuff you can't replace."

Broken water main floods Pointe-Claire neighbourhood

Full text: Trevor Coulton awoke at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday to an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement of his home on Brunet Ave. in Pointe Claire.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water caused by a broken water main on a nearby street.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
Coulton's home was among a dozen or so residences in the area that flooded or suffered water damage as a result of a burst 14-inch water main that forced the closure of streets in the neighbourhood east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
The break was on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave."
"The break was on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave," said Pointe-Claire Mayor John Belvedere. "Around 10 or 12 houses were flooded. Some on Marie-Anne and Victoria Sts., on Brunet, and Drayton Ave. The water came in people's backyards and then worked its way across, all the way down to Lakeshore Rd. "
City crews eventually closed the main water valve in the affected area, but streams of water flowed down Brunet and Victoria Aves.
Snow plows also pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
Belvedere said the city threw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including the Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire deptartment and public works.
"Even Baie-D'Urfé was here helping out," he said.
City crews were still busy pumping water from flooded basements on Wednesday afternoon.
Seeing people with flooded homes saddened the mayor.
"You hate to see this happen," said Belvedere, who lives nearby and had some flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be because of significant fluctuations in winter temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to be the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing rain in recent weeks.
"It had to be the weather. We had minus 25C then plus 6C, so that's a perfect storm for a water main to break."

Broken water main floods Pointe-Claire neighbourhood

Full text: Trevor Coulton awoke at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday to an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement of his home on Brunet Ave. in Pointe Claire.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water caused by a broken water main on a nearby street.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
Coulton's home was among a dozen or so residences in the area that flooded or suffered water damage as a result of a burst 14-inch water main that forced the closure of streets in the neighbourhood east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
The break was on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave."
"The break was on Victoria Ave., near Ste-Claire Ave," said Pointe-Claire Mayor John Belvedere. "Around 10 or 12 houses were flooded. Some on Marie-Anne and Victoria Sts., on Brunet, and Drayton Ave. The water came in people's backyards and then worked its way across, all the way down to Lakeshore Rd. "
City crews eventually closed the main water valve in the affected area, but streams of water flowed down Brunet and Victoria Aves.
Snow plows also pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
Belvedere said the city threw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including the Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire deptartment and public works.
"Even Baie-D'Urfé was here helping out," he said.
City crews were still busy pumping water from flooded basements on Wednesday afternoon.
Seeing people with flooded homes saddened the mayor.
"You hate to see this happen," said Belvedere, who lives nearby and had some flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be because of significant fluctuations in winter temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to be the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing rain in recent weeks.

Full text: First there was ice, now there's water - and soon it may all be ice again.
Montrealers woke up to a Tuesday morning without any weather warnings from Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ), but a glance outside their windows confirmed that one warning still applies: Be careful out there.
The forecast high for Tuesday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-63Rh ) could reach 6 degrees Celsius, but much of what melts could later be freeze over as temperatures are forecast to drop to minus 10 by midnight and minus 14 in time for the Wednesday morning commute.
While the city of Montreal has said its priority is to spread abrasives to lessen the risk to motorists and pedestrians, the results Tuesday morning were mixed. Major thoroughfares( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) were mostly ice free but still patched with some ice. Sidewalks on side streets - even those downtown - were frosted with a new layer of ice that forced some pedestrians into the street.
Environment Canada's freezing rain warning remains in effect for Québec, Saguenay, and the Charlevoix and Rimouski areas.

Transports Québec reported that by sunrise Tuesday many highways and roads were covered in ice, most notably Highway 20 between Ontario and Montreal, Highway 50 in the Outaouais, Highway 132 in the Montérégie, Highway 125 in Lanaudière, Highway 175 in the Réserve faunique des Laurentides and Highway 40 between Trois-Rivières and Quebec City.
All Commission scolaire des Samares and Commission scolaire des Laurentides( https://www.cslaurentides.qc.ca/ ) schools are closed for the day, as are a number of schools in the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board( https://www.swlauriersb.qc.ca/?page=EMERGENCYCLOSURES_MORE ).
While the Tuesday-Wednesday flash freeze will complicate matters over the next 24 hours, another low pressure system is expected to create another meteorological roller coaster for Thursday-Friday.
The forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) for the coming weekend is sunny but cold, with a forecast high for Saturday of minus 11.

Full text: Tania Lajoie knows she must adapt her driving in the winter, but she has found it more dangerous than ever just navigating her neighbourhood streets lately.
A mix of winter weather left many of the narrow streets in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce treacherous on Monday, a full week after the last major snowfall.
Residents who spoke with the Montreal Gazette reported that even after snow crews removed snowbanks that had piled up, driving conditions were not only difficult, but downright dangerous.
And with a forecast of rain, freezing rain and plummeting temperatures, they fear the situation could get even worse in the coming days.
On Hampton St., several drivers complained they're afraid to drive on many of the north-south streets in the borough because of icy ruts left on the road that cause their cars to move from side to side as the wheels get caught in the grooves.
Others complained about the bottom of their cars scraping snow and ice left on the road.
"I think it's horrible," Lajoie said after parking her car at the YMCA's lot on Hampton Ave. "They clean one side of each road, but they don't clean the middle. There are thick chunks of ice in the middle of the road."
Resident Tim Halal said drivers must drive as slowly as possible on the smaller streets. "I feel like I'm going sideways, and if I don't go a certain speed, I'm going to slide into another car."
Marie Hélène, another N.D.G. resident, said: "I find it the worst it has ever been."
"Right after the snow-clearing, it feels that it hasn't been done," she added. "I have lived in N.D.G. my whole life, and it's been really bad this year.
"It's not like they're not clearing the snow; it's just that they're not clearing properly. Pretty much all the side streets in N.D.G. are insane."
Hélène said parking a car is a challenge with the icy ruts on the road. "Your car is like a train on a track, but if you try to get out of that track, it's so easy to go flying somewhere else."
Borough mayor Sue Montgomery said she is aware of the problem with icy ruts.
"We had that dump of snow, and then pouring rain and it immediately froze, so we couldn't clear it," Montgomery said.
"I understand the idea of people having no control. I was in a couple of taxis that spun out. It's quite scary. You just have to go slow."
She added that icy conditions meant that graders used to scrape the snow off the road are also at risk of slipping into parked cars.
Making matters worse, in recent weeks the borough has had to deal with equipment breakdowns: two graders and one snowblower were out of commission, Montgomery said.
Christian Arsenault, the city councillor for the Loyola district, said the borough has among the oldest snowblowers in the city - about 30 years old, whereas such equipment is generally replaced after about 15 years.
Snow-clearing in the Loyola district and several streets east of Grand Blvd. is done by the city's blue-collar workers, and Arsenault said crews are working hard, but they are limited by out-of-date equipment.
"I know our blue collars are doing everything we can, but we are giving them bad equipment, and we've been doing so for years," he said.
"We need a better explanation (from the centre city) about why we don't have acceptable, functional equipment."
Last week, all boroughs were served notice by a letter from Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante that snow-removal operations have been sub-par.
However, there were complaints on Monday about clearing operations in her own borough, Ville-Marie, where streets remained snow-and ice-clogged five days after she issued her warning.
Montgomery noted borough officials can't spot all the problems everywhere, so citizens should flag her by email or by calling 311 when they see a problem.
Both Arsenault and Montgomery said they do not know why crews seem to be leaving so much snow behind after a removal operation - another common complaint - and said they will look into the matter. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder Facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Freezing rain, roller-coaster temperatures - welcome to February, Montreal

Full text: Montreal will slither, splash and slide into the first full week of February with a Monday that already has seen a freezing rain warning and freezing drizzle advisory, and forecast temperatures that vary from 5 C on Tuesday to -11 C on Saturday.
Monday's freezing rain warning notes that two to five millimetres of ice are expected locally, while regions in the Ottawa Valley and regions north of the St. Lawrence River between Lachute and Quebec City could receive more than 10 millimetres of freezing rain.
A low-pressure system tracking across Quebec Monday and Tuesday is to blame, and its precipitation will begin as snow Monday morning in western Quebec and then quickly change to freezing rain. It is expected to spread toward regions of central Quebec later in the day. Eastern Quebec will see snow changing to freezing rain overnight from Monday to Tuesday.
Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
Meanwhile, freezing drizzle is expected to persist throughout the Montreal area for most of Monday, adding to the general weather malaise.
Tuesday, however, is expected to see sunny skies and a forecast high of 5 C - eight degrees warmer than on Monday. But on Wednesday the temperature tumbles to a high of -7 C, with light snow, before spiking to zero on a cloudy Thursday, nudging up to 2 C on Friday with rain showers and then, just in time for the weekend, plummeting to -11 on Saturday.

Snow( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/snow ) will start about 2 p.m. Sunday before turning to freezing rain or freezing drizzle around 9 in the evening.
Road conditions might not initially be that bad since the amount of snow and freezing rain or drizzle will be light at first. However, things could get worse because of a better organized low pressure system coming close on the heels of the first one that could extend freezing rain into Monday.
The areas affected by Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada )'s alert are the island of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil to Varennes, and Châteauguay to La Prairie.

Allison Hanes: Good riddance to a soul-destroying January!

Full text: I've never paid much heed to Groundhog Day. No, not the Bill Murray movie, but the Feb. 2 "holiday" itself, when a cute little rodent pokes his head out of a hole and looks for its shadow to predict whether spring is coming sooner or later.
This year, I can't wait for Fred to pop up in Val-d'Espoir out in Quebec's Gaspé region( https://livestream.com/accounts/6944075/events/8537194 ) on Saturday. Because the arrival of February means January 2019 is finally, mercifully over. We're one day closer to the end of winter, no matter what Fred sees. (And to be honest, I'm not particularly optimistic about his forecast).
We just battled through the longest, darkest, most soul-destroying January I can remember. And I say this as someone who likes winter, doesn't mind the odd cold snap and revels in snowstorms. But the bone-chilling temperatures and the wild weather fluctuations of the last month nearly did me in.
The drastic swing from blizzard to polar vortex to freezing rain to rain to flash freeze within the space of mere hours has wreaked havoc on the human spirit and infrastructure alike.
Between the sting of wind chill and the constant fear of falling on the sidewalks, daily life has been downright dangerous. And I'm a reasonably healthy, fairly active, and fully mobile person. I can't even imagine how difficult things have been for the frail, the elderly or the homeless.
The cold claimed the life of Hélène Rowley Hotte, 93( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/montreal-woman-93-freezes-to-death-outside-seniors-residence ), the mother of former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe on Jan. 20. She somehow became locked outside her retirement villa in Montreal's east-end during a fire alarm and perished. An investigation into the tragedy is ongoing.
But the ice has led to casualties of its own, with record numbers of falls on slippery streets and sidewalks. Urgences Santé received an astounding 140 calls an hour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/after-snow-slush-and-flooding-montreals-street-clearing-makes-gains ), up from an average of 70 a day, after the deluge of rain melted the snowpack then rapidly froze into a solid mass with the consistency of concrete and the smoothness of a freshly flooded skating rink. The ambulance service took the step of imploring Montrealers not to go out, the conditions were so dire. Most of us would have been happy to comply, so strong was the urge to hibernate.
A week later, surfaces remain as slick and slippery as ever. The thick layer of ice seems impervious to all efforts to bring it under control. The disastrous weather has clearly complicated the city's snow-clearing efforts, making the task more challenging than usual.
But let's focus on Montreal's snow-clearing operations for a moment. Abysmal circumstances aside, they've been ... abysmal.
Citizens have been complaining. Mayor Valérie Plante sent a stern letter to the boroughs telling them to step up their game( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ). But it seems like it's the same story, year after year, no matter who's in charge or how extraordinary the weather might be.
How is it Montreal hasn't figured this out yet, after 377 years? We seem to have one response to making the sidewalks passable: salt the heck out them. But this week, that proved an exercise in futility. Mother Nature tried to give us a reprieve from the fury she unleashed a week earlier. A fresh coat of snow blanketed the city. But instead of packing it down into a cushioning layer to cover up the ice, we poured so many abrasives on it the snow dissolved into guck with the consistency of brown sugar and the treacherous glaciers beneath were re-exposed. We always seem to want to fight winter. Can't we try to work with it?
As for snow-clearing, why would crews be tackling René Lévesque Blvd., a crucial artery, during the morning rush hour? Why worsen traffic? Why?
Of course, Montreal is not alone in its misery. Much of North America is shivering under a glacial cold, with temperatures more frigid than Antarctica. Canada Goose parkas are being stolen at gunpoint in Chicago, General Motors has shut down production in Michigan to conserve power. Welcome to the age of climate change. It's not just global warming, but extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.
Good riddance, January! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
But will February be any better? Regardless of Fred's prediction, it looks like temperatures are going to rise to a seasonal -10 C over the weekend, with periods of snow forecast. By Monday night, however, it could all turn to rain. And back we will plunge into the nasty, messy, vicious cycle again.

But this week, that proved an exercise in futility. Mother Nature tried to give us a reprieve from the fury she unleashed a week earlier. A fresh coat of snow blanketed the city. But instead of packing it down into a cushioning layer to cover up the ice, we poured so many abrasives on it the snow dissolved into guck with the consistency of brown sugar and the treacherous glaciers beneath were re-exposed. We always seem to want to fight winter. Can't we try to work with it? As for snow-clearing, why would crews be tackling René Lévesque Blvd., a crucial artery, during the morning rush hour? Why worsen traffic? Why? Of course, Montreal is not alone in its misery. Much of North America is shivering under a glacial cold, with temperatures more frigid than Antarctica.
Canada Goose parkas are being stolen at gunpoint in Chicago, General Motors has shut down production in Michigan to conserve power. Welcome to the age of climate change. It's not just global warming, but extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.
Good riddance, January! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
But will February be any better? Regardless of Fred's prediction, it looks like temperatures are going to rise to a seasonal -10 C over the weekend, with periods of snow forecast. By Monday night, however, it could all turn to rain. And back we will plunge into the nasty, messy, vicious cycle again. ahanes@postmedia.com

Montreal Mayor Plante raps boroughs' knuckles on snow removal

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante is telling the city's 19 boroughs to make safe streets and sidewalks their top priority as snow removal operations resume( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/next-snow-removal-will-start-as-soon-as-this-one-ends-plante ).
In a letter sent Tuesday afternoon, Plante cracks the whip on mayors by telling them to improve the efficiency of snow removal operations by keeping a close eye on them and reporting any problems like equipment breakdowns to the central city immediately.
In particular, Plante emphasized the need to spread abrasives on icy sidewalks, streets and bike paths.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," she writes.
"My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory," she writes.
The next five days( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-breezy-with-a-chance-of-flurries ) are a window of opportunity to improve the situation created by last week's weather cocktail( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ), which included everything from extreme cold to blowing snow and freezing rain, she says.
Opposition leader Lionel Perez said the letter shows the mayor is finally responding to criticisms he raised about treacherous conditions on city streets( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/snow-removal ).
Perez tweeted Tuesday night that the letter is "a public relations exercise = panic" and that Plante sent it to the media at the same time as the mayors received it.
He noted that Plante reassured Montrealers that all was being done to make streets safe, but by Tuesday was acknowledging the need for improvement.
"Citizens are not fooled," he tweeted.
Plante said Monday that the rain and freezing conditions that followed the snowstorm on Jan. 19-20, forcing city crews to switch from removing snow to spreading abrasives, was not just an excuse, but "a reality."

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante said Monday that the next snow-removal operation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-snow-removal-will-slow-this-weekend-to-give-crews-a-break ) could start almost as soon as the current one ends.
"We're already getting ready for the next storm," Plante said to reporters at city hall.
A snowfall warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#184001396682812632201901280504ww1070cwul ) is in effect for the Montreal region, starting overnight Monday to Tuesday and continuing until Tuesday evening, with an expected accumulation of 15 centimetres and blowing snow.
"We're finishing the snow-removal operation but there's a good chance the two operations will overlap," she said.
The expected bill for clearing up after Tuesday's snowstorm and the one 10 days ago could be as high as $40 million for the two operations, she said.
"It's necessary, it's work we have to do and that Montrealers expect. It's been planned for in the budget," she said.
Earlier, opposition leader Lionel Perez accused the Plante administration of bungling snow removal and the spreading of abrasives on sidewalks.
"I think that topic No. 1 for all Montrealers is the current horrible state of sidewalks, the dangerous sidewalks that we have in Montreal throughout. There's tons of ice still on many parts of our city. It is simply unacceptable," he said.
"The administration has not responded the way it should. We hear excuses upon excuses," Perez added.
Plante dismissed the complaint, saying the city has done what it can given the drastic cocktail of weather in the past 10 days.
Removal of snow after the last snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-more-snow-freezing-rain-and-rain-on-the-way ) was proceeding on schedule when rain followed by a freeze left sidewalks covered with ice, forcing work crews to switch gears and start spreading abrasives, she said. The current snow removal operation will be finished Wednesday, she said.

Snow removal to taper off on weekend to give crews a break

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/snow-removal-taper-off-on-weekend-give-crews/docview/2171300156/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: After a gruelling week, it's break time for snow-clearing crews that have been dealing with a deluge of snow, ice and rain, as well as puddles, slush and ice caused by wild temperature fluctuations.
But the time off will be staggered over the weekend, meaning snow-clearing operations will continue across the city but at a slower pace, said city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin.
"There are people who have been working since last Saturday under extreme circumstances, and they're reaching their 70 hours so we have to give them a break," Sabourin said, citing a provincial law regulating drivers of heavy vehicles.
"It's important because we reduce the risk of accidents when employees are well-rested and vigilant."
He said the operation can continue because workers - about half city employees and half private contractors - are on different shifts. And some workers were given breaks before they reached the 70-hour threshold.
Sabourin added: "It's important that this is not perceived as us stopping the operation because people have to continue to follow parking restrictions."
The city hopes to have hauled away all the snow by Tuesday.
He said it's difficult to estimate how much of the city has been cleared so far because in some cases, crews have to return to streets that have already been cleared to remove newer snow or to remove ice that has formed after brief thaws.
The city has had to deal with about 50 centimetres of snow.
On Sunday, 23 centimetres fell but due to windy conditions - snow drifted from roofs and balconies - many streets were covered with 35 centimetres, Sabourin said. Then, on Sunday, another 15 centimetres fell.
The city wants crews legally available to work next week because more snow is in the forecast, Sabourin said.
Earlier Friday, Montrealers awoke to an ice-encrusted city - and a warning about treacherous sidewalk and road conditions from Urgences-Santé.
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips," the ambulance service warned via Twitter.
At 9:30 a.m., it was receiving 140 calls per hour, many of them about injuries from falls on ice. On a normal day, 70 calls per hour come in.
As of 11 a.m., Urgences-Santé had received 144 calls about falls on Friday. On average, it gets 70 to 80 such calls per day.
In addition to the slew of ice-related falls, ambulance workers were also stymied by icy stairs at non-weather-related calls, said Urgences-Santé operations chief Stéphane Smith.
"The calls took longer because it was hard to get around."
By 3 p.m., the situation was stabilizing, with Urgences-Santé fielding 80 to 90 calls per hour.
Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks.
Eight icebreakers are among the machines being used in snow-clearing operations.
"With ice removal, it's a particular situation; yesterday we couldn't put sand or abrasives or break the ice until we cleared the water," she said.
"But we have to remember, winter is our lot in life. It always has been. We're adapting, this (latest) meteorological cocktail has been exceptionally challenging. We haven't exactly been lucky."
The Société de transport de Montréal thanked commuters on Twitter Friday for their patience over the past few days.
The transit agency acknowledged that getting around was "often frustrating and exhausting."
Some people complained of overcrowded buses or buses not showing up at all during Friday morning's rush hour.
"Today, like cars, our buses were dealing with difficult driving conditions such as slippery roads, traffic and snow-clearing operations that caused a generalized slowdown in the network," said Amélie Regis, a spokesperson for the STM.
The STM was also dealing with reserved bus lanes that were not cleared on Sherbrooke St. W. used by the popular 105 bus route, as well as others. That resulted in delayed buses, many buses not showing up on time, and more congestion than normal on Sherbrooke.
Sophie Paquet, a spokesperson for the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough where the bus lane is located, explained that crews removed snow from both sides of Sherbrooke on Monday and Tuesday, but the accumulation of snow on Wednesday was still lingering Friday because crews had to switch to spreading salt and abrasives in order to tackle slippery roads and sidewalks.
Paquet said crews will be back on snow-removal duty over the next few days, but the workforce will be reduced because many workers will be given a break.
"We will make all possible efforts to make sure that Sherbrooke is freed up by Monday morning," Paquet said. "But of course, we have no control of the weather in the coming days." Postmedia News

Stay indoors, Urgences-santé pleads as ice-related injuries rise

Full text: Despite the city of Montreal making progress in its attempt to clear more than 40 centimetres of snow that had fallen since Sunday, the ice left behind by that weather remained a real danger for pedestrians on Friday - so much so that Urgences-santé urged Montrealers to stay indoors unless they have no choice but to go out.
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips (outdoors)," the agency warned on its Twitter account. "The number of calls received for falls because of ice is more than three times the usual number. If you can get to an emergency room or clinic, do so!"
Urgences-santé spokesperson Catherine Domingue said Friday morning's Tweet was resorted to after the first responding service found itself receiving 140 calls per hour Friday morning, many concerning injuries from falls on ice.
"Normally we deal with about 70 calls (reporting ice-related injuries) per day," she said. "We are really at emergency mode today. ... It's extreme."
Urgences-santé is also asking anyone who witnesses a fall to make sure of the person's condition before calling 911.
The warning came after Thursday's surreal images of intersections turned into slush-filled swamps, pedestrians capering like mountain goats to deal with ice-covered sidewalks and vehicles plowing through bumper-high waves of rain and slush. Still, by Friday morning snow-removal efforts finally seemed to be getting the better of a week that included snowstorms, freezing rain and showers better suited for spring than January.
At 9:30 a.m. Friday, the city was reporting that 62 per cent of Montreal's streets and sidewalks had been cleared of snow( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ) - three percentage points higher than Thursday, and a jump that apparently included some extra efforts being carried out in two heavily populated boroughs.
Sud-Ouest and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which reported clearance rates of 48 per cent on Thursday, saw their numbers spike to 60 per cent less than a day later.
The borough with the highest completion rate - 90 per cent - was Verdun. Outremont had the lowest, at 36 per cent.
A snow-removal worker moves his vehicle onto the sidewalk and gestures to motorists to make way for an ambulance on Cote-des-Neiges Rd. on Wednesday.
The overnight clearing blitz came after Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks. Eight ice breakers are among the machines being used in snow-clearing operations.
"With ice removal it's a particular situation; yesterday we couldn't put sand or abrasives or break the ice until we cleared the water," she said.
"But we have to remember, winter is our lot in life. It always has been. We're adapting, this (latest) meteorological cocktail has been exceptionally challenging. We haven't exactly been lucky."

"Today, like cars, our buses were dealing with difficult driving conditions such as slippery roads, traffic and snow-clearing operations that caused a generalized slowdown in the network," Amélie Regis, a spokesperson for the STM, told the Montreal Gazette.
The STM was also dealing with reserved bus lanes that were not cleared on Sherbrooke St. W. used by the popular 105 bus route, as well as others.

Sophie Paquet, a spokesperson for the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough where the bus lane is located, explained that crews removed snow from both sides of Sherbrooke St. on Monday and Tuesday, but the accumulation of snow on Wednesday was still lingering Friday because crews had to switch to spreading salt and abrasives in order to tackle slippery roads and sidewalks.
Paquet said crews will be back on snow-removal duty over the next few days, but the workforce will be reduced. Because employees have worked for so many days without a break, many will have to be given 24 to 48 hours of rest, in accordance with the city's contractual obligations.
"We will make all possible efforts to make sure that Sherbrooke is freed up by Monday morning," Paquet said. "But of course, we have no control of the weather in the coming days."
Friday's forecast calls for daytime high of -5 C and a wind chill near -16, falling to an evening low of -12 C, with a wind chill near -18 and a 40 per cent chance of flurries.
Because of incorrect information supplied to the Montreal Gazette, an earlier version of this story reported that Urgences-Santé was receiving 140 calls per hour concerning injuries from falls on the ice. In fact, that number reflected all the calls the service was receiving, not just from falls.
Christopher Curtis and Jason Magder of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this report.

Snow removal slows this weekend to give crews a break

Full text: After a gruelling week, it's break time for snow-clearing crews that have been dealing with a deluge of snow, ice and rain, as well as puddles, slush and ice caused by wild temperature fluctuations.
But the time off will be staggered over the weekend, meaning snow-clearing operations will continue across the city but at a slower pace, said city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin.
"There are people who have been working since last Saturday under extreme circumstances, and they're reaching their 70 hours so we have to give them a break," Sabourin said, citing a provincial law regulating drivers of heavy vehicles.
"It's important because we reduce the risk of accidents when employees are well-rested and vigilant."
He said the operation can continue because workers - about half city employees and half private contractors - are on different shifts. And some workers were given breaks before they reached the 70-hour threshold.
Sabourin added: "It's important that this is not perceived as us stopping the operation because people have to continue to follow parking restrictions."
The city hopes to have hauled away all the snow by Tuesday.
He said it's difficult to estimate how much of the city has been cleared so far because in some cases, crews have to return to streets that have already been cleared to remove newer snow or to remove ice that has formed after brief thaws.
The city has had to deal with about 50 centimetres of snow. On Sunday, 23 centimetres fell but due to windy conditions - snow drifted from roofs and balconies - many streets were covered with 35 centimetres, Sabourin said. Then, on Sunday, another 15 centimetres fell.
The city wants crews legally available to work next week because more snow is in the forecast, Sabourin said.
Earlier Friday, Montrealers awoke to an ice-encrusted city - and a warning about treacherous sidewalk and road conditions from Urgences-santé( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/after-snow-slush-and-flooding-montreals-street-clearing-makes-gains ).
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips," the ambulance service warned via Twitter. At 9:30 a.m., it was receiving 140 calls per hour, many of them about injuries from falls on ice. On a normal day, 70 calls per hour come in. As of 11 a.m., Urgences-Santé had received 144 calls about falls on Friday. On average, it gets 70 to 80 such calls per day.
In addition to the slew of ice-related falls, ambulance workers were also stymied by icy stairs at non-weather-related calls, said Urgences-santé operations chief Stéphane Smith. "The calls took longer because it was hard to get around."
By 3 p.m., the situation was stabilizing, with Urgences-santé fielding 80 to 90 calls per hour.
Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks. Eight icebreakers are among the machines being used in snow-clearing operations.
"With ice removal, it's a particular situation; yesterday we couldn't put sand or abrasives or break the ice until we cleared the water," she said.
"But we have to remember, winter is our lot in life. It always has been. We're adapting, this (latest) meteorological cocktail has been exceptionally challenging. We haven't exactly been lucky."
The Société de transport de Montréal thanked commuters on Twitter Friday for their patience over the past few days. The transit agency acknowledged that getting around was "often frustrating and exhausting."
Some people complained of overcrowded buses or buses not showing up at all during Friday morning's rush hour.
"Today, like cars, our buses were dealing with difficult driving conditions such as slippery roads, traffic and snow-clearing operations that caused a generalized slowdown in the network," said Amélie Regis, a spokesperson for the STM.
The STM was also dealing with reserved bus lanes that were not cleared on Sherbrooke St. W. used by the popular 105 bus route, as well as others. That resulted in delayed buses, many buses not showing up on time, and more congestion than normal on Sherbrooke.
Sophie Paquet, a spokesperson for the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough where the bus lane is located, explained that crews removed snow from both sides of Sherbrooke on Monday and Tuesday, but the accumulation of snow on Wednesday was still lingering Friday because crews had to switch to spreading salt and abrasives in order to tackle slippery roads and sidewalks.
Paquet said crews will be back on snow-removal duty over the next few days, but the workforce will be reduced because many workers will be given a break.
"We will make all possible efforts to make sure that Sherbrooke is freed up by Monday morning," Paquet said. "But of course, we have no control of the weather in the coming days."

Stay indoors, Urgences-santé pleads as ice-related injuries rise

Full text: Despite the city of Montreal making progress in its attempt to clear more than 40 centimetres of snow that had fallen since Sunday, the ice left behind by that weather remained a real danger for pedestrians on Friday - so much so that Urgences-santé urged Montrealers to stay indoors unless they have no choice but to go out.
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips (outdoors)," the agency warned on its Twitter account. "The number of calls received for falls because of ice is more than three times the usual number. If you can get to an emergency room or clinic, do so!"
Urgences-santé spokesperson Catherine Domingue said Friday morning's Tweet was resorted to after the first responding service found itself receiving 140 calls per hour Friday morning concerning injuries from falls on ice.
"Normally we deal with about 70 calls (reporting ice-related injuries) per day," she said. "We are really at emergency mode today. ... It's extreme."
Urgences-santé is also asking anyone who witnesses a fall to make sure of the person's condition before calling 911.
The warning came after Thursday's surreal images of intersections turned into slush-filled swamps, pedestrians capering like mountain goats to deal with ice-covered sidewalks and vehicles plowing through bumper-high waves of rain and slush. Still, by Friday morning snow-removal efforts finally seemed to be getting the better of a week that included snowstorms, freezing rain and showers better suited for spring than January.
At 9:30 a.m. Friday, the city was reporting that 62 per cent of Montreal's streets and sidewalks had been cleared of snow( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ) - three percentage points higher than Thursday, and a jump that apparently included some extra efforts being carried out in two heavily populated boroughs.
Sud-Ouest and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which reported clearance rates of 48 per cent on Thursday, saw their numbers spike to 60 per cent less than a day later.
The borough with the highest completion rate - 90 per cent - was Verdun. Outremont had the lowest, at 36 per cent.
A snow-removal worker moves his vehicle onto the sidewalk and gestures to motorists to make way for an ambulance on Cote-des-Neiges Rd. on Wednesday.
The overnight clearing blitz came after Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks. Eight ice breakers are among the machines being used in snow-clearing operations.

Paquet said crews will be back on snow-removal duty over the next few days, but the workforce will be reduced. Because employees have worked for so many days without a break, many will have to be given 24 to 48 hours of rest, in accordance with the city's contractual obligations.
"We will make all possible efforts to make sure that Sherbrooke is freed up by Monday morning," Paquet said. "But of course, we have no control of the weather in the coming days."
Friday's forecast calls for daytime high of -5 C and a wind chill near -16, falling to an evening low of -12 C, with a wind chill near -18 and a 40 per cent chance of flurries.

As of 9:30 a.m. Friday, the city was reporting that 62 per cent of Montreal's streets and sidewalks had been cleared of snow( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ) - three percentage points higher than Thursday, and a jump that apparently included some extra efforts being carried out in two heavily populated boroughs.
Sud-Ouest and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which reported clearance rates of 48 per cent on Thursday, saw their numbers spike to 60 per cent less than a day later.
The borough with the highest completion rate - 90 per cent - was Verdun. Outremont had the lowest, at 36 per cent.
A snow-removal worker moves his vehicle onto the sidewalk and gestures to motorists to make way for an ambulance on Cote-des-Neiges Rd. on Wednesday January 23, 2019.
The overnight clearing blitz came after Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks. Eight ice breakers are among the machines being used in snow clearing operations.
"With ice removal it's a particular situation; yesterday we couldn't put sand or abrasives or break the ice until we cleared the water," she said.
"But we have to remember, winter is our lot in life. It always has been. We're adapting, this (latest) meteorological cocktail has been exceptionally challenging. We haven't exactly been lucky."
Friday's weather forecast calls for periods of light snow beginning in the morning with a high of -5 C and a wind chill near -16. By nightfall, the forecast low is -12 C, with a wind chill near -18 and a 40 per cent chance of flurries.

Full text: Despite the city of Montreal making progress in its attempt to clear more than 40 centimetres of snow that had fallen since Sunday, the ice left behind by that weather remained a real danger for pedestrians on Friday - so much so that Urgences-santé urged Montrealers to stay indoors unless they have no choice but to go out.
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips (outdoors)," the agency warned on its Twitter account. "The number of calls received for falls because of ice is more than three times the usual number. If you can get to an emergency room or clinic, do so!"
Urgences Santé spokesperson Catherine Domingue said Friday morning's Tweet was resorted to after the first responding service found itself receiving 140 calls per hour Friday morning concerning injuries from falls on ice.
"Normally we deal with about 70 calls (reporting ice related injuries) per day," she said. "We are really at emergency mode today...It's extreme."
The warning came after Thursday's surreal images of intersections turned into slush-filled swamps, pedestrians capering like mountain goats to deal with ice-covered sidewalks and vehicles plowing through bumper-high waves of rain and slush. Still, by Friday morning snow removal efforts finally seemed to be getting the better of a week that included snowstorms, freezing rain and showers better suited for spring than January.

The mayor said the city was "in a race against the clock" to clear the streets before a drop in temperature on Friday would transform the slush and snow into obstacles much harder to remove.
Friday's weather forecast calls for periods of light snow beginning in the morning with a high of -5 C and a wind chill near -16. By nightfall, the forecast low is -12 C, with a wind chill near -18 and a 40 per cent chance of flurries.

Harsh weather wreaks havoc across province

Full text: Then the cold returned.
Montrealers will wake up to an ice-covered city on Friday after a tumultuous week of weather that has seen about 45 centimetres of snow, see-sawing temperatures, as well as freezing rain and plain rain.
After temperatures rose to 3 C Thursday, Environment Canada says the mercury will drop to -6 C by 6 a.m. Friday, with a wind chill of -17 C, a chance of flurries and gusty winds.
Expect the giant puddles left behind by Thursday's rain and the snow that melted in above-freezing temperatures to turn into giant rinks, making driving and walking difficult.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante is appealing for patience.
"We know this has been difficult for Montrealers," she said Thursday afternoon. "Snow removal is continuing. We received 30 centimetres on Sunday, crews started working on Monday at 7 p.m. and we're almost at 60 per cent completion."
But she said "the rains have slowed down the snow-removal operation because we've had to re-allocate resources to make sure roads and sidewalks can be used, and the challenge is that we're in a race against the clock because we know it will get colder. Right now it's mild, but (Thursday night) it's going to go down to minus-10 and that water will freeze."
The mayor said a small fleet of icebreaking plows designed to clear sidewalks had begun to be deployed and would probably see more work Friday as the temperature fell even further.
As for the ongoing snow-removal operation, originally expected to end by Friday, it will now only finish sometime next week, Plante said.
City officials are blaming an unexpected surplus of snow for compelling them to juggle resources between clearing away the slush and ice that clogged sewers in many parts of the city and removing snow banks formed Sunday.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said about 15 centimetres of snow ended up falling Wednesday, more than double what had been predicted.
"It was a tempest for our (snow removal) crews. It wasn't on the radar for the city of Montreal or the meteorologists."
Thursday was Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections resembling small ponds.
Weather-related crashes were reported across the region. Local road conditions ranged from dodgy to downright treacherous. Water accumulation was the major challenge for motorists, with vehicles of any size running the risk of hydroplaning if they suddenly hit water patches at high speed.
All Montreal island school boards cancelled classes. Power outages were reported in some parts of Montreal and Quebec. Dozens of flights were delayed or cancelled at Trudeau International Airport. And local hospitals reported ice-related injuries.
Inundated with calls, Urgences Santé urged Montrealers to contact 911 "only if a life (was) in danger." The ambulance service "had many calls involving people falling on the sidewalks, car accidents, but no major injuries," said supervisor Valérie Tremblay.
Surface public transit on Montreal island also suffered. The Société de transport de Montréal said bus service was delayed and warned buses might not be able to deploy their ramps allowing wheelchair access because of the accumulation of snow on sidewalks.
After a week of atmospheric turmoil, Mother Nature will provide a reprieve on Saturday: the forecast calls for a sunny day and a high of -12 C.

City officials are blaming an unexpected surplus of snow for compelling them to juggle resources between clearing away the slush and ice that clogged sewers in many parts of the city and removing snow banks formed last Sunday.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said about 15 centimetres of snow ended up falling Wednesday, more than double what had been predicted.

Thursday was Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections resembling small ponds.
Weather-related accidents were reported across the region. Local road conditions ranged from dodgy to downright treacherous. Water accumulation was the major challenge for motorists, with vehicles of any size running the risk of hydroplaning if they suddenly hit water patches at high speed.

Full text: Then the cold returned.
Montrealers will wake up to an ice-covered city on Friday after a tumultuous week of weather that has seen about 45 centimetres of snow, see-sawing temperatures, as well as freezing rain and regular rain.
After temperatures rose to 3 C Thursday, Environment Canada says the mercury will drop to minus-6 C by 6 a.m. Friday, with a wind chill of minus-17, a chance of flurries and gusty winds.
Expect the giant puddles left behind by Thursday's rain and the snow that melted in above-freezing temperatures to turn into giant rinks, making driving and walking difficult.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante is appealing for patience.
"We know this has been difficult for Montrealers," she said Thursday afternoon. "Snow removal is continuing. We received 30 centimetres on Sunday, crews started working on Monday at 7 p.m. and we're almost at 60 per cent completion."
But she said "the rains have slowed down the snow-removal operation because we've had to re-allocate resources to make sure roads and sidewalks can be used, and the challenge is that we're in a race against the clock because we know it will get colder. Right now it's mild, but (Thursday night) it's going to go down to minus-10 and that water will freeze."
The mayor said a small fleet of ice-breaking plows designed to clear sidewalks had begun to be deployed and would probably see more work Friday as the temperature fell even further.
As for the continuing snow-removal operation, originally expected to end by Friday, it will now only finish sometime next week, Plante said.

Montrealers will wake up to an ice-covered city on Friday after a tumultuous week of weather that has seen about 45 centimetres of snow, see-sawing temperatures, as well as freezing rain and plain rain.
After temperatures rose to 3 C Thursday, Environment Canada says the mercury will drop to minus-6 C by 6 a.m. Friday, with a wind chill of minus-17, a chance of flurries and gusty winds.

Snow removal on ice as schools close, roads flood, sidewalks freeze

Full text: The city of Montreal's strategy to remove tonnes of snow dumped during a snowstorm last weekend slithered into the slush Thursday morning, as a a second snowfall, freezing rain and incessant rain showers turned the removal operation into an ongoing attempt to literally keep pedestrians and motorists above water.
And city officials are blaming an unexpected surplus of snow that fell on Wednesday for compelling them to juggle resources between clearing away the slush and broken ice that clogged sewers in many parts of the city and removing snowbanks that were formed last Sunday.
"No one called (on Wednesday) for a 15-centimetre snowfall," said city spokesperson Philippe Sabourin during a press briefing held Thursday afternoon by Mayor Valérie Plante. "We didn't get that information...they were calling for four to seven (centimetres)...That's huge, 15 centimetres of snow, and in addition to that freezing rain (and) then rain. It was a tempest for our (snow removal) crews. It wasn't on the radar for the city of Montreal or the meteorologists."
Plante meanwhile told reporters that the city was in "a race against the clock."
"We know this has been difficult for Montrealers," she said. "Snow removal is continuing, we received 30 centimetres on Sunday, crews started working on Monday at 7 p.m. and we're almost at 60 per cent completion.
"But the rains have slowed down the snow removal operation because we've had to re-allocate resources to make sure roads and sidewalks can be used, and the challenge is that we're in a race against the clock because we know it will get colder. Right now it's mild, but tonight it's going to go down to minus 10 and that water will freeze."
The mayor predicted that the ongoing snow removal operation, originally expected to end by Friday, would only finish sometime next week.
Plante noted that despite a Tweeted message from Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais on Thursday morning that his snow removal crews had been reduced because many were obliged to care for children marooned at home after local school commissions closed down because of the weather, staffing levels elsewhere in the city were at strength.
The mayor said also that a small fleet of ice breaking plows designed to clear sidewalks had begun to be deployed and would probably see more work on Friday as the temperature fell even further.
Earlier on Thursday, Plante had taken to Twitter to tell Montrealers that "All of our teams are at work to ensure the safety (of travellers) but the past few hours have brought a cocktail of weather that is making work difficult..."The priority is to clear sidewalks, spread abrasives and unblock sewers."
Plante added that the city would "evaluate the situation on an hourly basis and adjust our interventions to the changing conditions. We ask that you exercise extreme caution no matter what your mode of travel."
Toutes nos équipes sont à l'ouvre pour assurer la sécurité des déplacements mais les dernières heures ont amené un cocktail météo très varié qui rend les interventions difficiles. Priorité au déblaiement des trottoirs, à l'épandage d'abrasif et au déblocage des puisards. #polmtl( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polmtl?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

The mayor's update came less than 24 hours after city officials said the snow removal operation would be suspended pending expected showers of rain and freezing rain, in order for the snow to absorb the precipitation.
By Thursday morning, however, that plan was clearly sinking, as Montrealers woke up to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections resembling small ponds.
All Montreal island school boards cancelled classes and operations for Thursday while local road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) ranged from dodgy to downright treacherous. Water accumulation was the major challenge for motorists, with vehicles of any size running the risk of hydroplaning if they suddenly hit water patches at high speed.

Weather( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather )-related accidents were reported on Highways 440 and 15 in Laval, the Ville-Marie Tunnel and Highway 20 in Ste-Julie on the South Shore. Water accumulation was also reported on Highway 20 W. at the exit for 55th Ave. and on Highway 25 N. at Tellier St.
Montreal police( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-police ) closed the exit at 55th Ave. because of the danger the water represented, and also reported a serious accumulation of water in the Atwater Tunnel. They also recommend that motorists and pedestrians think twice about leaving the house Thursday, at least until conditions on roads and sidewalks improve.
And by mid-morning, local emergency wards and first responders were suggesting that advice ought to be followed.
Urgences Santé reported a 25-per-cent increase in calls overnight, likely the result of the icy weather.
"We had roughly 400 calls since midnight," Urgences Santé supervisor Valérie Tremblay said. "We've had many calls involving people falling on the sidewalks, car accidents, but no major injuries."
Tremblay urged people not to call 911 unless it's a serious emergency, but rather to phone the 811 Info-Santé line.
At the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, doctors treated three patients for ice-related injuries from 6 p.m. yesterday to 10 a.m. Thursday, including a 28-year-old woman who hurt her ankle, a 64-year-old man who fell on his arm and a 4-year-old child for bruises to the head.
At the McGill University Health Centre, two patients were treated for injuries.
"The Montreal General Hospital is the only one of our emergency departments that has seen such cases today (two of them), but that number is nothing out of the ordinary during the winter months," said Paul Logothetis, a spokesperson for the MUHC.

Surface public transit on Montreal island also suffered from the day's rain. The Société de transport de Montréal warned commuters to expect delays in bus service because of the road conditions, and that its buses may not be able to deploy their ramps allowing wheelchair access because of the accumulation of snow on sidewalks.
The transit authority also reported that because of the road conditions, that at least these bus lines #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm107 ) (Peel St.), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm94 ) (St-Joseph/Iberville), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm45 ) (on Papineau between Rosemont and St-Grégoire) and #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm196 ) (55th Ave./St-Laurent) were being rerouted.

As of 11 a.m., about three dozen flights out of Trudeau airport( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-pierre-elliott-trudeau-international-airport ) were listed as delayed or cancelled. Power failures( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) were reported in Montreal (2,715 clients affected), the Laurentians (8,869), Lanaudière (6,835) and Laval (3,737).

Thursday's forecast( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-622L ) calls for rain changing to snow this afternoon with a high of 5 C, with the temperature falling to zero later this afternoon.
However, the forecast for Thursday evening doesn't bode well for anyone who has to commute home: Snow will give way to local blowing snow, with a low of -17 C overnight.

Elsewhere in the province, the situation was equally daunting. Many parts of southern and eastern Quebec - particularly the Mauricie, Quebec City and Bas-St-Laurent regions - were being pelted by freezing rain, while rainfall warnings were issued for Sherbrooke and St-Georges.

The mayor predicted that the ongoing snow removal operation, originally expected to end by Friday, would only finish sometime next week.
Plante noted that despite a Tweeted message Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais on Thursday morning that his snow removal crews had been reduced because many were obliged to care for children marooned at home after local school commissions closed down because of the weather, staffing levels elsewhere in the city were at strength.
The mayor said also that a small fleet of ice breaking plows designed to clear sidewalks had begun to be deployed and would probably see more work on Friday as the temperature fell even further.
Earlier on Thursday, Plante had taken to Twitter to tell Montrealers that "All of our teams are at work to ensure the safety (of travellers) but the past few hours have brought a cocktail of weather that is making work difficult..."The priority is to clear sidewalks, spread abrasives and unblock sewers."
Plante added that the city would "evaluate the situation on an hourly basis and adjust our interventions to the changing conditions. We ask that you exercise extreme caution no matter what your mode of travel."
Toutes nos équipes sont à l'ouvre pour assurer la sécurité des déplacements mais les dernières heures ont amené un cocktail météo très varié qui rend les interventions difficiles. Priorité au déblaiement des trottoirs, à l'épandage d'abrasif et au déblocage des puisards. #polmtl( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polmtl?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

The mayor's update came less than 24 hours after city officials said the snow removal operation would be suspended pending expected showers of rain and freezing rain, in order for the snow to absorb the precipitation.
By Thursday morning, however, that plan was clearly sinking, as Montrealers woke up to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections resembling small ponds.
Even before Plante's update on Twitter, cracks were already beginning to appear in the original snow removal strategy. Earlier on Thursday, Montreal executive committee chairman and Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais took to Twitter( https://twitter.com/benoitdorais/status/1088415431163965441 ) to say that because of the school closures, many snow removal personnel in his borough were unable to come in to work. Dorais also noted that because of the rain's effect on local streets, clearing operations had been put on hold in order for abrasives to be spread on icy streets and for sewers to be cleared of snow so the accumulated water could drain.
All Montreal island school boards cancelled classes and operations for Thursday while local road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) ranged from dodgy to downright treacherous. Water accumulation was the major challenge for motorists, with vehicles of any size running the risk of hydroplaning if they suddenly hit water patches at high speed.

Weather( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather )-related accidents were reported on Highways 440 and 15 in Laval, the Ville-Marie Tunnel and Highway 20 in Ste-Julie on the South Shore. Water accumulation was also reported on Highway 20 W. at the exit for 55th Ave. and on Highway 25 N. at Tellier St.
Montreal police( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-police ) closed the exit at 55th Ave. because of the danger the water represented, and also reported a serious accumulation of water in the Atwater Tunnel. They also recommend that motorists and pedestrians think twice about leaving the house Thursday, at least until conditions on roads and sidewalks improve.
And by mid-morning, local emergency wards and first responders were suggesting that advice ought to be followed.
Urgences Santé reported a 25-per-cent increase in calls overnight, likely the result of the icy weather.
"We had roughly 400 calls since midnight," Urgences Santé supervisor Valérie Tremblay said. "We've had many calls involving people falling on the sidewalks, car accidents, but no major injuries."
Tremblay urged people not to call 911 unless it's a serious emergency, but rather to phone the 811 Info-Santé line.
At the Centre hospitalier de l'université de Montréal, doctors treated three patients for ice-related injuries from 6 p.m. yesterday to 10 a.m. Thursday, including a 28-year-old woman who hurt her ankle, a 64-year-old man who fell on his arm and a 4-year-old child for bruises to the head.
At the McGill University Health Centre, two patients were treated for injuries.
"The Montreal General Hospital is the only one of our emergency departments that has seen such cases today (two of them), but that number is nothing out of the ordinary during the winter months," said Paul Logothetis, a spokesperson for the MUHC.

Surface public transit on Montreal island is also suffering from the morning's rain. The Société de transport de Montréal is warning commuters to expect delays in bus service because of the road conditions, and that its buses may not be able to deploy their ramps allowing wheelchair access because of the accumulation of snow on sidewalks.
The transit authority also reported that because of the road conditions, that at least these bus lines #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm107 ) (Peel's hill), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm94 ) (St-Joseph/Iberville), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm45 ) (on Papineau between Rosemont and St-Grégoire) and #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm196 ) (55th Ave./St-Laurent) were being rerouted.

Power failures( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) were reported in Montreal (2,715 clients affected), the Laurentians (8,869), Lanaudière (6,835) and Laval (3,737).

Thursday's forecast( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-622L ) calls for rain changing to snow this afternoon with a high of 5 C, with the temperature falling to zero later this afternoon.
However, the forecast for Thursday evening doesn't bode well for anyone who has to commute home: Snow will give way to local blowing snow, with a low of -17 C overnight.

Full text: The city of Montreal's strategy to remove tonnes of snow dumped during a snowstorm last weekend slithered into a ditch Thursday morning, as a snowfall, freezing rain and incessant rain showers turned the removal operation into an ongoing attempt to literally keep pedestrians and motorists above water.
"All of our teams are at work to ensure the safety (of travellers) but the past few hours have brought a cocktail of weather that is making work difficult," Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante wrote on Twitter( https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/1088453350251614208 ).

Full text: The city of Montreal's strategy to remove tonnes of snow dumped during a snowstorm last weekend slithered into a ditch Thursday morning, as a snowfall, freezing rain and incessant rain showers turned the removal operation into an ongoing attempt to literally keep pedestrians and motorists above water.
"All of our teams are at work to ensure the safety (of travellers) but the past few hours have brought a cocktail of weather that is making work difficult," Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante wrote on Twitter. "The priority is to clear sidewalks, spread abrasives and unblock sewers."
Plante added that the city would "evaluate the situation on an hourly basis and adjust our interventions to the changing conditions. We ask that you exercise extreme caution no matter what your mode of travel."
The mayor's update came less than 24 hours after city officials said the snow removal operation would be suspended pending expected showers of rain and freezing rain, in order for the snow to absorb the precipitation.
By Thursday morning that plan was clearly sinking, as Montrealers woke up to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections like small ponds.
Even before Plante's update on Twitter, cracks were already beginning to appear in the snow removal strategy. Earlier on Thursday, Montreal executive committee chairman and Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais took to Twitter to say that because of the school closures, many snow removal personnel in his borough were unable to come in to work.

Full text: The city of Montreal's strategy to remove tonnes of snow dumped during a snowstorm last weekend slithered into a ditch Thursday morning, as a snowfall, freezing rain and incessant rain showers turned the removal operation into an ongoing attempt to literally keep pedestrians and motorists above water.
"All of our teams are at work to ensure the safety (of travellers) but the past few hours have brought a cocktail of weather that is making work difficult," Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante wrote on Twitter. "The priority is to clear sidewalks, spread abrasives and unblock sewers."
Plante added that the city would "evaluate the situation on an hourly basis and adjust our interventions to the changing conditions. We ask that you exercise extreme caution no matter what your mode of travel."
The mayor's update came less than 24 hours after city officials said the snow removal operation would be suspended pending expected showers of rain and freezing rain, in order for the snow to absorb the precipitation.
By Thursday morning that plan was clearly sinking, as Montrealers woke up to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections like small ponds.
Even before Plante's update on Twitter, cracks were already beginning to appear in the snow removal strategy. Earlier on Thursday, Montreal executive committee chairman and Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais took to Twitter to say that because of the school closures, many snow removal personnel in his borough were unable to come in to work. Dorais also noted that because of the rain's effect on local streets, clearing operations had been put on hold in order for abrasives to be spread on icy streets and for sewers to be cleared of snow so the accumulated water could drain.

Full text: If you don't have to go out today, stay home. But if you do have to go out, be very, very careful.
Montrealers woke up Thursday to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections like small ponds.
All Montreal island school boards have cancelled classes and operations for Thursday while local road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) range from dodgy to downright treacherous. Water accumulation is the major challenge for motorists, with vehicles of any size running the risk of aquaplaning if they suddenly hit water patches at high speed.
The intersection of Ste-Catherine and Metcalfe Sts. after a night of rain.
Weather( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather )-related accidents had already been reported on Highways 440 and 15 in Laval, the Ville-Marie Tunnel and Highway 20 in Ste-Julie on the South Shore. Water accumulation has also been reported on Highway 20 W. at the exit for 55th Ave. and on Highway 25 N. at Tellier St.
Montreal police( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-police ) said they had closed the exit at 55th Ave. because of the danger the water represented, and also reported a serious accumulation of water in the Atwater Tunnel. They also recommend that motorists and pedestrians think twice about leaving the house Thursday, at least until conditions on roads and sidewalks improve.
A city crew clears backed-up water from a bus stop at St-Joseph Blvd. and St-Urbain St. on Jan. 24, 2019.
Surface public transit on Montreal island is also suffering from the morning's rain. The Société de transport de Montréal is warning commuters to expect delays in bus service because of the road conditions, and that its buses may not be able to deploy their ramps allowing wheelchair access because of the accumulation of snow on sidewalks.
The transit authority also reported that because of the road conditions, bus lines #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm107 ) (Peel's hill), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm94 ) (St-Joseph/Iberville), #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm45 ) (on Papineau between Rosemont and St-Grégoire) and #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stm196 ) (55th Ave./St-Laurent) were being rerouted.
A parent and child walk home after learning school was cancelled in Montreal on Jan. 24, 2019.
As of 9 a.m., about three dozen flights out of Trudeau airport( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-pierre-elliott-trudeau-international-airport ) were listed as delayed. Power failures( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) were reported in the Laurentians (10,570 clients affected), Lanaudière (5,300 clients) and Laval (8,000 clients).
On Wednesday, the city of Montreal said its "strategy" for clearing the snow that had accumulated since Sunday was to wait for that snow to absorb Thursday's rain before beginning snow removal operations.
But cracks began to appear in that strategy early Thursday, as Montreal executive committee chairman and Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais took to Twitter to say that because of the school closures, many snow personnel in his borough were unable to come in to work. Dorais also noted that because of the rain's effect on local streets, clearing operations had been put on hold in order for abrasives to be spread on icy streets and for sewers to be cleared of snow so the accumulated water could drain.
Thursday's weather forecast( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-622L ) calls for rain changing to snow this afternoon with a high of 5 C, with the temperature falling to zero later this afternoon.
However, the forecast for Thursday evening doesn't bode well for anyone who has to commute home: snow will give way to local blowing snow, with a low of -17 C overnight.
Elsewhere in the province, the situation was equally daunting. Many parts of southern and eastern Quebec - particularly the Mauricie, Quebec City and Bas-Saint-Laurent regions - were being pelted by freezing rain, while rainfall warnings were issued for Sherbrooke and St-Georges.

Montreal weather: The next 24 hours will be a roller-coaster

Full text: Tap here for the most recent updates on the storm and its fallout. ( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-62aO )
Expect a wild weather ride over the next 24 hours.
On Wednesday, after about 10 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal, the temperature gradually rose and the snow turned to freezing rain in the evening.
It was expected to be followed by plain rain and even warmer weather, then yet more snow, according to Environment Canada's forecast.
The rain is to continue for much of Thursday when the high is forecast to reach 3 Celsius.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The mix of precipitation could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the city of Montreal's website indicated it has hauled away just over half of the snow that has fallen since Sunday whenabout 23 centimetres of snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) fell.
The freezing rain could force the city to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal," she told reporters. "But that's life and we have to deal with it."
She said "the city has to decide where to put the priority, and obviously if there is freezing rain, that means spreading salt and abrasives.
"So I can't tell you exactly what will happen. It's not a precise science. Snow removal and de-icing really depend on the weather and the ability of crews to act rapidly."
Wednesday's weather swing saw the temperature rise from minus-13 C at 8 a.m. to zero at 8 p.m.
More temperature fluctuations are expected in the coming days. Environment Canada is forecasting daytime highs of between minus-5 C and minus-15 C between Friday and Tuesday.
The recent temperature rollercoaster has caused problems for the $40-million light installation on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge. The system was not working for four days because of the dramatic temperature changes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lights-out-cold-snap-has-shut-down-jacques-cartier-bridge-light-show ).
After repairs, it was back in operation on Tuesday night.

Full text: Expect a wild weather ride over the next 24 hours.
On Wednesday, after about 10 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal, the temperature gradually rose and the snow turned to freezing rain in the evening.
It was expected to be followed by plain rain and even warmer weather, then yet more snow, according to Environment Canada's forecast.
The rain is to continue for much of Thursday when the high is forecast to reach 3 Celsius.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The mix of precipitation could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the city of Montreal's website indicated it has hauled away just over half of the snow that has fallen since Sunday when about 23 centimetres of snow fell.
The freezing rain could force the city to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal," she told reporters. "But that's life and we have to deal with it."

According to an Environment Canada weather alert( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), snow will turn to freezing rain and then to plain rain, as the temperature rises to an unseasonably warm 3 Celsius. Then the snow will start again.
As of 5 p.m., with the temperature hovering around -7 C, snow was falling in Montreal.
But Environment Canada said it was expected to turn to freezing rain within a few hours.
Then, around midnight, with the temperature above freezing, rain was expected to start.
That rain is to continue for much of Thursday when the high is forecast to reach 3 C.
Late Thursday afternoon, the rain should turn to snow as the temperature starts falling, Environment Canada said. The low for Thursday night is expected to be about -11 C.
The weather could wreak havoc with the city of Montreal's snow-clearing operation.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the city said just under half of 23 centimetres of snow that fell on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) had been hauled away.
The freezing rain could force the city of Montreal to slow or suspend snow-removal if streets and sidewalks are covered by a sheet of ice, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday.
"We wish this weren't coming because we are still carrying out snow removal, she told journalists after giving a speech to entrepreneurs at Place Bonaventure.

Environment Canada is forecasting about five fresh centimetres of snow for Wednesday, probably followed by freezing rain and then rain.
"It's still early to get into details, but there's a good probability that we're going to see freezing rain - it could be late Wednesday afternoon or early evening," said meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Rain is then expected between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Parent said.
"It's a couple of systems that are merging together," he said.
"The snow that we're going to get on Wednesday is an approaching system over the Great Lakes, but there's a development over the Eastern seaboard and it's bringing the rain and warmer temperatures."
Highs of zero and -2 C are forecast for Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
Colder weather will return by Thursday night, when the low is expected to be -11 C.
About 23 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal on Sunday.
The city of Montreal began removing snow Monday. The operation is expected to take about a week.

Storm rolls over Central, Eastern Canada: Ontario and Quebec get first big bite of winter weather while rain, wind batter Maritimes

Full text: A nasty winter storm spent Sunday thrashing parts of Central Canada and the Maritimes as officials braced for the fallout from as much as 50 centimetres of snow in some areas and flash flooding in others.
New Brunswick was expected to shoulder the worst of the snowfall, but climbing temperatures also threatened freezing rain and later up to 40 millimetres of rain in some areas. Environment Canada warned residents in the Fundy coast regions to be aware that strong downpours and rapid snowmelt can trigger flash floods.
Geoffrey Downey, a spokesperson for the province's department of public safety, said localized flooding is always a concern when it rains and the ground is frozen.
He recommended that homeowners clear out any debris from drains around their property. Of equal concern, he said, is the risk of freezing rain because of its effect on infrastructure, such as power lines.
"There are parts of the province that are still quite cold, so if people start losing power and the temperature drops again, that's where we really have to be concerned about people's safety," he said.
The weekend storm caused flight delays and cancellations across affected areas, as well as some ferry service interruption.
Police cautioned drivers to postpone unnecessary travel.
For Central Canada, this weekend brought the first real bite of winter. In Quebec, a section of the Trans-Canada Highway near the New Brunswick border was closed on Sunday, and Montreal's annual Fête des neiges event was cancelled because of extreme cold weather. (It will resume Saturday.)
Much of Ontario was under an extreme weather advisory, with Ottawa residents juggling both an extreme cold alert and a winter storm warning. About 25 centimetres of snow was expected on the weekend. As of Sunday evening, the frigid air hit Arctic cold, with warnings of -35 C to -40 C temperatures with the wind chill.
The Ontario Provincial Police recorded 350 collisions in the Greater Toronto Area between Saturday and Sunday afternoon, while Toronto police clocked just less than 100.
In Toronto, temperatures were forecast to dip as low as -23 C overnight Sunday, or -36 C with the wind chill. The cold snap brought a 96-per-cent increase in service calls for furnace and hot water issues compared with last Sunday, said Mike Kolatschek, a communications manager with Reliance Home Comfort.
It is the coldest stretch that Southern Ontario has seen so far this year, said Peter Kimbell, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada.
"And the cold is not going away," he said. Although the temperature is expected to climb back above 0 C around Wednesday, Mr. Kimbell says all the signs point to a return to chilly conditions in Southern Ontario after that. "It's winter time. Expect it to be cold. It is cold," he said.
Toronto's shelters, meanwhile, will continue to operate under extreme cold alert procedures until at least Tuesday, said Todd Orvitz, director of strategic policy and solutions at Shelter, Support and Housing Administration.
Additional beds have been made available at Metro Hall and other emergency respite areas across the city.
"Last night, everybody who sought service or asked us for a referral received a space to stay. We consider that is a success," he said, adding that if an individual arrives at a shelter that's at capacity, the city can provide transportation to another location during these extreme temperature conditions.
"Some people prefer to travel on their own and in those cases we'll provide them with TTC [transit] tokens to get to the additional site."
In Nova Scotia, rain and wind battered the province, with the frozen ground again creating the potential for treacherous driving conditions and possible localized flooding in low areas.
In parts of Prince Edward Island, a winter storm and wind alert remained in effect Sunday evening, with Environment Canada warning of freezing rain, ice pellets and gusts up to 90 kilometres an hour. "The accumulated snow on the frozen ground combined with the expected rainfall of at least 20 mm and milder temperatures tonight followed by rapidly falling temperatures with risk of freezing rain and flash freeze conditions on Monday could lead to treacherous conditions," an advisory cautioned.
In Winnipeg, where temperatures hit a low of -27 C, Monday was expected to bring slightly warmer weather - although warmer in Winnipeg is still -15 C with a chance of flurries.

Full text: The city of Montreal is to launch partial snow-clearing operations Friday morning, a day after a 2-cm snowfall was expected to cover sidewalks and streets.
Snowplows and snow-clearing trucks will fan out across the city as of 7 a.m. At the same time, workers will continue to spread abrasives to ensure the safety of pedestrians and motorists, the city announced in a statement.
The snow-clearing will proceed in the following boroughs: Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Anjou, Lachine, Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal North, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles, St-Laurent and St-Léonard.
The city noted the amount of snow expected on Thursday varied from borough to borough. In its statement, the city did not include the boroughs of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce or Ville-Marie, among others.
City officials were not immediately available to comment on why some boroughs were not mentioned in the snow-clearing statement.
In November, city officials vowed to improve snow-clearing with drones and bigger dump sites.
Montrealers can follow snow-clearing operations by visiting ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement ).

Full text: Montreal police are investigating the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a 35-year-old man in Lachine early Tuesday morning after believing initially that he died after slipping on an icy street.
"There were some new elements that were brought to the attention of the investigators that caused them to reopen the investigation," said Const. Jean-Pierre Brabant, a spokesperson for the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
"It's now considered to be a suspicious death. The investigators are on the scene to know exactly what happened to the man."
At approximately 4 a.m., police and Urgences Santé responded to a 911 call, and found the man lying near a parked car on Provost St. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Provost was closed between 25th and 32nd Aves. Earlier Tuesday, police said the probable cause of death was an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.
A freezing rain warning had been issued midday Monday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-warning-issued-for-montreal-area ) by Environment Canada. While the warning is no longer posted, road and sidewalks were still icy early Tuesday.

Full text: Montreal police are investigating the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a 35-year-old man in Lachine early Tuesday morning after believing initially that he died after slipping on an icy street.
"There were some new elements that were brought to the attention of the investigators that caused them to reopen the investigation," said Const. Jean-Pierre Brabant, a spokesperson for the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
"It's now considered to be a suspicious death. The investigators are on the scene to know exactly what happened to the man."
At approximately 4 a.m., police and Urgences Santé responded to a 911 call, and found the man lying near a parked car on Provost St. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Provost was closed between 25th and 32nd Aves. Earlier Tuesday, police said the probable cause of death was an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.
A freezing rain warning had been issued midday Monday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-warning-issued-for-montreal-area ) by Environment Canada. While the warning is no longer posted, road and sidewalks were still icy early Tuesday.

At approximately 4 a.m., Montreal police and Urgences Santé responding to a 911 call found a 35-year-old man lying near a parked car on Provost Ave. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Provost was closed between 25th and 32nd Aves. while police continue their investigation, but no criminal involvement is so far suspected. Police said the probable cause is an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.

Full text: While thousands of Montrealers are expected to take to the highways and roads Monday night as part of their efforts to welcome 2019, they'll be doing so under conditions that are expected to be potentially hazardous.
Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, with the first precipitation expected early Monday evening and continuing throughout the night.
The federal agency notes that "surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions."
Monday's daytime forecast calls for mainly cloudy skies with a 60 per cent chance of flurries Monday morning and a high of -2 C and a windchill of -11.
On Monday night, snow beginning this evening will change to freezing rain then down to rain before Tuesday morning. About two to four centimetres of precipitation are expected.

Full text: Mother Nature has New Year's Eve plans, and they centre around a snow storm and possible freezing rain due to hit southwest and central Quebec on Monday night.
Two low pressure systems, one coming from western Canada and the other from the southern United States, are expected to join forces over the Great Lakes and head towards Quebec.
Much of the province could be on the receiving end of 10 and 20 centimetres of snowfall, with Montreal expecting 5-10.
According to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada, "the Montreal region and southern regions may experience some freezing rain."
If the storm stays on track to hit Montreal, getting around on New Year's Eve could be complicated( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-metro-will-pull-an-all-nighter-for-new-years-eve ).

Full text: Sometimes a photographer's assignment is very specific, such as "construction of the Champlain Bridge." Other times, it's incredibly vague: "There is freezing rain. Tell us a story." Somewhere in the middle, experience and happenstance collide in the perfect shot.
Here are our photographers' favourite shots of 2018.
Pierre Obendrauf: 'And then they kissed'
May 6, 2018.
I was walking around downtown looking for pictures between two assignments - Place des Festivals always brings out people. I saw Mikael Gervais and Laurence Crete on the other side of the fountain, enjoying a romantic weekend away from their hometown, Gatineau. I took pictures of them talking, looking at maps, drinking water - and then they kissed.
March 15, 2018.
More than 200 dogs were rescued from a dog-meat farm in South Korea. They were going crazy because of all the media present, so to try to get a sense of what they might be feeling in their new environment, I focused on one: Sunny, the Korean jindo, who was being held by Humane Society International's Chantal Ducharme. I got on my stomach and I could sense he could smell my three cats on my clothes. So then I played with his inquisitiveness and was lucky enough to get it to work.
Jan. 23, 2018.
Freezing rain hit the city overnight and we needed something early for the web. Marie-Philippe Bois was already well underway de-icing her vehicle and she was gracious enough to let me get inside her car to get this picture.
John Mahoney: When it all comes together
Aug. 29, 2018.
It was a double bill: Deep Purple and Judas Priest at the Bell Centre, and I could take pictures during the first three songs of each band's performance. Usually when I shoot a concert, I make sure to get a good selection of pictures of the lead singer and only then do I shoot the supporting musicians. Just when I started looking for pictures of guitarist Richie Faulkner, they unleashed the smoke machine - and with some backlight on Faulkner's sunglasses, the picture came together.
July 5, 2018.
I was assigned to photograph Olivia Lavallee at her home on the South Shore for a sports column by Stu Cowan about her swimming in the World Down Syndrome Championship in Nova Scotia. I hoped I'd be able to get a photo of her in a pool, so I made sure my GoPro camera had a full charge. But the only place to get her in water was in the family's above-ground pool in their backyard. I had Olivia swim back and forth across the round pool, sticking the underwater camera in the water and firing as many frames as I could without being able to see exactly what the camera was capturing. At one point, Olivia stopped to reposition her swim goggles and that made the best frame.
May 8, 2018
When a couple of busloads of senior citizens arrived at the Russian consul general's residence for a ceremony commemorating the end of the Second World War, I was immediately drawn to these two gentlemen wearing their veterans' uniforms and chests-full of medals. Before the ceremony, they engaged in a lively conversation and I had my photo. Only afterward did I learn that David Ficherman, on the left, was 103 years old, and his friend Shulin Grinberg was 96.
Dave Sidaway: Now that's a lot of construction
April 6, 2018.
Transport Quebec crews start to assemble huge scaffolding on the east side of the St-Jacques St. overpass. Three of my favourite photos this year are of major construction sites - Montreal hasn't seen this much major construction at the same time in decades.
Oct. 25, 2018.
The main structure of the new Champlain Bridge should be completed by Dec. 21, but it won't be open to traffic until the summer of 2019.
May 8, 2018.
The Société de transport de Montréal is building an underground garage at the Côte-Vertu station on the métro's Orange Line. It's expected to be finished in 2021 at a cost of $330 million.
Allen McInnis: Heat waves and ice
July 27, 2018.
I generally do not like shooting concerts. Photographers are often micro-managed by the PR teams working for the bands, and photo opportunities can be limited. AFI was high energy on stage - when I saw Hunter Burgan climb on a speaker, I didn't take my eyes off him. When he leaped off, I knew I had at least one good one.
July 23, 2018.
Montreal was in the middle of a heat wave. While walking along the Lachine Canal, I saw the misting station at Atwater Market and this young girl, Anokhi, who was enjoying the mist as her father, Arijit Nandi, lifted her to the peak of the stream.
Feb. 10, 2018.
Nashville Predators defenceman P.K. Subban has words with Montreal Canadiens right wing Brendan Gallagher after being driven into the boards by Gallagher during NHL action in Montreal. I wasn't on the schedule to shoot hockey that night, but really wanted to be there for the return of P.K. Shooting through a small hole in the glass, where only a portion of the rink is viewable, I was lucky that this transpired right in front of my window to the rink.

Full text: Sometimes a photographer's assignment is very specific, such as "construction of the Champlain Bridge." Other times, it's incredibly vague: "There is freezing rain. Tell us a story." Somewhere in the middle, experience and happenstance collide in the perfect shot.
Here are our photographers' favourite shots of 2018.
Pierre Obendrauf: 'And then they kissed'
May 6, 2018.
I was walking around downtown looking for pictures between two assignments - Place des Festivals always brings out people. I saw Mikael Gervais and Laurence Crete on the other side of the fountain, enjoying a romantic weekend away from their hometown, Gatineau. I took pictures of them talking, looking at maps, drinking water - and then they kissed.
March 15, 2018.
More than 200 dogs were rescued from a dog-meat farm in South Korea. They were going crazy because of all the media present, so to try to get a sense of what they might be feeling in their new environment, I focused on one: Sunny, the Korean jindo, who was being held by Humane Society International's Chantal Ducharme. I got on my stomach and I could sense he could smell my three cats on my clothes. So then I played with his inquisitiveness and was lucky enough to get it to work.
Jan. 23, 2018.
Freezing rain hit the city overnight and we needed something early for the web. Marie-Philippe Bois was already well underway de-icing her vehicle and she was gracious enough to let me get inside her car to get this picture.
John Mahoney: When it all comes together
Aug. 29, 2018.
It was a double bill: Deep Purple and Judas Priest at the Bell Centre, and I could take pictures during the first three songs of each band's performance. Usually when I shoot a concert, I make sure to get a good selection of pictures of the lead singer and only then do I shoot the supporting musicians. Just when I started looking for pictures of guitarist Richie Faulkner, they unleashed the smoke machine - and with some backlight on Faulkner's sunglasses, the picture came together.
July 5, 2018.
I was assigned to photograph Olivia Lavallee at her home on the South Shore for a sports column by Stu Cowan about her swimming in the World Down Syndrome Championship in Nova Scotia. I hoped I'd be able to get a photo of her in a pool, so I made sure my GoPro camera had a full charge. But the only place to get her in water was in the family's above-ground pool in their backyard. I had Olivia swim back and forth across the round pool, sticking the underwater camera in the water and firing as many frames as I could without being able to see exactly what the camera was capturing. At one point, Olivia stopped to reposition her swim goggles and that made the best frame.
May 8, 2018
When a couple of busloads of senior citizens arrived at the Russian consul general's residence for a ceremony commemorating the end of the Second World War, I was immediately drawn to these two gentlemen wearing their veterans' uniforms and chests-full of medals. Before the ceremony, they engaged in a lively conversation and I had my photo. Only afterward did I learn that David Ficherman, on the left, was 103 years old, and his friend Shulin Grinberg was 96.
Dave Sidaway: Now that's a lot of construction
April 6, 2018.
Transport Quebec crews start to assemble huge scaffolding on the east side of the St-Jacques St. overpass. Three of my favourite photos this year are of major construction sites - Montreal hasn't seen this much major construction at the same time in decades.
Oct. 25, 2018.
The main structure of the new Champlain Bridge should be completed by Dec. 21, but it won't be open to traffic until the summer of 2019.
May 8, 2018.
The Société de transport de Montréal is building an underground garage at the Côte-Vertu station on the métro's Orange Line. It's expected to be finished in 2021 at a cost of $330 million.
Allen McInnis: Heat waves and ice
July 27, 2018.
I generally do not like shooting concerts. Photographers are often micro-managed by the PR teams working for the bands, and photo opportunities can be limited. AFI was high energy on stage - when I saw Hunter Burgan climb on a speaker, I didn't take my eyes off him. When he leaped off, I knew I had at least one good one.
July 23, 2018.
Montreal was in the middle of a heat wave. While walking along the Lachine Canal, I saw the misting station at Atwater Market and this young girl, Anokhi, who was enjoying the mist as her father, Arijit Nandi, lifted her to the peak of the stream.
Feb. 10, 2018.
Nashville Predators defenceman P.K. Subban has words with Montreal Canadiens right wing Brendan Gallagher after being driven into the boards by Gallagher during NHL action in Montreal. I wasn't on the schedule to shoot hockey that night, but really wanted to be there for the return of P.K. Shooting through a small hole in the glass, where only a portion of the rink is viewable, I was lucky that this transpired right in front of my window to the rink.

Snow machines busy at ski hills

Author: Magder, Jason

Full text: Quebec ski hills have been suffering from what they call sidewalk syndrome - when local skiers see green lawns and bare sidewalks and elect to stay home.
"I got pictures from Mont Sutton today, and it looks like a picture perfect Christmas over there, but sitting in Montreal you can't imagine that this could be the case," said Yves Juneau, the CEO of the Quebec Ski Area Association.
Despite an abundance of snow in early November that saw many hills opened at 100 per cent in the early season, operators are no
w in consolidation mode, making snow, spreading it out with grooming machines and hoping for more wintry weather.
"We were off to a fantastic start with a cold month of November and tons of snow," Juneau said. "This is something we don't see often."
However, a thaw last week, and a day of rain forced many ski hills to close for a day or two to save the snow they have, and then reopen with artificial snow.
Most area ski hills are now reporting hard-packed surfaces, but Juneau said the fact there has not been a major snowfall in more than a month is merely a perception problem.
"Snow (in the city) is a great marketing campaign, but what we really need is sustained cold temperatures so we can make snow," he said. "That's why you see Mont St-Bruno (which is the closest hill to Montreal) has close to 100 per cent of its trails open. Even though we had that thaw, we were able to bounce back because of snow making."
The freezing rain, rain and warm temperatures in the forecast for most of the province on Friday is decidedly bad marketing, Juneau conceded. Still, he said he doesn't believe the wet weather will put a huge damper on ski conditions.
"When you're at 3,000 feet in altitude, like in Mont Tremblant, I can pretty much guarantee the mountain will get some snow even though at the base it will be liquid precipitation," he said.
Juneau said the Christmas to New Year's period is critical for ski hills, accounting for about 25 per cent of the season's business. Ski hills that are also vacation resorts, like Bromont or Mont Tremblant, have been faring better, because they don't depend as much on the whims local skiers, relying instead on people who book their ski vacations weeks or months in advance.
He said frigid temperatures at the same time last year were probably more difficult for ski hill operators, who saw a 20 per cent decline over the previous year.
There could be some good news on the horizon for skiers, as Environment Canada is forecasting snow for New Year's Eve on Monday.
Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent said there will be freezing rain in the Montreal area, but areas north of the city should just see snow. "In the Laurentians, it's not impossible to have 10 to 15 centimetres of snow, but it's too soon to tell," Parent said. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder

The freezing rain, rain and warm temperatures in the forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/expect-freezing-rain-by-friday-morning-environment-canada-warns-montrealers ) for most of the province on Friday is decidedly bad marketing, Juneau conceded. Still, he said he doesn't believe the wet weather will put a huge damper on ski conditions.
"When you're at 3,000 feet in altitude, like in Mont Tremblant, I can pretty much guarantee the mountain will get some snow even though at the base it will be liquid precipitation," he said.
Juneau said the Christmas to New Year's period is critical for ski hills, accounting for about 25 per cent of the season's business. Ski hills that are also vacation resorts, like Bromont or Mont Tremblant, have been faring better, because they don't depend as much on the whims local skiers, relying instead on people who book their ski vacations weeks or months in advance.
He said frigid temperatures at the same time last year were probably more difficult for ski hill operators, who saw a 20 per cent decline over the previous year.
"It's hard to imagine it will be as bad as last year," Juneau said.
There could be some good news on the horizon for skiers, as Environment Canada is forecasting snow for New Year's Eve on Monday.
Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent said there will be freezing rain in the Montreal area, but areas north of the city should just see snow.
"In the Laurentians, it's not impossible to have 10 to 15 centimetres of snow, but it's too soon to tell," Parent said.

Full text: Montrealers woke up Thursday to a frigid wind chill of minus-18 Celsius under mostly clear skies, but over the next 24 hours the temperature is expected to creep up, turning long-hoped-for snow into freezing rain.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and the Longueuil areas. Although it could snow after midnight, the precipitation is expected to turn to rain by dawn. It is expected to last about two hours and leave one to three millimetres on the roads, just in time for rush hour.
Temperatures will continue to climb, with a forecast high of 7 C Friday. The rain will continue to Saturday, which could reach 3 C. Will we have a white New Year's Eve? It's possible - Environment Canada is optimistically predicting periods of snow for Monday. But that's four days away - let's just get through the rest of 2018 safely first.

Montrealers can add a smog warning to the freezing-rain warning

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for the greater Montreal area, forecasting 10 to 20 millimetres of freezing rain starting Thursday evening and continuing overnight.
Around noon, the federal agency added a smog warning to the roster( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ). It predicts the smog will dissipate in the late evening as winds pick up - and by then, the rain should have started.
The freezing rain system will be felt first over southwestern Quebec before moving into the eastern half of the province Friday morning.
Areas just north of the St. Lawrence River are expected to be most affected by the precipitation. The freezing rain is expected to change to rain over the course of Friday and major rainfall accumulations could occur.
Travel is not recommended. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
André Monette, chief meteorologist at Météomédia, said the province can expect to see 30 to 60 millimetres of rain by Saturday morning( https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/meteo/quebec/montreal ).
Those rains and mild temperatures virtually ensure any region that doesn't already have a thick covering of snow - such as Montreal - will not be having a white Christmas.
Monette forecasts good weather for the holiday week, with temperatures slightly below normal.
Météomédia meanwhile is monitoring a system that could create a cocktail of weather conditions by Dec. 28 of Dec. 29.
The temperature is expected to drop to minus 2 C Thursday night before climbing to 6 C on Friday, with freezing rain or rain forecast for most of the day.

Full text: With freezing rain in the forecast, and holidays approaching, the Jacques Cartier Bridge's multipurpose path - used mostly by cyclists - closed for the winter as of Thursday night.
The weather forecast called for freezing rain to begin Thursday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-temperatures-climb ), but for a warmer than seasonal Friday. Despite the lack of winter weather, the path closed because the bridge authority has not figured out how to keep the path open safely during the winter months( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-cyclists-gaining-more-respect-on-montreal-bike-paths ).
This is not for a lack of trying. Last year, the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated, the federal body that oversees bridge operations, embarked on a $1.67-million pilot project( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jacques-cartier-bridge-bike-path-to-be-cleared-this-winter-but-closed-to-cyclists ) to routinely clear snow from the path in hopes of finding a conclusive way to keep it free of snow and ice. Though the bridge was being cleared, cyclists were still not permitted to ride on it. The results of the pilot project were not conclusive, and the bridge authority will try once again this season to iron out the kinks in its snow-removal operations.
The path will reopen in spring 2019 once the bridge authority deems it safe.

Full text: Environment Canada on Thursday issued a freezing rain warning for the greater Montreal area, forecasting 10 to 20 millimetres of freezing rain starting Thursday evening and continuing overnight.
Around noon, the federal agency added a smog warning to the roster( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ). It predicts the smog will dissipate in the late evening as winds pick up - and by then, the rain should have started.
The freezing rain system will be felt first over southwestern Quebec before moving into the eastern half of the province Friday morning.
Areas just north of the St. Lawrence River are expected to be most affected by the precipitation. The freezing rain is expected to change to rain over the course of Friday and major rainfall accumulations could occur.
Travel is not recommended. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
André Monette, chief meteorologist at Météomédia, said the province can expect to see 30 to 60 millimetres of rain by Saturday morning( https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/meteo/quebec/montreal ).
Those rains and mild temperatures virtually ensure any region that doesn't already have a thick covering of snow - such as Montreal - will not be having a white Christmas.
Monette forecasts good weather for the holiday week, with temperatures slightly below normal.
Météomédia meanwhile is monitoring a system that could create a cocktail of weather conditions by Dec. 28 of Dec. 29.
A maximum temperature of 0 C is forecast for Thursday during the day with a mix of sun and cloud. The temperature is expected to drop to minus 2 C Thursday night before climbing to 6 C on Friday, with freezing rain or rain forecast for most of the day.

Full text: Environment Canada on Thursday issued a freezing rain warning for the greater Montreal area, forecasting 10 to 20 millimetres of freezing rain starting Thursday evening and continuing overnight.
The freezing rain system will be felt first over southwestern Quebec before moving into the eastern half of the province Friday morning.
Areas just north of the St. Lawrence River are expected to be most affected by the precipitation. The freezing rain is expected to change to rain over the course of Friday and major rainfall accumulations could occur.
Travel is not recommended. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
A maximum temperature of 0 Celsius is forecast for Thursday during the day with a mix of sun and cloud. The temperature is expected to drop to minus 2 Celsius Thursday night before climbing to 6 Celsius on Friday, with freezing rain or rain forecast for most of the day.

Calling for a major overhaul of the fund that has an accumulated surplus of $949.3 million, the Conseil de gestion du Fonds vert (CGFV), which oversees the operation, says more than half of its programs need to be revised, re-evaluated or just scrapped because they are not helping.

Full text: The Montreal area is expected to be hit with freezing rain Thursday at around 10 p.m. lasting until about 7 a.m. Friday, according to Environment Canada's( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) latest forecast.
A low-pressure system from the Gulf of Mexico should reach Quebec by Thursday evening, and it should dump between 20 to 30 millimetres of precipitation on Montreal.
"We're expecting quite a lot of precipitation with the system," said Dominic Martel, an Environment Canada meteorologist. "It should start with five to 10 millimetres of freezing rain."
Sidewalks and streets are expected to turn into sheets of ice overnight, but by 7 a.m. the temperature will start rising about the freezing mark, possibly reaching a high of 8 degrees Celsius by 3 p.m.
It will continue raining until midday Saturday, Martel said.

Freezing rain warning lifted for Montreal

Full text: A freezing rain warning issued by Environment Canada for Montreal( https://www.weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ), the Laurentians and the Eastern Townships was lifted on Sunday morning as temperatures rose above freezing.
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/this-weekends-freezing-rain-isnt-done-yet-environment-canada-warns ) posted a freezing rain warning for Montreal and much of Quebec on Sunday.
The warning( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-133_metric_e.html ) remains in place for areas including Temiscamingue, Mont-Tremblant and Quebec City. "It should persist for those areas until later this evening or later tonight," said Ivan Dubé of Environment Canada.
Freezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces. Drivers are urged to avoid unnecessary trips, and to adjust their driving to road conditions as surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots become icy, slippery and hazardous.
In Montreal, it will be foggy this evening and overnight and there could be a bit of rain as temperatures remain above freezing overnight. But they will drop from Monday night into Tuesday, so puddles that have not dried up by then could freeze.
Temperatures will be cooler than average for Tuesday and Wednesday, Dubé said, with a low of minus 11 degrees Celsius expected for Tuesday night into Wednesday.

Full text: Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/this-weekends-freezing-rain-isnt-done-yet-environment-canada-warns ) posted a freezing rain warning for Montreal and much of Quebec on Sunday.
Freezing rain across southwestern Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) in the morning will spread to central parts of the province in the afternoon. The affected areas include Greater Montreal, the Laurentians, Abitibi, Eastern Townships, South Shore to the U.S. border, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Drummondville and central Quebec.
Between 2 to 5 millimetres of freezing precipitation is expected in those regions, reaching up to 10 millimetres in some areas north of the St. Lawrence River.
Drivers are urged to avoid unnecessary trips, and to adjust their driving to road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ). Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.
Freezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.

Montreal weather: Smog alert continues and freezing rain on the way

Full text: At least the daytime part of Saturday is looking pretty good - unless you are elderly or asthmatic or suffering from heart disease, in which case the continuing smog alert will make the whole day thoroughly unpleasant and you should stay indoors.
Environment Canada, which issued the smog warning Friday that was expected to extend into Saturday, said wood heating in winter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-wood-burning-ban-starts-oct-1-what-you-need-to-know ) is the main source of the particles, "more than industrial activities and transportation."
Also issued Friday was a weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning of freezing rain later in the day, which we can blame on a Colorado low. That freezing rain is expected to change to rain, but that switch could cause icy patches, so be cautious on the streets and sidewalks.
During the day, there will be a mix of sun and cloud and a high of 2 C. An east wind will pick up around midnight making the -1 C feel like -7 C.
Early next week, the federal meteorological agency expects temperatures around 5 C and more rain. If all goes according to plan, we should see the sun again by Tuesday.

Full text: Freezing rain slickly coated roads and sidewalks across southwestern Quebec overnight, and Environment Canada warns this downpour is due to continue Sunday morning.
The agency's alert( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#200257307386478079201811230504ww1070cwul ) for Montreal and the surrounding areas now forecasts between two and five millimetres of freezing rain.
Hydro-Québec is listing a few minor power outages( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/#bis ) across its network, but as of 8:30 a.m. none of them are in Montreal.
Temperatures in southern Quebec are expected to climb above the freezing point on Sunday and Monday. As that happens, the freezing rain is expected to give way to simple rain.

Full text: By 9 a.m., it was minus-15 Celsius in Montreal, breaking a record set in 1972, when the low was minus-14.4C. With the wind chill, this Nov. 22 feels like minus-26.
That's approximately the temperature at which your nose hairs freeze. And when you go indoors, your glasses fog up. Normals for this day are a high of 3 C and low of minus-4 C.
Still, it's a lot balmier than the coldest place in Canada on Thursday, which is Thomsen River, NT, at minus-38 C. They won't get much relief this week, but we will.
The temperature in the Montreal area should ease back up in the next few days. According to Environment Canada, the high on Friday will be minus-6 C, then minus-1 C on Saturday. Sunday, as temperature rises and precipitation falls, we could see freezing rain.
The early part of next week is expected to be above freezing, with some rain or light snow possible at the beginning of the workweek.

Full text: Shovelling, driving, power-failure survival guide
Shovelling can be bad for your back - and your heart.
Shovelling
Shovellers have more to fear than ill-timed city snow plows undoing hours of work.
The combination of physical exertion and cold weather can increase the risk of a heart attack, especially in inactive people and those with heart disease.
"Scooping heavy, wet snow raises your heart rate quickly," the Heart and Stroke Foundation warns. "Add in cold temperatures that raise blood pressure and increase the likelihood of developing blood clots, and it can be deadly."
If you load your shovel with five kilograms of snow every five seconds, you'll have moved almost 1,000 kg of snow after 15 minutes. That's hard on the heart and the back.
Here are some shovelling tips( https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/snow_shovelling.html ) from the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety:
. Pace yourself( http://blog.heartandstroke.ca/2016/01/shovel-smart-this-winter/ ). Take frequent breaks and drink warm, non-alcoholic beverages.
. Push snow rather than lift it.
. If you must throw snow, only pick up as much snow as you can easily lift. Then, rather than twist at the waist, turn your feet toward the direction at which you're aiming.
. Avoid overheating; wear thin, breathable layers.
. Don't shovel on a full stomach. Digest your meals first; otherwise, shovelling could put an extra strain on your heart.
. Stop shovelling if you experience sudden shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, light-headedness, nausea, dizziness, or severe headache and immediately seek medical attention.
Shovels should:
. Be light (about 1.5 kilograms or 3 pounds), and sturdy.
. Feature a handle that reaches the users's chest to reduce forward bending.
. Include a shaft with a bend.
. Have the right blade for the job at hand. A large push-style shovel will let you move more snow but may lead you to lift heavy loads. Smaller blades are best for lifting and throwing snow.
Slowing down on snow and ice will give your tires more time to grip the road.
Driving
Before you drive in wintry weather, consider these tips from CAA-Québec and Transport Canada:
. Remove all snow( https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/safevehicles-safetyfeatures-winterdriving-index-693.htm ) from your vehicle's hood, roof, windows and lights. Clear windows of frost and fog.
. Get a tune-up( https://www.caaquebec.com/en/storage/graffiti-some-tips-for-prevention-and-cleaning/winter-driving-tips/ ), including an inspection of electrical components, as well as air-intake, fuel, exhaust, ignition, cooling system and windshield wipers.
. Slow down on snow and ice. Your tires will have more time to grip the road. Give yourself extra travel time in bad weather.
. Avoid using cruise control on slippery roads.
. Always turn the steering wheel slowly to retain control.
. Front-wheel skids are often caused by excessive speed on a turn or the wheels locking up. If you find yourself in a front-wheel skid, gently ease up on the accelerator or brake pedal and steer in the direction of the turn while looking in the direction you want to go.
. For rear-wheel skids, turn the front wheels in the direction in which the back end has started swinging, while looking in the direction you want to go.
. Be alert for deceptive conditions. Invisible black ice can form when the temperature hovers around zero, especially on bridges, overpasses and underpasses. In rural areas, road conditions can change quickly from dry to snowy or ice-covered.
. Leave more space than normal between your car and the one ahead of you to give yourself time to respond if an emergency arises.
. Prepare an emergency kit for your trunk. It should include a shovel, a snow brush, a scraper, traction aids, booster cables, windshield-washer fluid, a reflective vest, a battery-free flashlight, basic tools, a first-aid kit, a warm blanket and some non-perishable snacks.
Hydro-Québec says storms, snow, freezing rain and winds are some of the main causes of power failures.
Home emergency kit
Authorities suggest you prepare a home kit with basic supplies( https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/yprprdnssgd/index-en.aspx ) that can help you take care of yourself and your family for 72 hours in case of an emergency such as an extended power failure.
Heavy snow and freezing rain can take down power lines, though Hydro-Québec says power outages are actually more common in the summer.
What should your emergency kit include?
Here are some basic( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/be-prepared-for-power-outage/index.html#conseils ) supplies suggested( http://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/family-safety-plan/emergency-kit.html ) by Public Safety Canada, Hydro-Québec and Quebec's public-security department.

Full text: The show begins at midnight.
Environment Canada predicts that Monday's increasing cloud cover will give way to snow mixed with rain as the clock strikes 12. The pre-dawn hours carry a risk of freezing rain till a subtle shift around 4 a.m., wherein precipitation becomes rain mixed with snow. That's just before the area around the Turcot reopens( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/its-not-over-yet-another-day-of-turcot-chaos ), so drive carefully on your Tuesday-morning commute.
About 2 centimetres of snow could fall. That's about the width of two fingernails, a penny or the business end of a soda bottle - and a far cry from the 14 inches( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/god-help-us-a-forecast-is-warning-of-14cm-of-snow-in-montreal-next-week ) forecast late last week. Two days of cool, sunny skies on Wednesday and Thursday might give way to more snow on Friday.
The Weather Network, which generally errs on the side of snowmageddon, predicts rain on Tuesday and agrees with the federal meteorological agency that snow will fall Friday.
Montreal already had its first snowfall, just before Halloween on Oct. 27-28, when an accumulation of 3 cm fell overnight.

Full text: The Great Lakes have a little surprise brewing for the Laurentians and other regions just north of Montreal: freezing rain.
Thankfully, Environment Canada has ruined the surprise by issuing special weather statements for the Laurentians, Lachute-St-Jérôme, Lanaudière, Mont-Laurier, Mont-Trembant and Upper Gatineau. The federal weather service says the freezing rain is expected to start Wednesday morning, riding in on a trough from the Great Lakes.
The weather system should give way to rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures near zero, but in the meantime there could also be ice pellets and maybe some snow.
Be careful on the roads, Environment Canada urges, and report severe weather conditions by email, QCstorm@canada.ca( mailto:QCstorm@canada.ca ), or tweet with the #QCStorm hashtag. Don't do those last two things while you're driving, please.

Montrealers rally against anti-Semitism in wake of Pittsburgh tragedy

Full text: About 200 people attended a vigil in the pouring, freezing rain Sunday in solidarity with the victims of the massacre in a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11( https://montrealgazette.com/news/crime/active-shooter-multiple-casualties-after-shooting-near-pittsburgh-synagogue/wcm/9f887ecb-b5be-487b-bbc4-9de4218e159d ).
Holding umbrellas, some stood silently while others sang on the sidewalk in front of the Montreal Holocaust Museum on Côte Ste-Catherine Rd. in Snowdon.
"We wanted to show our solidarity with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh here, with not only the Jewish community but also with other allies from the Muslim community, the black community and others as well," said co-organizer Sam Hersh, a member of Independent Jewish Voices, which opposes racism and supports Palestinian claims.
Hersh said he believed the massacre was at least partly related to the spread of hateful messages on social media and America's bitterly polarized political climate.
"It all has to do with this vitriolic rhetoric we're seeing in the United States, but there's also that sort of stuff going on in Canada to a certain extent," he said.
"I'm sad and frustrated, but I'm also emboldened to see the amount of support we got on a day like this," said Hersh, a political organizer who most recently worked on Monday's municipal election in Ottawa.
Imam Musabbir Alam, a co-founder of the Canadian Muslim Alliance, said he attended "to show solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters."
"All the houses of worship are sacred regardless of faith and we all share the same bond," he said.
Alam said Saturday's tragedy caused him to relive the massacre of six worshippers in Quebec City's Islamic Cultural Centre on Jan 29, 2017.
"I couldn't sleep last night," he said.
City councillor Craig Sauvé said he felt it was "so important to stand with the Jewish community after the tragedy and the terrorist acts of yesterday."
"We're all mind-boggled about how this continues to go on and how it seems to be accelerating," he said of hate crimes.
Sauvé said he thought the massacre was related to "this strange post-truth era" in which certain minorities are demonized.
"We've seen it before in Cambodia, in Nazi Germany, and more recently in Rwanda," he said.
"I'm very worried," he added.
Meanwhile, the city's institutional Jewish community, including Federation CJA and CIJA-Québec, is organizing a vigil Monday evening at 7:30 at Beth Israel Beth Aaron Congregation in Côte St-Luc.
"None of us in North America have ever experienced anything like this," said Rabbi Reuben Poupko, spiritual leader of the synagogue at 6800 Mackle Rd.
Poupko, whose father, Rabbi Baruch Poupko, led Congregation Shaare Torah in Pittsburgh for more than 60 years, grew up a few blocks from the Tree of Life Congregation, where Saturday's massacre occurred, in the predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighbourhood.
"I know the neighbourhood well, I know the synagogue well, I know the people very well, and it's a devastating tragedy," he said in an interview.
"Every Jew knows that it could have been any synagogue, and every synagogue this morning is a house of mourning," Poupko said.
"All I can tell you is we're heartbroken and outraged. Some people are fearful and worried while others are just trying to make sense of it. It's just an overwhelming sense of sadness and tragedy," he said.
Poupko said the tragedy is not just the product of a deranged loner, noting that statistics show a rise in acts of anti-Semitism( https://montrealgazette.com/news/anti-semitic-incidents-increase-for-second-consecutive-year-bnai-brith-reports ) during the past decade.
"Jews remain the most highly targeted religious minority in North America by a very, very large margin," he said.
"We are bedevilled by the extreme left, by the extreme right, by religious radicals, and those who seek to target Jews are unfortunately more than one in number," Poupko said.
"The best thing we can do is to strengthen the bonds that exist already between faith communities and to send a clear statement that people who propagate violence represent no one but themselves and they are not secretly being applauded by the mainstream, they are repudiated by all," he said.
Fo Niemi, executive director of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), also noted the parallels between the Pittsburgh tragedy and the Quebec City mosque massacre.
"I think the seeds of hate are present when we see the proliferation of hate messages and hate groups both online and in real time, and we have to take them very seriously and never say that this will not happen here," he said in an interview.
Niemi called on Quebec's political leaders to be careful about advocating any measures "that could be seen as inciting intolerance and discrimination towards religious minority groups."
"At the same time, I think that we have to step up measures to combat hate crime and hate groups in this province, especially hate online," he said.

Alam said Saturday's tragedy caused him to relive the killing of six worshippers in Quebec City's Islamic Cultural Centre on Jan 29, 2017.
"I couldn't sleep last night," he said.
City councillor Craig Sauvé said he felt it was "so important to stand with the Jewish community after the tragedy and the terrorist acts of yesterday."
"We're all mind-boggled about how this continues to go on and how it seems to be accelerating," he said of hate crimes.
Sauvé said he thought the massacre was related to "this strange post-truth era" in which certain minorities are demonized.
"We've seen it before in Cambodia, in Nazi Germany, and more recently in Rwanda," he said.
"I'm very worried," he added. Meanwhile, the city's institutional Jewish community, including Federation CJA and CIJA-Québec, is organizing a vigil Monday at 7:30 p.m. at Beth Israel Beth Aaron Congregation, 6800 Mackle Rd. in Côte-St-Luc.
"None of us in North America have ever experienced anything like this," said Rabbi Reuben Poupko, spiritual leader of the synagogue.
Poupko, whose father, Rabbi Baruch Poupko, led Congregation Shaare Torah in Pittsburgh for more than 60 years, grew up a few blocks from the Tree of Life Congregation, where Saturday's massacre occurred, in the predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighbourhood.
"I know the neighbourhood well, I know the synagogue well, I know the people very well, and it's a devastating tragedy," he said in an interview.
"Every Jew knows that it could have been any synagogue, and every synagogue this morning is a house of mourning," Poupko said.
"All I can tell you is we're heartbroken and outraged. Some people are fearful and worried while others are just trying to make sense of it. It's just an overwhelming sense of sadness and tragedy," he said.
Poupko said the tragedy is not just the product of a deranged loner, noting that statistics show a rise in acts of anti-Semitism during the past decade.
"Jews remain the most highly targeted religious minority in North America by a very, very large margin," he said.
"We are bedevilled by the extreme left, by the extreme right, by religious radicals, and those who seek to target Jews are unfortunately more than one in number," Poupko said.
"The best thing we can do is to strengthen the bonds that exist already between faith communities and to send a clear statement that people who propagate violence represent no one but themselves and they are not secretly being applauded by the mainstream, they are repudiated by all," he said.
Fo Niemi, executive director of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), also noted the parallels between the Pittsburgh tragedy and the Quebec City mosque massacre.
"I think the seeds of hate are present when we see the proliferation of hate messages and hate groups both online and in real time, and we have to take them very seriously and never say that this will not happen here," he said in an interview.
Niemi called on Quebec's political leaders to be careful about advocating any measures "that could be seen as inciting intolerance and discrimination toward religious minority groups."
"At the same time, I think that we have to step up measures to combat hate crime and hate groups in this province, especially hate online," he said. mscott@postmedia.com

Holding umbrellas, some stood silently while others sang on the sidewalk in front of the Montreal Holocaust Museum on Côte Ste-Catherine Rd. in Snowdon.
"We wanted to show our solidarity with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh here, with not only the Jewish community but also with other allies from the Muslim community, the black community and others as well," said co-organizer Sam Hersh, a member of Independent Jewish Voices, which opposes racism and supports Palestinian claims.
Hersh said he believed the massacre was at least partly related to the spread of hateful messages on social media and America's bitterly polarized political climate.
"It all has to do with this vitriolic rhetoric we're seeing in the United States, but there's also that sort of stuff going on in Canada to a certain extent," he said.
"I'm sad and frustrated, but I'm also emboldened to see the amount of support we got on a day like this," said Hersh, a political organizer who most recently worked on Monday's municipal election in Ottawa.

Full text: Here's what happened while you were having some much deserved rest.
Hurricane Willa, the weather system that devastated parts of Mexico,( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/the-latest-willa-becomes-category-5-storm-off-mexico/wcm/55648d39-1ece-4bc8-91c8-ad596389f3ba ) has been downgraded to a tropical storm - but it is set to leave its mark on Montreal this weekend.
The storm that originated in the Pacific Ocean is continuing its slow journey toward the Atlantic - via Florida, New York and Montreal - in the form of strong wind, rain storms and possibly the season's first nor'easter. Or, as MétéoMédia prefers: a "cocktail météo."
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement Friday morning warning that the system from the U.S. is bringing the gift of snow, ice pellets and freezing rain to southern Quebec.
Things are expected to start geting dicey on Saturday night, when we could see some flurries. That'll continue into Sunday morning with an unpredictable mix of flurries and showers. Then it's rain as far as Environment Canada can see.
President Donald Trump claims he's being blamed for the mail bombs( https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/the-latest-trump-claims-hes-being-blamed-for-mail-bombs ) addressed to some of his most prominent critics.
Trump says in a tweet sent before dawn Friday, "Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, 'it's just not Presidential!"'
Pipe bombs were sent to Trump critics including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and to ex-CIA director John Brennan at CNN but didn't explode.
Trump tweeted Thursday much of the anger in society is caused by the "Mainstream Media."
Brennan replied Trump should stop blaming others and should "Look in the mirror." Brennan advises Trump to "try to act Presidential."
Meanwhile, investigators have been searching coast-to-coast for the culprit and motives behind the bizarre mail-bomb plot aimed at critics of the president, analyzing the innards of the crude devices to reveal whether they were intended to detonate or simply sow fear two weeks before Election Day.
Three more devices were linked to the plot Thursday - two addressed to former Vice-President Joe Biden and one to actor Robert De Niro - bringing the total to 10 in an outbreak of politically loaded menace with little if any precedent.
Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that the devices, containing timers and batteries, were not rigged like booby-trapped package bombs that would explode upon opening. A search of a postal database suggested at least some may have been mailed from Florida.
Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, "it's just not Presidential!"

The Canadiens looked like they ran out of gas( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/in-the-habs-room-we-blew-it-its-our-own-fault-we-lost-julien-says ) in their 4-3 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night, but that's not the way coach Claude Julien saw it.
"They outcompeted us," Julien said. "I'm not going to say our guys didn't work, but they outcompeted us. They won a lot of battles along the walls, way more than usual. In our own end, we had to do a better job of killing plays and getting the puck out. We didn't do a good job of that. They were on pucks quicker than we were on a lot of occasions. But even so, for a road game we were still in the game with a chance to win or at least come out with a point and we blew it. It's our own fault."
The Canadiens got two goals from Max Domi and a single from Joel Armia, while Jason Pominville scored twice for the Sabres and Sam Reinhart also scored. Armia was in the penalty box for tripping when Okposo scored the winner.
The Canadiens will be back in action Saturday night in Boston against the Bruins (7 p.m., SN1, CITY, TVA Sports).

Montreal's Irish Embassy Bar & Grill hopes to reopen by St. Patrick's Day

Author: Zurkowsky, Herb

Full text: If you think the summer has been long and hot, imagine what it has been like for the owners of the Irish Embassy Pub & Grill, dealing with their own issues, delays and red tape for more than five months.
"It's been tough. You have to accept what it is. There's been down days and up days. I try to keep positive about it," co-owner Paul Quinn said.
The bustling Bishop St. landmark, which has played host to Canadian prime ministers and other political figures, is still waiting to be rebuilt after the bar was gutted by a five-alarm early-morning fire on March 24 that required more than 100 firefighters.
The blaze, which started on the top floor of the three-story structure, was determined to be electric-related, either due to a computer or power bar. Arson and foul play were ruled out after an investigation by city officials.
Quinn along with his partner, Joe Cannon, the bar's general manager, were told by their insurance company it would be six months before work on the building was completed. But now, the two simply hope the business can reopen for St. Patrick's Day, slightly more than six months away.
Cannon and his wife attended a movie the night before. He put his cellphone on mute and thought it was a prank when the calls started pouring in the following morning.
"I think we'd be lucky if we got opened for then, extremely lucky," Cannon admitted. "It would be nice. Obviously we want to be open. It would be almost like a sign, maybe, that things will go our way for once.
"It (any further delay) would be a hit, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. It's our goal to be open by then."
Between the insurance company doing its due diligence, there were delays in receiving permits, engineer's reports that found a plethora of structural damage due to water and mould, and poor weather conditions - including snow, rain and freezing rain - that further delayed the rebuilding process, not to mention the recent construction holiday.
"Every time we got going, another issue would shut us down temporarily," Cannon lamented.
The fire came only weeks after the bar opened a room in the basement, at an expense of more than $300,000, featuring their own line of craft beer. Cannon said business had decreased by as much as 12 per cent over the winter due to a variety of reasons, including: the three-year marathon construction project along the street, and more restrictive smoking laws, making their outdoor patio moot.
He said the Canadiens failing to make the playoffs had a negligible impact on business, suggesting the periodic closure of the Guy exit off the Ville Marie Expressway had more of an effect.
"A lot of the downtown businesses have taken a bit of a hit," Cannon said. "It's not just because of the construction. It could be worse. At least you can get up and down Bishop. But there's no flow in the city. Nobody can get downtown."
The bar employed between 40 and 45 staff in the winter and slightly more through the summer months between those working part-time and full-time hours. All have been hired by other establishments in the area, including Tim O'Melia, a bartender who had been at the Irish Embassy for nine years. He now works at Ziggy's Pub on Crescent St., but called the fire "absolutely devastating and terrible."
The Irish Embassy wasn't the only business affected by the fire. It's neighbour, Comedyworks, has also been closed. It has since moved its shows to McLean's Pub on Peel St. But Grumpy's, which is downstairs and wasn't as severely damaged, has reopened.
This has been a particularly busy year for insurance claims, between last spring's flooding and a fire at McGill University, further delaying the process, Quinn said. But they have been provided with the insurance money and, once the actual rebuilding begins, hope it can be expedited, he added.
Both Quinn and Cannon are married to working wives they've leaned on the last few months, not to mention dipping into their personal savings accounts. The two have poured their hearts and souls into the business for close to 11 years and are eager for the reopening to occur. They've also been touched by the outpouring of support they've received from patrons and the Irish community.
"It was our lives. It's what we do," Cannon said. "We were very proud of what we were able to build from zero. We were both quite devastated.
"We're quite proud of everything we accomplished. We are trying hard."

Full text: If you think the summer has been long and hot, imagine what it has been like for the owners of the Irish Embassy Pub & Grill, dealing with their own issues, delays and red tape for more than five months.
"It's been tough. You have to accept what it is. There's been down days and up days. I try to keep positive about it," co-owner Paul Quinn said.
The bustling Bishop St. landmark, which has played host to Canadian prime ministers and other political figures, is still waiting to be rebuilt after the bar was gutted by a five-alarm early-morning fire on March 24 that required more than 100 firefighters.
The blaze, which started on the top floor of the three-story structure, was determined to be electric-related, either due to a computer or power bar. Arson and foul play were ruled out after an investigation by city officials.
Quinn along with his partner, Joe Cannon, the bar's general manager, were told by their insurance company it would be six months before work on the building was completed. But now, the two simply hope the business can reopen for St. Patrick's Day, slightly more than six months away.
Cannon and his wife attended a movie the night before. He put his cellphone on mute and thought it was a prank when the calls started pouring in the following morning.
"I think we'd be lucky if we got opened for then, extremely lucky," Cannon admitted. "It would be nice. Obviously we want to be open. It would be almost like a sign, maybe, that things will go our way for once.
"It (any further delay) would be a hit, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. It's our goal to be open by then."
Between the insurance company doing its due diligence, there were delays in receiving permits, engineer's reports that found a plethora of structural damage due to water and mould, and poor weather conditions - including snow, rain and freezing rain - that further delayed the rebuilding process, not to mention the recent construction holiday.
"Every time we got going, another issue would shut us down temporarily," Cannon lamented.
The fire came only weeks after the bar opened a room in the basement, at an expense of more than $300,000, featuring their own line of craft beer. Cannon said business had decreased by as much as 12 per cent over the winter due to a variety of reasons, including: the three-year marathon construction project along the street, and more restrictive smoking laws, making their outdoor patio moot.
He said the Canadiens failing to make the playoffs had a negligible impact on business, suggesting the periodic closure of the Guy exit off the Ville Marie Expressway had more of an effect.
"A lot of the downtown businesses have taken a bit of a hit," Cannon said. "It's not just because of the construction. It could be worse. At least you can get up and down Bishop. But there's no flow in the city. Nobody can get downtown."
The bar employed between 40 and 45 staff in the winter and slightly more through the summer months between those working part-time and full-time hours. All have been hired by other establishments in the area, including Tim O'Melia, a bartender who had been at the Irish Embassy for nine years. He now works at Ziggy's Pub on Crescent St., but called the fire "absolutely devastating and terrible."
The Irish Embassy wasn't the only business affected by the fire. It's neighbour, Comedyworks, has also been closed. It has since moved its shows to McLean's Pub on Peel St. But Grumpy's, which is downstairs and wasn't as severely damaged, has reopened.
This has been a particularly busy year for insurance claims, between last spring's flooding and a fire at McGill University, further delaying the process, Quinn said. But they have been provided with the insurance money and, once the actual rebuilding begins, hope it can be expedited, he added.

New free indoor playground opens in Pincourt shopping mall

Full text: Off-Island kids have a new place to go when it's pouring rain, freezing cold or too hot to comfortably play outside, with the opening of a new, free, indoor playground in Pincourt.
The municipally run indoor play structure was officially opened last Thursday, and is installed within the Faubourg de l'Île shopping centre, at 101 Cardinal-Léger Blvd.
On Saturday afternoon, over a dozen children were playing happily in the structure, while their parents stood nearby or perched on benches nearby.
While the playground is designed for children between the ages of five and 12, Ashley Charlebois said her almost three-year-old was enjoying climbing, crawling and sliding through the circuit with the help of an older six-year-old buddy.
Charlebois said she had come from Vaudreuil with another friend to try out the play structure. She said she'd likely bring her son back again another day.
"It adds something to the mall, and it gives us something to do on a rainy day," she said.
Ilyssa Schaffer said she appreciated that, unlike the larger indoor play centres, it was easy to keep her six-year-old in sight.
"I like that it's small enough that you can keep track. Sometimes in the bigger ones, it's hard to keep track of where the kids are," said Schaffer.
Five year old Garrett climbs through an obstacle in the Pincourt Indoor Municipal Park in Pincourt, Friday June 29, 2018.
According to Pincourt assistant general manager Etienne Bergevin Byette, the idea to create an indoor playground emerged from the town's social development policy, which aims to improve quality of life for citizens.
"We noticed an inside playground was missing. In winter, kids can't always use the outside areas," he said.
The play structure is located in the Faubourg de l'Île shopping centre, between Canadian Tire and Hart. An agreement with the mall owners has allowed the town to use space within the mall at no cost, he said. Bergevin Byette said the cost of the playground was just under $100,000.
"We already had the staff, so that is not a new cost. The only new cost to the city was the structure itself," said Bergevin Byette. "We are lucky to have the mall in our area and to have them as a partner. Not all municipalities have a space like that this that they can use in this way."
The indoor playground is open Monday to Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m., Thursday and Friday from noon to 9 p.m. and weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Montreal weather: Is this what spring feels like? We can only faintly remember

Full text: This, apparently, is what spring feels like.
But who can really be sure after a cold week that included freezing rain, snow and one spritzing of rain after another?
Anyhow, Environment Canada is forecasting a daytime high of ten degrees and clear skies on Saturday. The nighttime forecast calls for more clear skies and a low of minus two.
On Sunday, the agency is forecasting a daytime high of 11 degrees and nighttime low of three degrees.
Just about anything other than locust would have been an upgrade after this week, so this weekend forecast may be a lot for some to take in. One possible way to cope with the change involves going outside with a lighter jacket than a parka.

Freezing rain warning lifted: Now it's just a rainy day in Montreal

Full text: What began as a morning of school cancellations, windshield maintenance and fears for the worst was by midday Monday officially designated as another grey, blustery, rainy day in April.
Six hours after issuing a freezing rain warning for the Montreal area, Environment Canada lifted that warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1614327341268895851201804140504ww1070cwulEnd ) after it became apparent that the cause of concern had quite literally melted away.
Which isn't to say Monday morning didn't start with a glaze of ice-driven dread as Montrealers woke up to a sheen of ice on sidewalks and side streets. And a better-safe-than-sorry consensus was quickly reached among Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.
But in the end, major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, and the weather warning of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec" seems to have melted away only slightly less quickly than the ice that formed overnight Monday.
There were several reports of traffic accidents early Monday morning linked to the overnight barrage of rain and freezing rain, including a hydroplaning incident involving three cars on Highway 40 near Sources Blvd. However, Urgences Santé otherwise reported no increase in calls due to ice related injuries or accidents.
Meanwhile the ice-related damage to Hydro-Québec's power grid in the Outaouais region saw the number of customers without power swell from nearly 30,000 early Monday morning to more than 42,000 by noon.
Also, the aftershocks of Sunday's storm in Toronto( https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2018/04/15/second-wave-of-ice-storm-pummels-gta.html ) were continuing at midday to make themselves making themselves felt at Montreal-Trudeau airport, as many departing flights to that city and to several destinations in the United States were delayed or cancelled.
The forecast for Monday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius, with periods of rain accompanied by wind gusts of up to 60 to 70 km./hr. continuing into Monday evening.

Montrealers woke up to a glaze of ice on sidewalks and side streets that seemed well on its way to melting Monday morning.
But while major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, a freezing rain warning remained in effect( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, one that warned of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec."
And that threat was enough for all Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.

Full text: A nasty spring storm that will bring ice pellets, freezing rain and strong winds to the greater Montreal region could lead to treacherous conditions on highways, roads and sidewalks on Monday, Environment Canada says.
Between 10 and 20 millimetres of precipitation is predicted to fall by Monday evening, with several hours of freezing rain expected, Environment Canada says in a weather warning it issued for the island of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Varennes, La Prairie and Châteauguay areas.
The freezing rain could cause roads and walkways to "become icy, slippery and hazardous," the agency says, making for a tricky morning and evening commute.
Power outages and falling tree branches may also occur during the slow-moving storm.
The city of Montreal will spread salt and other abrasives on streets and sidewalks and Transport Québec has asked its contractors to spread abrasives on the highways.
Motorists who have had their winter tires removed need to be vigilant when driving on slick highways, said Mila Roy, a spokesperson for Transport Quebec.
Roy suggested that using public transit would be a better option than driving, if possible.
The storm may cause flight delays or cancellations at Trudeau Airport. Check with your airline before heading to the airport.
The storm wreaked havoc in Ontario, causing hundreds of traffic accidents and power outages.
There is rain in the forecast for Montreal for the rest of the week, according to Environment Canada.

Full text: Check your flight, check your front walk and check for ways to keep your children amused during their unexpected day off.
Montrealers woke up to a glaze of ice on sidewalks and side streets that seemed well on its way to melting Monday morning.
But while major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, a freezing rain warning remained in effect( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, one that warned of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec."
And that threat was enough for all Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.
There were several reports of traffic accidents Monday morning linked to the overnight barrage of rain and freezing rain, including a hydroplaning incident involving three cars on Highway 40 near Sources Blvd. Meanwhile, nearly 30,000 Hydro-Québec customers in the Outaouais region were without power, although their outages represented 48 of the 78 power failures reported across all of Quebec.
The aftershocks of Sunday's storm in Toronto( https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2018/04/15/second-wave-of-ice-storm-pummels-gta.html ) were making themselves felt early Monday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport, as many departing flights to that city were delayed or cancelled.
The forecast for Monday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius, with periods of freezing rain changing to rain this afternoon and more rain continuing into the evening.
This story will be updated.

Sunday storm could bring '24 hours of freezing rain': meteorologist

Full text: Ready or not, a spring storm is coming. You can't hide.
On Saturday, Environment Canada issued freezing rain warnings for Southern Ontario, where power outages are expected.
The storm should hit Quebec on Sunday. It'll continue in a northeast direction across the province through Tuesday.
Meteorologist Steve Boily says temperatures will hover around zero. This stands to change the type of precipitation experienced in the Montreal region.
"Going to work on Monday may be chaotic and the end-of-day commute could be even worse if we've had 24 hours of freezing rain," Boily said. "I don't want to be alarmist, but this is a scenario that can't be ruled out."
Montreal hasn't been hit by a mid-April storm like this since 2007, the Environment Canada meteorologist said.
He advised drivers to wait until the end of the week before having their winter tires removed.

Full text: Ready or not, a spring storm is coming. You can't hide.
On Saturday, Environment Canada issued freezing rain warnings for southern Ontario, where power outages are expected.
The storm should hit Quebec on Sunday. It'll continue in a north-east direction across the province through Tuesday.
Meteorologist Steve Boily says temperatures will hover around zero. This stands to change the type of precipitation experienced in the Montreal region.
"Going to work on Monday may be chaotic and the end-of-day commute could be even worse if we've had 24 hours of freezing rain," Boily says. "I don't want to be alarmist, but this is a scenario that can't be ruled out."
Montreal hasn't been hit by a mid-April storm like this since 2007, the Environment Canada meteorologist says.
He advises drivers to wait until the end of the week before having their winter tires removed.

Full text: Montrealers should brace themselves for the possibility of being force fed another weather cocktail this weekend.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday morning, warning that several regions - including Montreal - could face "winterly precipitation" beginning Sunday thanks to a low pressure system headed our way from the United States.
"Snow changing to freezing rain is possible for the Greater Montreal, the Outaouais and the Eastern Townships. Regions farther north may receive significant snowfall amounts," reads the statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#32047390255769761201804120504ws1070cwul ), which was issued at 5:42 a.m.
The weather monitoring agency expects the storm to continue on Monday "as the band of heavy snow and freezing rain will spread toward Quebec City."
The statement notes that the weather system's track remained uncertain as of Thursday, as did the amount and type of precipitation that can be expected.

Enough! I'm ready for terrasse season; Winter has its charms, but it has been a tough one, and now it's time to move on

Full text: This is an April Fool's joke, right? Over the weekend, Environment Canada announced that a spring storm was making its way up from the central United States, over the Great Lakes and into Quebec. Starting Tuesday, parts of this province could see spots of snow, flurries and freezing rain.
The good news is that Montreal will likely be spared the worst of it. The latest forecasts predict rain for our city, not more of the dreaded white stuff. OK, fine. But it's still just a little too close for comfort as far as I'm concerned.
Listen up, Mother Nature.
Allow me to speak on behalf of all Montrealers: I'm done. We're all done.
We've put in our time. A full 88 days, 23 hours and 47 minutes of winter, to be precise. Dec. 21 marked the solstice and the first day of winter. March 20 was officially the first day of spring. That's quite enough, thank you. Let's get on with it.
Skiing, sledding and iceskating all hold a certain allure in December. I love cosy nights in front of a fire after a day of snowshoeing in January. Bring on the snowman-building in February. Getting friends together to visit a favourite cabane à sucre for maple syrup and pancakes in March? Pure magic. But let's be clear about one thing. There is nothing romantic about freezing rain in April - although at least the sidewalks won't stay icy long.
It's been a particularly long, cold, difficult winter. And, no, it's not just your imagination: We really did get more snow than usual this year. A typical winter snowfall in this city runs around 190 centimetres. This year, we were walloped with 235 centimetres. There were days in December where Montreal was quite literally colder than Antarctica, the North Pole or the planet Mars. Because it was so cold, the snow didn't thaw. This made matters worse for everyone involved. Over at our place, we broke a couple of shovels trying to break through the layers of ice covering the stairs and walkway, and I'm pretty sure we're not alone. We know that the conditions made for a very cumbersome season for snow and ice removal all around the island.
Not to mention expensive: The city spent $180 million in snow-clearing operations and had to open two emergency dump sites. It was a politically challenging experience for the newly minted Projet Montréal administration, which was criticized for its slow, ineffective response in dealing with slippery sidewalks and mountains of snow.
In my family, our supplies - much like our zest for winter - have been fully exhausted. There is not a single matching pair of mittens or gloves to be found anywhere in my house. Ditto for woolly socks. My kids have grown out of their snow pants and jackets. In an act of faith, I've gone so far as to send my heavy-duty parka - streaked with salt, sand and dirty snow - to the dry cleaners. I've swapped my winter boots for rain boots. The summer tires are out of storage and ready to be put on the car. I've got boxes of stuff in my basement all ready for a Sunday afternoon garage sale.
We live in a drafty old house in the Plateau and I've spent too much time over the past few months cocooned in blankets, armed with mugs of tea. Bring on the warmer weather. I am ready for terrasse season.
To all my fellow winterweary Montrealers, fear not. Look around. Kids are out on skateboards and scooters. Cafés are cracking open their windows. The days are getting longer and the sunshine feels stronger. It won't be long before Bixis will be back in operation.
Despite the burst of cold weather on the way this week, the harbingers of spring are everywhere. Hang in there. Twitter.com/CooperCeline

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area in anticipation of what it describes as a "spring storm" expected to roll into Quebec on Tuesday evening and continue on Wednesday.
The service says a weather system developing in the central United States is expected to move across the Great Lakes region and "bring significant amounts of snow starting Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday evening for regions north of the St. Lawrence Valley."
Across southern Quebec the precipitation is expected to take the form of freezing rain in areas close to the St. Lawrence River and rain elsewhere, although Environment Canada acknowledges "uncertainty" over where exactly the system will head once it reaches Quebec.

Mayor Valérie Plante's first 100 days: In her own words

Author: Riga, Andy

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/mayor-valérie-plantes-first-100-days-her-own/docview/2008062454/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: After a cyclist was killed on Mount Royal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cyclist-dies-of-injuries-after-collision-with-car-on-mount-royal ) during the election campaign, Projet Montréal vowed to make the mountain safer for pedestrians and cyclists, but did not spell out details. In February, Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez, Plante's point man on big parks, announced a pilot project that would block drivers from using Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. as an east-west artery( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ), eliminating a popular route linking Côte-des-Neiges and Plateau-Mont-Royal. Ferrandez had promoted the idea of cutting the road in two for years, but his declaration surprised even some of his fellow Projet councillors since the party's election platform( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ) referred to "gradually reducing transit traffic" on the mountain, not an abrupt shutdown. In the case of Ste-Catherine, Plante says she wants to ensure the makeover results in a "fantastic" experience for shoppers and pedestrians, with special attention paid to cleanliness and snow removal.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante arrives carrying soup in a paper cup. It's a noon-hour interview and she's nursing a bad cold that literally left her speechless at city council three days earlier.
"I love soup and I'm sick," she says, laughing, by way of explanation.
Though clearly still under the weather, Plante's voice is back and she's not about to skip the round of 100-days-in-office chats with reporters. The reviews of her baptism by fire haven't been good and she wants to set the record straight.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Montreal Gazette, Plante discusses her proudest achievement, her biggest regret and what she has found to be most surprising about being mayor. She also gives her take on some of the key moments in her first 3 ½ months in office.
The mayor does not hesitate when asked her greatest feat so far: ordering 300 new hybrid transit buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) to deal with chronic overcrowding.
"Montrealers are looking for more mobility and it's something I talked a lot about during my campaign," she says. Fulfilled thanks to financial help from Quebec, the purchase served to prove her detractors wrong about her having no sway with the provincial government, she adds.
Her biggest regret? A fat tax hike( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-mayor-valerie-plante-hikes-taxes-more-than-expected ) that contradicted her election promise not to exceed inflation.
"It was the right thing to do and I stand by it and it is a tax dedicated to water - we're not going to have a party with that money," Plante says. But in hindsight, she says, she realizes she should have made clear during the campaign that her tax pledge only referred to part of the municipal tax bills - and she should have better explained the tax hike once it was announced.
The backlash from the botched budget is still being felt.
Which may explain Plante's biggest eye-opener: the high expectations Montrealers have for their mayor.
"I'm surprised by the level of expectations. People have lots of hopes," she says.
That can result in "people saying, 'Well, Mme. Plante, we wish you would have done this differently,' but sometimes it's just something I don't have control of."
At the same time, she realizes "being the mayor brings out a lot of aspirations for Montrealers and I take that seriously. It just gives me energy to do my best to solve as many problems as I can."
Here are five key issues from the first 100 days, and what Plante has to say about them.
On why she hiked the water tax: "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." The backlash was strong.
TAXES
WHAT HAPPENED: During the election campaign, Plante promised not to raise municipal taxes by more than the inflation rate( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ), which was expected to be about 2 per cent in 2018. So voters were shocked( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-tax-bills-are-going-out-and-they-may-shock-some-taxpayers ) when the average hike in her first budget, made public on Jan. 10, was 3.3 per cent. Adding to taxpayers' consternation was Plante's attitude. She initially dismissed critics, contending she wasn't actually breaking the pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was because of a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." But that rationale didn't wash with many voters, since both taxes are based on property value and both are charged on the same bill. Also, nowhere in its platform did Projet Montréal say it was going to raise the water tax.
PLANTE'S POSITION: She should have chosen her words more carefully during the campaign, Plante acknowledges. But she contends she was blindsided by a financial hole( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/projet-montreals-first-challenge-a-358-million-budget-shortfall-report ) left behind by the previous Coderre administration. "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." Her administration also made the decision to ramp up work repairing and replacing the city's notoriously leaky water( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-is-the-water-tax-increase-really-necessary ) infrastructure. Montrealers would have understood the reasons for the tax decision had her administration done a better job of communicating about the budget, she says.
Cutting through traffic on Mount Royal was "not an easy" decision. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project.
MOUNT ROYAL
WHAT HAPPENED: After a cyclist was killed on Mount Royal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cyclist-dies-of-injuries-after-collision-with-car-on-mount-royal ) during the election campaign, Projet Montréal vowed to make the mountain safer for pedestrians and cyclists, but did not spell out details. In February, Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez, Plante's point man on big parks, announced a pilot project that would block drivers from using Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. as an east-west artery( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ), eliminating a popular route linking Côte-des-Neiges and Plateau-Mont-Royal. The aim was to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety but the announcement caused an uproar. The initial announcement was short on details. For example, it only later emerged the city would allow drivers arriving from the west to use the bigger Smith House parking lot on the eastern side( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plan-to-stop-through-traffic-over-mount-royal-gets-mixed-reviews ) when the smaller Beaver Lake lot is full. Ferrandez had promoted the idea of cutting the road in two for years, but his declaration surprised even some of his fellow Projet councillors since the party's election platform( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ) referred to "gradually reducing transit traffic" on the mountain, not an abrupt shutdown. Drivers are furious about losing a popular cross-city route. Mountain users are worried about being cut off from parts of the mountain. Les amis de la montagne, whose mandate is to protect and promote Mount Royal( https://lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/whats-new/in-the-news/2018/les-amis-de-la-montagne-s-response-to-the-city-of-montreal-s-announcement-about-cutting-transit-circulation-on-mount-royal ), says the plan, on which it has not been consulted, could create more problems than it solves( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: During the election campaign, when asked about Ferrandez's idea of banning through traffic on Mount Royal, Plante only said she would consider the idea. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project. She noted the city studied the idea in two reports, in 2008 and 2013. "A lot of people who use this transit road are upset. Well, I will prove to them that there are ways to go around the mountain and still go to work and do what you have to do, while giving Montrealers and tourists better access to the mountain." She says previous mayors have mulled over the idea, which she says is better for the environment as well as for people on foot and bike. "It's not an easy one," Plante says of the through-traffic problem. "That's probably why other politicians have never decided to take the lead on this one." She says an impact study will be made public after the pilot project.
In January, snowstorms followed by freezing rain left in their wake snow-clogged streets, slippery sidewalks and furious Montrealers. Plante acknowledges "we can do better."
SNOW AND ICE
WHAT HAPPENED: In January, snowstorms followed by freezing rain left in their wake snow-clogged streets, slippery sidewalks and furious Montrealers. The Plante administration blamed the rougher-than-usual winter( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-montreal-has-had-a-lot-more-snow-than-usual-this-winter ). But its case wasn't helped when it hesitated over a snow-clearing operation, hoping milderweather would eliminate the snow and ice( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-counting-on-warm-weather-to-clear-icy-streets-and-sidewalks ). Mother Nature didn't co-operate( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ). One borough mayor - Luis Miranda of Anjou - ignored city directives and had ice-free sidewalks, while much of Montreal's remained treacherous. Miranda became something of a folk hero after his good deed was met with a warning that Anjou could be hit with a fine of at least $200,000 for contravening city rules( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: "We did well with the previous snowstorms and then we had the one with ice and we realized that some practices had to be reviewed," she says. Montreal is an expert on carting off snow but falters when it comes to dealing with slippery sidewalks, she admits. "When it comes to sidewalks, it's a borough responsibility, but as a city, it is our job to say, 'Hey, there's ice everywhere and we need to do better,'" Plante says. Montreal will spend an extra $1.5 million on salt this winter and "ice crushers" will be ordered to deal with treacherous sidewalks starting next winter, she says. With city snow dumps overflowing, Montreal is also opening a new one( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) and has ordered extra-strong blowers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-spending-5-3-million-on-rented-snowblowers ) so it can stuff more snow into existing ones. "This is a crazy winter," she says. "For me, it was important to say, here's what we should have done better and here's how we can do better" in the future.
"My hope is that in a second mandate we'll be able to present some real action" on the Pink Line, Plante says.
PUBLIC TRANSIT
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's highest-profile election promise was the Pink Line - a new 29-station métro line linking Montreal North and Lachine( http://www.projetmontreal.org/ligne_rose_mobilite_durable ). So far, little has come of the idea - not even money for a study of the concept, which critics say will cost far more than the $6-billion figure( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/valerie-plantes-proposed-pink-line-is-it-realistic )Projetput forward during the campaign( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/valerie-plantes-proposed-pink-line-is-it-realistic ). However, a transit pledge she deemed her "No. 1 priority" is materializing. Plante convinced Quebec to help finance the purchase of 300 new hybrid buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) by 2020, increasing the Société de transport de Montréal's fleet by 15 per cent, to 2,100 buses. Critics suggest the purchase is premature because the STM has run out of garage space and will have nowhere to park them. The transit agency says it will find a solution in time.
PLANTE'S POSITION: Plante says her administration has set up an internal committee to hash out the details of the Pink Line. "We are already putting energy and thinking behind the Pink Line." But she notes that a regional body - the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain - will eventually have to come up with the proposal that will go to the provincial and federal governments, which would have to finance the new line. She hopes the ARTM will have set up an office to study the Pink Line by the fall of 2021. Plante admits she was "too excited" early in the election campaign when she suggested digging on the new line would start at the end of a first Projet Montréal mandate. She corrected that later, suggesting work would only start during a second mandate, meaning no sooner than late 2021. "My hope is that in a second mandate we'll be able to present some real action" on the Pink Line, she says.
Plante won't give any hints about her plan for Ste-Catherine St., but says "we want to make sure that people will be happy with what they see in the end."
STE-CATHERINE ST.
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's party was unimpressed with Coderre's plan for a major revamp of Ste-Catherine St( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-plan-for-revamped-ste-catherine-st ). Projet wanted a more pedestrian-friendly, car-light version. So far, Plante has nixed two parts of Coderre's ideas: there will be no heated sidewalks( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ), nor will inflatable street coverings be installed during construction( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-cancels-plan-for-inflatable-tunnel-over-ste-catherine-st ). However, Plante's vision for Montreal's marquee shopping street is still unknown. The new plan is due in March( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/will-projet-montreals-grand-visions-for-a-new-ste-catherine-st-become-reality ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: She won't give any hints about her new plan but says "we want to make sure that people will be happy with what they see in the end. Often, people feel like we do something that's really costly but they don't necessarily see the difference." That was one of the criticisms of the $50-million St. Lawrence River to Mount Royal promenade( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-pedestrian-corridor-is-beautiful-but-expensive ) that Coderre built for Montreal's 375th anniversary. In the case of Ste-Catherine, Plante says she wants to ensure the makeover results in a "fantastic" experience for shoppers and pedestrians, with special attention paid to cleanliness and snow removal. As for heated sidewalks, she says it would have cost at least $142 million to install them along 3.3-kilometres of Ste-Catherine. "That was a crazy expense," especially since the city was not sure about the technology's effectiveness, she says.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante arrives carrying soup in a paper cup. It's a noon-hour interview and she's nursing a bad cold that literally left her speechless at city council three days earlier.
"I love soup and I'm sick," she says, laughing, by way of explanation.
Though clearly still under the weather, Plante's voice is back and she's not about to skip the round of 100-days-in-office chats with reporters. The reviews of her baptism by fire haven't been good and she wants to set the record straight.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Montreal Gazette, Plante discusses her proudest achievement, her biggest regret and what she has found to be most surprising about being mayor. She also gives her take on some of the key moments in her first 3 ½ months in office.
The mayor does not hesitate when asked her greatest feat so far: ordering 300 new hybrid transit buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) to deal with chronic overcrowding.
"Montrealers are looking for more mobility and it's something I talked a lot about during my campaign," she says. Fulfilled thanks to financial help from Quebec, the purchase served to prove her detractors wrong about her having no sway with the provincial government, she adds.
Her biggest regret? A fat tax hike( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-mayor-valerie-plante-hikes-taxes-more-than-expected ) that contradicted her election promise not to exceed inflation.
"It was the right thing to do and I stand by it and it is a tax dedicated to water - we're not going to have a party with that money," Plante says. But in hindsight, she says, she realizes she should have made clear during the campaign that her tax pledge only referred to part of the municipal tax bills - and she should have better explained the tax hike once it was announced.
The backlash from the botched budget is still being felt.
Which may explain Plante's biggest eye-opener: the high expectations Montrealers have for their mayor.
"I'm surprised by the level of expectations. People have lots of hopes," she says.
That can result in "people saying, 'Well, Mme. Plante, we wish you would have done this differently,' but sometimes it's just something I don't have control of."
At the same time, she realizes "being the mayor brings out a lot of aspirations for Montrealers and I take that seriously. It just gives me energy to do my best to solve as many problems as I can."
Here are five key issues from the first 100 days, and what Plante has to say about them.
On why she hiked the water tax: "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." The backlash was strong.
TAXES
WHAT HAPPENED: During the election campaign, Plante promised not to raise municipal taxes by more than the inflation rate( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ), which was expected to be about 2 per cent in 2018. So voters were shocked( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-tax-bills-are-going-out-and-they-may-shock-some-taxpayers ) when the average hike in her first budget, made public on Jan. 10, was 3.3 per cent.

"You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." Her administration also made the decision to ramp up work repairing and replacing the city's notoriously leaky water( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-is-the-water-tax-increase-really-necessary ) infrastructure. Montrealers would have understood the reasons for the tax decision had her administration done a better job of communicating about the budget, she says.
Cutting through traffic on Mount Royal was "not an easy" decision. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project.

"That was a crazy expense," especially since the city was not sure about the technology's effectiveness, she says.

Environment Canada issued a special weather statement Saturday warning residents of southwestern Quebec weather conditions might be hazardous on the roads and sidewalks.
After a relatively dry Saturday, significant precipitation is expected for the Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Châteauguay and Outaouais regions. Up to 10 centimetres of snow are expected to fall starting Sunday morning when the temperatures will be hovering just below the freezing point. As temperatures rise in the afternoon, the snow could mix with freezing rain before it turns to rain in the evening.
Sunday appears to be the outlier, as most of the week is expected to be dry and relatively warm, with temperatures climbing as high as 8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, according to the Weather Network.

Mayor Valérie Plante's first 100 days: In her own words

Author: Riga, Andy

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/mayor-valérie-plantes-first-100-days-her-own/docview/2007807466/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: After a cyclist was killed on Mount Royal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cyclist-dies-of-injuries-after-collision-with-car-on-mount-royal ) during the election campaign, Projet Montréal vowed to make the mountain safer for pedestrians and cyclists, but did not spell out details. In February, Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez, Plante's point man on big parks, announced a pilot project that would block drivers from using Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. as an east-west artery( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ), eliminating a popular route linking Côte-des-Neiges and Plateau-Mont-Royal. Ferrandez had promoted the idea of cutting the road in two for years but his declaration surprised even some of his fellow Projet councillors since the party's election platform( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ) referred to "gradually reducing transit traffic" on the mountain, not an abrupt shutdown. In the case of Ste-Catherine, Plante says she wants to ensure the makeover results in a "fantastic" experience for shoppers and pedestrians, with special attention paid to cleanliness and snow removal.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante arrives carrying soup in a paper cup. It's a noon-hour interview and she's nursing a bad cold that literally left her speechless at city council three days earlier.
"I love soup and I'm sick," she says, laughing, by way of explanation.
Though clearly still under the weather, Plante's voice is back and she's not about to skip the round of 100-days-in-office chats with reporters. The reviews of her baptism by fire haven't been good and she wants to set the record straight.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Montreal Gazette, Plante discusses her proudest achievement, her biggest regret and what she has found to be most surprising about being mayor. She also gives her take on some of the key moments in her first 3 ½ months in office.
The mayor does not hesitate when asked her greatest feat so far: ordering 300 new hybrid transit buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) to deal with chronic overcrowding.
"Montrealers are looking for more mobility and it's something I talked a lot about during my campaign," she says. Fulfilled thanks to financial help from Quebec, the purchase served to prove her detractors wrong about her having no sway with the provincial government, she adds.
Her biggest regret? A fat tax hike( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-mayor-valerie-plante-hikes-taxes-more-than-expected ) that contradicted her election promise not to exceed inflation.
"It was the right thing to do and I stand by it and it is a tax dedicated to water - we're not going to have a party with that money," Plante says. But in hindsight, she says, she realizes she should have made clear during the campaign that her tax pledge only referred to part of the municipal tax bills - and she should have better explained the tax hike once it was announced.
The backlash from the botched budget is still being felt.
Which may explain Plante's biggest eye-opener: the high expectations Montrealers have for their mayor.
"I'm surprised by the level of expectations. People have lots of hopes," she says.
That can result in "people saying, 'Well, Mme. Plante, we wish you would have done this differently,' but sometimes it's just something I don't have control of."
At the same time, she realizes "being the mayor brings out a lot of aspirations for Montrealers and I take that seriously. It just gives me energy to do my best to solve as many problems as I can."
Here are five key issues from the first 100 days, and what Plante has to say about them.
On why she hiked the water tax: "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." The backlash was strong.
TAXES
WHAT HAPPENED: During the election campaign, Plante promised not to raise municipal taxes by more than the inflation rate( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ), which was expected to be about 2 per cent in 2018. So voters were shocked( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-tax-bills-are-going-out-and-they-may-shock-some-taxpayers ) when the average hike in her first budget, made public on Jan. 10, was 3.3 per cent. Adding to taxpayers' consternation was Plante's attitude. She initially dismissed critics, contending she wasn't actually breaking the pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was due to a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." But that rationale didn't wash with many voters, since both taxes are based on property value and both are charged on the same bill. Also, nowhere in its platform did Projet Montréal say it was going to raise the water tax.
PLANTE'S POSITION: She should have chosen her words more carefully during the campaign, Plante acknowledges. But she contends she was blindsided by a financial hole( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/projet-montreals-first-challenge-a-358-million-budget-shortfall-report ) left behind by the previous Coderre administration. "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." Her administration also made the decision to ramp up work repairing and replacing the city's notoriously leaky water( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-is-the-water-tax-increase-really-necessary ) infrastructure. Montrealers would have understood the reasons for the tax decision had her administration done a better job of communicating about the budget, she says.
Cutting through traffic on Mount Royal was "not an easy" decision. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project.
MOUNT ROYAL
WHAT HAPPENED: After a cyclist was killed on Mount Royal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cyclist-dies-of-injuries-after-collision-with-car-on-mount-royal ) during the election campaign, Projet Montréal vowed to make the mountain safer for pedestrians and cyclists, but did not spell out details. In February, Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez, Plante's point man on big parks, announced a pilot project that would block drivers from using Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. as an east-west artery( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ), eliminating a popular route linking Côte-des-Neiges and Plateau-Mont-Royal. The aim was to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety but the announcement caused an uproar. The initial announcement was short on details. For example, it only later emerged that the city would allow drivers arriving from the west to use the bigger Smith House parking lot on the eastern side( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plan-to-stop-through-traffic-over-mount-royal-gets-mixed-reviews ) when the smaller Beaver Lake lot is full. Ferrandez had promoted the idea of cutting the road in two for years but his declaration surprised even some of his fellow Projet councillors since the party's election platform( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/projetmontreal/pages/2087/attachments/original/1509477806/PlatformEn2017_f.pdf?1509477806 ) referred to "gradually reducing transit traffic" on the mountain, not an abrupt shutdown. Drivers are furious about losing a popular cross-city route. Mountain users are worried about being cut off from parts of the mountain. Les amis de la montagne, whose mandate is to protect and promote Mount Royal( https://lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/whats-new/in-the-news/2018/les-amis-de-la-montagne-s-response-to-the-city-of-montreal-s-announcement-about-cutting-transit-circulation-on-mount-royal ), says the plan, on which it has not been consulted, could create more problems than it solves( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: During the election campaign, when asked about Ferrandez's idea of banning through traffic on Mount Royal, Plante only said she would consider the idea. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project. She noted the city studied the idea in two reports, in 2008 and 2013. "A lot of people who use this transit road are upset. Well, I will prove to them that there are ways to go around the mountain and still go to work and do what you have to do, while giving Montrealers and tourists better access to the mountain." She says previous mayors have mulled over the idea, which she says is better for the environment as well as for people on foot and bike. "It's not an easy one," Plante says of the through-traffic problem. "That's probably why other politicians have never decided to take the lead on this one." She says an impact study will be made public after the pilot project.
In January, snowstorms followed by freezing rain left in their wake snow-clogged streets, slippery sidewalks and furious Montrealers. Plante acknowledges "we can do better."
SNOW AND ICE
WHAT HAPPENED: In January, snowstorms followed by freezing rain left in their wake snow-clogged streets, slippery sidewalks and furious Montrealers. The Plante administration blamed the rougher-than-usual winter( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-montreal-has-had-a-lot-more-snow-than-usual-this-winter ). But its case wasn't helped when it hesitated over a snow-clearing operation, hoping milderweather would eliminate the snow and ice( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-counting-on-warm-weather-to-clear-icy-streets-and-sidewalks ). Mother Nature didn't co-operate( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ). One borough mayor - Luis Miranda of Anjou - ignored city directives and had ice-free sidewalks, while much of Montreal's remained treacherous. Miranda became something of a folk hero after his good deed was met with a warning that Anjou could be hit with a fine of at least $200,000 for contravening city rules( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: "We did well with the previous snowstorms and then we had the one with ice and we realized that some practices had to be reviewed," she says. Montreal is an expert on carting off snow but falters when it comes to dealing with slippery sidewalks, she admits. "When it comes to sidewalks, it's a borough responsibility, but as a city, it is our job to say, 'Hey, there's ice everywhere and we need to do better,'" Plante says. Montreal will spend an extra $1.5 million on salt this winter and "ice crushers" will be ordered to deal with treacherous sidewalks starting next winter, she says. With city snow dumps overflowing, Montreal is also opening a new one( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) and has ordered extra-strong blowers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-spending-5-3-million-on-rented-snowblowers ) so it can stuff more snow into existing ones. "This is a crazy winter," she says. "For me, it was important to say, here's what we should have done better and here's how we can do better" in the future.
"My hope is that in a second mandate we'll be able to present some real action" on the Pink Line, Plante says.
PUBLIC TRANSIT
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's highest-profile election promise was the Pink Line - a new 29-station métro line linking Montreal North and Lachine( http://www.projetmontreal.org/ligne_rose_mobilite_durable ). So far, little has come of the idea - not even money for a study of the concept, which critics say will cost far more than the $6-billion figure( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/valerie-plantes-proposed-pink-line-is-it-realistic )Projetput forward during the campaign( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/valerie-plantes-proposed-pink-line-is-it-realistic ). However, a transit pledge she deemed her "No. 1 priority" is materializing. Plante convinced Quebec to help finance the purchase of 300 new hybrid buses( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ) by 2020, increasing the Société de transport de Montréal's fleet by 15 per cent, to 2,100 buses. Critics suggest the purchase is premature because the STM has run out of garage space and will have nowhere to park them. The transit agency says it will find a solution in time.
PLANTE'S POSITION: Plante says her administration has set up an internal committee to hash out the details of the Pink Line. "We are already putting energy and thinking behind the Pink Line." But she notes that a regional body - the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain - will eventually have to come up with the proposal that will go to the provincial and federal governments, which would have to finance the new line. She hopes the ARTM will have set up an office to study the Pink Line by the fall of 2021. Plante admits she was "too excited" early in the election campaign when she suggested digging on the new line would start at the end of a first Projet Montréal mandate. She corrected that later, suggesting work would only start during a second mandate, meaning no sooner than late 2021. "My hope is that in a second mandate we'll be able to present some real action" on the Pink Line, she says.
Plante won't give any hints about her plan for Ste-Catherine St. but says "we want to make sure that people will be happy with what they see in the end."
STE-CATHERINE ST.
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's party was unimpressed with Coderre's plan for a major revamp of Ste-Catherine St( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-plan-for-revamped-ste-catherine-st ). Projet wanted a more pedestrian-friendly, car-light version. So far, Plante has nixed two parts of Coderre's ideas: there will be no heated sidewalks( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ), nor will inflatable street coverings be installed during construction( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-cancels-plan-for-inflatable-tunnel-over-ste-catherine-st ). However, Plante's vision for Montreal's marquee shopping street is still unknown. The new plan is due in March( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/will-projet-montreals-grand-visions-for-a-new-ste-catherine-st-become-reality ).
PLANTE'S POSITION: She won't give any hints about her new plan but says "we want to make sure that people will be happy with what they see in the end. Often, people feel like we do something that's really costly but they don't necessarily see the difference." That was one of the criticisms of the $50-million St. Lawrence River to Mount Royal promenade( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-pedestrian-corridor-is-beautiful-but-expensive ) that Coderre built for Montreal's 375th anniversary. In the case of Ste-Catherine, Plante says she wants to ensure the makeover results in a "fantastic" experience for shoppers and pedestrians, with special attention paid to cleanliness and snow removal. As for heated sidewalks, she says it would have cost at least $142 million to install them along 3.3-kilometres of Ste-Catherine. "That was a crazy expense," especially since the city was not sure about the technology's effectiveness, she says.

Abstract: The Montreal area's topsy-turvy weather predictions continued Thursday with a special weather statement warning of freezing rain starting Friday afternoon. With the temperature hovering around zero degrees Celsius, we could get 2 to 5 millimetres of freezing rain, meaning "untreated surfaces such as roads and sidewalks may become icy and slippery."

Full text: The Montreal area's topsy-turvy weather predictions continued Thursday with a special weather statement warning of freezing rain starting Friday afternoon.
With the temperature hovering around zero degrees Celsius, we could get 2 to 5 millimetres of freezing rain, meaning "untreated surfaces such as roads and sidewalks may become icy and slippery." The Environment Canada statement also covers Châteauguay, La-Prairie, Laval and the Longueuil-Varennes area.
It'll be 4 C and sunny Saturday, and some sort of precipitation could fall Sunday, when it's expected to be 5 C. The rest of the week will linger around 2 C.
Environment Canada's extended forecast ends on Feb. 28 (sunny, high of 3 C), so it's anyone's guess whether March will arrive like a lamb or lion. More to the point, it's your guess:

At-risk areas of Quebec are on flood watch, Coiteux tells reporters

Abstract: With the memory of last spring's flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) still fresh and the sound of freezing rain crackling on Quebec City( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-100000-in-the-dark-as-freezing-rain-coats-quebec-city-region ), provincial Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux told reporters on Wednesday that at-risk areas of the province have been put on flood-watch status. "In the Eastern Townships, in certain parts of the Montéregie - particularly in the area of the Yamaska River - I think it's clear that we're in a state of alert and our teams on the ground are in contact with (risk-prone) areas," he said.

"In the Eastern Townships, in certain parts of the Montéregie - particularly in the area of the Yamaska River - I think it's clear that we're in a state of alert and our teams on the ground are in contact with (risk-prone) areas," he said. "There's an increased surveillance on all the waterways concerned."
Coiteux said the lessons learned from last year's flooding - which hit especially hard in Rigaud, Île-Bizard and Pierrefonds - included a more effective plan to allow the provincial government to work with cities in towns in the wake of a flood.
"I expect very soon to have an action to show you and it will contain very, very concrete measures," he said.
The Couillard government and Coiteux specifically were blasted for how they handled damage compensation and accused of entangling flood victims in red tape. As of last month, less than 10 per cent of the more than 6,000 claims had been fully processed nearly a year after the flooding.

Abstract: Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) forecasts that freezing rain will transform into rain over the course of the day as the temperature is expected to reach 6 C. The temperature is then expected to plummet to -11 C overnight. [...]the Capitale, des Navigateurs, des Premières-Seigneuries and des Découvreurs school boards have cancelled classes for the day for elementary, secondary and adult education courses.

Full text: The freezing rain that covered the Quebec City region Tuesday night has played havoc( http://nouvelles.hydroquebec.com/fr/pannes/hq/180/la-pluie-verglacante-cause-des-pannes-dans-la-region-de-quebec/ ) with Hydro-Québec's distribution network, leaving more than 100,000 clients without electricity on Wednesday morning.
As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, more than 108,700 Hydro customers were without power( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) due to 138 power failures.
In the neighbouring region of Chaudière-Appalaches, close to 9,600 clients were also waking up to no electricity.
Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) forecasts that freezing rain will transform into rain over the course of the day as the temperature is expected to reach 6 C. The temperature is then expected to plummet to -11 C overnight.
Icy conditions on local roads and sidewalks have made getting around difficult and potentially dangerous. As a result, the Capitale, des Navigateurs, des Premières-Seigneuries and des Découvreurs school boards have cancelled classes for the day for elementary, secondary and adult education courses.
Bad weather has also caused interruptions of service at Jean-Lesage airport, with many flights to Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa cancelled. If you're travelling to Quebec City today, check with the airline or the Aéroports de Montréal( http://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/departs ) before heading out.

Abstract: Mayor Valérie Plante's administration and some boroughs have been criticized in recent weeks for snow-clearing operations deemed inadequate( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) and for failing to properly de-ice sidewalks( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/bill-brownstein-our-bones-are-no-match-for-icy-sidewalks ) after freezing rain.

Full text: The snow really has been relentless in Montreal this winter.
Between November and mid-February, 193 centimetres fell.
That's 36 cm more than Montreal normally gets by the end of February, according to an analysis of data collected by Environment Canada at Trudeau Airport.
And Montreal's current tally is only 15 cm short of the 208 cm the city normally gets in an entire snow season (November to April).
The season came in like a lamb, with Montreal receiving 13 cm fewer than normal in November (six, compared with the normal 19).
But in December, 61 cm fell, 12 more than usual.
And in January, 86 cm fell, 37 more than usual.
So far in February, 40 cm have fallen, compared with the 42 cm normally seen in the entire month.
As for rain, there has been less than usual this winter.
The exception was January when 44 millimetres fell - 63 per cent more than the 27 mm that normally fall that month.

Montreal is in the middle of a reprieve.
The last snowfall occurred on Feb. 10 and there is only a hint of snow in Environment Canada's forecast (a 30-per-cent chance of flurries on Monday).
The city says it's ready for the return of snow.

Freezing-rain warning remains in effect for Montreal tonight

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/freezing-rain-warning-remains-effect-montreal/docview/2001151042/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: After predicting more than 10 centimetres of snow Saturday and Sunday, Environment Canada's weather warning has changed slightly, targeting a prediction of 2-5 mm of freezing rain expected to fall Sunday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ). Following Wednesday's storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ), which led to a number of afternoon highway accidents resulting in one death and several injuries, Friday's weather warning was followed by a few centimetres of snow and up to four cm more to come Saturday. The upper Midwest is preparing for a wintry blast as a winter storm is expected across the region, with forecasters saying up to a foot of snow is expected in some areas.

Following Wednesday's storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ), which led to a number of afternoon highway accidents resulting in one death and several injuries, Friday's weather warning was followed by a few centimetres of snow and up to four cm more to come Saturday. Temperatures on Saturday are expected to hover around minus-5.
For Sunday, the updated freezing-rain warning is calling for 2-5 mm to fall, with a possibility of 10 mm more north of the St. Lawrence. Temperatures in the Montreal area are expected to range from minus-3 during the day to an evening low of minus-10.
"Freezing rain will begin near the United States border around midday Sunday and spread toward the Montreal, the North Shore and the Centre-du-Québec regions later in the afternoon," the updated freezing rain warning stated.
Sun is expected on Monday with a high of minus-5 and a low of minus-14 and clear skies through the evening. After much the same on Tuesday, temperatures are expected to jump slightly above freezing, with highs of 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
The snow and freezing rain will make walking and driving more challenging around southern Quebec throughout the weekend.
Check on the city of Montreal's snow-clearing progress at ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). At 9:30 p.m., it was reporting 31 per cent of city streets had been cleared, down from earlier in the day because of additional snow.
And since it is also snow season beyond our borders, here are a few snow-day photos from as far afield as Paris and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1915031272045374221201802090504ws1070cwul ) for Montreal, Longueuil, Laval and Châteauguay this weekend.

This weather system may cause challenging conditions for drivers in southern Quebec throughout the weekend.

Aéroports de Montréal spending $6 million on new snow equipment for Trudeau airport

Author: Mennie, James

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/aéroports-de-montréal-spending-6-million-on-new/docview/1999805529/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Citing an average annual snowfall of 220 centimetres and 13 episodes of freezing rain over the past year, Aéroports de Montréal announced Thursday that it has invested more than $6 million in new snow-removal equipment for Trudeau airport's 2018 winter season. "Major fluctuations in winter weather conditions are forcing us to review our ways of doing things and refine our techniques," the ADM's Sylvain Marchand said in a statement.

Allison Hanes: Snow crisis? More like snow fiasco

Abstract: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, are blaming trouble with city snow-clearing operations this winter on extraordinary circumstances. After a particularly miserable storm dumped snow and freezing rain on Montreal, shuttered schools and made getting around dangerous without crampons, the city did its usual plowing and spreading of abrasives. Montrealers should expect better services, Plante says( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) City to start snow removal Sunday night( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ) Anjou mayor in hot water over ice-clearing operation( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ) CREDIT:

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, are blaming trouble with city snow-clearing operations this winter on extraordinary circumstances.
But the events of the last few days seem more like the result of extraordinary incompetence.
There has been more snow this winter, Parenteau claimed (incorrectly) on Wednesday. The snow dumps are almost full, he warned. Climate change is resulting in more freezing rain, Plante noted (correctly). We're in the midst of a snow crisis, the mayor insisted.
More like a snow fiasco.
After a particularly miserable storm dumped snow and freezing rain on Montreal, shuttered schools and made getting around dangerous without crampons, the city did its usual plowing and spreading of abrasives. Cleaning up such a mess is a complicated task - of that there is no doubt.
But Parenteau's decision not to clear snow over the weekend, relying instead on a day of thawing and the possibility of fresh snow, was the first misstep in a comedy of errors that is far from amusing. By Monday, Parenteau had offered a mea culpa and reversed his decision( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ). He ordered a full snow-clearing operation to commence.
Meanwhile, he picked a fight with Luis Miranda,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ) the borough mayor of Anjou for having already cleared the snow, ignoring a central city order to stand down. The central city is supposed to make the call on snow-clearing operations to ensure equity between different parts of the city and maintain a uniform standard. You'd think the purpose of such a policy would be to elevate the level of service for all, not create a race to the bottom.
And as Miranda noted, if you're going to raise taxes, you'd better make sure you're taking care of basic services. But the real absurdity is that Anjou may now face financial penalties for Miranda doing what Parenteau now admits he should have done in the first place.
Even as the city-wide effort got underway, questions began to swirl about its utility. Or rather futility, depending on where you live.
I watched as a backhoe attacked ice the consistency of concrete on the curbs in my neighbourhood so the heavy machinery idling behind could chew it up, spit it in the back of trucks and cart it away. The noisy endeavour, which looked like it removed as much street as snow, made little to no difference for pedestrians; in Ville-Marie and parts of the Plateau-Mont-Royal, the sidewalks were mostly bare.
In others parts of Montreal, however, the exercise was desperately needed. Sidewalks were treacherous and people had been slipping and sliding or having to walk on the road. Urgences Santé has reported a spike in the number of calls due to falls.
Couldn't the snow-clearing have been targeted to where it was most needed? Plante talked Wednesday about reducing disparities between boroughs. So tackling streets still covered in ice rather than raking ones where the pavement was showing seems like a place to start.
Plante and Parenteau deserve some credit for acknowledging that the city botched the latest snow-clearing job and offering some solutions to fix things. But it's disconcerting nonetheless to hear the person in charge of this crucial service say he resorted to wishful thinking to inform his decision.
Of course, all Montrealers who haven't flocked south hope for mild temperatures and a light dusting of fluffy white stuff after a particularly frigid and snowy January, but we know better than to count on it. Parenteau needs to face up to the sometimes grim reality that we live in Montreal and it's the middle of winter.
But worse is his false assertion that we've already got more snow so far this winter than we did in all of the last. It's easy enough to calculate that we got 141 centimetres of snow in December and January (plus the freezing rain). But between December 2016 and March 2017, we got about 220 centimetres. So it doesn't seem like Montreal is really overwhelmed by snowfall as much as Parenteau is in over his head.
Now Montreal is going to buy a few more special "croque-glace" - special tractors that crunch up ice on sidewalks that have been piloted in Ville-Marie borough - to deal with more frequent freezing-rain storms. Smart. The city is going to ask the province if it can use the Blue Bonnets site as a temporary snow dump. And we're going to have a snow-clearing summit to discuss best practices. What we need is less talk and more plowing.
Montreal has existed for 375 years and counting. We can be reasonably sure it has snowed in each and every one of those years. So at this point, we should be experts when it comes to clearing roads and sidewalks. The only thing different about this winter is the people in charge at city hall.
Montreal is not in a snow crisis. But the Plante administration sure is.

Anjou mayor in hot water over ice-clearing operation

Abstract: With legions of Montrealers forced to walk in the streets for days rather than risk icy sidewalks, a spike in ambulance calls for falls, a public mutiny from one borough mayor and a public apology from the city's snow-clearing chief, it has been a rough week on the snow and ice front for the newly elected administration of Mayor Valérie Plante. The day after freezing rain coated the city in ice last Tuesday, the city of Montreal opted not to call for an operation to clear snow because a thaw had been predicted for the weekend followed by more snow. Calling it "unrealistic" to expect snow to thaw in January, the mayor of the borough of Anjou, population 46,000, ordered snow-clearing operations to start mid-week.

Full text: With legions of Montrealers forced to walk in the streets for days rather than risk icy sidewalks, a spike in ambulance calls for falls, a public mutiny from one borough mayor and a public apology from the city's snow-clearing chief, it has been a rough week on the snow and ice front for the newly elected administration of Mayor Valérie Plante.
The day after freezing rain coated the city in ice last Tuesday, the city of Montreal opted not to call for an operation to clear snow because a thaw had been predicted for the weekend followed by more snow. When the thaw failed to materialize, Montrealers were sentenced to more days of ice-covered sidewalks and parking lots. Many ended up in hospitals.
Calling it "unrealistic" to expect snow to thaw in January, the mayor of the borough of Anjou, population 46,000, ordered snow-clearing operations to start mid-week. By Friday, the snow and ice had been cleared in his borough, Luis Miranda said. He told the central city it should be doing the same thing since Tuesday, he said.
"I took a decision based on the security of my constituents," Miranda said. "We couldn't wait like they did. Older-age people couldn't leave their homes since last week. We cannot condemn people to that."
The city of Montreal sent Miranda a disciplinary letter, and it has been intimated legal or financial repercussions could be leveled against the borough for defying city directives. Miranda said that message was repeated by Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive committee member responsible for citizens services, and the mayor of Verdun.
"Listen, if I have to do it again I will," Miranda said. "For me, the law states I'm responsible for the security of my constituents."
Had the snow melted, it would have left massive lakes on each street corner, where snow-clogged drains would be unable to take the flow, Miranda said.
"I've been doing this for 28 years, maybe they should listen to me. ... He (Parenteau) didn't do his job properly. I don't think he's the man for the situation. I have a very low opinion of that man."
Miranda also criticized Parenteau for leaving his municipal political party, formerly known as the Équipe Coderre Pour Montréal, to sit as an independent so he could have a seat on the city's executive committee, now ruled by Projet Montréal.
On the weekend, Parenteau sent a public apology on Twitter.
"The thaw was not as large as expected and the snowfall predicted for Monday is no longer forecast," he wrote. "In retrospect, we should have ordered (snow removal) before. It was a bad choice on my part and I apologize."

Urgences Santé confirmed it had between 30 and 40 calls last weekend related to falls, about four times the regular number. Although the causes of falls are not logged by ambulance drivers, much of the surge was linked to the ice, spokesperson Stéfan Overhoff said. Icy and snowy conditions also affect response times for paramedics who must navigate roadways and slippery sidewalks and staircases, often carrying stretchers.
Snow clearing began Sunday evening at 7. Instead of clearing snow earlier in the week, the city opted to spread more abrasives on sidewalks, Parenteau said, but acknowledged it dropped the ball when it came to parking lots.
Each city-wide snow-clearing operation costs roughly $15 million to $20 million, but Parenteau dismissed accusations his decision was financially motivated.
"It's never a question of budget. Snow will always fall in Montreal. We will adapt budget as necessary. It's never a question of the security of Montrealers."
With climate change bringing an increased rate of freeze-thaw cycles, the administration will make adjustments to tackle rapid freezes, Parenteau said, perhaps by splitting operations in boroughs so more territory can be covered more quickly. He chastised Miranda for starting operations ahead of the other boroughs, saying the city's snow-clearing strategy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-promises-new-snow-clearing-strategy-by-spring ) calls for all boroughs to share services equitably in the interest of fairness.
The mayor of Anjou said he wasn't interested in downgrading services to his constituents.
"So, let's give everyone lousy services?" he asked. "Let's all wear a shoe with a hole. ... The same week we're raising taxes 3.8 per cent, and we're giving lousy services? It's bad."

Plante administration takes heat over icy sidewalks

Abstract: With legions of Montrealers forced to walk in the streets for days rather than risk icy sidewalks, a spike in ambulance calls for falls, a public mutiny from one borough mayor and a public apology from the city's snow-clearing chief, it has been a rough week on the snow and ice front for the newly elected administration of Mayor Valérie Plante. The day after freezing rain coated the city in ice last Tuesday, the city of Montreal opted not to call for an operation to clear snow because a thaw had been predicted for the weekend followed by more snow. Calling it "unrealistic" to expect snow to thaw in January, the mayor of the borough of Anjou, population 46,000, ordered snow-clearing operations to start mid-week.

The day after freezing rain coated the city in ice last Tuesday, the city of Montreal opted not to call for an operation to clear snow because a thaw had been predicted for the weekend followed by more snow. When the thaw failed to materialize, Montrealers were sentenced to more days of ice-covered sidewalks and parking lots. Many ended up in hospitals.

Calling it "unrealistic" to expect snow to thaw in January, the mayor of the borough of Anjou, population 46,000, ordered snow-clearing operations to start mid-week. By Friday, the snow and ice had been cleared in his borough, Luis Miranda said. He told the central city it should be doing the same thing since Tuesday, he said.
"I took a decision based on the security of my constituents," Miranda said. "We couldn't wait like they did. Older-age people couldn't leave their homes since last week. We cannot condemn people to that."
The city of Montreal sent Miranda a disciplinary letter, and it has been intimated legal or financial repercussions could be leveled against the borough for defying city directives. Miranda said that message was repeated by Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive committee member responsible for citizens services, and the mayor of Verdun.
"Listen, if I have to do it again I will," Miranda said. "For me, the law states I'm responsible for the security of my constituents."

Police search for man who escaped from psychiatric hospital( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/police-search-for-man-who-escaped-from-psychiatric-hospital )
Police are searching for an escapee from a psychiatric hospital who was charged with a 2011 Pointe-Claire murder but found not criminally responsible.
Sean Brennan, 29, left the Philippe-Pinel Institute at 1:15 p.m. on Jan. 22, the Sûreté du Québec said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Philippe-Pinel is on Henri-Bourassa Blvd. E. in the Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles borough.
In 2011, Brennan, then 22 years old, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Bryan Bougie, 41. Bougie died in a third-floor apartment of a 34-unit building on Pardo Ave. Bougie was stabbed 91 times.
A day before the attack, Bougie had come across Brennan sleeping in a stairwell of his apartment building. He did not know Brennan, but offered to let him stay in his apartment.
At the time, Brennan was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, not taking medication and was drinking alcohol and consuming drugs daily, according to a news report about the trial.
Check your tickets: Loto-Québec seeking winners of unclaimed prizes( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/check-your-tickets-loto-quebec-seeking-winners-of-unclaimed-prizes )
Quebec's public lottery corporation is looking for one unknowing, or perhaps forgetful, millionaire.
Loto-Québec issued a news release Tuesday saying no one has come forth with the winning lottery ticket worth $1.75 million that was sold on Dec. 6 in the Montreal region. The ticket had the winning numbers of 6, 9, 16, 19, 21, 28 and a bonus number of 35. The winner has until Dec. 8, 2018 to claim the prize.
The corporation is also appealing to the winners of several other large prizes, one of which was worth more than $500,000.
At least 25 pedestrians fall victim to icy sidewalks: Urgences Santé( http://wp.me/p4Uzqt-5001 )
Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.

Abstract: Hydro-Québec repair crews were deployed across the South Shore Wednesday morning after Tuesday's freezing rain damaged its power distribution grid to black out more than 45,000 homes and businesses in the Montreal area. Westerly winds of up to 70 kilometres per hour made blowing snow an issue in places that got snow instead of rain, Environment Canada said, such as in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore and throughout the Gaspé.

Full text: Hydro-Québec repair crews were deployed across the South Shore Wednesday morning after Tuesday's freezing rain damaged its power distribution grid to black out more than 45,000 homes and businesses in the Montreal area.
By noon, the utility was reporting 550 power interruptions in Montreal, and 6,876 customers without electricity across Quebec.
The week's weather cocktail made road conditions difficult across Quebec but they were gradually improving by Wednesday morning.
Roads were still partially frozen, but precipitation had stopped in the vast majority of the province. Westerly winds of up to 70 kilometres per hour made blowing snow an issue in places that got snow instead of rain, Environment Canada said, such as in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore and throughout the Gaspé.
The freezing rain warning was ended for the Montreal area. Flurries were predicted for most of the day, with a high of minus-5 Celsius. Thursday and Friday were expected to be sunny with highs of minus-10 and minus-7 respectively. The temperature will rise above freezing for a second weekend in a row.

Full text: Freezing rain marked the beginning and the end of the day in Montreal on Tuesday.
Montreal woke up to a city covered in a coat of ice, with all island school boards canceling classes and many pedestrians having a hard time getting around.
Just as the city was getting back on its feet, a late-day band of freezing rain caused power outages that left more than 45,000 homes in Montreal and the Montérégie region without power on Tuesday night.
As of 9 p.m., blackouts were affecting 36,490 Hydro-Québec customers in the Montérégie, south of Montreal, as well as 8,800 on Montreal Island. In Montreal, the outages were concentrated in Verdun (3,767 customers), Pierrefonds (2,215) and Beaconsfield (1,855 homes were without electricity).
Hydro-Québec said it expected to restore power on Tuesday night.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said. "We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 10,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday evening, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Abstract: Hydro-Québec repair crews were deployed across the South Shore Wednesday morning after Tuesday's freezing rain damaged its power distribution grid to black out more than 45,000 homes and businesses in the Montreal area. Westerly winds of up to 70 kilometres per hour made blowing snow an issue in places that got snow instead of rain, Environment Canada said, such as in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore and throughout the Gaspé.

Full text: Hydro-Québec repair crews were deployed across the South Shore Wednesday morning after Tuesday's freezing rain damaged its power distribution grid to black out more than 45,000 homes and businesses in the Montreal area.
By 6:30 a.m. the utility was reporting 78 power interruptions in the region - about half of them area of Longueuil and Boucherville - with a little under 20,000 customers without electricity. In Montreal, three power interruptions were reported affecting 103 customers in LaSalle and Verdun.
The utility hopes to have power restored fully over the course of Wednesday morning.
The week's weather cocktail made road conditions difficult across Quebec but they were gradually improving by Wednesday morning.
Roads were still partially frozen, but precipitation had stopped in the vast majority of the province. Westerly winds of up to 70 kilometres per hour made blowing snow an issue in places that got snow instead of rain, Environment Canada said, such as in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore and throughout the Gaspé.
The freezing rain warning was ended for the Montreal area. Flurries were predicted for most of the day, with a high of minus-5 Celsius. Thursday and Friday were expected to be sunny with highs of minus-10 and minus-7 respectively. The temperature will rise above freezing for a second weekend in a row.

Full text: Freezing rain marked the beginning and the end of the day in Montreal on Tuesday.
Montreal woke up to a city covered in a coat of ice, with all island school boards canceling classes and many pedestrians having a hard time getting around.
Just as the city was getting back on its feet, a late-day band of freezing rain caused power outages that left more than 45,000 homes in Montreal and the Montérégie region without power on Tuesday night.
As of 9 p.m., blackouts were affecting 36,490 Hydro-Québec customers in the Montérégie, south of Montreal, as well as 8,800 on Montreal Island. In Montreal, the outages were concentrated in Verdun (3,767 customers), Pierrefonds (2,215) and Beaconsfield (1,855 homes were without electricity).
Hydro-Québec said it expected to restore power on Tuesday night.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said. "We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 10,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday evening, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Abstract: Driving in the Montreal region is not for the faint of heart - especially once winter hits, bringing months of slippery, snowy road conditions, whiteouts, black ice, freezing rain and worse. Since we can't spend five months a year inside at home waiting for spring, we drive. Bourbonnais said although his winter driving course tends to draw new drivers, newcomers unused to Montreal winters, and those who have experienced losing control on icy roads, everyone can benefit from testing their reflexes on the ice in a safe environment. Most of the four-hour winter driving course, is spent behind the wheel, repeatedly coaxing the car to slide, spin or skid so the students can practice regaining control.

Full text: Driving in the Montreal region is not for the faint of heart - especially once winter hits, bringing months of slippery, snowy road conditions, whiteouts, black ice, freezing rain and worse. Since we can't spend five months a year inside at home waiting for spring, we drive.
Or at least, we think we do. But according to former pro race car driver Claude Bourbonnais, who now operates a winter car control clinic (claude-bourbonnais.com( http://claude-bourbonnais.com )] on the ice near Ch. de l'Anse in Vaudreuil-Dorion, most people aren't really driving at all.
"They're just guiding the car along in a straight line, and usually nothing is happening. They're having a Starbucks and a cell phone conversation. So when something does happen, they're not ready," said Bourbonnais.
Last Friday's class included drivers with a broad range of experience, who came from all over the Montreal area and even as far as Sherbrooke.
Jean-Christophe Trahan just got his driver's license last spring. He decided to take the course after an acquaintance of his lost control on an icy back road and crashed, killing one of the three young friends in his car.
"It scared me and I want to be able to handle a situation like that if it happened to me," said Trahan. "If I encounter a patch of ice, I don't want to be surprised. I want to know how to react."
Another student, Julie Quenneville, survived a terrifying head-on collision on an icy country road near St-Denis-de-Brompton two years ago, and now suffers from anxiety when she has to drive in winter.
"I want to regain my confidence as a driver in wintry, icy conditions," she said.
Bourbonnais said although his winter driving course tends to draw new drivers, newcomers unused to Montreal winters, and those who have experienced losing control on icy roads, everyone can benefit from testing their reflexes on the ice in a safe environment.
The class meets in groups of five or six at an old ice-fishing hut with brightly painted trim, which Bourbonnais calls his 'winter palace.' Most of the four-hour winter driving course, is spent behind the wheel, repeatedly coaxing the car to slide, spin or skid so the students can practice regaining control.
When a car begins to slide on ice, most drivers instinctively turn the wheel and hit the brakes, sending the car into an uncontrollable spin, said Bourbonnais. The key is to keep a cool head, ease off the gas, focus your gaze on where you want to go, and turn a little less to stop the skidding, he said.
It's a counterintuitive response for most people, so most of Bourbonnais' class is spent drilling: zig-zagging through a slalom course on the ice, driving in a big circle designed to provoke the car to slide, repeatedly spinning out and recovering after a hard turn at moderate speed, and so on.
Claude Bourbonnais (right) talks with Jean-Christophe Trahan prior to giving him a winter ice driving lesson on the Lake of Two Mountains.
As for this reporter, at the end of four hours of slippery driving, I came away feeling both humbled and more confident. It is not easy to get the knack of turning the wheel just the right amount at just the perfect time when the car begins to slide and spin. It really does take your full attention- and both hands on the wheel. Best to put the cellphone away and finish the coffee before you hit the road.

Full text: Sorry, kids: it's back to school on Wednesday.
After a surprise day off Tuesday due to freezing rain, school boards said they expect children to stream back to school.
At the Commission scolaire de Montréal, the province's biggest board, all schools will be open, spokesperson Alain Perron said. At the English Montreal School Board, spokesperson Mike Cohen said: "There is no weather forecast to indicate we will have to cancel a second day."
Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that included a freezing rain warning over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
All Montreal-area school boards closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call early Tuesday morning.
But the EMSB had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast.

Adapted transit firm says STM is shortchanging its drivers

Full text: As the Société de transport de Montréal is celebrating a milestone for adapted transit service, a company that provides that service says the agency is shortchanging its drivers.
The STM boasted a record four million adapted transit trips in 2017 and had planned a news conference Tuesday to celebrate the achievement. However, the event was cancelled because snow and freezing rain wreaked havoc with the adapted transit service that would have transported some of the event's special guests.
Yung Cuong, the president of the company Taxi Para-Adapté, said the STM is shortchanging the 1,500 taxi drivers who provide 87 per cent of the STM's adapted transit trips.
"If we calculate it properly, we figure we're underpaid by about $12 million per year on the island of Montreal," said Cuong, whose company provides 160 cars and adapted minivans for the STM. "Our drivers are very discouraged."
Cuong said the taxi industry is struggling, and it is difficult for him to find drivers. Making matters worse, providing adapted transit service is a difficult job, and drivers have to provide additional services for which they are not paid.
Cuong explained it costs his drivers about 10 to 12 minutes for each trip to help their passengers load and unload. Because taxi drivers are only paid based on the amount charged on their meters, any time spent outside their cars is time for which they are not paid. He said the time lost on each trip amounts to $12 million in lost revenue over the year.
"It's a lot of time lost, and we're not paid for the physical labour that all this costs," he said. "And on a day like (Tuesday with freezing rain and snow on the streets), it's even longer. A lot of my drivers don't want to work today."
Cuong said when his drivers provide non-medical transportation for hospital transfers, the provincial government pays a base fee of $25 for each trip, which covers the special needs his drivers must provide.
He is asking the STM for a minimum amount for adapted transit trips, ranging from $6 to $8.
STM spokesperson Isabelle Tremblay said it is up to each of the individual taxi companies, not the STM, to figure out how to adequately pay their drivers.
She said the STM has contracts with 13 different taxi companies, and is now in the process of negotiating a new contract with them to take effect later this year.
Tremblay would not say whether the STM will consider adding a base amount for each driver in the upcoming contract, saying the STM will not negotiate in the public sphere. The contract for outsourcing adapted transit service will probably cost between $45 million and $50 million, Tremblay said. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist

About 3,500 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 2,350 in the Montérégie. Nearly 650 customers on Montreal Island were without power.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Abstract: All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.

At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

20 calls to Urgences Santé
As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, Urgences Santé had responded to about 20 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,400 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 1,570 in the Richelieu Valley. Only 82 customers on Montreal Island are without power. Hydro hopes to have power restored by 11 a.m., Labbé said.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.

That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

Across Quebec, about 10,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday evening, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day. All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices for today.
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,400 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 1,570 in the Richelieu Valley. Only 82 customers on Montreal Island are without power. Hydro hopes to have power restored by 11 a.m., Labbé said.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.

While the start of métro service was delayed slightly early Tuesday, all lines were functioning normally as of 7:30 a.m. There were no reports of disruptions to STM bus service, but road and sidewalk conditions virtually guarantee delays over the course of the day and will likely affect handicapped transportation services.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.
Montreal area commuter trains serving the Candiac, Deux-Montagnes, St. Jerome and Vaudreuil-Hudon lines were reporting no problems with operations as of 7:30 a.m.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

20 calls to Urgences Santé
As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, Urgences Santé had responded to about 20 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel', approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.
Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,400 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 1,570 in the Richelieu Valley. Only 82 customers on Montreal Island are without power. Hydro hopes to have power restored by 11 a.m., Labbé said.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While the start of métro service was delayed slightly early Tuesday, all lines were functioning normally as of 7:30 a.m. There were no reports of disruptions to STM bus service, but road and sidewalk conditions virtually guarantee delays over the course of the day and will likely affect handicapped transportation services.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B.

Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Full text: As the Société de transport de Montréal is celebrating a milestone for adapted transit service, a company that provides that service says the agency is shortchanging its drivers.
The STM boasted a record 4 million adapted transit trips in 2017 and had planned a news conference Tuesday to celebrate the achievement. However, the event was cancelled because snow and freezing rain wreaked havoc with the adapted transit service that would have transported some of the event's special guests.
Yung Cuong, the president of the company Taxi Para-Adapté, said the STM is shortchanging the 1,500 taxi drivers who provide 87 per cent of the STM's adapted transit trips.
"If we calculate it properly, we figure we're underpaid by about $12 million per year on the island of Montreal," said Cuong, whose company provides 160 cars and adapted minivans for the STM. "Our drivers are very discouraged."
Cuong said the taxi industry is struggling, and it is difficult for him to find drivers. Making matters worse, providing adapted transit service is a difficult job, and drivers have to provide additional services for which they are not paid.
Cuong explained it costs his drivers about 10 to 12 minutes for each trip to help their passengers load and unload. Because taxi drivers are only paid based on the amount charged on their meters, any time spent outside their cars is time for which they are not paid. He said the time lost on each trip amounts to $12 million in lost revenue over the year.
"It's a lot of time lost, and we're not paid for the physical labour that all this costs," he said. "And on a day like (Tuesday with freezing rain and snow on the streets), it's even longer. A lot of my drivers don't want to work today."
Cuong said when his drivers provide non-medical transportation for hospital transfers, the provincial government pays a base fee of $25 for each trip, which covers the special needs his drivers must provide.
He is asking the STM for a minimum amount for adapted transit trips, ranging from $6 to $8.
STM spokesperson Isabelle Tremblay said it is up to each of the individual taxi companies, not the STM, to figure out how to adequately pay their drivers.
She said the STM has contracts with 13 different taxi companies, and is now in the process of negotiating a new contract with them to take effect later this year.
Tremblay would not say whether the STM will consider adding a base amount for each driver in the upcoming contract, saying the STM will not negotiate in the public sphere. The contract for outsourcing adapted transit service will probably cost between $45 million and $50 million, Tremblay said.

Abstract: All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B.

City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.

At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

20 calls to Urgences Santé
As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, Urgences Santé had responded to about 20 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,400 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 1,570 in the Richelieu Valley. Only 82 customers on Montreal Island are without power. Hydro hopes to have power restored by 11 a.m., Labbé said.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.

Across Quebec, about 7,230 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,500 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 2,350 in the Montérégie. Nearly 650 customers on Montreal Island were without power.

Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Abstract: Montreal schools shut down All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, Urgences Santé had responded to about 20 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 6,752 Hydro-Québec customers are without power this morning, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,400 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 1,570 in the Richelieu Valley. Only 82 customers on Montreal Island are without power. Hydro hopes to have power restored by 11 a.m., Labbé said.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.

Full text: A major winter storm is coming to Quebec early in the week and it's expected to launch with snow, then rain, wind and freezing rain.
The freezing rain will be "significant," Environment Canada said in a statement issued Sunday. The winter storm will affect southwestern, central and eastern Quebec beginning Monday afternoon through Wednesday.
The most affected regions will be the Outaouais, Montreal and the Mauricie toward Quebec City, with five to 10 millimetres of freezing rain.
"Snow will intensify Monday afternoon and change to freezing rain over southern regions of the province on Monday night," the agency said.
As the storm is expected to worsen road conditions, the agency recommends drivers consider postponing travelling where possible.

Full text: A major winter storm is coming to Quebec early in the week and it's expected to launch with snow, then rain, wind and freezing rain.
The freezing rain will be "significant," Environment Canada said in a statement issued Sunday. The winter storm will affect southwestern, central and eastern Quebec beginning Monday afternoon through Wednesday.
The most affected regions will be the Outaouais, Montreal and the Mauricie toward Quebec City, with five to 10 millimetres of freezing rain.

City's first pothole-filling operation is underway

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/citys-first-pothole-filling-operation-is-underway/docview/1992063097/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: A new online service to take a picture of a pothole and send it to the city doesn't appear to be working on the test site of the city of Montreal( https://beta.montreal.ca/fiches-services/signaler-un-nid-de-poule ). The city announced at the end of 2016 that it would provide geo-location information for all the potholes that have been repaired, but according to the information on the city's open-data website( http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/refection-de-chaussee-par-remplissage-mecanise-de-nid-de-poule ), the pothole data was only collected for about a month between December 2016 and January 2017.

Full text: The pothole fillers are out, and they have a lot of ground to cover.
After rain, snow, freezing rain, followed by frigid temperatures, the city of Montreal was experiencing a bit of a thaw Friday and Saturday, and that means potholes appearing on the city's roads.
Potholes are caused by water infiltrating the road surface, and then expanding when it freezes. As the ice melts, there is hole left in the ground, explained city spokesperson Marilyne Laroche Corbeil.
Corbeil said 10 specialized trucks managed by subcontractors have been out patching holes with hot asphalt since Thursday. Added to that are four specialized trucks owned by the city and operated by blue-collar workers.
She said the trucks will continue working as long as temperatures don't dip too low, and provided that the patching operation doesn't interfere with a snow clearing or plowing operation. The roads also have to be relatively dry for a pothole operation to take place, Corbeil said.
While the city is performing this blitz for just a few days, city crews can repair potholes any time of the year if they are severe enough.
Corbeil said the pothole crews will return during the next thaw period.
Corbeil said the city received only half as many reports of potholes this year as it did last year at this time. Citizens can call 311 to let the city know about a pothole. A new online service to take a picture of a pothole and send it to the city doesn't appear to be working on the test site of the city of Montreal( https://beta.montreal.ca/fiches-services/signaler-un-nid-de-poule ). Another new technological innovation for keeping track of potholes that have been repaired( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-using-gps-data-to-track-plugged-potholes ) also appears not to be working. The city announced at the end of 2016 that it would provide geo-location information for all the potholes that have been repaired, but according to the information on the city's open-data website( http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/refection-de-chaussee-par-remplissage-mecanise-de-nid-de-poule ), the pothole data was only collected for about a month between December 2016 and January 2017. The information, therefore, is already a year out of date.

Wintermission in Montreal: Freezing rain, a thaw, and slush puppies

Author: Juhl, Hayley

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/wintermission-montreal-freezing-rain-thaw-slush/docview/1992062146/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Environment Canada reports there is a high probability of freezing rain or ice pellets in the predawn hours, but once the sun rises Saturday we'll reach a dry high of 3 degrees Celsius. If the melting snow mixed with salt and pellets keeps you inside this weekend, might we suggest you celebrate anyway, with a homemade slush puppy.

Full text: It's like the Weather Network says: "One week, two seasons."
Enjoy winter for the rest of Friday, then spend the weekend in spring, as the January thaw returns for a two-day return engagement.
The wintermission gets underway overnight Friday, as temperatures rise to the freezing mark. Environment Canada reports there is a high probability of freezing rain or ice pellets in the predawn hours, but once the sun rises Saturday we'll reach a dry high of 3 degrees Celsius. It'll be around zero on Sunday.
It won't be the best or worst Jan. 20 we've seen: In 2006, the mercury hit 6.4 C, and in 1970 it was minus-28.9 C, wind chill not included.
We'll be back to winter by Monday, so take advantage of the break to do something outdoorsy, like the Fête des Neiges( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/fete-des-neiges-de-montreal/ ) at Parc Jean Drapeau. There are tons of activities for all ages - dancing and workshops and human foosball, for instance - and things that are slightly higher on the danger scale, like axe-throwing and archery. Hopefully the ice sculptures will cope okay with the weather.
If the melting snow mixed with salt and pellets keeps you inside this weekend, might we suggest you celebrate anyway, with a homemade slush puppy.

Allison Hanes: Warning! One day this will not be a drill

Abstract: On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?

Full text: Thirty-eight minutes of panic( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/01/13/being-a-mother-in-hawaii-during-38-minutes-of-nuclear-threat-terror/?utm_term=.c342edf3cbd9 ) gripped the tropical paradise of Hawaii Saturday morning when emergency management authorities accidentally triggered an erroneous alert that ballistic missiles were racing toward the archipelago.
Terror has since turned to outrage over the false alarm among residents who legitimately feared their lives were ending. It has cast serious doubt on the credibility of the state's emergency systems. Authorities certainly owe Hawaiians some explanations - and perhaps an apology.
But one thing this fiasco should do, no matter where we live, is cause us to ask: Am I ready if disaster strikes?
The nuclear threat level hasn't been this high since the Cold War era, thanks to the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un. However the fallout from a nuke attack is only one kind of emergency we ought to be prepared for. From earthquakes to ice storms, floods to blizzards, major blackouts to toxic spills, too few of us have the necessary supplies, let alone the knowledge, to react in the case of even a minor crisis.
I include myself in this category. I arrived home with my children on Friday evening to a run-of-the-mill power outage. This incident was more inconvenient than urgent, but we were still bumbling around in the dark using my iPhone to locate candles, matches and a real flashlight.
On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?
How many of us have emergency provisions in our car should a vicious storm leave us stranded, like the one last March that trapped hundreds of motorists on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-happened-on-highway-13-during-the-montreal-snowstorm ) for hours overnight?
How quickly our memories fade. How swiftly cautionary tales are forgotten. We are predisposed to think the next major hurricane, tsunami, mudslide or wildfire will happen to others, never to ourselves.
But potential apocalypse lurks high and low. Garnering many fewer headlines than the Hawaii mayhem - but deserving no less of our attention here in Montreal - is a report issued last week by the Swiss Re Institute on the earthquake threat in Quebec.
The report, Earthquake Risk in Eastern Canada: Mind the Shakes,( http://institute.swissre.com/research/overview/expertise_publication/earthquake_risk_in_eastern_canada_mind_the_shakes.html ) found that though the fault line in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec City corridor is one of the most seismically sensitive in the country, we are woefully unaware - and unprepared. Only a tiny fraction - just 3.4 per cent - are properly insured for a tremor despite the fact 70 per cent of Quebec's population resides in this zone.
"According to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe model, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in the Charlevoix seismic zone near Quebec City could cause private residential property losses of up to $10.6 billion," noted the institute, which does research for the insurance industry. "And a repeat today of the magnitude 5.8 earthquake in the city of Montreal in 1732 would lead to even higher losses, estimated at $45 billion."
These findings echo an earlier, equally alarming, study by the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/ns/resources/studies/air-study ) in 2013 that estimated the total losses from a 7.1 magnitude quake in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec area at a staggering $61 billion. The IBC report pegged the probability of a major convulsion along the eastern Canadian fault line at 5 to 15 per cent in the next 50 years.( http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/EQ_brochure_EN-at-a-glance.pdf )
If so few of us are insured, it stands to reason nowhere near enough of us have taken precautions to increase our chances of surviving the big one.
Do you know the safest place to take cover if the ground starts shaking? How many days' worth of water and food do you have stockpiled? Do you have a manual can-opener or flashlight close at hand? Do you have a prearranged rendezvous point to meet up with your loved ones if you are apart when the earth rattles?
The Quebec public security department( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters.html ) provides tips on what to do in the event of all sorts of situations, including earthquakes.( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters/earthquake.html ) While it's not the role of authorities to stoke unnecessary alarm about impending disaster, surely civil security could do more to urge Quebecers to take stock of their advice ahead of time.
The terrifying 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), which examined the devastating scenarios for the Pacific Northwest if the precarious Cascadia Subduction Zone gives way, helped raise awareness among ordinary citizens about their own readiness levels( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes ).
Perhaps a scare like the one inflicted on Hawaiians, heart-stopping and inexcusable though it was, will have a silver lining. Though the state has been testing air raid sirens recently, many people realized in the throes of the chaos they had no clue what steps to take( https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/selfdecon_wash.asp ) in the event of a missile strike.
Let this be a wake-up call to all of us: expect the unexpected and prepare for the worst - now, before it's too late.

Abstract: By Thursday,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ) however, winter at its best had morphed into winter at its most wicked, with freezing rain turning sidewalks treacherously slick before the ice melted into yucky brown sludge. Friday night into Saturday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) night, winter returned with a vengeance. If I lug the little one to daycare on a sled because the sidewalks are impassable for a stroller in the morning, will there be enough snow left to drag her home again later?

Full text: Don't get me wrong: I love winter. I really do.
I love swishing down the slopes, skating on frozen lakes and tobogganing on Mount Royal. I love catching snowflakes on my tongue and making snow angels, then curling up next to a roaring fire with hot chocolate while a storm rages outside.
I love winter so much my wedding was held in the dead of February. By choice.
But the grimmer parts of winter also get me down sometimes, no matter how hard I try to grin and bear it: waking and returning home in the dark; digging cars out of snowbanks; having to dress small children in multiple layers several times every day.
The last few weeks of wild weather( http://montrealgazette.com/gallery/gallery-wild-weather-grips-montreal ) have made this winter especially difficult to enjoy. From bomb cyclones to polar vortexes, Mother Nature has been throwing everything in her arsenal at us - and the hyperbolic names the meteorologists give to these phenomena only feed our anxieties. Then the headlines stoke our memories of natural disasters past. Has it really been 20 years since the Ice Storm?( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-storm-98-relived )
The last week alone has been enough to induce whiplash.
A week ago we woke up to freshly falling snow, turning Montreal into a winter wonderland.
By Thursday,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ) however, winter at its best had morphed into winter at its most wicked, with freezing rain turning sidewalks treacherously slick before the ice melted into yucky brown sludge. Corner snowbanks receded into glacial puddles that flooded intersections.
Julian Gammom, front, and Nicholas Hurtubise have a long way to go to free their car from the snowbank on de Maisonneuve Blvd. near Girouard Ave. on Sunday.
By Friday, it was 8 C and raining, as if a mercurial artist decided to erase an unsatisfactory canvas. Montreal was at its ugliest and greyest, a lunar landscape of dirty, shrunken icebergs.
Friday night into Saturday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) night, winter returned with a vengeance. Rain turned to freezing rain then to snow. We woke up to a blizzard that dumped a total of 36 cms on the city( http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=51157 ) while the thermometer plummeted to sub-zero.
A bit of déjà vu, perhaps? Or a Bill Murray-esque Groundhog Day?
Feel sorry for the snowplow drivers. No sooner had they wrapped up one operation from last week's precipitation, than they had to start all over again. The tractor that finally arrived Friday morning to scrape the last bits of crust off my street was like a study in futility knowing what was coming.
Urgences Santé practically begged Montrealers to stay home over the weekend. You could almost hear the pleading tone of the statement the paramedics issued on the eve of this latest storm.
Personally, I was only too happy to oblige. At least the timing of this lashing allowed many of us to hunker down and watch the nastiness from indoors.
It offered a delicious moment of hygge, the difficult-to-translate Danish concept of "cozy and comfortable conviviality."( https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy )Known as one of the world's happiest societies, the Danes somehow manage to ward off seasonal affective disorder, a.k.a. the winter blues, with saunas and glogg. Denmark, a Nordic country much like our own, seems to accomplish this by embracing winter's small pleasures head-on.
But I've recently come to the conclusion that there are two preconditions for enjoying winter: being in the country and/or on the weekend.
In the country, you can get outside in the crisp fresh air without having to worry about whether your sidewalk is plowed or where your car is buried or whether the bus will slide down a hill.
Of course, Montreal affords many opportunities for winter fun: I applaud those Verdun parents who built their kids an ice rink in their front yard. I love to see cross-country skiers gliding through parks. Tobogganing on Mount Royal is a blast. But all of that's easier to do on a Saturday.
During the week, winter in the city is hell.
On a Monday morning like this one, I feel exhausted before even leaving the house. Am I going to need an umbrella today or snowshoes? If I lug the little one to daycare on a sled because the sidewalks are impassable for a stroller in the morning, will there be enough snow left to drag her home again later? Will I have to shovel the front stairs again when I get home?
It's only the middle of January and already I'm worn down.
Perhaps the solution is to find ways to bring the fun of winter weekends into workaday life. Why not an urban snow trail, so the hardiest among us can ski or snowshoe to work? Why not turn a street into an ice rink so we can skate around town? It's sometimes slippery enough, anyway. How about building a snowmobile highway leading to the heart of the city?
It's either make winter fun on a day-to-day basis or take our cues from the bears and simply curl up in a ball until spring.

Abstract: Despite inclement weather spanning Friday's daylong downpour( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ), Saturday's dump of up to 30 centimetres of snow and Sunday's expected cold snap( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), not all Montrealers are hunkering down for a quiet weekend. After a large snowfall the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death.

If you're going out on foot, in defiance of Urgences Santé's warning to stay in( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), or if you're hitting the highway, despite the Sûreté du Québec's advisory about perilous visibility and driving conditions( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), we've rounded up these safety tips, checklists and videos. Be safe!
City driving? How to avoid sliding, sliding ... bang!( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang )
Highway driving? Written after the February 2017 storm that saw drivers stuck for hours on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ), here is a checklist to get you prepared in case you get stranded in your vehicle( http://www.kaltura.com/tiny/q4vhn ) in cold weather.
Crashed into a pole? After a Christmas Eve crash into an electrical pole resulted in a woman undergoing multiple surgeries( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/guardian-angel-saved-woman-from-certain-death-family-says ) and amputation of her limbs, here is this safety checklist( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/drivers-and-passengers-take-note-what-to-do-if-you-crash-into-an-electricity-pole ).
Shoveling? Tap here( http://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ) so the ice you use tonight can go in your cocktail, not on your aching back.
Car buried in snow? On Saturday, the Montreal Children's Hospital issued a safety tip concerning carbon monoxide poisoning and idling cars. "In the past, the Montreal Children's Hospital has seen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after snowfalls and we want to prevent it from happening again. A child should never be left alone in an idling car. Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked. After a large snowfall the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death. Never leave your car running inside the garage even if the garage door is open."
Winter runner? Fitness columnist Jill Barker offers 5 weather-tested survival tips( http://montrealgazette.com/health/diet-fitness/fitness-five-weather-tested-survival-tips-for-winter-runners ).
And how about plain old safe winter walking? This first video has some walking tips from, yes, Vancouver, put together when they got hit by a storm just before last Christmas. (Walk like a penguin! For real!) And if that strikes you as the skittish advice of winter-weather dilettantes, check out the Montreal Gazette video response below it.

Just stay home: Montreal faces another weather warning

Abstract: Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday. "Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.

Full text: It seems winter is testing us. And maybe even testing our emergency preparedness, with warnings from the SQ, Urgences Santé and others advising us to just stay home.
After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days.
Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
Motorists make their way along a street during heavy fog in a small town west of Montreal on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018.
"Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/951902526273712130 ) people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
The Sûreté du Québec is also on the case( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/951907738854084608 ): "If you must be on the roads this weekend, redouble your vigilance," the SQ tweeted.
The temperature in Montreal fell from a high of 10 Celsius at 3 p.m. to minus-2 at 9:30 p.m., with a further drop expected later. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-17, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-16. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures around minus-10.
N.D.G. resident Alison Neill pushes the stroller carrying her seven-month-old daughter, Violet, over the uncleared snowbanks on Regent Ave., near Sherbrooke St., on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 90 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 9:30 p.m.( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/elimination-neige ) Friday. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 68-per-cent completion rate. Thursday's champion( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) St-Léonard had completely cleared its streets and several other boroughs were either finished or nearly finished by early evening. Friday was an off day for workers, so there were fewer plows and snow-removal trucks on the streets.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Just stay home: Montreal faces another weather warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my )
It seems winter is testing us. And maybe even testing our emergency preparedness, with warnings from the SQ, Urgences Santé and others advising us to just stay home. After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days. Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday. "Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Concordia students 'appalled' sexual misconduct allowed to go on so long( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-student-association-appalled-that-sexual-misconduct-was-allowed )
Concordia University has reassigned courses that were to be taught this term by professors who have been the subjects of recent high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct while those allegations are being investigated, according to a notice sent to students in the English department by their student association. "We are deeply upset and appalled that this university has allowed sexual misconduct to harm students for so long in what should have been a safe and professional environment," says the notice, signed by the executive of the Concordia Association for Students in English (CASE). The notice informed students of a meeting held Friday afternoon by members of the administration - including Kate Sterns, coordinator of the Creative Writing program, Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy and Dean of Students Andrew Woodall - to inform students in the Creative Writing program "of remedial actions the university has decided to take, as well as to respond to questions." The notice also warned students that faculty members have a potential conflict of interest and recommended students not treat the meeting as a forum to share experiences, but rather as an opportunity to demand change.

Montreal was ill-prepared for spring flooding, city report shows( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows )
Outdated flood maps. Emergency vehicles sidelined because they had low floors. No inventory of city equipment and materials. Not enough inspectors to check flooded homes. A 911 system inundated with calls because the city help line went down for four hours. A city report shows Montreal was ill-prepared for disaster in the spring of 2017, when the island suffered its worst flooding in 40 years. The document, obtained by the Montreal Gazette, is to be made public next week. The 55-page report, by the Montreal fire department's civil-security unit, reviewed the city's response and includes recommendations on how to improve emergency readiness. The flooding began in early May when the previous winter's heavier-than-usual snowfall started melting due to warm weather and heavy rain, raising water levels around Montreal and other parts of Quebec. Then-Mayor Denis Coderre declared a state of emergency on May 7, the same day 300 members of the Canadian Armed Forces arrived to help with flood relief. Over several days, more than 430 homes were evacuated in boroughs and suburbs on Montreal Island's north shore, along the Rivière des Prairies.
Quebec gangster can leave halfway house, return home to Trois-Rivières( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-gangster-can-leave-halfway-house-return-home-to-trois-rivieres )
One of Quebec's most notorious gangsters has succeeded in his efforts( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/timeline-raymond-desfosses-long-road-to-conditional-release-he-violated ) to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months. "I am chained like a dog to a halfway house. So if someone wanted to kill me it is very easy for them to find me," Raymond Desfossés, 67, said during a hearing Friday morning at a federal penitentiary in Laval. Desfossés was addressing a question put to him by Michel Lafrenière, the parole board member who presided over his hearing, as to how he would handle the possibility of someone seeking revenge for the crimes that led to his 18-year prison term. Lafrenière said it is the kind of stressful situation that could prompt a career criminal, like Desfossés, to use violence to protect himself. Such a situation could put public safety in jeopardy, Lafrenière said. He has good reason to be concerned because part of his sentence involves how he hired Gerald Gallant, 67, a hit man, to kill six of his rivals( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-hit-man-tied-to-west- end -gang-prepares-for-parole ) between 1980 and 2001. While he was initially charged with six counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder, he was able to plead guilty to taking part in a general conspiracy to commit murder. On Feb. 20, 2014, his sentence for the conspiracy was combined to one he was already serving and turned into an 18-year prison term.
Raymond Desfossés was successful on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018, in his bid to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months.

Motorists make their way along a street during heavy fog in a small town west of Montreal on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018.
"Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/951902526273712130 ) people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
The Sûreté du Québec is also on the case( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/951907738854084608 ): "If you must be on the roads this weekend, redouble your vigilance," the SQ tweeted.
The temperature in Montreal fell from a high of 10 Celsius at 3 p.m. to minus-5 at 11:30 p.m., with a further drop expected later. Light snow and blowing snow also were observed at that time. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-17, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-16. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures around minus-10.

Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 91 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 11:30 p.m.( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/elimination-neige ) Friday. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 69-per-cent completion rate. Thursday's champion( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) St-Léonard had completely cleared its streets and several other boroughs were either finished or nearly finished by early evening. Friday was an off day for workers, so there were fewer plows and snow-removal trucks on the streets.

Ultramar customers complain about delayed heating oil deliveries

Abstract: On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil. Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night.

Full text: For 30 years, West Island resident Denise Williams has had heating oil delivered to her home by Ultramar. She's never had a problem, she said.
Until this week.
Williams gets automatic deliveries from the fuel company, but on Sunday, that delivery never came.
So she called the company.
"Every day they were giving me the runaround. Sunday, they said, 'Oh maybe Monday.' Monday they said 48 hours, so that was Wednesday. Wednesday, I didn't get it. I called again and they said, 'Oh, we don't know'."
Every time she called, Williams said, she had to wait for between a half hour and 45 minutes.
On Wednesday, Williams said she was told that only emergency deliveries were being done and that because she has a heat pump, her situation wasn't an emergency.
"So I called Thursday, and I said, 'Listen, it's getting cold on the weekend. My pump won't work. I need oil'," she said. "Same runaround."
On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil.
"He said, 'I would encourage you to'," she said.
Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night. On Sunday, temperatures are expected to be between -17 and -22 degrees.
"It's a disaster with Ultramar," Williams said.
Williams isn't the only Ultramar customer who's had delayed deliveries. One Sherbrooke resident who contacted The Gazette said she's been having trouble with deliveries since December.
Pierre Tessier, a spokesperson for Ultramar, said the situation is now back to normal.
"Since last night, the delivery operations are running normally. The call centre is also operating normally and none of our clients are running dry," he said.
Tessier said the issues were caused by a confluence of factors, unrelated to the supply of fuel.
"As you know, the past few weeks have been very cold and that, of course, caused higher demand for heating oil," he said. "Combined with the fact that we also have several snow storms, that really complicated the delivery."
Delivery truck drivers also have legal limits on the length of time they can work, Tessier said.
"All that combined really affected some deliveries, especially in the West Island," he said.
"What we also see, some people are worried and they're calling saying they're empty and they don't have any oil but when we arrive there, sometimes, they have half a tank or just under half a tank," he said. "We're doing everything we can to make sure we deliver on time."
Tessier said the company has increased the number of drivers on the road.
However, he said he doesn't know why Ultramar customers appear to be making more complaints than customers of other distributors.
While all recent complaints received by The Gazette were about Ultramar, one of the province's largest heating-oil distributors, others are not having an easy time.
The Association des distributeurs d'énergie du Québec, which represents heating oil distributors, said all of its members are at capacity.

After a respite from bone-chilling temperatures on Thursday, Montrealers were waking up to a very rainy but warm Friday.

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning early Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. "Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.

Full text: It seems winter is testing us.
After a respite from bone-chilling temperatures on Thursday, Montrealers were waking up to a very rainy but warm Friday. At 7 a.m., the high of 7 degrees Celsius had already broken 1986's record 5.3 C for Jan. 12. However, the national forecaster warned conditions will get worse over the next few days.
If you planned on doing outdoor activities this weekend, it might be more advisable to stock up on hot chocolate and have quiet time at home.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning early Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Friday's high of 9 Celsius will be reached at 1 p.m., but temperatures will take a steep downturn starting around 4 p.m. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-21, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-20. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures around minus-10. A high of minus-3 is forecast for next Friday, Jan. 19.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 82 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 7 a.m. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 64-per-cent completion rate. Thursday's champion( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) Saint-Léonard had completely cleared its streets.

Abstract: Westbound traffic on the Ville-Marie was diverted to the eastbound span last month and will remain that way at least until the middle or end of 2019( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gridlock-gridlock-gridlock-no-turcot-relief-till-middle-or- end -of-2019 ). Originally, Transport Quebec had planned for the closures to begin Friday, but the department revised the schedule because of bad weather expected Friday night( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ).

Full text: Saturday will be the first of many instances where the entire Ville Marie Expressway will be closed as workers demolish the old structure.
Westbound traffic on the Ville-Marie was diverted to the eastbound span last month and will remain that way at least until the middle or end of 2019( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gridlock-gridlock-gridlock-no-turcot-relief-till-middle-or- end -of-2019 ). Crews must demolish and then rebuild the westbound highway. Until then, both the eastbound and westbound traffic on the expressway will share one span, with traffic lanes reduced to two lanes for most of that span.
The westbound Ville Marie will be closed starting Sarurday at 11:59 p.m. until Monday at 5 a.m. All westbound traffic will be forced off at Exit 5 toward Robert-Bourassa Blvd. and the Bonaventure Expressway downtown. The highway will be closed from that exit all the way to the Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue/Angrignon Blvd. entrance where Notre-Dame-de-Grâce meets LaSalle.
The eastbound Ville Marie will be closed from Décarie to the De La Cathedrale St. entrance downtown according to the same schedule.
The entrances to the westbound Ville-Marie at St-Antoine St. and Hôtel-de-Ville Ave. will be closed, as will the entrance to the eastbound Ville-Marie from Décarie.
The entrance to Highway 20 west from Highway 15 north will be closed, as will the entrance from the Décarie Expressway to the westbound Highway 20.

N.D.G. is at the bottom of the snow-clearing heap, St-Léonard on top

Abstract: Of Montreal's 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling on Thursday of last week and continued in increments until Tuesday, dropping 27 centimetres on the city. [...]this week's operations were hit by a confluence of problems: two of the city-owned snow blowers broke down; two of the three snow dumps used by dump trucks from the borough are located near the under-construction Turcot Interchange( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/turcot-interchange ) and plagued by traffic jams, slowing operations; snow removal that was supposed to start Monday was put off because there was another snowfall. Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin promised crews were hard at work and 80 per cent of the city's snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of -11 C overnight, with 10 to 20 centimetres more snow on Saturday.

Full text: On the snow-packed sidewalk of Montclair Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Ashley Baker slogged from driveway to front walkway with 8-month-old Max in a baby seat Thursday, cautiously navigating through the snowbanks. The journey of 10 metres took a while.
"After this past snowstorm, it's been particularly awful," she said. "They haven't even plowed the streets yet. ... There's a ridge of snow up the middle, so it looks like they just let the cars plow it."
With snow piled high on both sides, her neighbour Victor Langdon wasn't able to get out of his driveway because the roadway was too narrow. It has been like that for a week, he said.
"It's never perfect, but it's never like this," said Langdon, a 30-year-resident of Montclair Ave. "This is crazy that we have to wait this long."
Residents described the situation as "a disaster" and "a disgrace" on social media.
Residents have reason to feel hard done by. Of Montreal's 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling on Thursday of last week and continued in increments until Tuesday, dropping 27 centimetres on the city.
Only 50 per cent of the snow was removed in the borough as of 9 p.m. Thursday, according to the city's snow-clearing tracker( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). Meanwhile, boroughs like Anjou and Saint-Léonard have managed to take away 95 and 96 per cent of their snowfall, respectively. In other boroughs like the Sud-Ouest (56 per cent) and Lachine (62 per cent), residents were also incensed.
N.D.G. resident Treena Dickson navigates Wilson Ave. near Cote-St-Antoine Rd. on Thursday.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough Mayor Sue Montgomery said she understands residents' frustrations. Snow clearing in the borough during heavy precipitation at Christmas went smoothly, she noted, in part because there was less traffic. But this week's operations were hit by a confluence of problems: two of the city-owned snow blowers broke down; two of the three snow dumps used by dump trucks from the borough are located near the under-construction Turcot Interchange( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/turcot-interchange ) and plagued by traffic jams, slowing operations; snow removal that was supposed to start Monday was put off because there was another snowfall.
Then, as temperatures shifted late Wednesday, snow clearing teams were shifted to spreading abrasives instead.
"I think it's just that every operation is different and it depends on what we get in between, and how much comes down," said Montgomery, a former journalist at the Montreal Gazette. As a newly elected borough mayor, she said she's on a steep learning curve and is asking a lot of questions in order to improve services in the future, and asked residents to be patient.
It takes less time to clean boroughs like Anjou because they're smaller, said Jean-François Parenteau, the city's executive committee member responsible for citizen services, while those with a large industrial base like Saint-Laurent mean snowplows can blow snow directly onto properties instead of into dump trucks, a much quicker process. Densely populated and congested boroughs like Ville Marie, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Verdun are more complicated, he said.
The city's new snow policy calls for all boroughs to receive equal treatment, Parenteau said. It also calls for sidewalks to be cleared as soon as 2.5 centimetres of snow has fallen.
"If it's not done, there is a problem," he said. "It's very important for citizens to call (city public information line) 311 to make complaints. We will check all complaints personally."
The city generally starts removing snow once 10 to 13 centimetres has fallen, and expects to have it all cleared in four to five days, a rapid response compared to most other large North American cities, Parenteau said. Montgomery noted, however, that many workers would have to take a mandatory break Friday because of the long hours they logged in the last week.
Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin promised crews were hard at work and 80 per cent of the city's snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of -11 C overnight, with 10 to 20 centimetres more snow on Saturday. The city will be ready for the next barrage, Sabourin said.
Based on the last week's example, Ashley Baker of Montclair Ave. has her doubts.
"I'm afraid it's going to get really cold, and then everything is going to turn into blocks of ice," she said. "Then things are going to be incredibly bad."

Abstract: Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday. "Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.

Full text: It seems winter is testing us. And maybe even testing our emergency preparedness, with warnings from the SQ, Urgences Santé and others advising us to just stay home.
After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days.
Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
Motorists make their way along a street during heavy fog in a small town west of Montreal, Friday, January 12, 2018.
"Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/951902526273712130 ) people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
The Sûreté du Québec is also on the case( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/951907738854084608 ): "If you must be on the roads this weekend, redouble your vigilance," the SQ tweeted.
The temperature in Montreal fell from a high of 10 C at 3 p.m. to 4 C at 6:30 p.m., with a further drop expected later. It's expected to be minus-10 C by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day.

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.

After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/951902526273712130 ) people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
The Sûreté du Québec is also on the case( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/951907738854084608 ): "If you must be on the roads this weekend, redouble your vigilance," the SQ tweeted.
While the temperature in Montreal was 10 Celsius at 3 p.m., temperatures will take a steep downturn later Friday afternoon. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-17, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-16. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures around minus-10.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 87 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 3 p.m.( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/elimination-neige ) Friday. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 67-per-cent completion rate.

Full text: It seems winter is testing us.
After a respite on Thursday from bone-chilling temperatures, Montrealers were waking up to a very rainy but warm Friday. At 7 a.m., the high of 7 degrees Celsius had already broken 1986's record 5.3 C for Jan. 12. However, the national forecaster warned conditions will get worse over the next few days.
If you planned on doing outdoor activities this weekend, it might be more advisable to stock up on hot chocolate and have quiet time at home.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning early Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Friday's high of 9 Celsius will be reached at 1 p.m., but temperatures will take a steep downturn starting around 4 p.m. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-21, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-20. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures around minus-10. A high of minus-3 is forecast for next Friday, Jan. 19.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 86 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 2 p.m. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 67-per-cent completion rate.

Ultramar customers complain about delayed heating oil deliveries

Abstract: On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil. Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night. Delivery truck drivers also have legal limits on the length of time they can work, Tessier said.

Full text: For 30 years, West Island resident Denise Williams has had heating oil delivered to her home by Ultramar. She's never had a problem, she said.
Until this week.
Williams gets automatic deliveries from the fuel company, but on Sunday, that delivery never came.
So she called the company.
"Every day they were giving me the runaround. Sunday, they said, 'Oh maybe Monday.' Monday they said 48 hours, so that was Wednesday. Wednesday, I didn't get it. I called again and they said, 'Oh, we don't know'."
Every time she called, Williams said, she had to wait for between a half hour and 45 minutes.
On Wednesday, Williams said she was told that only emergency deliveries were being done and that because she has a heat pump, her situation wasn't an emergency.
"So I called Thursday, and I said, 'Listen, it's getting cold on the weekend. My pump won't work. I need oil'," she said. "Same runaround."
On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil.
"He said, 'I would encourage you to'," she said.
Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night. On Sunday, temperatures are expected to be between -17 and -22 degrees.
"It's a disaster with Ultramar," Williams said.
Williams isn't the only Ultramar customer who's had delayed deliveries. One Sherbrooke resident who contacted The Gazette said she's been having trouble with deliveries since December.
Pierre Tessier, a spokesperson for Ultramar, said the issues were caused by a confluence of factors, unrelated to the supply of fuel.
"As you know, the past few weeks have been very cold and that, of course, caused higher demand for heating oil," he said. "Combined with the fact that we also have several snow storms, that really complicated the delivery."
Delivery truck drivers also have legal limits on the length of time they can work, Tessier said.
"All that combined really affected some deliveries, especially in the West Island," he said.
"What we also see, some people are worried and they're calling saying they're empty and they don't have any oil but when we arrive there, sometimes, they have half a tank or just under half a tank," he said. "We're doing everything we can to make sure we deliver on time."
Tessier said the company has increased the number of drivers on the road.
However, he said he doesn't know why Ultramar customers appear to be making more complaints than customers of other distributors.
While all recent complaints received by The Gazette were about Ultramar, one of the province's largest heating-oil distributors, others are not having an easy time.
The Association des distributeurs d'énergie du Québec, which represents heating oil distributors, said all of its members are at capacity.

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.

After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
While the temperature in Montreal was 10 Celsius at 3 p.m., temperatures will take a steep downturn later Friday afternoon. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-17, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-16. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures around minus-10.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 87 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 3 p.m. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 67-per-cent completion rate. Thursday's champion( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) Saint-Léonard had completely cleared its streets and several other boroughs were either finished or nearly finished by 3 p.m. Friday was an off day for workers, so there were fewer plows and snow-removal trucks on the streets.

Abstract: Westbound traffic on the Ville-Marie was diverted to the eastbound span last month and will remain that way at least until the middle or end of 2019( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gridlock-gridlock-gridlock-no-turcot-relief-till-middle-or- end -of-2019 ). Originally, Transport Quebec had planned for the closures to begin Friday, but the department revised the schedule because of bad weather expected Friday night( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ).

Full text: Sunday will be the first of many instances where the entire Ville-Marie Expressway will be closed as workers demolish the old structure.
Westbound traffic on the Ville-Marie was diverted to the eastbound span last month and will remain that way at least until the middle or end of 2019( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gridlock-gridlock-gridlock-no-turcot-relief-till-middle-or- end -of-2019 ). Crews must demolish and then rebuild the westbound highway. Until then, both the eastbound and westbound traffic on the expressway will share one span, with traffic reduced to two lanes for most of that span.
The westbound Ville-Marie will be closed starting Saturday at 11:59 p.m. until Monday at 5 a.m. All westbound traffic will be forced off at Exit 5 toward Robert-Bourassa Blvd. and the Bonaventure Expressway downtown. The highway will be closed from that exit all the way to the Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue/Angrignon Blvd. entrance where Notre-Dame-de-Grâce meets LaSalle.
The eastbound Ville-Marie will be closed from Décarie to the De La Cathedrale St. entrance downtown according to the same schedule.
The entrances to the westbound Ville-Marie at St-Antoine St. and Hôtel-de-Ville Ave. will be closed, as will the entrance to the eastbound Ville-Marie from Décarie.
The entrances to westbound Highway 20 from northbound and southbound Highway 15 will be closed.
Originally, Transport Quebec had planned for the closures to begin Friday, but the department revised the schedule because of bad weather expected Friday night( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ).

Full text: It seems winter is testing us.
After a respite on Thursday from bone-chilling temperatures, Montrealers were waking up to a very rainy but warm Friday. At 7 a.m., the high of 7 degrees Celsius had already broken 1986's record 5.3 C for Jan. 12. However, the national forecaster warned conditions will get worse over the next few days.
If you planned on doing outdoor activities this weekend, it might be more advisable to stock up on hot chocolate and have quiet time at home.

The high forecast for Sunday is minus-21, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-20. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures around minus-10. A high of minus-3 is forecast for next Friday, Jan. 19.

Ultramar customers complain about delayed heating oil deliveries

Abstract: On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil. Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night. Pierre Tessier, a spokesperson for Ultramar, said the situation is now back to normal. "Since last night, the delivery operations are running normally.

Full text: For 30 years, West Island resident Denise Williams has had heating oil delivered to her home by Ultramar. She's never had a problem, she said.
Until this week.
Williams gets automatic deliveries from the fuel company, but on Sunday, that delivery never came.
So she called the company.
"Every day they were giving me the runaround. Sunday, they said, 'Oh maybe Monday.' Monday they said 48 hours, so that was Wednesday. Wednesday, I didn't get it. I called again and they said, 'Oh, we don't know.' "
Every time she called, Williams said, she had to wait for between 30 and 45 minutes.
On Wednesday, Williams said she was told that only emergency deliveries were being done and that because she has a heat pump, her situation wasn't an emergency.
"So I called Thursday, and I said, 'Listen, it's getting cold on the weekend. My pump won't work. I need oil,' " she said. "Same runaround."
On Friday morning she said the customer representative she spoke to told her she still wasn't on the list to receive a delivery on Saturday, so she asked if she should find another company to deliver her heating oil.
"He said, 'I would encourage you to,' " she said.
Williams said her heat pump won't work if the temperature drops below -12 C. Environment Canada is forecasting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) an overnight low of -22 C on Saturday night. On Sunday, temperatures are expected to be between -17 and -22 degrees.
"It's a disaster with Ultramar," Williams said.
Williams isn't the only Ultramar customer who has had delayed deliveries. One Sherbrooke resident who contacted The Gazette said she's been having trouble with deliveries since December.
Pierre Tessier, a spokesperson for Ultramar, said the situation is now back to normal.
"Since last night, the delivery operations are running normally. The call centre is also operating normally and none of our clients are running dry," he said.
Tessier said the issues were caused by a confluence of factors, unrelated to the supply of fuel.
"As you know, the past few weeks have been very cold and that, of course, caused higher demand for heating oil," he said. "Combined with the fact that we also have several snow storms, that really complicated the delivery."
Delivery truck drivers also have legal limits on the length of time they can work, Tessier said.
"All that combined really affected some deliveries, especially in the West Island," he said.
"What we also see, some people are worried and they're calling saying they're empty and they don't have any oil but when we arrive there, sometimes, they have half a tank or just under half a tank," he said. "We're doing everything we can to make sure we deliver on time."
Tessier said the company has increased the number of drivers on the road.
However, he said he doesn't know why Ultramar customers appear to be making more complaints than customers of other distributors.
While all recent complaints received by The Gazette were about Ultramar, one of the province's largest heating-oil distributors, others are not having an easy time.
The Association des distributeurs d'énergie du Québec, which represents heating oil distributors, said all of its members are at capacity.

Abstract: With freezing rain changing to rain, and milder temperatures forecast until a return to the deep freeze this weekend, snow accumulation on roofs, awnings and car shelters could become a problem. Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas. [...]several trains had to run with just eight out of 10 cars, seriously reducing capacity on the line.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Montreal wants power to decide where cannabis use can be banned( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-wants-power-to-decide-where-cannabis-use-can-be-banned )
Montreal wants pot-smoking banned in public spaces where tobacco use is already forbidden - near playgrounds, for example.
And it also wants Quebec to give it the power to ban cannabis consumption temporarily in other places during special events, Mayor Valérie Plante told the Montreal Gazette on Thursday.
Under rules that came into effect in May 2016, smoking is prohibited in outdoor play areas aimed at children and on sports fields.
"We want to follow the same rules and bylaws as the ones connected to tobacco use in public spaces," said Plante, who next week will present the city's suggestions to a National Assembly committee studying Quebec's proposed pot legalization bill.
She said that would be a coherent way to proceed and would make pot rules easier to apply.
"We're also asking to have some flexibility for specific events or period of times."
She cited the Fête des Neiges festival in Parc Jean-Drapeau as an example.
"For four days, there are families, there are kids - we want to be able to say, OK, for this period of time in that area, there's no smoking whatsoever."
Montreal weather: Beware of things falling from the sky, including rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain )
Look up.
With freezing rain changing to rain, and milder temperatures forecast until a return to the deep freeze this weekend, snow accumulation on roofs, awnings and car shelters could become a problem.
The Régie du Bâtiment du Québec is warning property owners to pay special attention to snow that may have accumulated on the roofs. The rain could make that snow even heavier and risk caving in a roof, the authority said.
If a lot of snow has accumulated, it's a good idea to remove it, but the RBQ recommends hiring a professional to do the work.
Also, with all the snow piled on the roofs of high buildings, there could be large chunks falling to the ground as the temperature warms up.
All the rain could make the roads and sidewalks icy late Friday when temperatures are expected to plummet to -10 C and the rain will change to snow.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas.
The bone-chilling cold will return this weekend, with a high of -10 C forecast for Saturday, and highs of -18 C expected for Sunday and Monday.
Snow clearing not completed
It looks like the city might not finish clearing Monday's snow before the next dump. About 71 per cent of the streets had been cleared by 6 p.m.
It has been a bad week for Montreal-area commuter trains( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/its-been-a-bad-week-for-montreal-area-commuter-trains )
Several unrelated incidents wreaked havoc with the commuter train lines on the first four days of the week.
"It was a difficult week," said Elaine Arsenault, a spokesperson for the Réseau transport métropolitain, which oversees operations of the region's commuter trains.
The problems began on Monday morning when water from melting snow seeped into what Arsenault called propulsion boxes on four train cars serving the Deux-Montagnes line. As a result, several trains had to run with just eight out of 10 cars, seriously reducing capacity on the line.
She said that, in anticipation of the next major thaw, maintenance workers are checking to ensure propulsion systems are properly sealed.
The Deux-Montagnes line also saw electrical problems that affected several other cars on Thursday morning. Two cars could not connect to power and, without heat and the ability to open doors, they were taken out of service.
Electrical problems were also to blame for the cancellation of Train 932 toward Central Station at 9 a.m. Thursday. Arsenault said the train had no electrical current, so its engine could not start.
"It has been taken in for repairs, and cancelled. It will be put back into service later," she said.

N.D.G. is at the bottom of the snow-clearing heap, St-Léonard on top

Abstract: On an N.D.G. citizens' Facebook page where residents were bemoaning their narrow, slippery sidewalks, impassable for seniors and baby strollers, borough mayor Sue Montgomery apologized for the delay and asked for patience. Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin said the city was hit with an unexpected second snowfall early this week that hampered snow clearing efforts, but promised that crews were hard at work throughout the city, and that 80 per cent of the snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of minus-11 C overnight, then more snow on Saturday.

Full text: On the snow-packed sidewalk of Montclair Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Ashley Baker stepped cautiously from driveway to front door with 8-month-old Max in a baby seat, navigating between snowbanks.
"After this past snowstorm, it's been particularly awful," she said. "They haven't even plowed the streets yet. ... There's a ridge of snow up the middle of the street, so it looks like they just let the cars plow it."
With the snow piled high on both sides of the street, her neighbour Victor Langdon wasn't able to get out of his driveway because the roadway was too narrow. Conditions have been similar for a week, he said.
"It's never perfect, but it's never like this," said Langdon, a 30-year-resident of Montclair Ave. "This is crazy that we have to wait this long."
The residents of western N.D.G. have reason to feel abandoned. Out of 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling last week and continued in small increments until Tuesday, dropping a total of 27 centimetres on the city.
Only 46 per cent of the snow was removed in the borough as of Thursday before noon, according to the city's snow-clearing tracker( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). Meanwhile, boroughs like Anjou and Saint-Léonard have managed to take away 84 and 89 per cent of their snowfall, respectively. Others boroughs like the Sud-Ouest and Lachine have seen less than 55 per cent removed so far.
On an N.D.G. citizens' Facebook page where residents were bemoaning their narrow, slippery sidewalks, impassable for seniors and baby strollers, borough mayor Sue Montgomery apologized for the delay and asked for patience.
"I understand your frustration with the snow and I have been pushing for answers," she wrote.

Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin said the city was hit with an unexpected second snowfall early this week that hampered snow clearing efforts, but promised that crews were hard at work throughout the city, and that 80 per cent of the snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of minus-11 C overnight, then more snow on Saturday.
Montclair resident Baker has her doubts conditions are set to improve.
"I'm afraid its going to get really cold, and then everything is going to turn into blocks of ice. Then things are going to be incredibly bad."

Abstract: On an N.D.G. citizens' Facebook page where residents were bemoaning their narrow, slippery sidewalks, impassable for seniors and baby strollers, borough mayor Sue Montgomery apologized for the delay and asked for patience. Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin said the city was hit with an unexpected second snowfall early this week that hampered snow clearing efforts, but promised that crews were hard at work throughout the city, and that 80 per cent of the snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of minus-11 C overnight, then more snow on Saturday.

Full text: On the snow-packed sidewalk of Montclair Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Ashley Baker stepped cautiously from driveway to front door with 8-month-old Max in a baby seat, navigating between snowbanks.
"After this past snowstorm, it's been particularly awful," she said. "They haven't even plowed the streets yet. ... There's a ridge of snow up the middle of the street, so it looks like they just let the cars plow it."
With the snow piled high on both sides of the street, her neighbour Victor Langdon wasn't able to get out of his driveway because the roadway was too narrow. Conditions have been similar for a week, he said.
"It's never perfect, but it's never like this," said Langdon, a 30-year-resident of Montclair Ave. "This is crazy that we have to wait this long."
The residents of western N.D.G. have reason to feel abandoned. Out of 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling last week and continued in small increments until Tuesday, dropping a total of 40 centimetres on the city.
Only 46 per cent of the snow was removed in the borough as of Thursday before noon, according to the city's snow-clearing tracker( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). Meanwhile, boroughs like Anjou and Saint-Léonard have managed to take away 84 and 89 per cent of their snowfall, respectively. Others boroughs like the Sud-Ouest and Lachine have seen less than 55 per cent removed so far.
On an N.D.G. citizens' Facebook page where residents were bemoaning their narrow, slippery sidewalks, impassable for seniors and baby strollers, borough mayor Sue Montgomery apologized for the delay and asked for patience.
"I understand your frustration with the snow and I have been pushing for answers," she wrote.

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas. According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was slowest at snow removal, with 48 per cent of roads cleared by 2 p.m. St-Léonard leading the pack with 90 per cent of their roads cleared.

Full text: Look up.
With freezing rain changing to rain, and milder temperatures forecast until a return to the deep freeze this weekend, snow accumulation on roofs, awnings and car shelters could become a problem.
The Régie du Bâtiment du Québec( https://www.rbq.gouv.qc.ca/citoyen/penser-securite-a-la-maison/deneiger-et-deglacer.html ) is warning property owners to pay special attention to snow that may have accumulated on the roofs. The rain could make that snow even heavier and risk caving in a roof, the authority said.
If a lot of snow has accumulated, it's a good idea to remove it, but the RBQ recommends hiring a professional to do the work.
Also, with all the snow piled on the roofs of high buildings, there could be large chunks falling to the ground as the temperature warms up.
All the rain could make the roads and sidewalks icy late Friday when temperatures are expected to plummet to -10 C and the rain will change to snow.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas.
The bone-chilling cold will return this weekend, with a high of -10 C forecast for Saturday, and highs of -18 C expected for Sunday and Monday.
Snow clearing not completed
It looks like the city might not finish clearing Monday's snow before the next dump. About 66 per cent of the streets had been cleared by 2 p.m.
A total of 30 centimetres fell between the new year and last Monday, leaving high snowbanks all over the city.
According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was slowest at snow removal, with 48 per cent of roads cleared by 2 p.m. St-Léonard leading the pack with 90 per cent of their roads cleared.
If you're out of town and are dreading this weather, you could change your flight free of charge if you are booked with Air Canada. The airline has offered to waive change fees to anyone travelling to or from Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto between Thursday and Sunday. If you're flying, check the Aéroports de Montréal website( http://www.admtl.com/en ) before heading out.

Abstract: The Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, which covers Laval, Lanaudière and the Laurentides areas, has also cancelled all classes because school-bus transportation was cancelled. According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Lachine and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce had fallen behind in snow removal, at 38 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively.

You should keep your eyes on the sidewalk ahead of you if you venture out Thursday.
Freezing rain that ended Thursday morning was causing sidewalks to be slippery even though temperatures were hovering over the freezing mark.
And while there were no major road accidents overnight, some roads were also slippery.
The warm temperatures could also caused snow piled on the roofs of high buildings to fall.
Environment Canada ended its freezing rain warning for the Montreal region just after 6 a.m.
The weather caused several schools to cancel classes north of the city. The Commission scolaire des Laurentides cancelled classes for all elementary and high school students. The Commission scolaire des Samares also closed all its schools. The Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, which covers Laval, Lanaudière and the Laurentides areas, has also cancelled all classes because school-bus transportation was cancelled. Daycares remained open.
The ice should melt throughout the day, as temperatures are expected to reach 6 degrees Celsius on Thursday, and stay that warm through Friday before the temperatures plummet to -10C overnight Friday. Then, we're expecting about 10 to 15 centimetres of snow to fall over a 24-hour period between Friday and Saturday.
The bone-chilling cold will return, with a high of -10C forecast for Saturday, and highs of -18C expected for Sunday and Monday.
Snow clearing not completed
It looks like the city may not finish clearing the snow from Monday just in time for the next dump of snow. Only about 60 per cent of the streets had been cleared by Thursday morning.
A total of 30 centimetres fell between the new year and last Monday, leaving high snowbanks all over the city.
According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Lachine and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce had fallen behind in snow removal, at 38 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively. The citywide average was at 60 per cent, with Anjou and Outremont leading the pack with 80 per cent of their roads cleared. Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie was not far behind at 74 per cent.
If you're out of town and are dreading this weather, you could change your flight free of charge if you are booked with fly Air Canada. The airline is offering waiving change fees to anyone travelling to or from Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto between Thursday and Sunday.

In case you missed it, here's what happened in Montreal on Jan. 10

Abstract: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal: Concordia to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct in creative writing program: president( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-in-creative-writing-program-president ) Concordia University president Alan Shepard says he was alerted Monday to what some on social media are calling an "open secret" that spanned decades: allegations of sexual misconduct and a toxic environment created by certain professors in the university's Creative Writing program.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Concordia to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct in creative writing program: president( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-in-creative-writing-program-president )
Concordia University president Alan Shepard says he was alerted Monday to what some on social media are calling an "open secret" that spanned decades: allegations of sexual misconduct and a toxic environment created by certain professors in the university's Creative Writing program.
Shepard called a news conference Wednesday afternoon to respond to allegations published Monday in an online essay by Mike Spry, a former Concordia creative writing student. Spry wrote that in his 14-year association with Concordia, he had "been witness to and made aware of innumerable instances of unwanted affection, groping, inappropriate remarks and propositions."
Spry, who admitted certain improprieties on his own part in the essay, claimed power abuses and sexual misconduct are rampant in the CanLit community in general, and at Concordia in particular. In response, several students and alumni have posted on social media their contention that sexual misconduct has been a problem in the creative writing program for many years, some naming specific professors.
Several former students of the program told the Montreal Gazette that certain professors are known for having sexual relationships with their students. Some referred to these professors as "skirt chasers" and "vipers," whom women in the program warned each other to avoid. One former student referred to these professors as the "Concordia Penis Cabal."
Man who shot unwelcome party guest in the back has parole eligibility set at 12 years( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-who-shot-unwelcome-party-guest-in-the-back-has-parole-eligibility-set-at-12-years )
Montreal resident Oswald Wyke will have to serve at least 12 years behind bars before he is eligible for parole in a case where he murdered a stranger who crashed his backyard party in Côte-des-Neiges three years ago.
"Wyke committed the most serious offence under the Criminal Code, which is murder," Superior Court Justice Claude Champagne wrote in his decision delivered at the Montreal courthouse on Wednesday. "He acted in a cowardly manner, shooting his victim twice in the back."
Champagne listed the fact that Wyke, 29, shot Olvin Alfredo Paz, 29, in his lower back and in the back of his skull among the aggravating factors that persuaded him to set Wyke's parole eligibility at 12 years instead of the minimum of 10 years. On Oct. 19, a jury found Wyke guilty of second-degree murder, a Criminal Code offence that comes with an automatic life sentence upon conviction. Parole eligibility can be set at anywhere between 10 and 25 years. Prosecutor Louis Bouthillier asked that Wyke's eligibility be set at 13 years, while defence lawyer Sharon Sandiford asked for the minimum.
City asks for patience as we brace for more cold, freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-rain-deep-freeze-montreal-is-caught-in-a-weather-yo-yo )
If the persistent snow banks didn't make getting around hard enough, freezing rain is expected to be added to the mix on Wednesday and Thursday.
We've gone from deep freeze, to seasonal norms, to unseasonably warm weather and are now bracing for freezing rain, rain, a snowstorm, and then back to the deep freeze. The coming weather even led to Air Canada issuing a travel warning and to waive the usual fees for anyone wishing to change their travel plans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 14.
If the winter were a children's toy, it would be a yo-yo, as Montrealers have dealt with extremes during the first three weeks of winter.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow.
"We're improving our services and it shows," Plante said at the webcast of the executive committee meeting Monday morning, after saying that the city received 1,600 fewer complaints than it did at this point of the season last year.

Abstract: Of Montreal's 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling on Thursday of last week and continued in increments until Tuesday, dropping 27 centimetres on the city. [...]this week's operations were hit by a confluence of problems: two of the city-owned snow blowers broke down; two of the three snow dumps used by dump trucks from the borough are located near the under-construction Turcot Interchange( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/turcot-interchange ) and plagued by traffic jams, slowing operations; snow removal that was supposed to start Monday was put off because there was another snowfall. Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin promised crews were hard at work and 80 per cent of the city's snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of -11 C overnight, with 10 to 20 centimetres more snow on Saturday.

Full text: On the snow-packed sidewalk of Montclair Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Ashley Baker slogged from driveway to front walkway with 8-month-old Max in a baby seat Thursday, cautiously navigating through the snowbanks. The journey of 10 metres took a while.
"After this past snowstorm, it's been particularly awful," she said. "They haven't even plowed the streets yet. ... There's a ridge of snow up the middle, so it looks like they just let the cars plow it."
With snow piled high on both sides, her neighbour Victor Langdon wasn't able to get out of his driveway because the roadway was too narrow. It has been like that for a week, he said.
"It's never perfect, but it's never like this," said Langdon, a 30-year-resident of Montclair Ave. "This is crazy that we have to wait this long."
Residents described the situation as "a disaster" and "a disgrace" on social media.
Residents have reason to feel hard done by. Of Montreal's 19 boroughs, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has seen the least amount of snow removed since the snow started falling on Thursday of last week and continued in increments until Tuesday, dropping 27 centimetres on the city.
Only 49 per cent of the snow was removed in the borough as of 5 p.m. Thursday, according to the city's snow-clearing tracker( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). Meanwhile, boroughs like Anjou and Saint-Léonard have managed to take away 93 and 95 per cent of their snowfall, respectively. In other boroughs like the Sud-Ouest (55 per cent) and Lachine (61 per cent), residents were also incensed.
N.D.G. resident Treena Dickson navigates Wilson St. near Côte-St-Antoine on Thursday.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough Mayor Sue Montgomery said she understands residents' frustrations. Snow clearing in the borough during heavy precipitation at Christmas went smoothly, she noted, in part because there was less traffic. But this week's operations were hit by a confluence of problems: two of the city-owned snow blowers broke down; two of the three snow dumps used by dump trucks from the borough are located near the under-construction Turcot Interchange( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/turcot-interchange ) and plagued by traffic jams, slowing operations; snow removal that was supposed to start Monday was put off because there was another snowfall.
Then, as temperatures shifted late Wednesday, snow clearing teams were shifted to spreading abrasives instead.
"I think it's just that every operation is different and it depends on what we get in between, and how much comes down," said Montgomery, a former journalist at the Montreal Gazette. As a newly elected borough mayor, she said she's on a steep learning curve and is asking a lot of questions in order to improve services in the future, and asked residents to be patient.
It takes less time to clean boroughs like Anjou because they're smaller, said Jean-François Parenteau, the city's executive committee member responsible for citizen services, while those with a large industrial base like Saint-Laurent mean snowplows can blow snow directly onto properties instead of into dump trucks, a much quicker process. Densely populated and congested boroughs like Ville Marie, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Verdun are more complicated, he said.
The city's new snow policy calls for all boroughs to receive equal treatment, Parenteau said. It also calls for sidewalks to be cleared as soon as 2.5 centimetres of snow has fallen.
"If it's not done, there is a problem," he said. "It's very important for citizens to call (city public information line) 311 to make complaints. We will check all complaints personally."
The city generally starts removing snow once 10 to 13 centimetres has fallen, and expects to have it all cleared in four to five days, a rapid response compared to most other large North American cities, Parenteau said. Montgomery noted, however, that many workers would have to take a mandatory break Friday because of the long hours they logged in the last week.
Montreal city spokesman Philippe Sabourin promised crews were hard at work and 80 per cent of the city's snow should be cleared by Friday, when rain is forecast( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ), followed by freezing temperatures of -11 C overnight, with 10 to 20 centimetres more snow on Saturday. The city will be ready for the next barrage, Sabourin said.
Based on the last week's example, Ashley Baker of Montclair Ave. has her doubts.
"I'm afraid it's going to get really cold, and then everything is going to turn into blocks of ice," she said. "Then things are going to be incredibly bad."

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas. According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Lachine and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce had fallen behind in snow removal, at 47 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively on Thursday afternoon.

Full text: Look up.
With freezing rain changing to rain, and milder temperatures forecast until a return to the deep freeze this weekend, snow accumulation on roofs, awnings and car shelters could become a problem.
The Régie du Bâtiment du Québec( https://www.rbq.gouv.qc.ca/citoyen/penser-securite-a-la-maison/deneiger-et-deglacer.html ) is warning property owners to pay special attention to snow that may have accumulated on the roofs. The rain could make that snow even heavier and risk caving in a roof, the authority said.
If a lot of snow has accumulated, it's a good idea to remove it, but the RBQ recommends hiring a professional to do the work.
Also, with all the snow piled on the roofs of high buildings, there could be large chunks falling to the ground as the temperature warms up.
All the rain could make the roads and sidewalks icy late Friday when temperatures are expected to plummet to -10 C and the rain will change to snow.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning that there could be significant snowfall for southern, central and eastern Quebec, and the snow could be mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain over the southernmost areas.
The bone-chilling cold will return this weekend, with a high of -10 C forecast for Saturday, and highs of -18 C expected for Sunday and Monday.
Snow clearing not completed
It looks like the city might not finish clearing Monday's snow before the next dump. Only about 60 per cent of the streets had been cleared by Thursday morning.
A total of 30 centimetres fell between the new year and last Monday, leaving high snowbanks all over the city.
According to the city's snow clearing website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), Lachine and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce had fallen behind in snow removal, at 47 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively on Thursday afternoon. The citywide average was at 66 per cent, with St-Léonard leading the pack with 90 per cent of their roads cleared.
If you're out of town and are dreading this weather, you could change your flight free of charge if you are booked with Air Canada. The airline has offered to waive change fees to anyone travelling to or from Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto between Thursday and Sunday. If you're flying, check the Aéroports de Montréal website( http://www.admtl.com/en ) before heading out.

The snowbanks will become crustier and heavier in the coming days, as freezing rain is expected to start falling around dinnertime.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )at 11 a.m.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay and La Prairie areas, saying roads and sidewalks could become slippery as temperatures warm up to 6 C on Thursday and Friday.

Abstract: According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The warmer temperatures were expected to cause river levels to rise with a buildup of frazil ice (crystals) causing flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laval-monitoring-river-levels-as-frazil-ice-forms-on-waterways ) for some residents along the Rivière des Prairies in Laval and Terrebonne.

Full text: If the persistent snow banks didn't make getting around hard enough, freezing rain is expected to be added to the mix on Wednesday and Thursday.
We've gone from deep freeze, to seasonal norms, to unseasonably warm weather and are now bracing for freezing rain, rain, a snowstorm, and then back to the deep freeze.
If the winter were a children's toy, it would be a yo-yo, as Montrealers have dealt with extremes during the first three weeks of winter.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rush-hour-slightly-less-arduous-as-snow-clearing-operations-continue ) who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow.
"We're improving our services and it shows," Plante said at the webcast of the executive committee meeting Monday morning, after saying that the city received 1,600 fewer complaints than it did at this point of the season last year.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the city reported it had completed 42 per cent of the snow removal operation. According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The boroughs with the least amount of snow cleared were Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at 30 per cent.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sue Montgomery, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough mayor, acknowledged the slow pace of snow clearing in her borough. In a Facebook post she said she understands residents' frustration and asks for their patience.
"What I'm told is that the equipment was set to pick up the piles of snow on Monday but then had to be dispatched to plow snow because of the snowfall that day. And I'm told it's bad everywhere in Montreal," she wrote. "Believe me, I'm watching and asking so we can get it right."
The snowbanks will become crustier and heavier in the coming days, as freezing rain is expected to start falling around dinnertime.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )at 11 a.m.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay and La Prairie areas, saying roads and sidewalks could become slippery as temperatures warm up to 6 C on Thursday and Friday. Temperatures will dip back down near the freezing mark on Saturday and the rain will change to snow. About 15 centimetres of snow is expected before temperatures plummet to a high of -14 C on Sunday.

Abstract: After a brutal cold spell( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baby-its-cold-outside ) that lasted almost two weeks, Mother Nature is offering up something a bit more appealing this week. A low-pressure system and a warm front from Hudson Bay is expected to bring rain showers on Thursday with a forecast high of between 5 and 10 C. The record for Jan. 11, registered in both 1975 and 1980, is 9.4 C, according to Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada. Early in the day delays had been reported due to snow clogged switching stations on the tracks.

Montreal could see freezing rain or mixed precipitation on Wednesday before temperatures climb on Thursday, Bégin said.
The mild weather will probably not lead to flooding because the thaw and the rain will not last long, Bégin predicted. The snow on the ground will also absorb some of the rain, he said. Temperatures will fall throughout the day on Friday with colder weather returning for the weekend. Environment Canada is forecasting a high of minus-11 C on Saturday and Sunday.

Snow clearing begins
On Monday night, the city of Montreal began clearing away the snow that has fallen during the last week. About 10 centimetres of snow fell through the day on Monday with another two to four centimetres expected Monday night.
The city received several small accumulations of snow since the last clearing operation was completed on New Year's Eve. A total of 18.4 centimetres had fallen as of Sunday.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the No Parking signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
During the weekend, several boroughs had lots of snow on the streets, and while sidewalk plows were out, many streets remained snow-covered. The centralized snow-clearing policy means the city decides when plowing and removal operations take place.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation on itsInfo-Neige website( https://infoneige.ca/ ) (infoneige.ca) or on its mobile application.
An RTM commuter train sits in the Lucien-L'Allier station in Montreal on Monday January 8, 2018. Early in the day delays had been reported due to snow clogged switching stations on the tracks.
Trains delayed
The snowfall caused long delays for evening train commuters. The Réseau de transport métropolitain announced delays of up to 30 minutes for departures on all six commuter train lines, including three cancellations on the Candiac line because the window wipers weren't working.
Strong winds continually pushed snow onto the tracks and ice formed on several switches, resulting in delays, said Elaine Arsenault, a spokesperson for the RTM.
Pierre Roussin, who takes the train to Laval each evening, was thankful that his 6:45 p.m. train was not delayed. He said heavy snow often causes havoc with switches during the winter so he takes delays in his stride. "They don't happen that often," he said.
Arsenault said she wasn't expected delays to commuter train services on Tuesday morning.
A motorist digs out his car as another waits for an STM bus to pass on Joesph St. in Verdun on Monday evening. STM buses are forced to work their way around snow clogged city streets and cars that did not shovel a space before parking causing some streets to become almost one lane.
Dozens of crashes
A woman in her 70s died Monday evening after the car she was travelling in flipped over on Highway 10 in Marieville, in the Montérégie.
About 40 cars went off the road during the snowfall on Monday, said Claude Denis, a spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
Police in Laval said the slippery conditions resulted in several motorists ending up in the ditch during the commute home Monday night.

Full text: Tuesday's rush hour was already looking better than Monday's, with fewer transit delays, and some streets plowed and cleared.
A snow removal operation began Monday at 7 p.m., and by Tuesday morning, only Pierrefonds-Roxboro had not yet started hauling away snow.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the 'no parking' signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation on itsInfo-Neige website( https://infoneige.ca/ ) (infoneige.ca) or on its mobile application.
Many streets were still snow-covered throughout the island on Tuesday after 12 centimetres fell steadily throughout the day on Monday, meaning a total accumulation of 30 cm since the city completed its last snow-removal operation on New Year's Eve. And while the snow caused dozens of train delays on Monday, the St-Jérôme line and the Deux-Montagnes lines had slight delays on Tuesday.
Temperatures are expected to continue to rise throughout the week after a brutal cold spell( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baby-its-cold-outside ) that lasted almost two weeks.
A low-pressure system and a warm front from Hudson Bay is expected to bring rain showers on Thursday with a forecast high of between 5 and 10 C. The record for Jan. 11, registered in both 1975 and 1980, is 9.4 C, according to Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.

Abstract: After a brutal cold spell( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baby-its-cold-outside ) that lasted almost two weeks, Mother Nature is offering up something a bit more appealing this week. A low-pressure system and a warm front from Hudson Bay is expected to bring rain showers on Thursday with a forecast high of between 5 and 10 C. The record for Jan. 11, registered in both 1975 and 1980, is 9.4 C, according to Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada. Early in the day delays had been reported due to snow clogged switching stations on the tracks.

A low-pressure system and a warm front from Hudson Bay is expected to bring rain showers on Thursday with a forecast high of between 5 and 10 C. The record for Jan. 11, registered in both 1975 and 1980, is 9.4 C, according to Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.
Montreal could see freezing rain or mixed precipitation on Wednesday before temperatures climb on Thursday, Bégin said.
The mild weather will probably not lead to flooding because the thaw and the rain will not last long, Bégin predicted. The snow on the ground will also absorb some of the rain, he said. Temperatures will fall throughout the day on Friday with colder weather returning for the weekend. Environment Canada is forecasting a high of minus-11 C on Saturday and Sunday.

Snow clearing begins
On Monday night, the city of Montreal began clearing away the snow that has fallen during the last week. About 10 centimetres of snow fell through the day on Monday with another two to four centimetres expected Monday night.
The city received several small accumulations of snow since the last clearing operation was completed on New Year's Eve. A total of 18.4 centimetres had fallen as of Sunday.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the No Parking signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
During the weekend, several boroughs had lots of snow on the streets, and while sidewalk plows were out, many streets remained snow-covered. The centralized snow-clearing policy means the city decides when plowing and removal operations take place.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation online through the website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/carte ) or by downloading the mobile app( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/operations-delais#dintelligent ).
An RTM commuter train sits in the Lucien-L'Allier station in Montreal on Monday January 8, 2018. Early in the day delays had been reported due to snow clogged switching stations on the tracks.
Trains delayed
The snowfall caused long delays for evening train commuters. The Réseau de transport métropolitain announced delays of up to 30 minutes for departures on all six commuter train lines, including three cancellations on the Candiac line because the window wipers weren't working.
Strong winds continually pushed snow onto the tracks and ice formed on several switches, resulting in delays, said Elaine Arsenault, a spokesperson for the RTM.
Pierre Roussin, who takes the train to Laval each evening, was thankful that his 6:45 p.m. train was not delayed. He said heavy snow often causes havoc with switches during the winter so he takes delays in his stride. "They don't happen that often," he said.
Arsenault said she wasn't expected delays to commuter train services on Tuesday morning.
A motorist digs out his car as another waits for an STM bus to pass on Joesph St. in Verdun on Monday evening. STM buses are forced to work their way around snow clogged city streets and cars that did not shovel a space before parking causing some streets to become almost one lane.
Dozens of crashes
A woman in her 70s died Monday evening after the car she was travelling in flipped over on Highway 10 in Marieville, in the Montérégie.
About 40 cars went off the road during the snowfall on Monday, said Claude Denis, a spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
Police in Laval said the slippery conditions resulted in several motorists ending up in the ditch during the commute home Monday night.

A snow removal operation began Monday at 7 p.m., and by Tuesday morning, only Pierrefonds-Roxboro had not yet started hauling away snow.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the 'no parking' signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation on itsInfo-Neige website( https://infoneige.ca/ ) (infoneige.ca) or on its mobile application.
Many streets were still snow-covered throughout the island on Tuesday after 12 centimetres fell steadily throughout the day on Monday, meaning a total accumulation of 30 cm since the city completed its last snow-removal operation on New Year's Eve. And while the snow caused dozens of train delays on Monday, the St-Jérôme line and the Deux-Montagnes lines had slight delays on Tuesday.
Temperatures are expected to continue to rise throughout the week after a brutal cold spell( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baby-its-cold-outside ) that lasted almost two weeks.

The mild weather will probably not lead to flooding because the thaw and the rain will not last long, Bégin predicted. The snow on the ground will also absorb some of the rain, he said. Temperatures will fall throughout the day on Friday with colder weather returning for the weekend. Environment Canada is forecasting a high of minus-11 C on Saturday and Sunday.

Snow clearing begins
On Monday night, the city of Montreal began clearing away the snow that has fallen during the last week. About 10 centimetres of snow fell through the day on Monday with another two to four centimetres expected Monday night.
The city received several small accumulations of snow since the last clearing operation was completed on New Year's Eve. A total of 18.4 centimetres had fallen as of Sunday.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the No Parking signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
During the weekend, several boroughs had lots of snow on the streets, and while sidewalk plows were out, many streets remained snow-covered. The centralized snow-clearing policy means the city decides when plowing and removal operations take place.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation on itsInfo-Neige website( https://infoneige.ca/ ) (infoneige.ca) or on its mobile application.
An RTM commuter train sits in the Lucien-L'Allier station in Montreal on Monday January 8, 2018. Early in the day delays had been reported due to snow clogged switching stations on the tracks.
Trains delayed
The snowfall caused long delays for evening train commuters. The Réseau de transport métropolitain announced delays of up to 30 minutes for departures on all six commuter train lines, including three cancellations on the Candiac line because the window wipers weren't working.
Strong winds continually pushed snow onto the tracks and ice formed on several switches, resulting in delays, said Elaine Arsenault, a spokesperson for the RTM.
Pierre Roussin, who takes the train to Laval each evening, was thankful that his 6:45 p.m. train was not delayed. He said heavy snow often causes havoc with switches during the winter so he takes delays in his stride. "They don't happen that often," he said.
Arsenault said she wasn't expected delays to commuter train services on Tuesday morning.
A motorist digs out his car as another waits for an STM bus to pass on Joesph St. in Verdun on Monday evening. STM buses are forced to work their way around snow clogged city streets and cars that did not shovel a space before parking causing some streets to become almost one lane.
Dozens of crashes
A woman in her 70s was in critical condition Monday evening after the car she was travelling in flipped over on Highway 10 in Marieville, in the Montérégie.
About 40 cars went off the road during the snowfall on Monday, said Claude Denis, a spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
Police in Laval said the slippery conditions resulted in several motorists ending up in the ditch during the commute home Monday night.

Less severe delays were announced for the Deux-Montagnes, Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Mascouche lines.
Delayed are the 4:20, 4:40 and 5 p.m. departures toward Vaudreuil-Hudson, the 4:55 p.m. departure from Vaudreuil to Montreal, the 3:50, 4:05 and 4:35 p.m. departures toward Saint-Jérôme, the 3:45 p.m. departure from Saint-Jérôme toward Montreal, and the 3:35, 4:15 and 4:45 p.m. departures toward Candiac. The 3:55, 5:15 and 5:55 p.m. departures for Candiac were cancelled.

Full text: After a brutal cold spell( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baby-its-cold-outside ) that lasted almost two weeks, Mother Nature is offering up something a bit more appealing later this week.
A low pressure system and a warm front from Hudson Bay is expected to bring rain showers on Thursday with a forecast high of between 5 and 10 C. The record for Jan. 11, registered in both 1975 and 1980, is 9.4 C, according to Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.
Montreal could see freezing rain or mixed precipitation on Wednesday before temperatures climb on Thursday, Bégin said.
The mild weather will probably not lead to flooding because the thaw and the rain will not last long, Bégin predicted. The snow on the ground will also absorb some of the rain, he said. Temperatures will fall throughout the day on Friday with colder weather returning for the weekend. Environment Canada is forecasting a high of -11 C on Saturday and Sunday.
On Monday night, the city of Montreal will begin clearing away the snow that has fallen during the last week. About 10 centimetres of snow fell throughout the day on Monday with another two to four centimetres expected Monday night.
The city received several small accumulations of snow since the last clearing operation was completed on New Year's Eve. A total of 18.4 centimetres had fallen as of Sunday.
"We need the cooperation of citizens and want people to respect the No Parking signs," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
Parenteau said he hopes the snow-removal operation will be finished by Thursday night.
During the weekend, several boroughs had lots of snow on the streets, and while sidewalk plows were out, many streets remained snow-covered. The centralized snow-clearing policy means the city decides when plowing and removal operations take place.
You can keep track of the city's snow-removal operation on itsInfo-Neige website( https://infoneige.ca/ ) or on its mobile application.

Full text: We talked to a handful of Quebecers about the 1998 Ice Storm. Here are four stories of a baby born, a farm family stranded, a coming together in Kahnawake and a cancer battle that could not wait.
'There was no stopping' the ice storm baby
It felt like the universe was playing a trick on Jolene Bear.
Of all the times her daughter could have come into the world, it had to be one month early, in the midst of the most devastating ice storm to hit Quebec in generations.
When Bear's water broke on Jan. 9, 1998, the freezing rain had battered Montreal's South Shore for nearly 80 consecutive hours - razing hydro towers, shattering trees and cloaking the region in darkness.
"The timing wasn't great," says Bear, a resident of the Kahnawake Mohawk territory. "Our power was out, we were sleeping at my mother-in-law's. There were 10 of us in that house and the roads were all covered in ice."
She woke up early that morning and knew right away the baby was coming.
"I didn't want to wake everyone up, I didn't want to cause a panic, so I hid the fact that I was in labour for a while," Bear says. "My husband's grandmother was the only other person awake, so we just sat and told stories and I hoped she wouldn't notice."
A few hours later, Bear called the local ambulance, which took over an hour to navigate the ice and tree-covered streets before arriving outside the Kahnawake home.
"When they wheeled me out - I'll never forget this - I had to close my eyes because the ice pellets were hitting me in the face," she says. "It was nice outside, sunny even, but that ice kept falling."
"My water broke in the ambulance and I remember saying, 'Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!' There was no stopping her."
Five minutes after the paramedics carted Bear into the LaSalle hospital, Ta'kawisenhawe Ivory Stacey was born.
The name Ivory came from the child's aunt - who accompanied Bear to the hospital. Her Mohawk name, Ta'kawisenhawe, commemorates the chaos of Stacey's birthday. Translated into English, it literally means, "She brings the ice."
That she was born in the midst of Ice Storm '98 has given Stacey a small measure of celebrity in Kahnawake.
"When I told her the Gazette was doing a story about her birth, she kind of rolled her eyes like 'No big deal,' " Bear says. "People in town will tell her, 'You're the Ice Storm baby, you're the Ice Storm baby.' She's known for it in these parts."
Stranded on the farm, 'we rationed our fuel and made do'
Kelly Greig was lying in bed when she heard the trees crackling.
Freezing rain had been building up on the branches for hours and now they began snapping off and slamming onto the frozen ground. The thought that one of the trees could crash into the family farmhouse kept her awake for hours.
"When I woke up the next day, everything was frozen and the power was out," said Kelly, who lived on her family's farm in Ormstown during Ice Storm '98. "My dad told us school was cancelled, which is an awesome thing to hear when you're 10 years old."
But the freezing rain wouldn't let up and soon began wreaking havoc in Ormstown and the other farming communities spread across the Chateauguay Valley.
"I remember hearing a snap and I went to the upstairs window," said Kelly's mother, Mary Greig. "You could see the power line sagging and then all of a sudden the pole just snapped in half and then the next one snapped in half and the next one. I watched 20 poles go down like dominoes."

For the Greigs - who had 50 cows that needed milking each day - there was no time to sit around and wait for help. Every morning, Kelly's father, David Greig, would fire up a tractor-powered generator to get the milking machine in gear.
As David and his son tended to the cattle, Mary drew power from the generator to cook a meal and watch the news for updates on the government responses to the brewing crisis.
If the tractor ran out of diesel fuel or if they overloaded the generator, the whole operation would have screeched to a halt. There were diesel shortages across the valley since other farmers were also leaning on generators to keep their businesses alive.
"Had we known the power would have been out for 21 days, maybe we would have done things differently, but we didn't know," said David. "So we had to improvise. We rationed our fuel and made do with what we had."
The initial onslaught of ice effectively stranded the Greigs on their property - severing its ties to the power grid and telephone lines. And with hydro poles strewn across the roads and downed trees blocking access to the house, there was little contact between the family and the outside world.
But then David came up with an idea that was equal parts brilliant and reckless.
"We went over to the telephone line with a crowbar and broke the icy crust off it," he said. "I thought that if I could just get the wire re-attached, the phone would work again and then we'd be in business. So we spliced it together and it actually worked."
Kelly said she was just glad her father didn't electrocute himself and light up like a Christmas tree.
"It was one of those things that, at the time, seemed like it could have gone either way," she said.
"But we were also three kids stuck in a house with our parents for a month. We must have driven them crazy. I think we were all relieved when school started back again." (Courtesy of the Greig family)
Looking back, the Greigs say they're lucky they made out as well as they did. Farmers in Hemmingford, about 30 kilometres east of Ormstown, went without power for a whole month and some lost livestock.
"When I look back, I just remember my mom and dad doing whatever they could to make it easier on us," Kelly said. "My mom, she was a schoolteacher, she had us reading, playing every board game you can imagine. I must have played her at checkers like 40 times and she never let me win.
"But we were also three kids stuck in a house with our parents for a month. We must have driven them crazy. I think we were all relieved when school started back again."
In Kahnawake, 'We were ready for it'
Kellyann Meloche daydreams about worst-case scenarios: natural disasters, plane crashes, train derailments and the like.
She'll be the first to admit it's not the healthiest preoccupation, but it's one that's essential to her work.
As the longtime head of Kahnawake's emergency preparedness team, Meloche tries to predict and avert crises. She was still relatively new to the job in January 1998, on the eve of an ice storm that would bring down the South Shore's power grid for weeks.
"My colleagues used to call me Chicken Little - they thought I was always running around saying the sky was about to fall," says Meloche. "I remember looking at the forecast that January and my mind started to see that worst-case scenario. They were calling for seven days of freezing rain and snow.
"That's not only improbable, it's nearly impossible to see that kind of consistent ice storm."
Meloche says her instinct to envision chaos helped her see the potential for disaster and take action. Her team sprang into action days before the storm, setting up a command centre at the fire station and soliciting cots from the Red Cross to set up an emergency shelter at the local Knights of Columbus club.
Meanwhile, families with wood- or oil-burning stoves agreed to take in relatives whose homes relied on electricity for heat in the event of a massive power failure. By the time the power actually failed on Jan. 6, Meloche had already secured extra fuel and generators to keep the town running.
"We were ready for it," Meloche says. "It was incredible how the community came together. If you were to walk through the streets of Kahnawake in the middle of January 1998, you would have seen something incredible: people with their own trucks, their own chainsaws clearing trees from the streets, people cutting branches down before they could take out power lines.
"Neighbours helped neighbours, people just banded together and there was this real sense of solidarity. It brought out the best in everyone."
The storm didn't leave Kahnawake unscathed: hydro poles snapped under the weight of the ice, people's cars crashed into ditches and the community lost power for weeks. And while the Canadian Forces dispatched thousands of troops to help with relief efforts in nearby communities, the Mohawk territory actually declined its offer of assistance.
Eight years earlier - during the 1990 Oka Crisis - the military had landed on the South Shore reserve and forced a confrontation that led to a number of serious injuries among the civilian population.
"The wound from 1990 was still fresh and people didn't want to see army trucks rolling through town," Meloche said. "But I think there was also a sense that we had it under control and that we could help ourselves. And we did."
In the end, Meloche earned the Deputy Minister's Award for her community's response to the ice storm.
"More than anything, you're proud of the community," Meloche says. "You're proud of the moms and dads who busted out the board games to keep their kids from going crazy. Proud of the teachers who volunteered to do activities with kids at the Knights of Columbus. You're proud of the chefs who made enough food to feed our elders and hundreds of others.
"You're proud to be from a place that really values togetherness."
The 'craziness' of fighting cancer in the freezing rain
On the fourth day of the 1998 Ice Storm, Montreal resident Romy Schnaiberg called the hospital to see if her latest round of chemotherapy would be cancelled.
"I remember the nurse just said, 'Yeah, you have chemo, you need to come in," said Schnaiberg, a mother of two young children who had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer diagnosed in 1997. "Life goes on. I thought maybe I don't come in because there's an ice storm. They thought I was nuts."
The freezing rain shut down highways, damaged 24,000 hydro poles and downed thousands of kilometres of power lines - effectively bringing life to a halt in Montreal and beyond. For Schnaiberg, however, there was no choice but to keep fighting the disease that was eating away at her.
And as if the difficulty of navigating motherhood and cancer treatment during a once-in-a-lifetime ice storm wasn't enough, the chemotherapy drugs administered to Schnaiberg that day in 1998 sent her into anaphylactic shock.
"It looked like, for all intents and purposes, a heart attack," she said. "I was in a packed emergency room in the middle of the storm. It was craziness.
"When things finally settled down, I told the doctors, 'I've got a four-year-old and a two-year-old and I have to get home and make life normal for them. And they said, 'You don't understand. You're really sick.' It hadn't occurred to me, until that point, that I was that sick."
Following her doctor's recommendations, Schnaiberg decided to move her family into her husband's grandmother's apartment in Côte-St-Luc. It was one of the few buildings in the city that hadn't lost power during the storm.
"With the sickness, the kids had already had so much destruction in their lives," said Schnaiberg. "I'd had surgeries, I'd lost my hair, I was weak from the chemo. My daughter Kelsey, she used to drag my wig around the house and say, 'Mommy, put on your hair.'
"So you're in this extreme situation - in and out of the hospital, staying at a relative's apartment - and you end up having to ask for help. And you get so much support from your family, your friends, from complete strangers, from a doctor who offers his home phone number.
"There were communities cropping up everywhere, you know, wherever people needed help, people were cropping up to help them. I had people bringing me food, helping me out and all I needed to focus on was me and the kids."
Romy Schnaiberg celebrates her daughter Kelsey's birthday shortly after the 1998 ice storm. Schnaiberg battled breast cancer during the storm.
When the storm finally passed, Schnaiberg and her husband wrestled with the sorts of inconveniences that plagued families across the region: house repairs, insurance companies and finding a way to get back to normal. But while the storm presented her family with its own unique challenge, it also marked the beginning of Schnaiberg's journey toward remission.
"Sometimes people will talk about the storm and they'll try to one up each other with horror stories," she says. "I never say anything. For me, it was all part of a journey.
"I never thought of myself as a strong person before the cancer, but I think it took (the Ice Storm) for me to realize I was."

20 years later, are we ready for another Ice Storm?

Abstract: Due to climate change, in the future "it's quite probable that when we do have ice storms, the accumulations of ice will be larger," Atallah said. Experts expect more precipitation will fall in the form of freezing rain in the future, and scientists think that due to climate change, "patterns will be moving more slowly and so storms may be more persistent," Atallah said. [...]there's no "statistically significant trend in the data" to predict an increase in the number of ice storms - prolonged periods of freezing rain that cause significant ice accumulation. Power was gradually restored during the Ice Storm with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces and crews from other jurisdictions, including this one from Connecticut Light and Power Company working on Hydro lines on Oxford St. in N.D.G. After 1998, Quebec reorganized and expanded its network of emergency-response offices and started working more closely with municipalities, which are responsible for managing emergencies within their jurisdictions.

Full text: A rare confluence of circumstances is required for freezing rain to develop: precipitation falling in an area where a layer of warm air is sandwiched between two layers of cold air.
The bad news: Montreal is one of the most freezing-rain prone regions in North America. The worse news: climate change may make ice storms more frequent - and more drawn out.
That means we may yet see a replay of the extraordinary 1998 Ice Storm, which plunged half of Quebec into darkness, in some cases for weeks.
Twenty years later, is Quebec's power supply more secure and are Quebecers better prepared for weather disasters?
***
A remarkable amount of freezing rain fell in southern Quebec between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10, 1998. In some places, 110 millimetres fell, double the normal annual total.
Unable to withstand the weight of the ice, Hydro-Québec structures toppled like dominoes, taking with them wires carrying electricity. The tally: 1,000 steel pylons and 24,000 wood poles damaged, and thousands of kilometres of power lines downed.

By Jan. 6, 700,000 customers were without power. And it got worse.
Four days later, 1.4 million Hydro customers were in the dark, representing 3.5 million people or half the province's population. Businesses, bridges and highways were closed. Métro service was curtailed. Bank machines went down; stores that remained open couldn't process credit cards. People were told to avoid blacked-out downtown Montreal. Mail delivery was suspended. There were lineups for gas.
Montrealers didn't know it at the time but two key water-filtration plants that serve 1.5 million people lost power; they could not pump water to homes and fire hydrants. They were completely down for two hours and partially disabled for five more. Fortunately, no water contamination was reported, nor was any major fire called in.
With the help of the Armed Forces and crews from other jurisdictions, power was gradually restored. By Day 12, a return to normal was in sight, though 285,000 customers were still without power. In a few areas - including the hardest-hit "triangle of darkness," around St-Jean-sur-Richelieu - some waited 33 days for power to return.
During the 1998 Ice Storm, some were without power and out of their homes for a month. Here, a child at one of the shelters is overcome with tears.
Thirty Quebecers perished during the storm and its aftermath. Among them, 10 died of burns after using various means - candles, oil lamps, fondue pots - to stay warm, with another six dying of carbon monoxide poisoning after firing up generators indoors. Four people died after falling off roofs they were clearing of ice.
The storm also ravaged parts of Ontario and the northeastern United States. It was the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history. In Quebec alone, the damage was estimated at $3 billion.

Eyad Atallah studies extreme precipitation.
He's expecting to be busy in the years to come because of climate change.
Freezing rain normally occurs only a handful of times per winter in Montreal and it lasts only a few hours, said Atallah, a research associate at McGill University's Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department.
The 1998 storm was almost unprecedented because the weather mix remained stationary for several days, he noted.
Mayor Pierre Bourque inspects a mountain of dead branches on Mount Royal in January 1998, when the Ice Storm damaged an estimated four out of five trees.
Due to climate change, in the future "it's quite probable that when we do have ice storms, the accumulations of ice will be larger," Atallah said.
"That's because the amount of precipitation we expect in storms in general is going to go up as the atmosphere warms up. We're already seeing that trend; we don't even need to go into projections."
Experts expect more precipitation will fall in the form of freezing rain in the future, and scientists think that due to climate change, "patterns will be moving more slowly and so storms may be more persistent," Atallah said.
But so far there's no "statistically significant trend in the data" to predict an increase in the number of ice storms - prolonged periods of freezing rain that cause significant ice accumulation.
How should Quebec prepare?
Hundreds of ice-storm victims queued for hours Jan. 29, 1998, in the gymnasium at CEGEP St-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
"The only thing you can really do is work on infrastructure and on emergency-response management," Atallah said.
At the peak of the 1998 storm, a single teetering transmission line remained to power the entire island of Montreal.
"If that line had gone down, the humanitarian disaster would have been much worse," Atallah said. "Shelters would have been lost, hospitals would have lost power. We were really on the brink of a much bigger disaster."
But emergency-preparedness isn't just Hydro's responsibility, he added.
"People died (in 1998) of carbon monoxide poisoning because they were trying to heat their homes with inappropriate means," Atallah said. "We have to make sure people are educated about what they can and can't do. We need shelters that are stormproof, and to make sure that people have safer alternatives for heating homes."

Marie-Ève Grenier is working to ensure future power failures aren't as devastating.
An engineer, she works in the Hydro-Québec division that operates and develops transmission lines.
The utility spent $2 billion in the aftermath of 1998, rebuilding its network and adding capacity, including new transmission lines serving Montreal and areas south of the city.
"We improved the configuration of the transmission system," Grenier said.
"We built new lines so that we have 'loops' - if a transmission line fails, we have alternative paths for the electricity. If we have one line failure, we can count on another one."
One of the new loops serves downtown Montreal.
In addition to the redundant power supply, Hydro upgraded the network of enormous towers that carry transmission lines and the wood poles that carry power to homes and businesses.
Marie-Eve Grenier of Hydro-Quebec says fortification of polls and pylons means the utility is better able to withstand freezing-rain storms. "You don't avoid the power failure but it's faster to restore it."
Every tenth transmission pylon is now a more robust "anti-cascading tower" that is heavier and stronger than other towers, Grenier said. That means fewer would fall in an ice storm, she said, noting "in 1998, 40, 50 kilometres of lines were crashing down."
And cables attached to anti-cascading towers are fastened in such a way that if ice-laden cables plunge to the ground, they won't bring the tower down with them, she added.
After the storm, a public inquiry headed by engineer Roger Nicolet recommended Hydro-Québec bury distribution lines, which in most parts of Quebec are overhead, held up by utility poles.
But Hydro deemed that measure infeasible because burying all of Quebec's distribution lines would cost $80 billion, Grenier said.
"We decided to go for a compromise" by fortifying wood poles so they better withstand harsh weather, she added.
In 1998, many wood poles snapped in two or were toppled.
Newer poles are a bit thicker, and the part atop poles that holds up the wires, known as a "crossarm," is now made of plastic instead of wood. In extreme weather, the plastic crossarms break, not the poles.
"You don't avoid the power failure but it's faster to restore it," Grenier said.
Other post-1998 Hydro innovations include a de-icing gizmo that uses a revolver barrel and blank cartridges to break the ice on overhead ground wires.
Hydro also intensified vegetation control because falling branches and entire trees felled many power lines in 1998.
During the Ice Storm 1998, businesses, bridges and highways were closed. Metro and bus service was curtailed. Bank machines went down; stores that remained open couldn't process credit cards.
Grenier said Quebecers worried about a replay of 1998 can rest easy.
"We have a more robust, reliable grid," she said. "We can't be totally immune (to major storms) but the impact of another ice storm would be minimized and the service would be restored quickly."
If Quebec experienced a repeat of January 1998's weather, the power might go off, but "instead of a couple of weeks, it would be more in terms of days."

Éric Houde is known as Monsieur Catastrophes.
He's Quebec's disaster point man, dealing with catastrophes such as the 2013 derailment of a train carrying crude oil that claimed 47 lives in Lac-Mégantic, and the 2014 fire that killed 32 people in a seniors' residence in L'Isle-Verte.
The Ice Storm was a game changer for emergency preparedness in Quebec, Houde said.
"The government response is now structured, organized - it's like an orchestra, everybody knows their roles," every department knows its responsibilities, said Houde. His official title is director of operations for Quebec's civil protection department, the outfit responsible for readying the province for disasters.
Power was gradually restored during the Ice Storm with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces and crews from other jurisdictions, including this one from Connecticut Light and Power Company working on Hydro lines on Oxford St. in N.D.G.
After 1998, Quebec reorganized and expanded its network of emergency-response offices and started working more closely with municipalities, which are responsible for managing emergencies within their jurisdictions.
"We ask the municipalities to inform people of local risks - whether that's living near a waterway, a railway, an industrial park or some other risk - and to inform the population on the measures to take in case an event happens," Houde said.
By law, Quebec municipalities must have an emergency plan in place, but Houde acknowledged that some are more prepared than others.
The province guides cities and towns as they analyze risks and prepare for any contingency. They should, for example, have access to a generator-equipped co-ordination centre, as well as sources of fuel for generators in a power failure and of drinking water in case the waterworks are down, Houde said.
He also has advice for the public.
"What I say to my family is, '(In an emergency) would you be self-sufficient for 72 hours? Would you have enough drinkable water? Would you have enough money in your pocket if the bank machines weren't working? Is your car's gas tank full in case there's a fuel shortage?'"
Do you know where your scraper is? And how about a three-day home emergency kit? The Quebec government can help you prepare: Here, a Montrealer resorted to a spade for clearing snow off his car on Lincoln Ave. in downtown Montreal on Jan. 6, 1998.
Houde wants all Quebecers to visit his department's website to get a list of supplies that every home should have in its three-day emergency kit( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/family-safety-plan/emergency-kit.html ).
In its 1999 report, the Nicolet Ice Storm inquiry said it should not be surprising that Quebec lacked a "culture of civil security focused on prevention and preparation" because, as a society, the province considers itself invulnerable.
Quebecers think "disturbances of the past will not be repeated. Events such as the War Measures Act of October 1970, the (Oka) crisis of 1990, the St-Basile-le-Grand PCB fire or the Saguenay floods are perceived as isolated one-off phenomena," the report said.
But Houde said that changed after 1998.
"More and more people are conscious of the fact that you have to be prepared," he said. "They know that preparation and prevention are key."
Today, Quebec also knows it must learn from mistakes, Houde added, noting the province has a policy of debriefing officials after disasters.
This month, Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux hosted a meeting of provincial and municipal officials to review the response to devastating floods that inundated more than 5,000 homes in Montreal and other parts of Quebec in the spring of 2017.
The look back provided a stark reminder that emergency planning still needs work.
Coiteux's department disclosed a government-commissioned survey that found widespread dissatisfaction among flood victims.
Six out of 10 said their municipality provided no safety tips before the floods and half said they were not satisfied with the municipal help they received during the flooding. Most also said they were dissatisfied with Quebec's compensation program.
"It's true that it wasn't perfect," Coiteux said of Quebec's flood crisis management. "We can do better in all three phases" of a disaster - before, during and after.

'Facing a new reality'; West Island cities pressed to clear icy, snowy streets

Full text: It can take days for Montreal to dig out from a blizzard.
While inner-city streets often become clogged after a major snowfall, most suburban roads are cleared relatively quickly.
With less traffic and fewer vehicles parked on West Island streets, snow plows can clear the streets quickly compared to city boroughs like Plateau-Mont-Royal and Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Damede-Grace.
As of Feb. 15, 171 centimetres of snow had fallen on Montreal, eclipsing last year's winter total of 169 cm.
Snow clearing and removal efforts have tested municipalities across the island, but some are more effective than others.
The city of Pointe-Claire uses teams of both private and public workers to clear its streets and sidewalks.
"To ensure effective snow removal throughout our territory, we have a private contractor serving the industrial sector, while our employees clear snow in the residential sector," said city spokesperson Marie-Pier Paquette-Seguin.
"This means that operations can be carried out simultaneously and performances can easily be compared."
Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle said snow clearing is one of the "major services" it provides to local citizens.
"I must admit though, it is simpler (here) than in Montreal because we have a no-parking law in the winter for overnight. So when there is a storm we start working around midnight, between midnight and 2 a.m. depending on the storm, and we can rapidly go through our city."
He said the municipality deploys about eight to 10 trucks to clear snow from approximately 125 kilometres of roads and another 30 km of sidewalks.
Bourelle said towing parked cars is not a common occurrence in Beaconsfield. "If we have to, we'll have it towed, but it's not a major problem for us."
Bourelle said his city has had to use heavy graters this winter because of icy conditions.
"All of us are facing a new reality because of climate change," he said.
"There is a lot more rain and freezing rain, mixed with snow. I don't need to tell you it makes for very icy streets. And on some streets you end up with a layer of ice and we've had to use graters to remove the ice, which makes it more challenging."
By mid-February, Bourelle said Beaconsfield's crews had already spread as much salt on its roads and sidewalks as all of last winter. "We're over 1,500 tonnes now," he said. "That's about the limit we would normally use for the whole winter."
Andrew Duffield, head of public works for Beaconsfield, said the city has a "White Road Policy," which calls for a strategic use of abrasives.
"It means we prioritize the road conditions on our arteries and collectors, hills, curves and sidewalks by spreading salt and abrasives as required. And on our secondary and tertiary roads we apply salt and abrasives at the stop signs but not through out the length of the street," Duffield said.
"This allows us to greatly reduce the amount of salt we use, and the impact on the environment. In the event, of an ice storm like we experienced over the holidays, we apply salt and abrasives throughout our entire road network."
Bourelle said Beaconsfield residents have come to expect effective snow clearing.
"We have very demanding residents so we have to be very good at it. Otherwise we'll hear about it from our citizens," he said with a laugh. jmeagher@postmedia.com

Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal at 3:35 p.m. The federal agency predicted that freezing rain would turn to snow later in the evening.
The forecast for Wednesday calls for about 2 centimetres of snow, with winds gusting up to 70 kilometres an hour in the afternoon.
Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau, of the Surete du Quebec, said that several cars slid off Highways 40 and 30, but there were no major accidents.
Meanwhile, the Aeroports de Montreal reported that more than three dozen flight arrivals were delayed at Trudeau airport. A dozen scheduled departures were also delayed, and there were a couple of cancellations. Postmedia News

Amateur weatherman predicts a nasty storm; Snow, pellets, rain and sleet expected to fall on city starting today

Abstract: The area around Mont-Tremblant, Saint-Sauveur and Ste-Agathe could be covered in ice by mid-morning Tuesday - Sirois believes the region will see up to 15 millimetres of rain followed by about 20 centimetres of snow.

Full text:   While scores of Quebecers binged on meat pie and malt liquor this Christmas Eve, Mark Sirois's mind drifted into a visions of an icy future.
Sirois, 45, is an amateur meteorologist who admits he probably spends too much time daydreaming about low-pressure systems.
His weather obsession got the better of him on Dec. 24, when he first noticed the perfect storm brewing: frozen pellets, thick snow, rain and sleet set to blanket southern Quebec this Tuesday.
The picture only became clearer over the following week as data from a dozen international weather prediction models began to pour in.
At one point, Sirois even traced a map of Quebec on a piece of paper, held it up to his computer screen and compared a half-dozen weather models to see which regions of the province might be hit the hardest.
By New Year's Eve he was certain this perfect storm would come and the following day he posted a detailed alert message online - beating Environment Canada's prediction by nearly 24 hours.
When all the hours of tracing, number crunching and analysis ended, Sirois said he took a nap.
It is the precision and speed of this amateur sleuthing that's earned the 45-year-old a following of 6,382 daily readers on his Southern Quebec Severe Weather Network Facebook page. Some of his most loyal followers include snow plow operators, TV weather reporters and even Environment Canada employees.
"It may sound crazy but this is what I do for fun," said Sirois, who oversees IBM's major IT projects in Canada when he isn't chasing storms.
"Sometimes, I'll be watching The Bachelor with my wife and then - around 8 p.m. - the new long-term prediction models are released and I've got to slip away to check up on them. My wife thinks I'm a little funny that way."
Sunday's post - which garnered over 120 shares, 300 likes and dozens of comments -warned that Montreal will see a mix of snow, rain and sleet that will make driving dangerous in and around the city.
For Sirois, the fun about trying to predict weather comes because of its inherently unpredictable nature. Tuesday's storm, for instance, will be caused by a "Colorado low" system sweeping in from the Great Lakes and into Montreal.
Ordinarily, that would mean heavy snow but this particular system is wrapped around a pocket of warm air. That means we'll likely see fits of rain and freezing rain with the snow.
"A little bit east of Montreal, in Drummondville, the temperature at minus-1 may decide to fall as snow but it may mix with freezing rain.
"If it's snow, it'll accumulate one way. If it's rain, you'll see a different sort of accumulation," said Sirois. "It's hard to now exactly how much of what we're going to get. But that's where the fun lies."
Sirois broke his prediction down into regions. Places like Ormstown, Huntington and Lacolle in southern Quebec could be hit by up to 30 millimetres of rain. Meanwhile, in the corridor that encompasses Shawinigan, Trois-Rivieres and Quebec City, between 20 and 30 centimetres of snow is expected.
The area around Mont-Tremblant, Saint-Sauveur and Ste-Agathe could be covered in ice by mid-morning Tuesday - Sirois believes the region will see up to 15 millimetres of rain followed by about 20 centimetres of snow.
To those who doubt his bona fides, Sirois says his track record speaks for itself. In November, he beat Meteo Media by two days in declaring that Montrealers would see a white Christmas.
"Based on all the data I looked at, my feeling was we'd get enough cold days just before Christmas so that, on Dec. 25, there'd still be snow on the ground," he said.
"And I was right. I like to try to use long-term forecasts and get ahead of the major networks.
"I will tell you what people appreciate. They like knowing what will happen way in advance. They like the interaction.
"They ask questions and I answer everyone. They like the delivery and my attempt to explain why things happen and why things did not go as planned. There is an accessibility they do not get from other sources. My purpose is to give people as much heads up as possible so they can make alternative travel plans so they are kept safe. I can handle the criticism as long as people are kept alive." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text: First the Grey Cup, then Major League Soccer playoffs, then an outdoor NHL game this weekend. How did the stadium's organizers and groundskeepers pull it off?
?
On a brisk late November afternoon, a group of men instrumental to the operations of Toronto's BMO Field gathered in a lounge on the first level to discuss the whirlwind of activity ahead. They'd been immersed in logistics for months, and finally the busiest, most prestigious five-week period in the facility's young history was upon them.
Over 36 days, their natural-grass stadium would play host to an eclectic mix of major sports events: the Grey Cup, followed three feverish days later by the Major League Soccer playoffs and then a New Year's Day outdoor NHL game.
It was just days before the Grey Cup, and the grounds were busy with workers. The stadium conversions between events would be labour intensive, intricate and done on tight timelines. No stadium had ever held these three particular events in quick succession before, let alone one with the challenge of maintaining a natural pitch to the standards of soccer stars Michael Bradley and Sebastian Giovinco.
Situated along Toronto's lake shore on the grounds of Exhibition Place, BMO Field would most certainly face snow, rain and freezing temperatures during those five weeks. It would be transformed dramatically for each sport, its capacity stretched by different configurations. There would be parades of personnel from three different leagues and loads of media. It would all come with much public hand-wringing over how the grass would hold up.
Over the year the field had already weathered nine Toronto Argonauts football games, a rugby match, two Canadian women's soccer team friendlies and 21 Toronto FC games. The meticulously maintained pitch would need to be dug up and resodded in 2017, but not before going out with a spectacular bang.
Seated at the table in the BMO Field lounge were Nick Eaves, the chief venues and operations officer at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment; Peter Church, the general manager of BMO Field; Robert Heggie, the head groundskeeper; and MLSE's senior director of communications, Dave Haggith. These figures would play the supporting cast to the main character threading through the big sporting events: the stadium itself.
"We definitely want to pitch for more big events like these," said Eaves of the stadium, which opened humbly in 2007 as the home of Toronto FC but underwent a two-phase, $150-million renovation, completed last spring, to make it a multiuse facility and add the Argonauts as tenants. "Yes, these special events are a lot of work, and we know that. But look at the interest. This really shows the versatility of the building, along with the ability of the teams to create very different atmospheres here. How many stadiums can host these three different outdoor sporting events in different setups with different capacities? It's pretty unique."
The group stepped outside, through the same tunnel Toronto FC players use, and stopped abruptly at the edge of the pitch. It was brilliant green and lush. The rest of the stadium was bustling with workers, but the field was quiet. A small sign read: "Please keep off the field."
Stands for portable grow lights sat on the grass - part of the $7-million MLSE has spent in recent years on tools to maintain the field even in Ontario's cold weather. In 2009, the club switched from artificial turf to natural grass and added underground heating and drainage; a hot glycol-water mix pumped through 42 kilometres of pipes keeps the soil temperature at 14 degrees, even on that cold November afternoon.
The stadium hadn't hosted an event since TFC's Oct. 30 playoff win over New York City FC, giving Heggie and his crew time to nurture the grass for the big games ahead.
"The last three weeks we've been using a woven plastic translucent grow cover that lets the light through but puts the grass back to a July or August temperature underneath that cover," Heggie said. "You can grow the grass a little faster because it doesn't realize it's November. MLSE got me everything a groundskeeper could possibly want to help grow and maintain this field. The healthier and fuller the grass is going into the Grey Cup, the better it will be for the TFC game afterward. We ideally always wanted 10 days between football and soccer games, and then we started doing it in seven. This time we're doing it in three days - the shortest changeover time we've ever had."
The Ottawa RedBlacks celebrate in designated areas so as not to damage the field after defeating the Calgary Stampeders on Nov. 27. It was the first Grey Cup game played on real grass since 2002. Read David Shoalts's full report on the 39-33 overtime nail-biter.
The Grey Cup
It was the first Grey Cup on real grass since the 2002 game at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium, which had a natural surface until 2009. Typically during a Grey Cup week, the host stadium is abuzz with team practices and working media. This Grey Cup week was different.
"For the first time in my tenure with the league, the two Grey Cup teams weren't actually allowed to practise on the field where they would play," said Curtis Emerson, the director of events and production for the CFL. "So that gave us some logistical challenges, and we had to get creative."
The Calgary Stampeders and Ottawa RedBlacks practised at Toronto's Monarch Park Stadium, a small domed facility that the CFL had to deck out with Internet connections, a media work space and a food truck for reporters. The teams didn't enter the stadium until a walk-through the day before the game.
To further protect the field, the CFL built the halftime stage just beyond the north end zone instead of rolling one onto the field for a performance by OneRepublic. Only a few small utility vehicles loaded with speakers were allowed on the field at halftime, but not before Heggie gave the drivers strict instructions about how to gently manoeuvre them on his pitch.
Ten brightly coloured sponsor logos and a decorative 104th Grey Cup insignia were painted on the field - typical at most CFL games. The end zones were free of team names, so that saved some paint. Still, removing all those logos in time for Wednesday's soccer game would be a big job.
Another challenge was BMO Field's sidelines - narrower than many others in the CFL. The league restricted both teams to just a cheer squad and one mascot, turning down requests for the Stampeders' galloping white touchdown horse and the RedBlacks' chainsaw-wielding team of lumberjacks.
Covers were laid on the grass where the teams stand during the game to help protect the area most prone to wear. Cheerleaders were the only performers on the field at halftime during the OneRepublic show, dancing in front of the stage in the north end zone (which is made of artificial turf).

When the action-packed Grey Cup ended with the RedBlacks as winners in overtime before a crowd of 33,421, a cannon launched confetti just over the Ottawa squad, mostly contained by that sideline tarp. Security personnel promptly roped off the field and diligently kept all the celebrating players and working media to the north end zone. That gave Heggie and his crew the field to themselves. Even as the RedBlacks and their supporters erupted in jubilation, Heggie's crew got to work, repairing field divots with pitchforks and taking down the south goalposts. For them, the countdown clock to soccer had begun ticking.
Heggie winced as a euphoric RedBlacks lineman lay down right on the centrefield logo to savour the victory and appeared as if he might try making an angel - driving the paint further into the turf. "Please don't do it, buddy," Heggie begged quietly, which got a chuckle from his colleagues. To the crew's relief, the player laid still. A dozen more workers would arrive shortly to help scrub off the logos and lines. It would be an all-night job.
After the Grey Cup game, with kickoff for the MLS playoff match between Toronto and Montreal less than 36 hours away, the grounds crew worked late into the night measuring and painting lines on the field. Many of the workers slept at the stadium over the next three days to get the job finished.
Getting ready for another MLS playoff game
The grounds crew would work in shifts around the clock from the conclusion of Sunday's Grey Cup game until Wednesday night's MLS Eastern Conference semi-final between Toronto FC and the Montreal Impact. Some members of the crew would rarely leave the stadium during that time, occasionally grabbing a little shut-eye in the groundskeeping shop.
After the stadium emptied out in the hours after the Grey Cup, they mowed the field, which removed some paint. An inch and a half of grass height is optimal for football, while soccer players prefer the grass at three-quarters of an inch on game day.
Heggie's crew had done extensive off-season testing on several field paints. They chose the one recommended by London's Wembley Stadium - Supaturf, from Australia, which comes off only when a special solution is applied; it was the same paint the Wembley crew used in October when they converted its field from an NFL game to a UEFA Champions League match in just three days. Overnight, the BMO Field crew mixed the solution with water and sprayed it onto the paint, leaving it for a few minutes before scrubbing it with brushes and pressure washers. Lines, logos and yard markers vanished one by one and were all gone by sunrise.
Some soccer fans took to Twitter during the Grey Cup, riled up to see chunks of turf flying off the cleats of football players. Heggie's crew had addressed most people's anxieties about sharing a pitch with the CFL by providing a healthy field. But this three-day turnaround had some worried again. The crew relished the challenge.
"Lots of people just think groundskeepers are all like Carl Spackler in , but we're scientists, we're mixing chemicals, doing math and observing the plants. We're grass experts," Heggie said. "My guys don't mind working all night to prove everyone wrong."
After the Grey Cup game, workers lay down mats in the end zone that will have stadium seats placed on top.
The field wasn't the only thing being rapidly converted. OneRepublic's stage disappeared. Black Grey Cup decor was torn down and replaced with Toronto FC red. Both football end zones were swallowed up by extra seating hauled in on forklifts and popped into place like puzzle pieces.
"It's like a huge jigsaw puzzle," said Church, walking the stadium from end to end, walkie-talkie in hand. "It will be two solid days of non-stop conversion. We do this between every soccer and football game so we know how, but it's a significant manual undertaking - and this time we have a lot less time to do it."
High-powered grow lights are placed over the field.
In the darkness, large mobile grow lights were wheeled onto the field to apply a warm yellow light across the grass. The crew knew rain had been forecast for game night, so they prepared by aerating the field to ease drainage before using rollers and brushes to press their signature striped design into the field. When they painted the soccer lines, the groundskeepers tweeted a photo of their measuring tape and took a lighthearted jab at their colleagues in Montreal, whose paint blunder had caused an embarrassing delay during the first leg of the playoff series: "Measure twice, paint once."
Heggie put on a red-and-white TFC scarf in the hours before the Nov. 30 game and shook the outstretched hand of a distinguished guest at field level: MLS commissioner Don Garber.

An MLS playoff classic
Heggie's crew was given hearty congratulations and posed for a photo with Garber, who in the past said publicly that he preferred BMO Field remain a soccer-only facility.
"I was worried when they put a CFL team in here - it's no secret. I run a soccer league," Garber would later say at halftime in a press box heaving with journalists. "But the field turnaround has been terrific. I watched the Grey Cup [on TV] down in the States and I saw a lot of painted logos on the field and was worried, but I got here early tonight to see the field, and they did well."
In pounding rain and a spine-tingling atmosphere, Montreal and Toronto battled in a playoff classic, with the Reds clinching the most celebrated win in the franchise's history. In the same stadium where TFC endured dark days for much of its first decade, there was triumphant singing and dancing, with streamers cascading from the bleachers as the home side hoisted the conference trophy.

Fans celebrate after Toronto's victory over Montreal.
They would become the first Canadian team to play in the MLS Cup, hosting the game 10 days later. Even with the stadium's capacity stretched to 36,000, the championship game would sell out in just three minutes.
"We want to host as many championships as we can, hopefully with our own teams," Eaves said. "More tickets could have been sold by putting TFC playoff games in a bigger venue, but BMO Field is TFC's home - the vibe here is what this team is all about. We might have had that debate in the past, but we never considered it this year."
Robert Heggie, head groundskeeper at BMO Field, and Scott Hunte of Greenhorizons discuss sod being laid down at Greenhorizons' greenhouse in Vineland, Ont.
Getting the field pitch-perfect for 2017
As his pitch sat fertilized and pampered beneath a cover and grow lights, resting in the week before its last game, Heggie left on a quick day trip - 100 kilometres around Lake Ontario to Vineland, Ont., to a rented greenhouse.
There, extra-thick rolls of sod were being trucked in from a sports grass farm in Burford, Ont., where Greenhorizons Sod Farms began growing it two years ago. Some 100,000 square feet of grass would rest in the greenhouse until mid-January, when it would be transported down the highway to become BMO Field's new pitch.
In 2017, TFC plans to start its home games much earlier than in the past two years, when the stadium was undergoing renovations. For Heggie, that poses a challenge: installing new sod during a Canadian winter and making it perfect for TFC by late March.
Greenhorizons will arrive at BMO Field after the NHL leaves with its outdoor rink materials (around Jan. 15), remove the current field and install new sod. To care for the new grass in winter, Heggie's crew just bought an inflatable greenhouse they'll erect over the stadium.
"We can't ask anyone how this will turn out," Heggie said, "because we don't know anyone who has done it."
The MLS Cup
Temperatures dropped steadily and snow fell in the lead-up to the MLS Cup. Seattle Sounders and TFC players got one practice at the stadium, their breath visible in the cold air. Workers roamed the stadium with backpack snowblowers, blasting piles of powder, but the small patches of snow on the field melted quickly on soil heated to 15 degrees.
"They've done an amazing job to have the field in such great condition this time of year in this climate and in this region of the world - hats off to the grounds crew," TFC goalkeeper Clint Irwin said. "Today, you could actually hear the ice melting on the field."
Star midfielder Bradley expressed "much respect" for the crew's work. Manager Greg Vanney echoed the compliment. Giovinco would be the only detractor, trying to explain his cramp-plagued season by wondering aloud if the field changeovers had affected his play.
It was -6C as the Saturday night game began. A third successive BMO Field event went to extra time, and the exhilarating night ended with Seattle winning in penalty kicks.
In the days that followed, Heggie turned off the underground heat and snow fell on the grass. Its life as a playing field was over. Its only remaining role was that of a firm, cold surface deep beneath the many layers of an outdoor hockey rink for the final spectacle in the stadium's wild five weeks.
Mike Craig, NHL senior manager of facilities, looks at the work underway at BMO Field to prepare for the Centennial Classic game on New Year's Day.
NHL's Centennial Classic
The NHL arrived on the Exhibition Grounds on Dec. 15, pulling up to the stadium with a 53-foot refrigeration unit - the world's biggest. Setting up for the league's 20th outdoor hockey game - with the Toronto Maple Leafs playing host to the Detroit Red Wings - boards, floor tiles, tools and pipes quickly covered much of the icy, dull-green grass. During the league's first few days on site, harsh winter weather meant extra hours for snow removal and to tarp the area against freezing rain.
The rink began with large plastic deck tiles topped with three layers of plywood, then ice pans chilled by coolant circulating from the refrigeration truck. The boards were set up, and ice was made with a spray boom passing over the surface some 250 times, lightly misting it with water. The grey ice was then painted white. Rain and temperatures creeping above freezing weren't major concerns - not with the big truck monitoring the ice temperature.
The NHL brought the world's biggest refrigeration truck to prepare BMO Field for the New Year's Day outdoor game.
Workers prepare the deck tiles where the rink is being built on the field.
Hoses and pipes will carry glycol solution from the mobile refrigeration truck to the field's temporary ice rinks.
"Up to game No. 20, we've dealt with every weather situation, and this is the same crew we've had right from the start, so we're confident in our experience," said Mike Craig, the NHL's senior manager of facilities operations. "Still, it can be tough to sleep the night before a game. You're excited and nervous and you want everything to go perfect, so you have to monitor the temperatures every minute."
This NHL game at BMO Field (or Exhibition Stadium, as they've dubbed it for the week, with Scotiabank as the game's title sponsor) may not be steeped in stadium history like recent outdoor games at Dodger Stadium or Soldier Field or Michigan Stadium, where 105,491 fans set a single-game NHL attendance record. For several years, MLSE aimed to land an outdoor NHL game, but only with the renovations of the past two years - new suites, clubs and overhead canopies, plus the ability to add extra seating - did BMO Field become ideal for an outdoor game.
A temporary 5,900-seat bleacher was added to the north end; combined with the 5,800 seats added to a stand on the south side before the Grey Cup, the 40,000-seat configuration will make it BMO Field's largest event yet.
Instead of turf blankets, pitchforks and sprinklers at the ready in the stadium's workshop, dozens of shovels in varying sizes now stand, along with new hockey nets, unblemished by pucks.
Heggie will be among the spectators on New Year's Day, ready for the hockey, the fans and the music that will fill BMO Field with electricity one more time - until the new sod rolls in to prepare for spring.
Head groundskeeper Robert Heggie: ‘Lots of people just think groundskeepers are all like Carl Spackler in Caddy Shack, but we're scientists, we're mixing chemicals, doing math and observing the plants. We're grass experts. My guys don't mind working all night to prove everyone wrong.'

Full text:   Thanks to La Nina, Montrealers can expect more snow and colder temperatures than last year, experts say. Andy Riga provides your guide to surviving shovelling marathons, icy roads and power failures.
FORECAST After getting off easy last winter, Montrealers should brace themselves for a return to cold, snowy weather, forecasters say.
In case you're out of practice, the Montreal Gazette has put together a shovelling, driving and powerfailure winter survival guide. But first, the forecast. The winter of 2015-16 was milder than usual thanks to the El Nino phenomenon, with less snow, more rain and warmer temperatures.
The one that looms ahead is expected to be marked by La Nina, which normally results in colder weather in Canada.
Between October 2015 and April 2016, 169 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal. If the long-term forecasts are correct and an average amount of snow falls this winter, Montrealers can expect 210 cm - 41 cm more than last year.
"We have the La Nina event going on this year - some coolerthan-normal water down in the equatorial Pacific, off the coast of South America - that's going to be a big driver for us this winter," Weather Network meteorologist Michael Carter said in an interview.
After analyzing historical trends and global weather patterns, he's predicting a return to a traditional chilly, white Montreal winter this year.
"We're returning to more classic winter weather after a very mild winter last year - temperatures that are near normal to perhaps a bit below normal, along with frequent storms and plenty of snow," Carter said.
Environment Canada is also forecasting a whiter, cooler winter for Montreal.
SHOVELLING Shovellers have more to fear than ill-timed city snow plows undoing hours of work.
The combination of physical exertion and cold weather can increase the risk of a heart attack, especially in inactive people and those with heart disease.
"Scooping heavy, wet snow raises your heart rate quickly," the Heart and Stroke Foundation warns. "Add in cold temperatures that raise blood pressure and increase the likelihood of developing blood clots, and it can be deadly."
If you load your shovel with five kilograms of snow every five seconds, you'll have moved almost 1,000 kilograms of snow after 15 minutes. That's hard on the heart and the back.
Here are some shovelling tips from the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety:
Pace yourself. Take frequent breaks and drink warm, nonalcoholic beverages.
Push snow rather than lift it.
If you must throw snow, only pick up as much snow as you can easily lift. Then, rather than twist at the waist, turn your feet toward the direction at which you're aiming.
Avoid overheating; wear thin, breathable layers.
Don't shovel on a full stomach. Digest your meals first; otherwise, shovelling could put an extra strain on your heart.
Stop shovelling if you experience sudden shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, lightheadedness, nausea, dizziness, or severe headache and immediately seek medical attention.
SHOVELS SHOULD:
Be light (about 1.5 kilograms or three pounds), and sturdy.
Feature a handle that reaches the users's chest to reduce forward bending.
Include a shaft with a bend.
Have the right blade for the job at hand. A large push-style shovel will let you move more snow but may lead you to lift heavy loads. Smaller blades are best for lifting and throwing snow.
MONTREAL SNOW STATISTICS 210 cm Average snowfall (October-April) 169 cm Snowfall (2015-16) 41 cm Additional snow expected this winter compared to last winter (if forecasters are correct) 383.3 cm Most snow in one winter. In 1970-71. That includes 43 cm that fell in one day during the March 1971 "storm of the century" that killed 17 Montrealers.
92.9 cm Least snowfall in one winter (1979-80) Green Christmas: 15 Christmases over the past 60 years have been "green," which Environment Canada defines as having less than 2 cm accumulated snow on the ground on Dec. 25. First snow: The first snowfall (2 cm on the ground) typically happened by Nov. 29 in the years between 1871 and 1910. Between 1971 and 2010, the first snow on the ground was normally recorded on Dec. 12. This year it happened on Nov. 21. Last snow: In the late 1800s, it was normally around April 8 by the time Montreal's last snow had all melted. In the years since 2000, the average snow expiry date had moved up to March 23.
Sources: Environment Canada, The Weather Network, Montreal Gazette Archives DRIVING Before you drive in wintry weather, consider these tips from CAA-Quebec and Transport Canada:
Remove all snow from your vehicle's hood, roof, windows and lights. Clear windows of frost and fog.
Get a tune-up, including an
Slow down on snow and ice. Your tires will have more time to grip the road. Give yourself extra travel time in bad weather.
Avoid using cruise control on slippery roads.
Always turn the steering wheel slowly to retain control.
Front-wheel skids are often you find yourself in a front-wheel skid, gently ease up on the accelerator or brake pedal and steer in the direction of the turn while looking in the direction you want to go.
For rear-wheel skids, turn the front wheels in the direction in which the back end has started swinging, while looking in the direction you want to go.
Be alert for deceptive conditions. Invisible black ice can form when the temperature hovers around zero, especially on bridges, overpasses and underpasses. In rural areas, road conditions can change quickly from dry to snowy or icecovered.
Leave more space than normal time to respond if an emergency arises.
Prepare an emergency kit for your trunk. It should include a shovel, a snow brush, a scraper, traction aids, booster cables, windshield-washer fluid, a reflective vest, a battery-free flashlight, basic tools, a first-aid kit, a warm blanket and some non-perishable snacks.
HOME EMERGENCY KIT Authorities suggest you prepare a home kit with basic supplies that can help you take care of yourself and your family for 72 hours in case of an emergency such as an extended power failure.
Heavy snow and freezing rain can take down power lines, though Hydro-Quebec says power outages are more common in the summer.
WHAT SHOULD YOUR EMERGENCY KIT INCLUDE? Here are some basic supplies suggested by Public Safety Canada, Hydro-Quebec and Quebec's public-security department.
Water (at least two litres of water per person per day).
Food that won't spoil, such as canned and dried food, energy bars.
Manual can opener.
Crank or battery-powered flashlight
Warm blankets.
Battery-powered radio (and extra batteries) to monitor the situation.
First aid kit (bandages, gauze sterile pads, scissors, tweezers, safety pins, antiseptic, pain medication).
Other items such as prescription medication, infant formula and equipment for people with disabilities. ariga@postmedia.com

Full text: With the cost of operating your own vehicle almost $9,000 a year, car-sharing services and transit can offer a cheaper ride
At one point in time, Amy Robinson owned both a motorbike and a car. But she sold the bike when she got pregnant with her son, and got rid of the car just a year after inheriting it from her father.
Now Ms. Robinson makes her way around Vancouver, and occasionally up to the mountains for skiing, using a car-sharing service, which allows those who can neither afford, nor want to pay, the running costs of a vehicle to enjoy the benefits of a vehicle. She complements that by taking public transit where possible, and rides her bicycle when weather permits.
For the most part, Ms. Robinson, the founder and co-executive director of Loco BC, a non-profit local business alliance that tries to build sustainable businesses by encouraging a shift in local purchasing, doesn't miss it at all.
"There's the odd time when it's freezing rain or freezing cold and the bus is late or something happens and it feels like a drag and my son is complaining, 'Why don't we have a car?'" she says. "But for the most part, we're environmentalists in our work and our lives so we're very committed to making it work without a car."
That commitment is paying off with the bottom line. The driving costs calculator on the Canadian Automobile Association website estimates that the cost of operating a compact vehicle, such as a Honda Civic, in British Columbia for a year is $8,828, factoring in fuel, insurance, licensing, maintenance and depreciation.
In comparison, Modo, a car-sharing service founded in 1997 that caters to 15,000 users in B.C.'s Lower Mainland and Victoria, charges $8 an hour, or $64 for the entire day. Ms. Robinson uses Modo for her two-way car sharing - meaning the car needs to be returned to the same location it was picked up from - and uses Car2Go and Evo Car Sharing for one-way trips, where she might take the bus out and car-share her way home.
Factoring that in, Ms. Robinson's transportation expenditure compares very favourably.
"In a high month we might pay $500-600; in a low month we might pay less than $100," she says. "So the average we pay between Car2Go, Evo and Modo in a month is about $300, so we pay like half basically of what it would cost to own a car in a year."
While it was a slight inconvenience to carry around a car seat to install in a car-sharing vehicle when her son was young, now that he's 11, Ms. Robinson is starting to see other benefits to the service. For instance, to pick up renovation materials, Modo offers cube vans for rent, or a truck if a couch or two needs to be moved.
However, while she is embracing the use of alternative transportation methods, don't expect Ms. Robinson to be signing up to use Uber, if the disruptive transportation company ever comes to Vancouver.
"Things like Uber and even some of the one-way car shares, I feel like they're super convenient but [the people that use them] could probably just take the bus and so they're increasing transportation impact in terms of emissions and all of that," she says.
In Montreal, Vincent Dussault shares a similar story to Ms. Robinson, using a combination of Bixi bikes in the summer, public transit and car-sharing services such as Communauto and Car2Go to make his way around town and further afield with his wife and two sons.
While Mr. Dussault still technically owns a car, he has lent it to his sister for the past four years. Though he finds it easy enough to use the car-sharing services on offer, he says it's not always the easiest in Montreal.
"So far I've found it difficult in the winter to live without a car," he says. "My son is playing hockey, too, so maybe without hockey I would survive [more easily]."
Part of the reasoning for that is sometimes the car locations of available vehicles aren't always just around the corner, so he often takes a Bixi bike to go and pick up the vehicle.
Communauto, which was founded in Quebec in 1994 and operates in a number of cities, offers two different models in Montreal - a two-way sharing option and a one-way version called Auto-mobile, with which the car can be left anywhere within a certain area.
"I really like the fact that with Auto-mobile you can just leave the car in front of your house," Mr. Dussault says. "In Montreal where I live sometimes in summer there is a lot of congestion and just to bring back the car to the parking sometimes you are tired and happy to be home."
When it comes to savings, Mr. Dussault recorded his entire expenditure for September and October last year.
While the CAA website has the cost of owning a compact car in Quebec at $8,843, Mr. Dussault has found substantial savings by using communal transportation options.
Across the two months, he took 160 trips on Bixi, used 10 subway tokens, made 72 journeys with Communauto and another four with Car2Go. He also took one ride with Uber.
In terms of cost, September cost him $548, although that was partly because of a $160 rental of a BMW to drive to Shawinigan, while October cost him $274.
And as a fan of electrical cars such as the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, both of which are offered by Communauto, Mr. Dussault gets the opportunity to try out a number of different vehicles while cutting back on costs and emissions.
"Given the number of trips and the quality [of] cars, $274 per month to be able to move around as you like in Montreal, it's very little," he says.

Full text:   Don't despair: the dumping of snow predicted for the Montreal region won't be around for very long.
Environment Canada meteorologist Andre Cantin said he's confident the Montreal area will get at least 10 centimetres of snow on Thursday, starting in the early morning and ending early afternoon. He's more confident than he was for the last major snowfall predicted back on March 2, which didn't turn out to be the blizzard that was expected.
By Thursday morning rush hour, about four centimetres are likely to fall, making for a potentially slippery commute. The snow will turn to freezing rain and then straight rain starting about 3 or 4 p.m., Cantin said.
The rain will continue all day Friday. Thursday's high is forecast at -2 C, and Friday's high is expected to reach 7C. The warming trend will continue through the weekend, with temperatures predicted to reach near 10 C on Sunday and 7 C on Monday.
"By the end of the long Easter weekend, most of the snow will melt," Cantin said.
The storm is good news for skiers, and may extend the season for some hills in the region. The lower Laurentians will see 15 centimetres fall, while areas further north will get more. Mont-Tremblant could get up to 30 centimetres, Cantin said.
The mild temperatures forecast could also be a boon for the city of Montreal's finances, because the city may not have to send out snow removal equipment for this storm.
City officials will see how much snow has fallen and then take a look at the predicted temperatures to decide whether to cart away the snow from this storm, said Philippe Sabourin, a spokesperson for the city. Under the new city-wide snow clearing policy, the central city decides whether all the boroughs will start a snow removal operation. Such an operation costs about $17 million, according to the city's website.
"As soon as 2.5 centimetres have fallen, the plows head out, but it's too early to say now whether a snow removal operation will take place," Sabourin said.
He explained the city may just push the snow to the sides of the streets and let Mother Nature melt it away. "It will depend on how much snow falls, and how much of that actually stays on the roads," Sabourin said.

Lawsuits over falls cost city; Over five years, 77 injury claim settlements average $16,634 each

Abstract: "The city, just like any owner, has the obligation to maintain its property for it to be safe for citizens, the pedestrians walking on it," said Olivera Pajani, a partner in the Kugler Kandestin law firm, which represented Forstinger.

Full text:   On an overcast January afternoon in 2012, LaSalle resident Gertrude Woschitz Forstinger donned her winter boots, grabbed the leash and took her dog out for a walk. It had snowed, and there was a centimetre or two covering the sidewalks of LaSalle Blvd., a busy thoroughfare.
She stopped to chat with another local resident, then walked a dozen more steps and hit a patch of sheer ice stretching the width of the sidewalk, hidden beneath the sheet of snow. She went down hard, fracturing her right wrist.
There were no signs that any abrasives or salt had been spread. Photos taken by her husband at the scene the next day, as well as the testimony of the man she had been chatting with, backed up her claim.
A nurse, Forstinger was unable to work for a year.
She filed a lawsuit against the city, saying it was negligent in its obligation to keep the sidewalks safe, and therefore to blame for her broken wrist and the ensuing pain, suffering and loss of wages.
Three years later, Judge Suzanne Courchesne agreed. Forstinger was awarded $132,236.
While the payout in Forstinger's case was relatively high, figures provided by the city of Montreal to the Montreal Gazette reveal that lawsuits like hers are not uncommon. Nearly half the time, plaintiffs who take the city to court over a fall win a settlement.
Over a five-year period between 2011 and 2015, the city concluded lawsuits related to falls on city property with 160 individuals.
Of those cases, the city paid settlements 77 times, with the average payout being $16,634.
Most of the payments were settled out of court, with the city and plaintiffagreeing to a settlement in 62 cases. In cases that did continue in court, the city was most often victorious, winning 58 judgments and losing only 15. In the remaining 25 cases, the plaintiffs withdrew their lawsuits.
In total over the five years, the city had to pay $1,264,751, an average of $252,950 a year for falls. In 43 per cent of the cases, the sums are not princely, with payouts of less than $5,000. Snow or ice is listed as a factor in the fall roughly half the time.
The key to winning a case against the city is proving that it was negligent in its responsibilities, within reason.
"The city, just like any owner, has the obligation to maintain its property for it to be safe for citizens, the pedestrians walking on it," said Olivera Pajani, a partner in the Kugler Kandestin law firm, which represented Forstinger. While it's obvious that during a storm, the city is unable to clear all its streets and sidewalks immediately, once the storm is over, it is held to the same standards as any prudent homeowner, who is expected to clear the snow offtheir pathway or put down salt or abrasives.
"People say: 'Well it's Quebec, what are you expecting?'" Pajani said. "It may be Quebec, but if there was freezing rain and you haven't done anything in 24 hours and it becomes an ice rink, well, that's negligence."
In Forstinger's case, the borough of LaSalle had spread abrasives 48 hours before her accident, after days of rain and freezing rain, followed by a sudden drop in temperatures. The judge noted that the borough's policy suggested that abrasives should be spread again in the case of very cold or windy conditions, but it failed to do so.
"There is strong evidence that there was the presence of ice and the absence of abrasives, and the court concludes ... that the work carried out by the city employees, in terms of maintenance as well as inspecting the walkways, were proven to be inadequate, insufficient and in the wrong," Courchesne wrote in her ruling.
Forstinger's payout was large because the city had to cover her lost wages, and because she wasn't found to have contributed to the negligence causing the fall by, for instance, wearing inappropriate footwear, rushing, or being pulled by her dog. As part of the settlement, the court also awarded Forstinger $60,000 for non-monetary losses, referred to as "nonpecuniary damages" for things like pain, suffering, the surgery she had to endure, and moral damages.
Following snowfalls last month, sidewalks in several Montreal boroughs remained icy for days. Officials said technical difficulties, and a desire to save costs associated with sending workers or contractors out to spread abrasives again, played a role.
Pajani said her firm receives calls regularly from individuals who have fallen and want a free consultation to decide whether their case is worth taking to court. In most cases that the firm decides to accept, the plaintiffs are successful, she said. Pictures of the accident scene taken soon after the incident are often the most important evidence plaintiffs can gather. The cost of opening a file at the courthouse and filing a lawsuit may vary between $200 and $800, depending on the amount that is being claimed, Pajani said. The court costs for things like stenographers, bailiffs and photocopies could be in the range of $5,000. If the plaintiff wins, those costs are most often covered by the city. If the plaintiff loses, the court will most often condemn him or her to pay the city's legal fees, but that does not include the lawyers' fees.

Full text:   After freezing rain blanketed the city's streets and sidewalks with a sheet of ice Monday morning, Montrealers should brace for more extreme weather, with up to 30 centimetres of snow expected Tuesday evening and into Wednesday.
Montreal received between two and 10 millimetres of freezing rain on Monday, according to Environment Canada.
The result was icy sidewalks and streets throughout the city, with a number of people reporting falls or tumbles on social media.
Rhiannon Collett, a 20-year-old playwright, slipped and fell on the sidewalk in front of her Visitation St. apartment in the Village as soon as she stepped offher porch.
"Directly in front of my neighbour who was trying to wrangle both of her children (down the sidewalk)," Collett said Monday morning.
She ended up walking down the middle of the street instead to get to the metro and head to work - it was less slippery than the sidewalk, she said.
"It is a nightmare," Collett said. "Basically I'm just waiting for the frozen hell-sphere to melt!" Urgences-Sante said it was receiving an usually high number of calls because of the weather, and recommended people make sure they have a sturdy pair of boots on, or even use a cane with an ice pick attached to the end if they plan on walking a lot.
Spokesperson Benoit Garneau said that as of 10:30 a.m., Urgences-Sante had received roughly 450 calls in the Montreal area, about 100 more than on a normal winter day.
A hundred ambulances had been dispatched to cover the area, and it was asking people to please call hospitals first if they didn't consider their injuries to be an emergency, to avoid overfilling hospital waiting rooms.
Calls started coming in around 6:45 a.m., Garneau said.
"As soon as people started going outside," he said, adding that people are falling on sidewalks, in stairways, garage entrances or commercial parking lots.
Most injuries are bruises or sprains, he said, but some are worse: broken wrists, forearms or elbows as people try to protect themselves before hitting the ice.
The 911 calls, however, began to stabilize around 1 p.m. as conditions on the sidewalks and roads improved.
City officials say there are multiple reasons why removing ice remains a perennial issue. They include the amount of time it takes to clear thousands of kilometres of sidewalks, inadequate equipment and a cocktail of rapidly evolving climatic conditions that can make it hard to keep up.
And if Monday's weather wasn't enough winter misery, Environment Canada is warning of a "major storm" developing over the Central United States that will move into Quebec.
The snow is expected to begin falling on Tuesday evening, "with snowfall amounts possibly exceeding 30 centimetres," Environment Canada warns on its website.

Montrealers celebrate Leap Year by tiptoeing on icy sidewalks
It may be called Leap Year Day, but Feb. 29 had Montrealers tiptoeing carefully on ice-covered sidewalks and roads.
Ever wonder how the city tackles the problem of slippery sidewalks? City of Montreal spokesperson Jacques-Alain Lavallee explained that city crews do not use the same "recipe" of abrasives for sidewalks and roadways. For roads: "For pavement, we mainly use pure salt. If the temperature is cold (between -10 C and -15 C), crushed stone is added to the salt because it is less (effective). The mixture is 50/50 per cent salt/stone. If the temperature drops below -15 C, we use a mixture of 10/90 per cent salt/stone."
For sidewalks? "We almost always use the mixture 10/90 per cent salt/stone."
Why isn't pure salt used on sidewalks?
"Pure salt is mainly used on roadways because (vehicle) traffic has the effect of releasing the heat required for the chemical reaction.
"The material placed on sidewalks serves a dual purpose: to cause the salt to melt and the abrasive (crushed stone) to enable traction."
Why do roads seem better deiced than sidewalks?
"For one, the vehicles run much faster than pedestrians. This intensive vehicle traffic gives off the heat required to cause the chemical reaction of salt to melt the ice. Tire friction caused by traffic is another important factor in the process of melting ice."

Slip-sliding away on Montreal's icy sidewalks; Falls common as city slow to clear walkways following freezing weather

Abstract: Leaving the L'Atelier d'Argentine steak house on Crescent St. on Thursday, Feb. 18, the night before the Flyers would fall to the Habs, Panaccio hit a patch of ice as he strolled toward Ste-Catherine St. His ankle rolled over and he broke two bones and tore several ligaments. Westmount resident Emile Fattal, who has made improving the state of the city's sidewalks a personal mission for the last four years, says the heart of the problem is actually much more simple: cities and boroughs are skimping on spreading salt on the sidewalks to save money, forcing pedestrians to walk in the salted streets.

Full text:   As a veteran journalist who covers the Philadelphia Flyers' home and away games, Tim Panaccio is no stranger to Montreal, or the treachery of its sidewalks. He even bought a pair of winter boots at an Aldo store during a recent stopover to manoeuvre the downtown streets.
Unfortunately, his boots were no match for the conditions on his last visit. Leaving the L'Atelier d'Argentine steak house on Crescent St. on Thursday, Feb. 18, the night before the Flyers would fall to the Habs, Panaccio hit a patch of ice as he strolled toward Ste-Catherine St. His ankle rolled over and he broke two bones and tore several ligaments. He took a cab to the Glen site of the McGill University Centre Hospital, an experience he characterized as "enlightening."
"That was an ordeal," he said.
"The doctor didn't have enough help. Boy, you don't have enough people there."
They put him in a cast and told him he would require surgery. He did not cover the hockey game.
A week after the incident, Panaccio's ankle is still so swollen he will have to wait another week before surgeons can operate. He could be out for up to eight weeks. Workers' compensation regulations don't allow him to work while he's recuperating.
"This is a very significant setback for me," said Panaccio, a fit 63-year-old who worked out every day, until his accident. He has lost five pounds since the fall. "I could miss the entire playoffs."
Panaccio's misfortune is far from unique, particularly in this winter of frequent rain followed by freezing temperatures, in a city where sidewalks often remain covered in ice for days.
"'It's an orthopedic bonanza," Montreal family physician Ashok Oommen said on CJAD news talk radio station Thursday after the latest bout of freezing rain. For older residents, the effects of breaking a limb or hip can be catastrophic.
A study by Montreal's public heath agency and the Universite de Montreal looking at the number of outdoor winter falls in Montreal and Laval in the winter of 2008-2009 showed 960 people were transported by ambulance to hospital in the space of two months, an average of 16 a day. Nearly three quarters reported slipping on ice or snow. Those figures don't include the injured, like Panaccio, who didn't use an ambulance to go to hospital.
There are multiple reasons why removing ice remains a perennial issue, city officials say. They include the amount of time it takes to clear thousands of kilometres of sidewalks, inadequate equipment, and a cocktail of rapidly evolving climatic conditions that can make it hard to keep up.
Westmount resident Emile Fattal, who has made improving the state of the city's sidewalks a personal mission for the last four years, says the heart of the problem is actually much more simple: cities and boroughs are skimping on spreading salt on the sidewalks to save money, forcing pedestrians to walk in the salted streets. He has contacted officials at cities and boroughs like Westmount, Ville-Marie and Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace to ask why they can keep streets and bike paths clear but not sidewalks. He has been told abrasives like gravel are more effective on ice-covered sidewalks.
"Abrasives are not a substitute for salt." He said. "Salt the bloody sidewalks. Apply the same criteria as you do on the streets."
Cities prioritize streets because they need to ensure two-tonne vehicles don't slide out of control and kill people, said Cote-des-Neiges -Notre-Dame-de-Grace Mayor Russell Copeman. But he concedes sidewalks remain an issue.
"As a mayor, it's not as though I'm happy we're having trouble clearing our sidewalks," he said. "But there are real technical constraints to doing so."
Foremost is the amount of time it takes to clear the 400 kilometres of sidewalks in his borough - roughly six to eight hours, by which time the first sidewalks to be cleared may be covered again in snow or slush that changes to ice. Many sidewalk-clearing machines have blades that are too wide for narrow sidewalks. Smaller tractors with shorter blades lack the power to clear ice. Salt becomes less effective below minus 6 C, and boroughs prefer to use less of it for ecological reasons, Copeman said, and because it often gets washed away by the rain.
Boroughs can go back to icy sidewalks when conditions improve, but Copeman admits that limited budgets play a part in that decision.
"It's not impossible, but we do it with a certain amount of parsimony," Copeman said. "If it were an easy problem to fix, people much smarter than I would have found the solution."
Citizens can and have sued Quebec cities for falls on icy sidewalks, but they have to prove the city has been negligent. While some have won, like the 69-year-old Montreal North grandmother who won $25,000 after a sidewalk fall in 2007, most do not, Protegez-Vous magazine reported. The city of Montreal was not able to provide details on lawsuits by Friday.
MUHC emergency room physician Dr. Frederic Dankoffnotes international studies have shown rain followed by freezing temperatures are the most hazardous weather conditions when it comes to falls, contributing to twice as many injuries as snowfalls. Injuries typically peak in the first days of an ice storm and then jump again four to eight days later as people get back to their regular lives. Ankles are the main victims, followed by wrists, backs and skulls.
"We try and tell people unless its really necessary, avoid going out," Dankoffsaid. "And if you have elderly family members, see if they need groceries or medicine and go get it for them."
Panaccio's mishap has not changed his opinion of the city.
"I still love Montreal," he said.
Upon hearing the number of injuries related to falls each year, he said: "If that's the case, you've got a real problem."
As for Panaccio, he told his wife he was going to have to buy a new set of boots.

Full text:   The only thing crazier than the Canadiens' season might be Montreal's wacky winter weather. In the past 24 hours, Montrealers have seen a bit of everything. Rain, snow, sleet, ice pellets, fog, high winds and freezing rain all took their toll on the province's blinkering power grid.
After a storm blew through southern Quebec on Wednesday night, some 255,000 Hydro-Quebec customers were without power when they awoke Thursday morning.
Hydro crews scrambled into duty and as of 6 p.m. Thursday, that number had been reduced to 91,000 across Quebec, including 670 customers in Montreal. Most of those were in Pierrefonds.
Another 2,200 customers in Laval were also without power. The off-island communities of St-Lazare and Hudson were also hit particularly hard by the storm. More than 2,960 customers in St-Lazare and 1,200 in Hudson were without power at 6 p.m. Due to the power outage, the Town of Hudson activated its emergency measures Thursday evening, inviting citizens to seek warmth and shelter at the Stephen Shaar Community Centre at 394 Main Rd.
Cots were to be set up for the night, and coffee and snacks served to residents, said Mayor Ed Prevost.
"It will be a cold night in Hudson," Prevost added, "but everybody here is on top of the situation."
Prevost said Hydro has assured him power would be restored to local residents as of 12:30 p.m. Friday. While nearly all customers in Montreal could have their power restored by late Thursday night, those in more remote areas outside Montreal could be waiting till Saturday, according to Hydro-Quebec.
While high winds and freezing rain brought down tree branches across the city, the worst hit areas of Quebec were the Laurentians and Lanaudiere regions north of Montreal, said Hydro-Quebec spokesperson Mathieu Rouy.
More than 66,000 customers were still without power in those two regions as of 6 p.m. "Because of the freezing rain, this is where we saw the most power lines taken down by tree branches," Rouy said.
Meanwhile, thousands of students in the West Island and other parts of Montreal got the day off Thursday as darkened schools across the island were closed.
In the east end, about 100 residents in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve sector were deprived of water when a main burst on Simon-Derome St., near Langelier Blvd.
Mild temperatures also made for slushy conditions on city roads and sidewalks, but that is expected to change by Friday when temperatures dip below zero.
The forecast calls for a high of -10C on Friday, which could turn slushy streets and sidewalks into dangerously slippery patches of ice.
City of Montreal officials are preparing to spread abrasives as needed, said spokesperson Jacques-Alain Lavallee.
He said sidewalk-clearing operations begin once the accumulation of snow on the ground reaches 2.5 cm. The city will spread different abrasives, depending on conditions and types of surfaces. "For example, on roads we use pure salt, while the mix for sidewalks only contains 10 per cent salt and 90 per cent abrasives - usually crushed stone," Lavallee said.
"For pavement, we mainly use pure salt. If the temperature is cold (between -10 C and -15 C) crushed stone is added to the salt because (salt alone) is less (effective). The mixture is 50/50 per cent saltstone. If the temperature drops below -15 C, we use a mixture of 10/90 per cent salt-stone."
Saturday's forecast calls for a high of 2 C, and a 60 per cent chance of flurries and a 70 per cent chance of showers.
So you might need your umbrella again ... in February.

Full text:   Montrealers are in for a Groundhog Day hangover. Wednesday's weather forecast calls for a mixed bag of precipitation - snow, ice pellets, freezing rain, rain - that will test the patience and prudence of rush-hour motorists.
Environment Canada issued a weather alert Tuesday to prepare the public for a messy drive on Wednesday morning. About 5-10 centimetres of snow is expected, followed by 2-4 millimetres of freezing rain.
"It could make for pretty poor driving conditions in the morning, especially for rush hour in the Montreal area," said Marie-Eve Giguere, a meteorologist for Environment Canada.
"It's not a huge storm," she added. "Again, it's not the quantity of snow, but it's just that the heaviest bit will be at rush hour.
"The snow will start overnight, so when we wake up (Wednesday), even if you wake up early, there should be a few centimetres on the ground," Giguere said. "The heaviest snow should fall at rush hour, between 6-9 a.m., and it could be mixed with ice pellets."
As temperatures rise by midmorning, the precipitation could turn to freezing rain. Rain is expected to begin around midday. The good news is that the worst of the storm is expected to pass by late afternoon.
After a relatively mild January in Montreal, temperatures are expected to dip for the next couple of weeks, Giguere noted. But longterm forecasts are still calling for milder than normal temperatures in February and March. That has more to do with the El Nino weather system than El Groundhog.

Snowstorms bookend 2015; Despite Tuesday's wintry blast, December is hottest on record

Abstract: The city also saw its coldest February on record, which brought with it a record number of freezing pipes in Montreal homes - with more than 2,000 homes affected, and waiting times of up to a week for some households to get their water back.

Full text:   The year ended much as it began - with a thick blanket of snow covering the city.
Montrealers were digging out on Tuesday putting an end to the bizarre springlike weather that marked most of December.
The snowstorm served as a reality check only four days after temperatures near 20 C brought golfers to the links and kite boarders and windsurfers to the water. By Tuesday evening, Environment Canada's winter storm warning was still in effect. It maintained a forecast of up to 40 cm of snow accumulation by the end of the day. The city had already received 25 cm of snow as of 2 p.m. About 100 flights - split equally between departures and arrivals - were cancelled at Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport Tuesday morning, but by late afternoon most flights resumed according to normal schedule, said an official with the Aeroports de Montreal.
Despite the poor visibility, Montreal hospitals did not report an abnormal increase in the number of people showing up at emergency rooms with injuries caused by falls.
Nez Rouge suspended its drivehome service for Tuesday night in the Montreal and Quebec City regions and in most of southern Quebec because of the bad weather. Snow-clearing operations in the city of Montreal's 19 boroughs will begin at 7 a.m. on Wednesday and run until 7 p.m. on Thursday. At that point, crews will take a break for New Year's, and resume snow clearing on Jan. 2 and continue until all streets are cleared. This is the first test of Montreal's new snow-clearing policy, which harmonizes operations across the boroughs. That means all boroughs are required to start snow-clearing operations at the same time.
Despite the blast of wintry weather, December will be the hottest on record, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Eve Giguere.
"Christmas Eve, it was 20 degrees warmer than the average," Giguere said. Daily highs were above zero Celsius for the whole month until this past Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday is also forecast to be below zero before temperatures climb above freezing on Thursday.
The warm temperatures this December were a nice change after a bone-chilling winter of 2015.
January 2015 arrived with a light dusting on New Year's Day, and 20 centimetres of snow two days later.
A thaw and then a deep freeze seemed to catch the city offguard, because many boroughs didn't send workers out in time to spread salt, resulting in slippery sidewalks, and the mayor opening up an inquiry into the slow response.
It was the winter of expensive heating bills, as the mercury dipped below zero on Jan. 20 and stayed there until March 4 - one of the longest streaks of below-zero temperatures in Montreal on record. The city also saw its coldest February on record, which brought with it a record number of freezing pipes in Montreal homes - with more than 2,000 homes affected, and waiting times of up to a week for some households to get their water back.
As if the cold and snow weren't enough, those taking public transit were left out in the cold waiting for longer than usual.
A strike of Canadian Pacific workers halted service for two straight days on the Vaudreuil-Hudson, Candiac and St-Jerome commuter train lines. Overall reliability of trains and buses also took a dive in the harsh winter weather, with mechanical breakdowns galore. As for snow, we got plenty of that too, with snow falling on 16 days in January, 12 days in February, and nine days in March.
March remained colder than average on most days, with the St. Patrick's Day Parade being held downtown on the coldest day of the month, with a wind chill of nearly -20 C. Montrealers got a reprieve in April and May, with temperatures in the 20s and approaching the 30s. What they spent on heating in the winter, they saved on air conditioning in the summer, because only a few days were hotter than 30 C in July and August, and there was also plenty of rain during those months.
Temperatures remained warmer than average for most of September, October and November before the record-setting December that's wrapping up.
With the snow finally here, there is no major thaw predicted in the next few days - good news for ski hills and anyone who makes a living on outdoor winter activities. Giguere, however, predicts a warmer than usual winter, and that could mean more freezing rain and rain than snow.
"But that doesn't exclude any major cold snaps," she cautioned. jmagder@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/JasonMagder

It's beginning to look a lot like a green Christmas

Full text:   I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones Bing Crosby used to sing about - long before anyone talked about global warming and when the only carbon footprints were snow angels in the schoolyard.
But this December, you are more likely to see someone skateboarding than snowboarding in Montreal, which bears no resemblance to a winter wonderland anywhere outside the surreal holiday window display at the downtown Ogilvy store. Even the slopes of Mount Royal, a seasonal palette normally caked in snowflakes by now, remain as brown as chocolate bark.
With only four sleeps to go, Montrealers are once again facing the prospect of a green Noel on Dec. 25.
The forecasted high for Christmas Day is a mild 3C, according to Environment Canada, which is also predicting a relatively balmy 14C for Christmas Eve. Too bad the tennis courts are closed.
The warmest temperature recorded for Montreal on Dec. 25 was 12.8 C in 1964.
Green Christmases are not unheard of. In fact, there have been 14 since 1955, according to Environment Canada.
But half that total has come in the last two decades, the most recent in 2014. The others were 1994, '96, '98, '99, 2002 and '06.
Prior to that, green Christmases were less frequent, happening no more than twice per decade from the 1950s through the 1980s.
It was back-to-back green in 1956-57, then again in 1964 and '67. It happened twice in the 1970s ('71, '79) and only once the following decade in 1988.
Andre Cantin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the chances of a green Christmas in Montreal from the mid-1950s till the mid-1980s were about 20 per cent, or twice per decade.
In the last two decades, however, the figure jumped to 35 per cent.
"With the mean temperature rising above zero, whatever snow that does fall soon melts, increasing the probability of a green Christmas," Cantin explained.
The long range seasonal forecast calls for a relatively mild winter in Montreal.
Temperatures are not expected to dip below freezing on a builda-backyard-rink kind of basis till some time in 2016.
"We're forecasting temperatures warmer than normal, which is consistent with the fact we have a strong El Nino present in the Pacific Ocean," added Marie-Eve Giguere of Environment Canada.
"That being said, an El Nino doesn't always mean a green Christmas. The strongest El Nino ever recorded was in 1997-98 and there was not a green Christmas that year. But there was one the year before and the year after," Giguere said.
El Nino aside, planet Earth is also running a fever these days.
The United Nations weather, water and climate body is predicting 2015 will be the warmest ever recorded, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recently
noted that the years 2011-2015 was the warmest five-year period on record.
The world's 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1998, with eight of them being since 2005, the WMO said.
"This is all bad news for the planet," WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said last month.
It's also bad news for ski hill operators in Quebec, who are feeling the pinch of mild weather.
Mont-Tremblant had 15 of 96 ski runs open last week and many others in the Laurentians and Eastern Townships were closed while waiting for snow-making machines to do what Mother Nature won't: cover the trails.
The Owl's Head ski centre in Mansonville planned to celebrate its 50th year of operation this winter, but owner Fred Korman said Thursday that it has been too mild to even make snow.
"It's tough, really tough," Korman said. "I've seen Christmas with no snow before, but we had weather cold enough to make snow."
Owl's Head has yet to open and Korman predicted a tough year ahead for most ski centres in Quebec.
"I don't think it's any secret at all.
It's going to be tough, that's for sure ... and we can't do a thing about it."
Of course, climate change might have a certain appeal for those still thawing out from the Big Chill of last winter when Montrealers suffered through a record cold snap in February, risking frostbite simply by getting out of bed in the morning.
But this holiday season, which has seen more rain than snow hit the ground, downtown retailers were more likely to sell an umbrella than a Canada Goose jacket. At the Simon's store on Ste-Catherine St. W., a sales clerk said winter jackets were still selling, just not as briskly as in past winters.
While Montrealers will be happy to see lower heating bills this winter, the Accuweather winter forecast also warns that an El Nino year means more freezing rain could be on its way.
"Unfortunately, the winter pattern will also favour an increased risk of ice storms, especially from eastern Ontario to southern Quebec, including the cities of Ottawa and Montreal as temperature inversions will be more common," Accuweather posted on its website.
Montrealers will recall the last time El Nino passed through town, he turned offthe lights throughout much of Quebec.
Few here will ever forget the Ice Storm of 1998, when nearly a week of freezing rain left the province's electrical grid in blinkered tatters and millions huddling by candlelight.
While no one is predicting a repeat of that catastrophic event, for now Montrealers' best line of defence against the elements was having their winter tires installed by the legally required Dec. 15 deadline.
For now, however, a snow brush is optional.

Montreal to harmonize snow-clearing policy

Author: Mio, Kevin

Abstract: Boroughs that will incur additional costs because of the new snow-clearing standards will see their budget allotment adjusted from the central city, the mayor said, adding all boroughs will also be obliged to use the city's INFONeige MTL application so residents can be better informed when snowstorms hit.

Full text:   After months of consultations, the City of Montreal unveiled its new snow-clearing policy on Friday, one Mayor Denis Coderre believes will have an immediate effect on citizens this winter.
For the first time since Montreal was merged with surrounding suburbs in 2002, a single policy will dictate how the city reacts to snowstorms.
"You won't have 19 different policies, you will have one. That harmonization will change the culture of the way we are working. I think it will have immediate impacts on our quality of life," Coderre said at city hall.
The process began in January after a report by the comptroller general cited a lack of equipment and manpower in Montreal to handle winter conditions.
The goal of the new policy, Coderre said, is to guarantee the same minimum level of snow clearance for residents in the 19 boroughs.
The biggest change is the central city will now determine when a snow-removal operation is to begin.
Once that decision has been made, which can occur even after a storm of only 10 centimetres, all boroughs will have 12 hours to begin removing snow.
To expedite work during storms - spreading abrasives, plowing and removing snow - the city has categorized its 35,000 streets and divided them into three priority groups.
Major arteries, as well as bus routes, school zones and commercial areas are in the first category, making up 25 per cent of streets. Another 15 per cent are in the second group, which includes streets with four-season bike paths and commercial sections. The remaining 60 per cent are the city's residential streets.
Once a snow-clearing operation begins, boroughs will have 36 hours to clear all streets in the first category, with a maximum of four days for a storm of up to 20 cm.
Boroughs that fail to meet the time frame to begin snow removal will see a reduction of two per cent in their snow-removal allotment from the city, which translates to between $500,000 and $1 million depending on the borough. The city's total budget for snow removal is $155 million.
"That will make it impossible to try and save money on the backs of citizens," Coderre said. "There is no question regarding budget, the money is there."
One of the biggest complaints last winter was the city's handling of snow-covered and icy sidewalks, something the policy addresses.
After more than five centimetres of precipitation accumulate, salt and abrasives are to be spread on sidewalks in the first two groups within four hours and within a maximum of eight hours in the third group.
In the event that freezing rain is in the forecast, abrasives are to be spread on sidewalks and streets with a five per cent grade before the storm hits and the application will resume once the freezing rain starts.
Boroughs that will incur additional costs because of the new snow-clearing standards will see their budget allotment adjusted from the central city, the mayor said, adding all boroughs will also be obliged to use the city's INFONeige MTL application so residents can be better informed when snowstorms hit.
"The big winners in all this are the citizens," said Anie Samson, mayor of the Villeray-St-Michel- Parc-Extension borough and vicepresident of the Executive Committee.
"It will save time because we will have standards for everyone in Montreal," she said, adding now they know it will take a maximum of four days to clear a storm of 20 centimetres.
Before, clearing that storm could take longer because various boroughs would start clearing operations at different times.

Full text:   Climate change is making our winters more unpredictable and, consequently, harder to manage. Within a few days in early January, Montrealers saw 20 centimetres of snow, 20 millimetres of freezing rain, and intense freezing temperatures.The city of Montreal struggled to remove snow, salt the ice, and make the roads and sidewalks safe.
"This is an exceptional situation, and one of the worst that a city could go through in terms of snow removal," Philippe Sabourin, a spokesperson for the city of Montreal, said at the time. "On an operational level, these changing temperatures make things much more complex."
For Dr. Damon Matthews, climate change specialist and Concordia University professor in the department of geography, planning and environment, this is the new reality of a changing climate.
"Winters in Canada have been warming faster than other seasons," he explained. "The rule of thumb in terms of how it affects precipitation is that we're expecting more of it overall, but it's not more frequent. So we have more intense precipitation events."
Matthews, whose research on climate change recently demonstrated that the outdoor skating season in Canada has been significantly reduced over the years (see infographic), says we're especially seeing an increase in variability. "There were some pretty wild swings in temperature earlier this winter,"he noted."That's consistent with how climate change is affecting the jet stream."
Can we confront climate change in a way that's meaningful enough to make a difference? "The challenge is big," Matthews said. "There's no single solution, but there are lots of little solutions." The focus for a number of researchers in Montreal is developing solutions to reduce the impact of climate change.
BEING READY
When the city experiences power outages, in part due to increasingly extreme weather, the search for alternative energy sources becomes a priority. Dr. Pragasen Pillay, Concordia engineering professor and NSERC/Hydro-Quebec senior industrial research chair, is investigating sources of renewable energy already present in large buildings.
For example, processing food waste through large-scale composters and converting it to methane or electricity could be key to creating local power sources in Montreal's city centre. "This could be used for emergency back up power ,"Pillay said. "With these tall buildings, we still need to power elevators and light hallways. Being able to have this kind of energy locally for emergencies would be valuable."
In other words, if we're hit by another ice storm that's as severe as what we experienced in 1998, downtown Montreal would not lose power entirely. In fact, its buildings could generate and store some energy, and possibly even power traffic lights and other facilities.
A waste-to-energy approach also has added ecological benefits. For instance, if food waste is used for energy, it won't need to be carried to landfills. "You could process waste directly in the building, offsetting the building'sneeds," Pillay said. "You'd also reduce trucking needs, the cost of landfills, and the diesel and fuel required to take that food waste to landfills."
Pillay says other countries, meanwhile, are also producing alternative energy from landfills.
BETTER ROADS
Winter-readiness should also be measured by how well our infrastructures can endure harsh weather conditions. To that end, Concordia engineering professor Dr. Tarek Zayed and his team are working to find durable solutions for our roads.
Zayed and his team developed a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) based management system,which provides information about how well the concrete's insides are performing after scanning a bridge deck using GPR.
When bridges in Montreal collapse or start chipping, it's also partly because of winter. "When bridges get older, they have concrete cracks," Zayed said. "These cracks carry the salt and water from rain, which quickly deteriorates the rebar inside the concrete. It'll corrode and rust, and corrosion can'tbestopped. After a while, the bridge becomes dangerous because it cannot carry its load."
The Ministere des Transports du Quebec commissioned Zayed and his team to study the province's bridges using the GPR,hoping it will help them decide how we can make these types of structures safer.
The team is also studying road markings, which, as any driver has noticed, can fade away in just one season.That's because the very tools we use to deal with winter - snow plows and salt - make road markings disappear.So the trick is to find long-lasting materials that won't.
Markings can be made with water-based paints, thermoplastic, epoxy paint, tapes, or Methyl Methacrylate (MMA). "They're different in lifespan," Zayed explained. "Sometimes it's done by water-based paint, which is the least expensive, but has a shorter duration. Usually, at stop signs and traffic lights, they use epoxy,which lasts longer."
THROUGH THE ROOF
Concordia engineering professor Dr. Hashem Akbari is remarkably optimistic in the face of climate change and the extreme winters it causes.
"For the first time, it was documented that the ozone hole in the South Pole was repairing itself," he said. "That was because of the protocol refusing the use of CFCs around the world.It's an example of implementing the science and coming to the expected result."
Akbari has been working on ways to make cities cooler to reduce their impacton Global Warming. He calls cities "heat islands," because their temperature is often about five degrees warmer than suburban or rural areas. His work looks for ways to cool down a city's hottest surfaces - usually roofs and pavements - which cool air temperatures by up to three degrees and improve air quality, both indoors and outside.
Cooling roofs and pavements is a strategy that has a long arm. It causes a decrease in air-conditioner use,it reduces the demand and consumption of energy, and it can cut down greenhouse gas emissions. "Reducing the air temperatures in Los Angeles by just three degrees Celsius is as effective as having everyone in the city drive electric cars," Akbari said.
One solution he recommends is white roofs,which reflects hort wave radiation back to the sky. In principle, they work similarly to rooftop gardens, or "green roofs," but they don't incurany incremental costifa cool roof is specified for the original installation."With roof top gardens, you need to move dirt to the top of building, you need water, you need the structure to support the weigh," he noted.
Roofs are also available in other highly reflective coloured materials, or absorbent surfaces, which can contain water, allowing it to evaporate slowly, and thus cool the air. As for pavements, while more needs to be developed, cool stones are one way to keep these surfaces cold and permeable.
That these technologies are available now explains why Akbari is so hopeful. "We can and we will make a difference," he said. His work on cool surfaces proves it.

Full text:   (From Montreal Gazette, January 29, 2015) Due to a reporting error, a column in Wednesday's Montreal Gazette referred to an electronic road sign in Massachusetts that purportedly read "Wicked Big Storm Coming. Pahk Ya Cah!" That sign, which was widely circulated on social media, turned out to have been Photoshopped. The Gazette regrets the error. *****
Damned if you do, double damned if you don't.
Predicting a storm of "historic" proportions, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio called on residents Monday to go home and batten down the hatches. Broadway theatres cancelled performances, planes were grounded, the subway shut down early and schools and the Metropolitan Museum were closed Tuesday.
Hours before the nor'easter dubbed Snowmageddon was expected to barrel up the East Coast, five states had declared a state of emergency.
What the Big Apple got, as we know now, was bupkus. A storm of Vaudevillian legend, Juno may be best remembered there for snowball fights in a deserted Times Square, overwrought correspondents reporting from CNN's blizzardmobile and Manhattan survivalists jostling for baguettes and batteries at the Whole Foods emporium.
The storm did sock it to Cape Cod and Boston, where Massachusetts used electronic road signs and a sense of humour to caution motorists to travel with care: "Wicked Big Storm Coming. Pahk Ya Cah!" To be honest, it seems like a pretty good day when the news du jour focuses on a snowstorm of anticlimactic proportions.
So were the politicians wrong to be prepared, to heed the warnings of the National Weather Service and scare the populace into submission?
It is instructive to contrast their hyper-readiness with Montreal's dismal handling of snow clearing this winter.
Montreal has a well-worn reputation for knowing its way around a snowstorm. We have the experience, the crews, the equipment. Visitors from distant lands who happen to be here after a storm stare out the windows in wonder as the armada of trucks, plows and blowers performs a late night snow-clearing ballet.
But this season, we have allowed petty politics and contractual squabbles to intrude on what ought to be a simple and obvious task - to ensure that the roads are cleared and the sidewalks are safe for pedestrians.
Despite the fact that Montreal got pretty much exactly the storm Environment Canada had predicted - a dirty cocktail of rain, freezing rain, ice pellets and snow, complicated by a sudden deep freeze - snow clearing and removal was woebegone and belaboured in many districts.
Mayor Denis Coderre huffed and puffed and promised to find out who wasn't doing their job.
Projet Montreal accused the mayor of launching "a witch hunt."
An internal audit detailed a cavalcade of system failures - broken machinery, understaffed work crews, elementary miscalculations on whether to salt, sand or clear snow, and in what order.
Luc Ferrandez, Projet's leader and the mayor of Plateau-Mont-Royal, initially said his district couldn't afford to clear the streets, blaming the central city for cutting $800,000 from its snow budget.
Only on Monday, some three weeks after the rain began to fall on Jan. 3, did the Plateau finally relent, admitting it had erred and announcing it would begin to remove snow from one-third of its streets.
As for the other two-thirds of streets in the city's trendiest district, well, good luck with that, and don't forget to stock up on rock salt. Spring is 53 days away.
Canadians with long memories can still get a cheap laugh out of the time Toronto mayor Mel Lastman summoned the army - 400 troops dispatched from CFB Petawawa, driving armoured vehicles - when the city was pummelled with 118 centimetres of snow in January 1999. The soldiers had help from a brigade of 100 volunteer shovellers from Prince Edward Island, who were rewarded with tickets to a Maple Leafs game. (No, I did not make that up.)
Yet for all his over-the-top outlandishness, Lastman understood what he was there for, what was required of politicians, and expected by taxpayers. "We arranged it so that seniors could go around the corner to get milk," he told the Toronto Star a decade later. "Would I do it again? You're darned right I would."
In the wake of Monday's storm-that-wasn't, New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, was asked whether he felt authorities had over-reacted. "We have had people die in storms," Cuomo told reporters. "I would rather be in a situation where we said, 'We got lucky.'" Of course, it takes more than the dusting of snow that blanketed Central Park to stop Montrealers, who party through the bleak mid-winter, cycling through slush and motoring through potholes the size of groundhogs wearing Canada Goose parkas.
But even hardy winter souls have a right to basic services from their city administration, starting with safe, ice-free, sidewalks and a place to pahk the cah.

Full text:   Montreal's comptroller's office investigated how the city responded to the first major snow and ice storm of 2015.
Here's a timeline of the storm and the city's response, compiled from city comptroller Alain Bond's report and media reports.
DEC. 31 The city's public-works department, using information from three weather services, sends out its daily weather forecasting bulletin. The Dec. 31 bulletin mentions rain and ice conditions. Bond's report says those daily bulletins were updated, but forecast temperatures around 10 C and did not foresee the dramatic drop in temperature that would occur between Jan. 4 and 5.
JAN. 1 10 a.m. Snow began falling.
JAN. 3 Boroughs began spreading abrasives.
JAN. 4 Between Jan. 3 and 4, about 23 centimetres of snow fell in Montreal.
Freezing rain began. In total, about 20 mm of freezing rain fell.
The city's daily weather-forecasting report issued Jan. 3 predicted that by 4 p.m. Jan. 4, the temperature would be around 8 and there would be no precipitation. In fact, the temperature went from -9.8 C to 2.1 C on Jan. 4 and eventually fell to -17 C by Jan. 5. Eight of the city's 19 boroughs began snow-clearing operations. The other 11 boroughs began snow clearing the next day.
JAN. 5 Hospitals report higher-thanusual numbers of people with broken wrists and ankles, and Urgences Sante said it was transporting more people than usual to hospitals because they had fallen on icy sidewalks, driveways, entranceways and parking lots.
6:48 p.m. On Twitter, Mayor Denis Coderre says that he has asked for widespread use of abrasives, and says it could slow snow-clearing operations.
8 p.m. After receiving a high number of complaints and given the city administration's concern about the situation, Montreal's borough-co-ordination office sent a notice to all boroughs to begin spreading abrasives as quickly as possible, before the next morning, Bond's report said.
JAN. 6 The city of Montreal defended the treacherous condition of its sidewalks, saying an exceptional cocktail of snow, rain, freezing rain and plummeting temperatures played havoc with its snow-clearing and salting operations.
"It's the worst (weather) conditions that you could bring together and it hampered our ability to get ahead," said Philippe Sabourin, a city spokesperson.
JAN. 7 Coderre asks for an audit of the snow-clearing operations.

Full text:   Don't blame God for Montreal's failure to clear its icy streets and sidewalks, Mayor Denis Coderre said Wednesday. The city knew days in advance it was facing a minor snowstorm followed by freezing rain and four days of extreme cold in early January.
That tempete was followed by a storm of accusations as union leaders blamed the city for skimping on overtime payments, borough mayors accused employees of absenteeism and one city councillor blamed global warming.
"The question," Coderre said, "is did we spread abrasives in all the boroughs when they were needed? ... I want to know who didn't do his job."
Opposition party Projet Montreal accused Coderre of responding to a complex issue with petty politics, and of orchestrating a witch hunt to divert attention from the fact his cuts to borough snow-clearing budgets were the main culprit.
Coderre was reacting to a presentation given to the city's executive committee by civil servants on the storm. Here are the city's findings, and reactions:
STORM WAS NO SURPRISE
Forecasts predicted days in advance the city was getting snow Jan. 3 followed by rain and freezing rain, then four days of extreme cold. The forecast 24 hours before the storm was mainly correct, in terms of levels of snow and rain, and when they would fall.
MONTREAL HAS SOME ICE STORM EXPERIENCE
Aside from the big one of 1998, Montreal has been hit with similar conditions - most recently from Dec. 24 to 27, 2008, when the city suffered snow, rain and then freezing rain. Sidewalks ended up in similar shape as this year.
ABRASIVES ARE BEST REMEDY
At temperatures below -21 C, salt becomes ineffective, so abrasives like small rocks are the best solution for frozen streets and sidewalks, officials noted. They must be spread repeatedly because they become encapsulated in layers of ice, until the rain stops.
311 INUNDATED
Montreal's 311 information line received more than 3,000 calls between Monday and Friday of that week complaining of icy roads and sidewalks. The majority of calls came from the boroughs of Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Plateau-Mont-Royal, Cote-des-Neiges - Notre-Damede-Grace, St-Laurent, Sud-Ouest and Ville-Marie.
BLAME GAME
Michel Parent, head of the city's blue-collar union, blamed the city for the poor response, saying it didn't want to call in crews on overtime to save money. (City officials denied this.)
Plateau-Mont-Royal mayor and Projet Montreal leader Luc Ferrandez blamed a record level of absenteeism among blue collar workers who were burning off unused sick days allowed in their contract. He and others noted employee ranks were stretched thin by numerous assignments: moving the snow, clearing the snow, spreading abrasives and salt, collecting recycling, repairing water leaks.
Executive committee vice-president Harout Chitilian suggested global warming is presenting new challenges for the city. The city is well prepared for clearing and removing snow, less so for ice storms, and must adjust to changing weather patterns.
OFFICIAL BLAME GAME
The city ordered an audit of the ice-clearing inefficiencies that was supposed to be ready Wednesday.
It wasn't, and the file has been moved to the city's comptroller's office for investigation. That report is supposed to be presented next Wednesday.
Coderre said it was "sad" the city's comptroller was forced to investigate the affair.
"It means there is someone who is not giving the information in his borough somewhere."
WITCH HUNT
Opposition party Projet Montreal accused Coderre of orchestrating a "witch hunt" to try and find a scapegoat.
"It follows the Coderre pattern of taking credit when things go well, but when there is a problem, looking for others to blame," councillor Guillaume Lavoie said. Instead of heeding the suggestions of highranking civil servants to launch a committee to find solutions to a complex problem, Coderre resorted to petty politics, which will do little to resolve future ice issues, Lavoie said.
IMPROVEMENTS
City officials said they were starting a committee to look at best practices in other cities. They noted Quebec City suffered a similar storm last year that rendered most of its bridges impassable. Coderre questioned why a committee was necessary when the city had so much forewarning.
"It's not a question of what product was used, it's a question of operations," he said. "I want to know what happened. The reality is we know someone did not do their job."

No ice storm of '98; It was a nasty reminder, but this weather event was a far cry from earlier crisis

Author: Vendeville, Geoffrey

Full text:   For some families, especially the 155,000 households left in the dark Sunday, the first ice storm of the new year may have stirred up memories of the storm of 1998.
But the most recent storm pales in comparison to the '98 disaster that caused havoc across Eastern Canada.
Sunday's storm heaped 10 centimetres of snow followed by freezing rain on the greater Montreal area. High winds and ice felled trees, turned sidewalks into skating rinks and - at the storm's peak - left 155,000 Hydro-Quebec customers without electricity. By 5 p.m. Monday, Hydro-Quebec reported that 2,500 households across the province were still without power.
In contrast, the ice storm of '98 - still the harshest on record in Quebec - battered the south of the province with 30-to-40 millimetres of freezing rain, and ripped the branches offor toppled an estimated 16,000 trees in Montreal alone. "During the 1998 ice storm, high-voltage transmission lines and towers fell like dominoes under the weight of the freezing rain," Hydro-Quebec spokesman Mathieu Rouy said. "At the height of the storm, more than one million homes were without power and it took several weeks to restore power to all the homes affected."
Hydro-Quebec has said it made a number of improvements to its power grid to avoid a repeat of the '98 disaster.
Every 10th tower on a transmission line has been bolstered to withstand violent winds and heavy ice, and Hydro-Quebec has rejigged its transmission system to deliver electricity by different routes, Rouy said.
Although some have argued Hydro-Quebec should bury more power lines to protect them from harsh weather, Rouy said that would be too costly since some hydroelectric complexes are more than a thousand kilometres away from customers. "I can't give you a precise number, but it can be three times, or even 10 times the cost or more," he said.
This weekend's ice storm wasn't nearly as severe as in 1998.
A spokeswoman for the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the association didn't expect an uptick in the number of housing or car insurance claims because of the storm. In 1998, however, the ice storm caused $1.3 billion in damage ($1.9 billion in today's dollars), the IBC reported.
Andre Cantin of Environment Canada said Sunday's storm doesn't even qualify as exceptional. "We don't have a classification scheme, but from the point of view of other storms I'd say (Sunday's) was moderately problematic."
As for the '98 storm, Cantin said he had never seen anything like it in his 31 years as a meteorologist - and doesn't expect to again.
Over those chaotic few days between Jan. 4 and 10, 1998, he worked 15-hour shifts in a provincial government office in Quebec City, relaying the latest forecasts up a chain to top brass. "Even the premier participated in the conference calls. It was an event that was managed at the very highest level," Cantin recalled.
"It was a little stressful, but motivating for a meteorologist like me to work and provide information in a situation that was so dramatic," he said, "because there were people who were suffering and who were subsequently traumatized. As soon as we speak of an ice storm now, these people remember." gvendeville@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/geoffvendeville

Full text:   The city of Montreal defended the treacherous condition of its sidewalks on Monday saying an exceptional cocktail of snow, rain, freezing rain and plummeting temperatures played havoc with its snow clearing and salting operations during the weekend.
"It's the worst (weather) conditions that you could bring together and it hampered our ability to get ahead," said Philippe Sabourin, a city spokesperson. "We don't deny that there are icy sidewalks."
The wacky weather led to a miserable return to school and work for thousands of Quebecers who had to navigate slippery sidewalks that were covered in a thick layer of ice. Plunging temperatures overnight Sunday froze water that had accumulated on sidewalks and some streets, the city said.
By noon on Monday, staffat the Montreal General and Royal Victoria Hospitals had already treated more than a dozen people for wrist or ankle breaks, a level three or four times higher than normal. Some hospital staffalso turned up in the emergency room with broken limbs after falling, said Ian Popple, a media relations officer with the McGill University Health Centre.
Urgences-Sante confirmed that there was a large increase in the number of people they transported to hospitals on Monday because of falls. "They aren't just falling on the sidewalks in Montreal, they're falling in their driveways, entranceways and in parking lots," spokesperson Benoit Garneau said. "We are picking them up from everywhere."
Low temperatures mean that many sidewalks could remain icy for a few days, Sabourin warned, adding that pedestrians should be careful when walking and ensure they have boots with good traction.
The city of Montreal has to clear and salt 10,000 kilometres of roads and sidewalks and "we can't be everywhere at once," Sabourin said. He said city employees have been working hard since Saturday and said there is no miracle recipe to immediately thaw icy sidewalks.
As they wait for the ice to thaw, or for the city to spread more abrasives, Montrealers found their own tools to get around on Monday. Many pedestrians walking downtown were using trekking poles for stability. At the downtown Sports Experts store, a clerk said he sold more than 40 pairs of crampons that provide traction on the ice.
A spokesperson for the Agence metropolitaine de transport said workers did their best to keep platforms and parking lots free of ice, but they were hampered by gusting wind that blew away the abrasives that had been spread during the weekend. "We were watching the weather closely, but the changing weather conditions made it difficult," Fanie Clement St-Pierre said.
At Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, many flights were delayed on Monday because of de-icing.
Environment Canada said skies will be cloudy on Tuesday with a 60 per cent chance of flurries in the afternoon and a high of -10 C. On a positive note, Hydro-Quebec said it had restored power to almost all Montreal homes that lost electricity on Sunday night.

Canada and U.S. grapple with winter weather, from flash freezing to flight delays

Full text: Freezing rain, high winds have forced flight delays and cancellations in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal
A litany of weather problems gripped vast swaths of Canada and the United States on the first Monday of 2014, ushering a "pick your misery" list of headaches that has so far included flight cancellations, stalled shipments, overwhelmed homeless shelters, school closures, crop damage and record-low temperatures.
From Crowsnest Pass, Alta., to Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, Canadians confronted freezing rain, snow, high winds and teeth-cracking cold, with some communities heeding as many as four different consecutive weather alerts. The coldest air in almost 20 years also swept over the U.S. toward the East Coast, with 90 per cent of the contiguous U.S. expected to be at or below the freezing mark Monday, according to the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Md.
"It was a lexicon of winter misery being played out," said Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips. "Pick your misery. The weather gods are out to punish you."
The unstable conditions stemmed from a tug-of-war between a warm, moist system from Texas and cold Arctic air. Like "a bully waiting in the bush," the cold front inevitably prevailed, Mr. Phillips said. Particularly unusual was how quickly the weather shifted in places such as Windsor, Ont., where the temperature went from around the freezing point Sunday to -18 C on Monday. "It's like a reverse Chinook," he said.
Freezing rain across Eastern Canada forced hundreds of airline passengers to be diverted to Fredericton, and Nova Scotians were facing warnings of winds gusting up to 130 kilometres per hour. But in Newfoundland, where schools have been closed until Wednesday, there was some reprieve: Crews made progress in restoring power for thousands as the island entered its fourth day of outages triggered by cold weather, a fire at a terminal station and a power plant that went off-line.
The Ontario Provincial Police reported several accidents and vehicles in ditches on a highway north of Toronto, and buses for two Ottawa school boards were cancelled. In Quebec, warmer temperatures brought rainfall warnings. The Prairies faced a whirlpool of frigid, dense air - known as a polar vortex - that blanketed Saskatchewan and Manitoba and descended into much of the United States. More than 3,500 U.S. flights were cancelled, with more than half of Chicago O'Hare's 2,400 daily flights axed amid a temperature of -25 C. Minnesota shuttered its schools because of the cold for the first time since 1997, farmers from Texas to Florida braced for damaged crops, and Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard pushed the city's travel emergency level to "red," making it illegal for anyone to drive except for emergencies or to seek shelter.
Mr. Phillips warned that the Arctic air will soon flood the eastern part of Canada and cause flash freezes. "It's going to be a messy situation," he said. Some communities - including Toronto, Halifax, Montreal and Quebec City - were expected to see a drastic drop in temperatures by Tuesday. Those seeking some relief were urged to look forward to the weekend.
"Just wait it out," Mr. Phillips advised. "By the end of this week, we'll be into a January thaw in the east and, while not thawing in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, instead of having highs of -25, we'll have highs of -4."

Full text: Hydro Quebec reported that it may take as much as 72 hours to repair possibly leaving some families without power for Christmas
? Weather conditions are expected to improve in the final days leading up to Christmas after a weekend of hazardous weather and treacherous road conditions played a factor in the deaths of six people in three fatal accidents in Quebec.
On Saturday, a 21-year-old woman was killed near Quebec City during a head-on collision on an icy stretch of highway. On Sunday, a 72-year-old female pedestrian was killed after being struck by a snowplough in Lanaudière, north of Montreal.
Perilous road conditions made travelling dangerous in several regions of the province as the storm made its way east, leaving behind it a trail of accidents and power outages.
As was the case in Ontario, the storm struck down transmission lines, cutting off electricity in thousands of homes, especially in the southern part of the province. At least 45,000 homes in Quebec were without electricity on Sunday, mostly in communities just south of Montreal in the Montérégie region, as well as in the Eastern Townships where freezing rain and high winds damaged several transmission lines.
The power outage also affected about a 1,000 homes in Montreal. New Brunswick Power reported about 3,800 customers without electricity on Sunday, most of them in St. Stephen. Hydro Quebec reported that it may take up to 72 hours to restore power to all customers, possibly leaving some families without electricity for Christmas.
On Sunday in Quebec City, severe weather played a factor in a pile-up involving a city bus and several cars on one of the main inner-city highways, leaving two people injured. The city was particularly hard hit by the bad weather, causing public-transit delays and several minor accidents on city streets while foiling plans for last-minute Christmas shoppers.
"This kind of weather will certainly hurt December sales. But we hope that nicer weather in the coming days will help us make up some of the losses," said Pascale Moisan, head of the Petit Champlain tourist business district. The ferry service on the St. Lawrence River between Quebec City and Lévis was stopped earlier in the day before resuming after a 90-minute interruption.
The mixture of ice pellets, freezing rain, snow and strong winds created havoc throughout the province on Sunday. Combined with the unusually cold weather in the days leading-up to the weekend storm, the month of December was shaping up to be one of the coldest and snowiest in recent years, said Environment Canada meteorologist René Héroux.
"I don't expect any record-breaking snowfall or cold temperatures but we haven't seen this amount of snow and cold weather in December for several years," Mr. Héroux said. "For instance, Quebec City had 75 centimetres of snow before this weekend's storm. It will easily break the 100-centimetre mark but that's far from being a record snowfall for a month of December in that city."
Road conditions got worse throughout the day due to freezing rain, sleet and up to 80-kilometre-an-hour winds. But as the storm moved eastward Mr. Héroux said the Maritimes would receive mainly snow, making the situation for travellers more manageable. Nonetheless police were urging extreme caution for all those travelling during the storm.
Several flights in Montreal, Quebec City and Maritime airports were cancelled or delayed. Some areas of the province were hit with as much as 20 centimetres of sleet and freezing rain and as much as 30 centimetres of snow. Winds of up to 85 kilometres an hour added to the mayhem, leaving several cities and towns scrambling throughout the night to clear the roads.
Environment Canada is reporting that weather conditions will improve by midday Monday in Quebec, giving a reprieve to those planning to travel before Christmas day.

Full text: Environment Canada says a disturbance from Texas is behind freezing precipitations that will move across Southern Ontario into Friday evening
Just in time for the busiest travelling weekend of the year, Mother Nature is offering holiday commuters a mixed bag of weather that could leave roads slippery and force flight delays.
Environment Canada says a disturbance from Texas is behind freezing precipitations that will move across Southern Ontario into Friday evening. Depending on the location, people can expect a blend of wet snow, ice pellets, freezing rain or rain.
Things could get even worse overnight from Saturday to Sunday, when a second system could usher a major ice storm.
Further east, the Richelieu Valley, south of Montreal, can expect five millimetres of freezing precipitation tonight and light freezing precipitation Saturday.
At the same time, on the west coast, Vancouver and Victoria were getting snow, which was expected to turn to rain near the coast.
The weather's impact was still limited on early Friday at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, where less than two per cent of flights (12 arrivals and 11 departures) had been cancelled.
However, several airlines warned of further disturbances.
Air Canada said that flights today at airports in Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Halifax and Newark, NJ, could be affected by forecasted snow and de-icing.
Air Canada said it is expected flight disruptions to continue in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto through the weekend.
WestJet also warned that storms could delays or cancellations to its flights in British Columbia (Vancouver, Abbotsford, Victoria, Comox and Nanaimo) and eastern Canada (Kitchener-Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton and Montreal).
Porter also cautioned travellers with flights in Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Chicago and Quebec to check for possible delays or cancellations.

Full text: Power outages and flight disruptions reported due to bad weather
A freezing-rain warning was lifted for Toronto and points west Friday morning, but remained in effect for York, Halton and Durham regions and much of cottage country after a rainy, windy night left Southern Ontario's roads slicked with slush and ice.
Numerous school boards outside the city cancelled bus service for a second day.
Mid-morning, Hydro One reported that more than 116,000 of its customers were without power, mostly in rural locations, as the utility struggled to deal with hundreds of downed lines.
In Toronto, scattered power outages were reported overnight, knocking out traffic lights at several key intersections but in most instances service was restored within a few hours.
The largest hydro disruption, afflicting between 5,000 and 6,000 customers, was in the city's northwest, within a rectangle bounded by Wilson and Sheppard Avenues, and Bathurst and Keele Streets.
Elsewhere in the region power outages were more extensive, particularly in and around Hamilton, where thousands of customers lost electricity as a result of ice buildups on hydro lines and falling trees.
Dozens of flights in and out of Pearson International Airport and the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport were delayed or cancelled, and as usual air travellers were being urged to call ahead before heading for either airport, or to check departures and arrivals online.
On the roads, traffic was generally light, police said.
One of the more unusual travel interruptions happened on the VIA train tracks between Toronto and Montreal, when a tree or a large branch fell on the engine of an eastbound train as it neared Belleville at around 9 a.m., bringing the journey to a swift halt.
"What are the odds?" tweeted Alex Brassard, a political scientist headed for the NDP convention in Montreal.
After a 15-minute delay, the train began moving again.
Also affected was the busy Scarborough Rapid Transit line, which was shut down between Kennedy and McCowan Stations before trains began running again at around 7 a.m.
Toronto's school buses were running on schedule, but service was cancelled in several other large school districts, including Peel, Halton and Durham regions, and points east as far as Peterborough.
The Toronto police marine unit, meanwhile, was corralling a 200-tonne vessel that broke free from its moorings near Harbourfront Centre overnight.
Temperatures were warming up, with a high of 7 C anticipated by mid-morning, and a flood warning was also in effect as the snow and ice began to melt.
A look at school bus service in the region
York Region District School Board: Bus and taxi service operating as normal
Toronto District School Board: Student transportation operating as normal
Halton: Buses cancelled on and north of Steeles for Halton District School board, Catholic Distrcit School Board, and French Catholic Board
Simcoe County District School Board: All school buses cancelled in all of its zones
Durham District and Durham Catholic District School Board: All school buses north of Hwy 7 cancelled, schools are open
Peel District School Board: All buses in Caledon are cancelled, schools are open
Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board: Buses in Caledon and Durham County are cancelled, schools are open

Environment Canada warned Sunday that the "hit and run" storm could drop up about 30 centimetres of snow in Ontario and as many as 60 centimetres in some areas in Quebec.
"It's a one-day wonder here for Ontario, that's the good news about it," said Environment Canada senior climatologist Dave Phillips.
Air travel was crippled Sunday by the storm and flights at Toronto's Pearson International Airport - the busiest in the country - were cut by 50 per cent. Most flights from the United States, but also from Ottawa, Windsor, London and Kingston, Ont., were cancelled and many international flights were delayed.
The Greater Toronto Airport Authority and airport authorities in Montreal were advising travellers to check ahead with their airline. VIA Rail said all trains were operating normally in Ontario and Quebec with some experiencing delays of about 30 minutes.
In Toronto, driving was treacherous as the visibility was low and the drifting snow slogged streets and sidewalks.
Brianne Tucker, a shop keeper in Toronto, spent most of the morning shovelling her side walk, but it was tough to keep up with the constant snowfall.
"I think I've seen the wind change about three different times just while having breakfast," said Tucker while shovelling snow.
She estimated that about four centimetres of snow per hour accumulated on her walkway.
"Personally, I'm loving it because I'm from the Arctic, so this is like going home. But it's definitely crazy."
Several scheduled events were cancelled, including a Santa Claus Parade in Innisfil, Ont., due to the deteriorating weather conditions.
Police were reminding drivers who ran into trouble to stay safely inside their cars.
A woman outside her vehicle on Highway 401 near Elgin Road in London, Ont., was hit and killed by a snow plow around 12:30 p.m., television station CP24 reported.
Weather warnings were issued for Ontario, southern Quebec and all of the Atlantic Provinces. There were reports of thunder and strong winds hitting some areas in southwestern Ontario and Toronto.
Other regions were bracing for the more of the same.
"It's going to have the Maritimes in its grips for most of tomorrow (Monday) and tomorrow evening into Newfoundland," said Mr. Phillips.
"When it finally just blows away up there in Newfoundland and out in the North Sea it will have created a lot of misery," he said.
"In Montreal we're seeing anywhere between 15 and 25 centimetres of snow today," said Mr. Phillips, adding that the city could get a total of 40 centimetres.
"Some areas in southern Quebec, particularly in the elevated areas - this could translate into more like 60 centimetres of snow," said Mr. Phillips.
In Atlantic Canada, weather warnings are in effect for most of the region.
The Monday morning commute could be especially tricky in northwestern New Brunswick, where up to 40 centimetres of snow is expected to fall today and overnight.
The rest of New Brunswick, and most of Prince Edward Island and mainland Nova Scotia will receive between 15 and 25 centimetres of snow today before changing to rain overnight.
A rainfall warning is in effect for southern Nova Scotia, which could receive up to 40 millimetres of rain.
Some areas in the Maritimes could see winds gusting up to 90 kilometres an hour, while winds gusting to 140 kilometres an hour are predicted for northwestern Cape Breton.
The same weather is expected to hit most of Newfoundland overnight and into tomorrow, with the western part of the province receiving the most snow. Storm warnings are also in place for eastern Labrador.
Despite all the problems expected in Canada, the brunt of the storm is staying south and hitting harder at the eastern seaboard of the United States.
Street and highway crews were at work trying to clear roads across the Great Lakes states into New England today as a storm blamed for three deaths spread a hazardous mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain.
The National Weather Service posted winter storm warnings from Michigan and Indiana all the way to Maine.
The storm canceled hundreds of flights at airports in Chicago, where Midway Airport measured 10 inches of snow by Sunday morning. No delays were reported at Boston's Logan Airport, but officials urged travelers to check with their airlines. Boston expected five to eight inches of snow, with heavier amounts likely in northern New England.
An estimated 103,000 customers were blacked out Sunday morning in parts of Pennsylvania, the utilities PPL and MetEd reported.

Full text: Close to 30,000 Quebecers were left without power Wednesday after the province was hit hard by freezing rain.
? Close to 30,000 Quebecers were left without power Wednesday after the province was hit hard by freezing rain.
The Laurentians and the Beauce, south of Quebec City, were the hardest hit regions as high winds combined with the freezing rain prevented work crews from accessing the troubled areas.
Hydro-Quebec spokesperson Elodie Pestel said that while problems were widespread early Wednesday morning, the situation had improved somewhat later in the day.
By Wednesday evening 20,000 people were still without power, but Ms. Pestel said most of Hydro's clients would be reconnected by Thursday morning.
"(The problems) are not uniquely because of the weather," she said. "Repair crews are having trouble accessing the lines because the conditions are difficult. The ground is slippery."
Some 65 millimetres of rain and freezing hit downtown Montreal Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, four times the previous record for the day.
The rain helped create dangerous conditions for motorists and pedestrians alike.
Montreal's ambulance service said it had received more than 550 calls by Wednesday afternoon, many for pedestrians injured as a result of sidewalks that resembled skating rinks.
Montreal's two large hospitals reported treating a combined 58 patients for injuries related to the weather, including one person who was listed in serious condition.
As a precaution, police closed nearly a dozen slippery downtown streets.
Weather forecasters predict light flurries for Montreal overnight Wednesday, while the freezing rain is expected to head towards New Brunswick.

Snowstorm hits Ontario

Full text: Southern Ontario was hit with a winter storm Thursday, making a white Christmas and travel headaches both a reality.
Environment Canada says there could be as much as 30 centimetres of snow before the storm blows through.
Other parts of the country are getting a variety of weather types as well Thursday.
"It's balmy in Calgary while it's frigid in Saskatchewan and Winnipeg," David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment Canada, told globeandmail.com. The wind chill is -48 degrees Celsius in Winnipeg.
The weather is affecting operations at Pearson Airport in Toronto, where several flights have been cancelled or delayed.
"Between 120 and 130 flights have been either cancelled or consolidated," Connie Turner, the general manager for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said.
The airport was expecting 80,000 people to go through its terminals Thursday, one day before Christmas Eve. What was normally expected to be a busy day at the airport is turning out to be an even busier one, with backups occurring because of the volume.
"It's going to better than anticipated -- the runways are clean and the [cleaning]crew was out there all night," Ms. Turner said.
Thursday shouldn't be the busiest day at Pearson, she points out. Instead, the GTAA is expecting 102,000 people going through the airport on Jan. 2.
Air Canada says early flights to Ottawa, Calgary and Montreal are affected, along with some flights to U.S. destinations. Some United Airlines flights are also cancelled.
Jacqueline Richard, a spokeswoman for Aéroports de Montreal, said most flight cancellations at the Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport were not as a result of conditions in Montreal.
"Flights are being cancelled because of conditions elsewhere, [not only in Ontario]but Cincinnati and Detroit," she said.
Despite the cancellations, Ms. Richard said it was a quiet morning at Trudeau.
"Things have been going rather smoothly," she said. "It'll be a lot busier this afternoon...we're expecting this to be the busiest day of the year."
VIA Rail Canada released a statement Thursday morning, providing other transportation options for travellers whose holiday plans changed due to flight cancellations.
"Space is still available on many of the departures throughout the Windsor to Québec City Corridor. While many trains will be busy, seats still remain on most departures between Montréal-Québec City, Montréal-Ottawa, Montréal-Toronto and Windsor-Toronto," the statement says.
The snowstorm warning remains in place for communities west of Toronto and through the Niagara region. There is also a heavy snowfall warning covering most of southwestern Ontario, including Windsor and Sarnia.
"Let's look at the positive," Mr. Phillips said. "This is going to ensure that the province is going to have a white Christmas."
"We didn't have a white Christmas last year," Mr. Phillips said. "For the most part, they have been brown in the past 10 years."
"The storm's timing is what makes it a buzz out there. Its timing makes it more significant than the type of precipitation."
Mr. Phillips says the storm is not out of season.
"The storm is behaving, it's not record-breaking. It doesn't indicate that we're going to be getting a bunch of these," he commented.
Mr. Phillips noted that the greatest impact for most areas is over and cleanup has already begun. However, the storm has been a mixed bag of precipitation.
"This storm is almost like a winter factory," Mr. Phillips said.
In the Toronto area the snowfall has ended, giving way to freezing rain. As a result, Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for Toronto and areas to the north of the city. The warning also extends through Oshawa, Pickering, Belleville, Kingston, Ottawa and Cornwall.
Other regions of the province had a variety of conditions. Aurora received 17 centimetres of snow, followed by freezing rain. It was raining in the Niagara Peninsula while Windsor and Pearson airports received light snow. Toronto island received light rain and Ottawa got ice pellets.
Some areas experienced all types of precipitation, like in London, where the north part of the city received snow while the south part received freezing rain. Mr. Phillips pointed out that some areas could simply receive thunderstorms.
Environment Canada has also posted various weather warnings for snow or freezing rain from Windsor to the Quebec border.
"The day will end with snow," Mr. Phillips said. Rain will turn into snow tonight in most areas, including Toronto.

Central Canada snowed in

Full text: The first severe snowstorm to hit Central Canada is delaying air travel and has caused chaos on some roads leading into Toronto.
The first severe snowstorm to hit Central Canada is delaying air travel and has caused chaos on some roads leading into Toronto.
The storm, which hit Winsdor Monday morning and travelled eastward toward Montreal, left snow, freezing rain and ice pellets after exiting the U.S. Midwest. The accumulated snowfall in some areas is expected to reach between 30 and 50 centimetres by Tuesday morning.
Air Canada officials advised Monday night that as a result of continued heavy snow in the Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal regions it planned to cancel or delay more than half its Tuesday morning flights. Travellers can call Air Canada and Canadian Airlines officials for flight information at 1-888-247-2262 before heading to the airport.
The airline expects to resume normal schedules by late Tuesday afternoon and plans to substitute larger aircraft to accommodate stranded passengers. Travellers who reschedule flights will not have to pay change fees.
Pearson International Airport official Peter Greg said that 70 per cent of Monday departures and arrivals were cancelled. Earlier in the day, an airport spokesman said the airport was as ready as it could be for the storm, and that new equipment in place allows crews to clear snow from runways in a third of the time it used to take.
But passengers weren't made to sleep at the airport overnight. Laura Cooke, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, said "we secured several hundred hotel rooms in the Toronto area to put up those whose connecting flights were cancelled."
The worst-hit area so far is a large region that includes Wingham, Stratford and Owen Sound. Wind has created drifts in the area as high as the windows of cars. Provincial police say roads are impassable, and are telling motorists not to travel in Perth, Huron, North Wellington, Bruce and Grey counties. School buses in the entire region are expected to be cancelled Tuesday.
Toronto is getting more snow and patchy freezing rain Tuesday morning on top of about 20 centimetres overnight. Plows have been out all night and major highways are generally clear. However, a number of highway ramps are blocked by jack-knifed tractor trailers.
The O-P-P have closed a section of Highway 400 North of Canal Road.
Schools are open in York Region, north of Toronto, but both the York separate and public school boards say their buses are cancelled.
Parts of Midwestern, Central and Eastern Ontario remain under a heavy snow warning. A winter storm warning remains in effect for Toronto, Hamilton, Waterloo and London as well as Halton, Peel, York and Durham. The warning has ended for Windsor, Sarnia, Brantford and Niagara.
Environment Canada says conditions will improve from west to east across the province as the day goes on. However, snowsqualls will remain a problem off of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Midwest got the brunt of the storm.
Chicago's O'Hare Airport cancelled about 75 per cent of its departing flights and housed thousands of stranded travellers. Earlier Monday, a plane skidded off the runway because of the weather. The storm was felt as far south as Texas, with snow possible in El Paso, along the Mexican border.
The storm began as a jet stream hit a cold front sitting over Colorado Monday. The jet stream created a low-pressure area, where Colorado's cold air clashed with warmer air sucked in from Texas and Oklahoma. Fuelled by powerful winds, the whole weather system headed northeast toward the Great Lakes and grew in intensity.

The first severe snowstorm to hit Central Canada will delay air travel Tuesday while motorists faced a morning drive on snow-covered roads.
The storm, which hit Winsdor Monday morning and travelled eastward toward Montreal, left snow, freezing rain and ice pellets after exiting the U.S. Midwest. The accumulated snowfall in some areas was expected to reach between 30 and 50 centimetres by Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the storm was expected to push into eastern Quebec and New Brunswick.
Air Canada officials advised Monday night that as a result of continued heavy snow in the Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal regions it planned to cancel or delay more than half its Tuesday morning flights. Travellers can call Air Canada and Canadian Airlines officials for flight information at 1-888-247-2262 before heading to the airport.
Heavy snow warnings were issued by Environment Canada for the area north of Toronto. Snowfall was expected to continue into the night in most areas before tapering off into flurries by Tuesday morning.
The airline expected to resume normal schedules by late Tuesday afternoon and plans to substitute larger aircraft to accommodate stranded passengers. Travellers who reschedule flights will not have to pay change fees.
Pearson International Airport official Peter Greg said that 70 per cent of Monday departures and arrivals were cancelled.

Laura Cooke, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, said "we secured several hundred hotel rooms in the Toronto area to put up those whose connecting flights were cancelled."
The agency warned people not to travel Monday night as near-blizzard conditions would produce hazardous driving conditions. Temperatures were poised to dip Tuesday.
In other cities such as Windsor, snow started falling at noon Monday but by 5 p.m. had turned to freezing rain, said Cliff Woolcock, maintenance manager for the city. The area had already received about eight centimetres of snow.
Hamilton was hit with snow and freezing rain but a police spokesman said while the city had "a rash of minor accidents", there were no serious incidents.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Midwest got the brunt of the storm.

City crews poised to tackle weather
By ALLISON DUNFIELD Globe and Mail Update
Heavy snowfall caused aggravation during rush hour in southern Ontario Monday evening, but no serious problems.
Ontario Provincial Police said that no highways were reported closed as of 5 p.m. EST and there were no major accidents on Monday.
In Windsor, Ont. snow started falling by noon on Monday but by 5 p.m. it had turned to freezing rain, said Cliff Woolcock, maintenance manager.
He said the Southwestern Ontario city had been hit with eight centimetres of snow by 4:30 p.m. and 20 salter plows had been operating on major city routes since 10:30 a.m.
"We hope to get through this by tomorrow morning," Mr. Woolcock said, adding the city's first major storm of the year was supposed to end early Tuesday morning.
In Peterborough, north of Toronto, snow was falling "very lightly" by about 4 p.m. EST, said Greg Hogg, road supervisor for the city. "We don't have anything major as of yet."
However, Peterborough was expected to have up to 25 centimetres. Mr. Hogg said the city's 13 plow trucks, two graters and five front-end loaders are prepared. He said ploughing would likely begin after midnight. "Everyone should be able to get to work tomorrow."
In Kitchener by about 4:30 p.m., only about five centimetres of snow had fallen, Mike Tout, manager of operations, said, adding "it's snowing pretty good right now."
Mr. Tout said that there were a few fender-benders on the Conestoga Espressway expected to get between 15 and 20 centimetres.
Weather problems began Sunday evening in Parry Sound, Ont, the Canadian Press reports. Three people died and one is in hospital after a minivan crossed the centre line and hit a southbound car head-on on Highway 69 near Parry Sound on Sunday evening.
Provincial police in Parry Sound said both people in the car were killed, along with one passenger in the minivan.
