Full text: With thousands of snowbirds staying north this winter, a pedestrians'group is calling on the city of Montreal to vastly improve its sidewalk snow-clearing operations.
Pedestrian activist Dan Lambert said he's concerned that icy sidewalks - and the fear of a serious fall - will keep many senior citizens locked in their homes during the colder months, which will take a toll on their physical and mental well-being.
"It doesn't take much to discourage a senior," he said. "The only exercise that a lot of them can do is go for a walk, and if they can't even go for a walk safely in the winter, it's going to be really hell for them staying inside. And the worst thing they can do is slip and fall."
There were many icy patches on sidewalks Wednesday after a dusting of snow melted and refroze overnight. Lambert's group, the Coalition mobilité active Montréal, has been regularly monitoring the state of sidewalks and bike paths in several parts of the city, including Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Ville-Marie, Plateau-Mont-Royal and Sud-Ouest. Lambert said he has been sending messages of congratulations to public works directors for good maintenance in high-traffic areas, but he added that crews have not been thoroughly put to the test so far this winter.
"We haven't had anything I would call terrible snow events," Lambert said. "We haven't had any challenging weather yet. The thaw-freeze cycles are more problematic when you have accumulated snow."
Lambert is concerned that things will deteriorate if there are major snowfalls or bouts of freezing rain.
"In some cases, city policies aren't good enough, and that goes for hilly areas that can get very slippery with just one centimetre of ice," he said.
The Coalition mobilité active Montréal and the Conseil régional de l'environnement de Montréal sent a joint letter to Mayor Valérie Plante earlier in the year highlighting their concerns.
The letter asked the city to add more space to allow people to keep safe distances when passing each other on sidewalks. It also asked the city to maintain some pedestrian corridors that were instituted during the spring in order to widen sidewalks into the street, but the administration declined that request, saying it would make snow-clearing operations more difficult.
If there aren't wider areas for pedestrians, Lambert said, he would like crews to do a better job of clearing entire sidewalks; generally ice is pushed to the margins of the sidewalks, which reduces the width where people can walk.
Lionel Perez, interim leader of the opposition Ensemble Montréal, said much of the reason for persistently icy sidewalks is due to a lack of funds. He said the Plante administration has not significantly increased the city's snow-clearing budget since it came into power.
"If the boroughs and city centre don't have sufficient money, they adjust their decisions accordingly," Perez said. "Public safety of our elderly should not be compromised by budgetary decisions. This year, there are a lot more seniors (in the city) and there are fewer indoor activities for them to do, so it's more important than ever that we have truly excellent sidewalk clearing."
Perez said the Plante administration is not up to the task, and that icy sidewalks have been a hallmark of the mayor's tenure.
"There's no reason for Montreal to have the challenges we've seen in the last few years, but they always come up with excuses," he said.
Youssef Amane, a spokesperson for Plante, said the administration is prioritizing sidewalks this year.
"We know that this year, many more Montrealers will stay in the city because of the pandemic," Amane said. "That's why we are paying particular attention to securing sidewalks, so as to encourage active mobility.

Full text: What's Christmas without a little bit of ... rainfall?
Environment Canada has issued a rainfall warning for the Montreal area, Laval, Châteauguay and Longueuil, with 20 to 40 millimetres expected to begin falling Thursday afternoon, continuing until Friday evening.
That rain may cause flash floods and pooling on roads, the statement warns.
Christmas Day is expected to be unseasonably warm, with temperatures up in the 13 C range, but the temperature will drop below freezing at night.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
The COVID-19 vaccines are in Quebec. Now what?
Experts are celebrating the start of Quebec's COVID-19 vaccination campaign, but they also warn that the benefits of the vaccine won't be apparent for some time. "I think we should be ecstatic," said Dr. Donald Sheppard, chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in McGill's Faculty of Medicine. "I think it is very clear that the only exit strategy for us to get back to normal life will be vaccination," he said. "It's the only way we're going to protect the vulnerable people in our community, the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions." But the first inoculations are unlikely to have any immediate effect on the number of hospitalizations and deaths.
Quebec to close non-essential businesses over the holidays to help curb COVID-19
In what it's describing as a needed "holiday pause," the Quebec government announced a series of restrictions Tuesday aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 in the province. The measures will include closing non-essential businesses as of Dec. 25 and keeping elementary schools closed an extra week, until Jan. 11, with some distanced learning options available. At a news conference Tuesday, Premier François Legault said the government had no choice but to act given the rising number of daily cases and the pressure the province's hospitals are under. Legault said businesses deemed non-essential will be closed until at least Jan. 11. Grocery stores, pharmacies, pet shops and hardware stores will remain open, as will the province's liquor (SAQ) and cannabis (SQDC) stores.
Legault opens door to Canadiens games at Bell Centre this season
Quebec Premier François Legault put on his hockey-fan hat Wednesday and said he would welcome the resumption of National Hockey League action in mid-January. "If it takes place in mid-January - I hope so, to be quite honest - I think it's entertainment that is very popular in Quebec," Legault said during his daily news conference. Legault also said he was looking forward to the Canadiens playing in a proposed Canadian Division. "Obviously, with the financial means that NHL teams have, they can put in place measures to protect players," said Legault. "Unlike garage leagues, they are capable of creating bubbles."
Bonjour-hi T-shirts a big boon to the Montreal Gazette Christmas Fund
Merci-thank you. That seems to be the most appropriate response to broadcaster Aaron Rand and fans of the satirical "bonjour-hi" T-shirt he created. The popular CJAD host presented a cheque for $8,655 to the Montreal Gazette Christmas Fund Thursday - proceeds from the sale of the shirts this fall. The T-shirt is Rand's latest salvo into the field of linguistic politics in Quebec. It says "bonjour Hi!" with a thumbs-up and the words "approuvé OQLF approved" underneath. Five hundred of them have been sold since Rand launched the line in November. Rand told Gazette columnist Bill Brownstein he had been galvanized to act after hearing Michel Leblanc, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, say the expression "bonjour-hi" was offensive when used by local merchants. "Here's the guy responsible for trying to help hard-hit businesses saying that," Rand told Brownstein. "I had really hoped and prayed the bonjour-hi debate was over, but noooo. It's such a simple and unnecessary thing to bring up again."
Will 2020 be a white Christmas in Montreal? Don't bet on it
It probably won't be a white Christmas, and that's something Montrealers should get used to. "There's still some uncertainty, so I wouldn't say the probability is zero, but there are definitely more chances for a green Christmas for Montreal," Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent told the Montreal Gazette. Parent said after several days of colder than normal temperatures, it's expected to snow over the weekend and warm up for the next few days. By the time Christmas rolls around, however, temperatures are expected to hover a little above the freezing point. There is some precipitation in the forecast, but so far that will come in the form of rain, Parent said. "There's still some uncertainty around that system because it's still a few days away, but all the models point to a rain event on Christmas Eve."

Forecast looking bleak for a white Christmas

"There's still some uncertainty around that system because it's still a few days away, but all the models point to a rain event on Christmas Eve."
For it to be considered to be a white Christmas, there have to be two centimetres on the ground on Dec. 25 in the morning, Parent said. If the predictions for the next week hold, it looks like Montreal is heading for its third green Christmas in a row.
While many people have taken to making their own outdoor skating rinks in their yards this year, Parent said perhaps amateur ice makers should wait until after Christmas to start up their rinks, as the temperatures will be above the freezing mark.
"Up until the 24th, temperatures will be near zero, but it's going to climb up over that, so they may have work to do on their rinks for Boxing Day," he said.
According to statistics provided by Environment Canada, there have been 17 green Christmases since 1955 - six of those have come since the turn of the century.
The last time there was a white Christmas, it was 2017 and there were 18 centimetres of snow on the ground, Parent said. It used to be all but a sure thing for Montreal to be under a white blanket on Christmas Day, but that has been less likely in recent years.
"From 1963 to 1984, there was an 83 per cent chance of having a white Christmas, and in the last 20 years, it's a 68 per cent chance. We can see there is a trend, and that is the case throughout the country," he said. "We're seeing less and less snow cover, fewer snow days and that translates to fewer white Christmases." jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder

Parents' camp-outs torpedoed as EMSB moves to online kindergarten registration

Full text: The decades-old tradition of parents camping outside Royal Vale School mid-winter to obtain a coveted kindergarten spot for their child has been assigned to the scrap heap.
Royal Vale and four other elementary schools where parents have caught the sleepover bug, or queue up extremely early, is part of a pilot project that will give parents the opportunity to book a registration appointment online.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the English Montreal School Board to come up with a new registration plan because it's unsafe to have parents chatting around a campfire, toasting marshmallows.
"It's the end of an era," Royal Vale's principal, Mauro Zampini, said on a bitterly cold Tuesday morning.
"We need to progress and move with the times. Not everybody had the opportunity to spend three days outside and have babysitters for their kids."
The online registration plan was presented to Royal Vale's governing board this month and parents agreed it was time to make a change.
"Obviously, no one wants to be (sleeping) outside in the winter, especially given the COVID-19 situation," he said.
The other primary schools participating are: Merton in Côte-St-Luc, Edinburgh in Montreal West, Gardenview in St-Laurent and East Hill in Rivière-des-Prairies.
Parents can try to obtain an appointment to register starting Jan. 25 at 7 a.m. on the board's website They will have to enter their names, address and their child's name.
Applications will be time-stamped and school officials will phone successful applicants a few days later with a designated appointment time to register their child the following Monday.
Kindergarten registration takes place from Feb. 1 to 5 at all other EMSB schools.
The EMSB will install billboards on highways close to the schools to remind parents of the new procedure.
Parents have been queuing at Royal Vale School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for more than 40 years, drawn by a strong math and science program and popular after-school programs, such as a Jewish heritage class.
Royal Vale draws students from across Montreal because it doesn't have school boundaries.
Over the years, parents shivered in the snow and freezing rain or idled in their cars to ensure their children would get a spot in the school's French-immersion kindergarten classes.
More recently, the camp-outs have become more festive and technology has allowed football fans to stream the Super Bowl on Sunday night. Alumni would often turn up with hot chocolate and snacks to cheer them on and friendships were formed.
But some single parents argued that the system was unfair because they were unable to stay overnight or had to work on weekends. In the early years, parents hired teenagers to reserve their place in the line.
Board spokesperson Michael Cohen, who has worked at the EMSB for 22 years, said every year he would be inundated with phone calls from journalists asking when the board was going to change the registration procedure so parents wouldn't have to spend the weekend sleeping outdoors.
"The last few years, the calls started getting earlier and earlier, as soon as Friday," he said.
Every year, Cohen and his brother attend the Montreal Canadiens game on Super Bowl Sunday.
"Some years, I could barely watch the game because I was getting so many calls," he recalled.
The school board never felt the need to change the registration setup before the pandemic because Royal Vale parents were not lobbying for changes, said board chairperson Joe Ortona.
"This initiative was always parent driven and they policed their own sign-up list," he said. "At a time we are discouraging social gatherings, I do not believe it would be prudent to have parents spending the weekend together in close quarters."

Full text: The decades-old tradition of parents camping outside Royal Vale School mid-winter to obtain a coveted kindergarten spot for their child has been assigned to the scrap heap.
Royal Vale and four other elementary schools where parents have caught the sleepover bug, or queue up extremely early, is part of a pilot project that will give parents the opportunity to book a registration appointment online.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the English Montreal School Board to come up with a new registration plan because it's unsafe to have parents chatting around a campfire, toasting marshmallows.
"It's the end of an era," Royal Vale's principal, Mauro Zampini, said on a bitterly cold Tuesday morning.
"We need to progress and move with the times. Not everybody had the opportunity to spend three days outside and have babysitters for their kids."
The online registration plan was presented to Royal Vale's governing board this month and parents agreed it was time to make a change.
"Obviously, no one wants to be (sleeping) outside in the winter, especially given the COVID-19 situation," he said.
The other primary schools participating are: Merton in Côte-St-Luc, Edinburgh in Montreal West, Gardenview in St-Laurent and East Hill in Rivière-des-Prairies.
Parents can try to obtain an appointment to register starting Jan. 25 at 7 a.m. on the board's website They will have to enter their names, address and their child's name.
Applications will be time-stamped and school officials will phone successful applicants a few days later with a designated appointment time to register their child the following Monday.
Kindergarten registration takes place from Feb. 1 to 5 at all other EMSB schools.
The EMSB will install billboards on highways close to the schools to remind parents of the new procedure.

Winter cycling gaining popularity in Quebec

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/winter-cycling-gaining-popularity-quebec/docview/2466046223/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It appears that cycling could grow into a four-season activity in Quebec.
Magali Bebronne of Vélo Québec says workshops on winter cycling are growing in number and there is "enormous" demand for the information they provide, including winter cycling techniques and tips on how to dress and plan your route.
Bebronne attributes that popularity to Montreal's decision to maintain most of its bicycle path network 12 months a year. The city clears about 76 per cent of the network during the winter months, she notes, adding that the year-round availability of the recently inaugurated 184-kilometre Réseau Express Vélo (REV) will also lure riders who have until now been hesitant to ride in winter.
And Bebronne defends the decision to clear bike paths in winter, noting that no one seems to complain when the city removes snow from alleyways or little travelled streets.
"Times have changed," she said. "Traffic is an issue and at a time when there's no organized sports, at least getting out (by bicycle) allows you some physical activity."
Nor is winter cycling only catching on in Montreal. Fabien Burnotte, co-founder of the Vélo Urbain Sherbrooke Facebook group, says the ranks of winter cyclers are growing in his Eastern Townships city.
Burnotte remembers when he used to be perceived as an oddity while taking his child to daycare by bicycle.
"But now it's become normal," he said.
But he adds that while things have improved when it comes to sharing the road with cars and other vehicles, the situation remains far from easy.
"Used to be a truck would barely miss me at least once a week, now I'd say it's more like once a month, which is four times less," he joked grimly, adding that it's a shame that not all local bike paths are plowed during the winter.
City authorities in Sherbrooke acknowledge "there's still work to do" but add the will to change things is there, noting the city's "active" transportation plan, which includes provisions for walking and cycling along with motorized traffic, is proof of that.
Winter cycling popularity has also been helped by the advent of the "fat bike," so named because of its oversized tires.
Bebronne says there are more than 90 "fat bike" networks in Quebec despite the fact the bicycles were little known five years ago.
Over time, techniques have been developed to maintain the trail surfaces.
"With weather conditions more difficult or unpredictable, this sport provides a good alternative when you can't go cross-country skiing because of freezing rain," she said.
This report was prepared as part of the Facebook and Canadian Press News Scholarship Program.

Full text: Montreal will get five to seven centimetres of snow starting Sunday at 6 p.m. the Environment Canada weather office says. But the white stuff probably won't stick around, since rain is expected Monday.
Sunday's snowfall will amount to close to five centimetres on the South Shore, and between five and 10 centimetres north of Montreal, said meteorologist Maxime Perron.
"This is pretty normal for this time of year," said Perron, who noted that the first major snowfall usually arrives in mid- to late November.
"We're right in the climatological normal," he said.
Temperatures will hover around zero overnight in Montreal, when the snow will turn to freezing rain or rain.
Monday's forecast calls for rain ending early in the afternoon, with a high of plus 4, falling to 2 in the afternoon.
The recent weeks saw an unusually warm spell, but the trend is back to normal temperatures now, so we're not likely to see another stretch of warm weather before winter sets in, Perron said.
According to the long-term outlook for the coming winter, there's a 55-per-cent chance Montreal will have slightly warmer temperatures than usual, with a normal amount of precipitation, he said. To calculate that outlook, weather experts look at global patterns to come up with a statistical probability. However, the results are far from certain.
"It's slightly better than a coin toss," Perron said.

Full text: On the night of Dec. 31, as we joyfully rang in the New Year, we never dreamed we would be shaking our heads in disbelief at how our world has changed. COVID-19 has given us time to reflect, re-prioritize and reminisce about life as we knew it. We are developing a keener appreciation for the things we take for granted, reconsidering what is most important in our lives and recalling a time when the situation we are currently facing would have been unimaginable.
These events would have been part of some apocalyptic movie playing at our local theatre. Our eyes would have been riveted to the screen while we munched on popcorn. But this isn't a movie, and so we try to find reassurance and comfort in those things that give us some sense of normalcy. For practising Christians worldwide, that reassurance is Easter.
COVID-19 has disrupted people's livelihoods and children's education, and impacted such milestone events as graduations, school proms, weddings, birthdays, and sadly, even funerals. This year, Easter seems all but forgotten.
The realization that Lent and Easter would not be "traditionally" celebrated has been a difficult one. The pandemic hit the Christian community in the middle of Lent. This 40-day season, which encourages prayer, introspection, charitable giving and fasting, does not require social contact, but Palm Sunday proved a challenge.
Our parish placed a table in the church parking lot for the distribution of palm leaves and prayer literature on Sunday morning. Parishioners were invited to drive by and pick up their palm leaves, sparking curiosity among morning joggers, dog walkers and neighbours. My husband, the church pastor, and I conversed with several people, including those of different faiths, all the while maintaining a safe distance.
The observance of Holy Week and the Good Friday Walk of Faith in Dollard-des-Ormeaux was modified so that through the miracle of modern technology, Christians could still experience some of these events in a unique and meaningful way. Maundy Thursday (the day before Good Friday), which has always included a service and potluck supper with a neighbouring church, was cancelled. This year's Walk of Faith took the form of recorded Bible readings and prayers. Others ventured outdoors for a solitary journey in quiet contemplation.
But we missed the solemnity of the group procession, the act of gathering in recognition of Good Friday, and the camaraderie among the walkers. Rain or shine, walkers of all ages and abilities would wind their way along the designated route, symbolically following in Jesus's footsteps.
Easter is the highlight of the church calendar, more significant than Christmas as the story of the resurrection embodies the crux of the Christian faith. The jubilant hymns and joyful atmosphere of the Easter service will be muted. Those of Ukrainian origin, like myself, may busy themselves with baking paska (Easter bread) or creating decorative pysanky (Easter eggs). Easter dinner can still be enjoyed within households, while others may share their Easter meal online, freezing leftovers for a later date. Now would be the time to try new recipes, bake a gorgeous Easter cake, or deliver leftovers to the doorsteps of family members and the elderly isolated at home.
The challenge that all people of faith are facing at this time is the inability to gather and exchange such meaningful gestures as handshakes, embraces or an encouraging pat on the back. This is part of being human. Perhaps this Easter gives us more reason than ever to put aside our differences and view others with compassion and caring, following the example of Jesus.
I encourage Christians to celebrate Easter however they can, respecting social distancing. Have a safe and happy Easter!

Full text: Friday the 13th dawned chilly and damp in Montreal as drizzle gave way to a rainfall warning by 8 a.m.
Environment Canada said the Montreal, Châteauguay, Longueuil and Laval areas could see 25 to 40 millimetres of rain over the course of the day and warned that a combination of rain and mild temperatures could speed up snow melt: "Localized flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) in low-lying areas is possible."
Rain, at times heavy, is expected to continue till around 6 p.m. This evening, showers could turn to flurries as the temperature dips to around 1 degree Celsius.
Saturday, expect some sun with a high around 4 C and temperatures around freezing on Sunday. It's forecast to be around minus-11 C overnight Saturday and Sunday.
There are six more days until spring( https://montrealgazette.com/life/qa-fred-la-marmotte-on-love-rivalry-and-the-burden-of-groundhog-day ).

Business group fears employers not prepared to deal with coronavirus

Full text: The head of a group of chambers of commerce is sounding the alarm, saying many Quebec businesses aren't adequately prepared to deal with the coronavirus.
"It worries us that a large number of Quebec companies don't have adequate human resources policies to support their employees in this particular context," Charles Milliard, president and director general of the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec, said in a statement Tuesday.
Millard said infected employees or workers going into quarantine for possible exposure to the virus while the province is already experiencing a labour shortage could have a double-whammy effect on businesses in the province.
He said he is also worried about the supply chain, as goods from China have become more difficult to acquire since the coronavirus outbreak.
The province's largest employer's group shares that concern, saying the worldwide spread of the virus could make it difficult on operations and on the ability of Quebec businesses to fill orders.
However, so far there seems to be no need to panic about employee shortages because of the virus.
"We have no particular cases (of infected employees) in the 70,000 businesses that we represent," said Karolyne Gagnon, vice-president of labour and legal affairs for the Conseil du patronat du Québec.
"But we're telling employers to sensitize employees about proper hygiene and about the need to stay home if they have symptoms."
She said she believes most businesses already have plans to allow employees to work from home, whether to mitigate the effects of other health scares (like the H1N1 flu) or to alleviate traffic congestion caused by major construction projects like the Turcot Interchange or the Réseau express métropolitain, which will force the closure of the Mount Royal tunnel at the end of the month.
At Hydro-Québec, one of the province's largest employers, there are currently no cases of employees who have been quarantined and are working from home, said spokesperson Cendrix Bouchard.
"We've been monitoring the situation daily," Bouchard said. "There are no business trips in China right now. If there were any, they would be cancelled, and we are evaluating each trip on a case-by-case basis.
"If employees want to travel for personal reasons and they want to visit an affected area, upon their return we ask them to follow Health Canada's guidelines" to self-monitor for 14 days and self-quarantine if they show symptoms of the virus.
Bouchard said because Hydro-Québec provides an essential service, all department managers must have backup plans in place to cover a worst-case scenario.
"But that's something we'll do with other situations, like for freezing rain episodes or the spring thaw," he said.
For the moment, Bouchard said, other factors could affect Hydro-Québec's employees more severely than the coronavirus, like the coming closure of the Deux-Montagnes tunnel, which is expected to affect the commutes of 2,200 office employees out of roughly 9,000 who work on the island of Montreal, nearly 25 per cent of its workforce.
Among other large employers, the National Bank has several employees working from home as a preventive measure, said spokesperson Claude Breton.
At Air Canada, spokesperson Pascale Déry said the Montreal-based company is following the guidance of "relevant health authorities to ensure the safety of both employees and passengers." jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder Facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Brownstein: City spokesperson Sabourin finds bliss in 'winter wonderland'

Full text: Why is this man always smiling?
He spends much of his days and nights often getting peppered by the press about slow snow removal and slippery streets and sidewalks sometimes perceived to be less pristine than bike paths. Not to mention criticism about rampant street construction, broken water pipes, mobility or lack thereof, recycling, composting and, natch, the ever-ongoing Mountain road imbroglio.
Such is the life of city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin. He is on the front line - some might even say the firing line - in seeking to explain city-hall decisions that some find confounding.
Sabourin awakes around 4:30 a.m. to see what's up or down in the city. He can often be heard on radio at 6 a.m. and then on the tube throughout the day. He can be counted on to send text messages to media up until late at night. In short, he's always available.
This is a job that could give most ulcers. Not Sabourin. He relishes it all. He's not just a glass-half-full fellow - his mug overflows. I suspect he may even whistle while he works.
"There's no stress here for me. I honestly love what I do, and so I remain positive all the time," says the ever-affable Sabourin, 47, who became the city's spokesperson three years ago.
"I'm confident because I feel I have the information to understand the situation and make citizens more aware of the challenges we face. And they are more willing to accept the situation, even if it's difficult. They understand there's no way we can get rid of two-metre-high snowbanks in just a few days."
The stats appear to support Sabourin's assertion. Despite frequent media outrage over these issues - I plead guilty here( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-montrealers-are-slip-slidin-away-on-icy-sidewalks ) - citizen complaints have dropped. Between Nov. 1 and Feb. 10, the city received 397 from the 19 boroughs. That's down considerably from last year's 707 complaints over the same period.
Sabourin is taking me and Montreal Gazette photographer Allen McInnis on a drive through the city to check out key operational posts on the snow-battle front.
Since Feb. 6, Montreal has received about 60 centimetres of snow and, as of Sunday, the cleanup was 95 per cent completed. Sabourin estimates the job will be finished by Monday - unless another storm strikes.
But even on a relatively calm day, Sabourin is having to deal with complaints from LaSalle residents about unplowed sidewalks and from irate city motorists who've been issued tickets on streets after they've been cleaned, but with the No Parking signs still erroneously in place.
In the first instance, the problem relates to massive amounts of snow removed from homes and driveways, thus requiring heavier artillery to clear sidewalks. And while sympathetic to the plight of wrongly ticketed motorists, Sabourin notes this is more a police issue.
Then there's the reality of some boroughs being faster than others in removal operations.
"It's like we're running a marathon here. It doesn't always matter who is fastest, but more that we all get to the finish line in good time. Often, we have to work on steeper hills first, as is the case in the Ville-Marie borough. In Île-Bizard, it's fast, because they don't have to transport the snow. They can blow it on the side. But in Côte-des-Neiges, they have to load the snow at night, because there's so much traffic during the day and they're so far away from the land dump sites.
"What has to be considered is the geographic situation of each borough in relation to the dump sites and the density of the population. Each borough has to figure out the best strategy."
Sabourin disputes a conspiracy theory about bike paths receiving priority treatment.
"The point is we use different tools and machinery for the streets, sidewalks and bike paths. They all start working around the same time but there's certainly no bike-path priority. We try to do sidewalks first to ensure pedestrian safety. We realize it's not perfect, but we are trying."
The city is a network of 10,000 kilometres, 6,000 of which are sidewalks and only 700 of which are bike paths.
"That's the equivalent of the distance between Montreal and James Bay," Sabourin says. "That's our challenge, and clearing it is like a military operation."
That would make executive committee member and Verdun mayor Jean-François Parenteau the general.
Over 3,000 workers are involved in this operation. The cost is equally enormous, about $1 million per every cleared centimetre of snowfall, according to Sabourin. While we've already received close to the seasonal average of 190 centimetres, only 120 centimetres has had to be cleared away. The rest has melted on its own.
The snow-removal budget this winter is about $180 million, but should we get blasted again, there's still plenty of capacity left to accommodate it at the city's 12 land and 16 sewer dump sites, which together can handle up to 18 million cubic metres of snow.
A contracted dump truck operator unloads into the sewer system at one of the approved sewer dumps in Montreal on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2020. The sewer dump is located under the Jacques Cartier Bridge and feeds in to one of the largest sewers in the city, which transports the melts snow to the water-filtration plant in east-end Montreal.
On the subject of sewer sites, we visit one under the Jacques-Cartier Bridge. During the height of snow-removal operations, 100 trucks an hour, 24/7, drop off their loads here.
Sabourin explains that the sewer sites save a lot of time, especially in the downtown area, where trucks don't have to haul snow at land sites farther away. He also is quick to point out that the dumped snow goes through a water treatment process before being moved into the St-Lawrence River.
"In the old days, the snow, which can contain salt and grease, went straight into the river, without regard to the environment," Sabourin says.
We also visit "command central," a small office in an Old Montreal highrise. Staff here monitors road conditions on 550 closed-circuit cameras throughout the city. Based on their surveillance, they are able to direct crews from affected boroughs to trouble spots. They also control traffic lights, in case of emergencies.
"The worst scenario is freezing rain and ice pellets, especially in hilly areas," Sabourin says.
Adds staffer Alain Dupuis: "We see everything that goes on in the city here, and some of it can be pretty crazy. But the key is not to panic."
That appears to be the prerequisite for a job here.
"I love the snow. It's like a winter wonderland for me here. That explains why I'm so positive," Sabourin says. "There's little more beautiful a sight than watching one of our machines at a land site blowing snow 140 feet in the air at sunrise."
Such a romantic. But surely there must be a downside to the job.
"What's Philippe doing between the tempests? Why, he's dealing with the potholes," Sabourin says with a sigh.

Smiling Sabourin is here to soothe snow-removal fury

Full text: Why is this man always smiling? He spends much of his days and nights often getting peppered by the press about slow snow removal and slippery streets and sidewalks sometimes perceived to be less pristine than bike paths. Not to mention criticism about rampant street construction, broken water pipes, mobility or lack thereof, recycling, composting and, natch, the ever-ongoing Mountain road imbroglio.
Such is the life of city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin. He is on the front line - some might even say the firing line - in seeking to explain city-hall decisions that some find confounding.
Sabourin awakes around 4:30 a.m. to see what's up or down in the city. He can often be heard on radio at 6 a.m. and then on the tube throughout the day. He can be counted on to send text messages to media up until late at night. In short, he's always available.
This is a job that could give most ulcers. Not Sabourin. He relishes it all. He's not just a glass-half-full fellow - his mug overflows. I suspect he may even whistle while he works.
"There's no stress here for me.
I honestly love what I do, and so I remain positive all the time," says the ever-affable Sabourin, 47, who became the city's spokesperson three years ago.
"I'm confident because I feel I have the information to understand the situation and make citizens more aware of the challenges we face. And they are more willing to accept the situation, even if it's difficult.
They understand there's no way we can get rid of two-metre-high snowbanks in just a few days."
The stats appear to support Sabourin's assertion. Despite frequent media outrage over these issues - I plead guilty here - citizen complaints have dropped. Between Nov. 1 and Feb. 10, the city received 397 from the 19 boroughs. That's down considerably from last year's 707 complaints over the same period.
Sabourin is taking me and Montreal Gazette photographer Allen McInnis on a drive through the city to check out key operational posts on the snow-battle front.
Since Feb. 6, Montreal has received about 60 centimetres of snow and, as of Sunday, the cleanup was 95 per cent completed. Sabourin estimates the job will be finished by Monday - unless another storm strikes.
But even on a relatively calm day, Sabourin is having to deal with complaints from LaSalle residents about unplowed sidewalks and from irate city motorists who've been issued tickets on streets after they've been cleaned, but with the No Parking signs still erroneously in place.
In the first instance, the problem relates to massive amounts of snow removed from homes and driveways, thus requiring heavier artillery to clear sidewalks. And while sympathetic to the plight of wrongly ticketed motorists, Sabourin notes this is more a police issue.
Then there's the reality of some boroughs being faster than others in removal operations.
"It's like we're running a marathon here. It doesn't always matter who is fastest, but more that we all get to the finish line in good time. Often, we have to work on steeper hills first, as is the case in the Ville-Marie borough. In Île-Bizard, it's fast, because they don't have to transport the snow. They can blow it on the side. But in Côte-des-Neiges, they have to load the snow at night, because there's so much traffic during the day and they're so far away from the land dump sites.
"What has to be considered is the geographic situation of each borough in relation to the dump sites and the density of the population. Each borough has to figure out the best strategy."
Sabourin disputes a conspiracy theory about bike paths receiving priority treatment.
"The point is we use different tools and machinery for the streets, sidewalks and bike paths. They all start working around the same time but there's certainly no bike-path priority. We try to do sidewalks first to ensure pedestrian safety. We realize it's not perfect, but we are trying."
The city is a network of 10,000 kilometres, 6,000 of which are sidewalks and only 700 of which are bike paths.
"That's the equivalent of the distance between Montreal and James Bay," Sabourin says. "That's our challenge, and clearing it is like a military operation."
That would make executive committee member and Verdun mayor Jean-François Parenteau the general.

A LOVE LETTER TO FEBRUARY: FIRST PERSON

Author: Hudson, Susan

Full text: I love February! The snow, the cold, the slush, the ice, the short days. I love this twilight month - after the festive spikes of Christmas and New Year's, but still far from Easter awakenings. February blahs are an alien concept to me.
After half a lifetime of Februarys, I am still a little surprised when people malign this enchanting midwinter month.
Somehow, we have been taught we are supposed to endure February, to close our eyes and brace for it, wishing it away. We complain, we create holidays such as Valentine's Day, Family Day, even line up for Roll up the Rim to Win contests to help us forget this neat, even month of just 28 days. And what other month gets a bonus day every four years? Instead of regarding it as a race to the other side, there are benefits to cozying up to February, an opportunity to indulge in a little introspection, permission to shelter and actively wait, to contemplate - good and bad - whatever the world drops at your frozen doorstep.
Similar to a long postponed walk in the woods, February-bathing can be an opportunity to shed distraction and absorb insights. If we choose, it gives us permission to pause, travel inward and connect with what is natural, still and unaffected. Considered thoughts are conducive to crystallization in February. No other month offers the same cauldron and ingredients. Even if you are at a stage of life where there is never enough time, February can prompt us to reflect ever so briefly and gratefully on our shelter, and ability to cope with icy blasts and thaws alike.
Perhaps it is different for me because my birthday falls in February. Not that I grew up with much of a fuss over my birthday, but still, this is my corner of the calendar. It's not uncommon to see horizontal freezing rain on my birthday, and this is somehow exhilarating to me. Perhaps I don't have enough drama in my life, but February continually reminds me to look for the exceptional in each new day.
My youngest son is experiencing his first February away from home. Having just turned 18, he is making his transition to adulthood studying in Montreal. The cold Quebec winter is challenging his usual inclination to wear running shoes and merely place bare hands in pockets to get around.
He tells me he found a great scarf in a second-hand store for $2 and it's wool! Severe cold is teaching him lessons I never could.
I turned 18 in another time and place. I decided to spend six months in France as an au pair. I did not go through an agency, which was in retrospect a mistake, but found a family through the friendof-a-friend network. I was placed with a family who had a five-year-old girl in the south of France outside of Marseilles. This sparkling, exotic adventure was a big leap, but I was ready.
This idyllic situation in an otherwise warm, glamorous part of the world was anything but. The home was isolated, my employer was away from home for 10-day stretches at a time. Her husband was unhappy with the situation, often sullen and worked long hours. Their daughter, my charge, deeply resented that I was not her mother. Rather rapidly after my arrival, their housekeeper was let go and I was told I was also responsible for cleaning the house. To top it off, I was there to learn French, but told I had to speak English to their daughter so she could learn my language.
The few days the mother was home in a month, it was made embarrassingly clear to me that I was supposed to disappear. I took many long walks to the local village and back, but lacked the imagination, courage and language skills to venture much further.
After about five weeks, my 18th birthday rolled around. Nobody in France knew or cared that it was my special day. There were no digital connections back home, no e-mail, Facebook or texting, which we take for granted today. Even long-distance phone calls were seen as extravagant, so it seemed as though the whole world had forgotten me. I was utterly alone with a recalcitrant five year old. I knew enough not to blame her, but my patience was often tested.
That day, despite the unusual chill in the air, I decided to take my equally lonely little charge out to play in the garden. I succumbed to a crashing wave of self-pity standing there in the cold, missing home, feeling profoundly sorry for myself when suddenly I felt it. Could it be? There it is again. A snowflake! And another snowflake. It's snowing! In the south of France! These beautiful snowflakes fell freely and plentifully from the sky like tiny bits of home, and they were all for me.
Hope replaced despair and in an instant that day I grew up.
February is a gift. Wish it away and its subtle wisdom is lost. Embrace it and it might just become your favourite month.

The snow is expected to start falling over southern Quebec Thursday morning and may change to freezing rain in the southern edge of the province Thursday evening before reverting to snow on Friday.
While the statement notes that snowfall accumulation may vary from one region to another, it adds that it "may exceed 15 centimetres over most areas."
As is usual with special weather statements issued by the federal agency, Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ) cautions that "this scenario could change by the time the system arrives, given the uncertainty of its track."

Full text: Re: "Lure passengers with better service" (Letters, Jan. 23) It is time that public investment brought transport into the 21st century to alleviate the use of cars.
While letter-writer Raymond Graham lives in the West Island, I'm in Rivière-des-Prairies in the east end. As an avid Concordia Stingers supporter, I travel frequently from home to the Loyola campus in N.D.G. from September to March. The trip takes at least one hour and 45 minutes each way with the use of a bus, the métro and another bus.
It seems to me that the coming REM light-rail network is good for commuters in the West Island and north and south shores, but what about the east end of the island? Mayor Valérie Plante's proposed Pink Line is a good solution, but she makes the mistake of stopping it in Montreal North. It should continue at least to the west end of R.D.P.
Then again, the powers in Quebec City might be more agreeable if this line went farther to off-island communities to the east, such as Repentigny.
Then they could muster even more votes from those ridings.
Mind you, they seem to be focused on a tramway that would go from Pointeaux-Trembles to downtown - something I cannot wrap my head around given the freezing rain and increasingly erratic weather we've been seeing. Jim Cartier, Rivière-des-Prairies

A weekend of meteorological possibilities is coming our way

Full text: Environment Canada on Friday issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area that, at the moment, forecasts a weekend of meteorological possibilities.
The statement, issued at 5:20 a.m., notes that a low-pressure system from the American Midwest will affect southwestern Quebec beginning Saturday evening. Describing the system as containing a "mixed bag of precipitation," the statement predicts that the precipitation will spread eventually toward eastern Quebec.
"Although precipitation is expected to begin as snow, it is highly possible that it changes to freezing rain over areas near the St. Lawrence River and even rain over areas further south," the statement says. "Total snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system evolves, but they could exceed 15 centimetres over areas north of the St. Lawrence River. Additionally, expected rainfall amounts should reach between 10 and 15 millimetres, at this time."
The statement warns also that travel could be difficult, but cautions "at this time, computer model guidance still shows significant variability regarding the system's track. Consequently, there is much uncertainty and the scenario could still change significantly."

Full text: Environment Canada has lifted a special weather statement issued Wednesday morning for the Montreal area and that had forecast 15 centimetres of snow that could coincide with the Thursday morning rush hour.
While the statement originally warned that driving conditions "could be hazardous during morning rush hour Thursday in Montreal and its suburbs," an amended forecast now calls for 4 to 8 centimetres to fall over the area over next 24 hours with high of 0 Celsius on Wednesday and of -3 on Thursday.

Full text: Environment Canada has lifted a special weather statement issued Wednesday morning for the Montreal area and that had forecast 15 centimetres of snow that could coincide with the Thursday morning rush hour.
While the statement originally warned that driving conditions "could be hazardous during morning rush hour Thursday in Montreal and its suburbs," an amended forecast now calls for 4 to 8 centimetres to fall over the area over next 24 hours with high of 0 Celsius on Wednesday and of -3 on Thursday.

Monday's Quake A Wake-Up Call

Full text: Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature.
Mercifully, the freezing rainstorm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast, though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers.
On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Montreal actually sits on a continental "weak spot," explained Christie Rowe, a professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University and the Canada Research Chair in Earthquake Geology, making it prone to seismic activity.
"The St. Lawrence lies in a very old fault zone. It's pretty wide. It goes from the Laurentians basically down to the U.S. border. And the fault formed when the Atlantic Ocean was opening, so hundreds of millions of years ago," she said. "But faults in continents never fully heal. So it's always this weak spot."
The last "Big One" to rattle the area occurred in 1732, said Rowe, but predicting the next one is notoriously difficult.
"We don't understand the timing of earthquakes when they're not on a plate boundary," she said. "They're totally unpredictable. We know looking back in history that there've been a few since Europeans arrived. That could mean we have one tomorrow, it could mean we don't have another one for 500 years."
The rarity and lack of certainty around their timing may make the risk easy to ignore compared to more imminent threats like spring floods or blizzards, but even a moderate earthquake could be incredibly damaging in Montreal.
"I can only imagine what would happen to the Olympic Stadium," Rowe said. "We're not built for this type of risk."
In 2013, the Insurance Bureau of Canada released an eye-opening and sobering study examining earthquake risk in the two seismically volatile regions that are home to 40 per cent of the population.
It estimated that a 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami in British Columbia could cause as much as $75 billion in damages. Meanwhile a major convulsion of magnitude 7.1 along the St. Lawrence fault line could cause losses in excess of $60 billion, while crippling the economy.
The IBC research outlined the dual threats in financial terms. Journalist Kathryn Schulz chronicled the humanitarian and civilizational toll, if - or likely, when - the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Pacific coast gives way. The piece, published in the New Yorker, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.
At once understated in tone and alarming in effect, the article might have jolted cities on the West Coast into action and prompted people in the Cascadia danger zone to stock up on First Aid kits.
Montrealers may know how to confront the ravages of an Ice Storm after shivering through 1998. And we are commemorating the devastation of the quake that hit Haiti 10 years ago, given Montreal's close ties to that country. Yet it seems there is little awareness about what to do if the ground starts trembling here.
"We 100 per cent don't take it seriously enough," said Rowe, who grew up in California, where readiness is second nature.
"The immediate risks during the shaking and then during any aftershocks, would be from falling objects and that could be part of the building, it could be windows breaking. So if you start to feel shaking, get under a heavy table or desk so that falling objects won't hit you," she advised. "If people do feel an earthquake in the city, if they're in a modern building that has steel stairwells, those are some of the safest parts of modern buildings. And just stay away from the frontage of any building, stones could be falling."
Rowe suggested holding earthquake drills in Montreal that include schools, public authorities, willing businesses and ordinary citizens. She also invited those who experienced Monday's seismic event to go to Did You Feel It? on Earthquakes Canada's website (earthquakescanada. nrcan.gc.ca) and share their observations to help scientists like herself gather data.
"I'd like the community to know that there are researchers who are working on this and we are trying to better our understanding of it with the hopes of making us safer," she said.
Freezing rain may be a frequent peril for Montrealers, but the latest tremor should be a wake-up call. ahanes@postmedia.com

Senators still competitive but losses are mounting; Spirits remain high in Ottawa despite woes, rebuilding team will be in good spot for draft

Full text: It's a weird dynamic, the fine art of losing competitively.
The Ottawa Senators haven't won a game since before Christmas. Only the Detroit Red Wings have a worse record.
During their current season-high seven-game losing streak, they've been defeated by the Red Wings, by the New Jersey Devils (last in the Metropolitan Division), and on Saturday, by the Montreal Canadiens, who ended their own eight-game slide in the process.
For all that, there's little despair over all the games that have slipped away.
Senators coach D.J. Smith suggests there has been no loss of energy or enthusiasm despite the long run of losses.
"I don't think anyone is thinking that way," he said. "We're playing way better defensively. The last two nights (against Detroit and Montreal) easily we could have won, so I think our guys are playing well."
Even a player with as competitive a spirit as winger Brady Tkachuk - he led all players in the 2-1 overtime loss to Montreal in shots (six) and hits (six) - wasn't in any mood to kick garbage cans around the dressing room or beat himself up about the many lost opportunities against the Canadiens.
"You can take the good out of the games that you know you played well in," Tkachuk said. "And some of that, we can learn from. We're right there. We've had a bunch of overtime games. It's just a matter of time (before) things are going to turn around."
Never lose sight of the big picture, though. While the players on the ice are doing whatever they can to win and secure their positions in the NHL, either here or somewhere else, making the playoffs isn't part of the conversation.
More and more, the final 37 games will be about giving younger players a bigger taste while general manager Pierre Dorion entertains offers for veterans in advance of the Feb. 24 trade deadline.
Accordingly, goalie Marcus Hogberg has played in consecutive games, a test run for what will likely see him sharing time with the injured Anders Nilsson next season.
Prospects Drake Batherson and Filip Chlapik are now seeing significant minutes with the goal of making them better players tomorrow. Batherson scored the Senators'only goal against the Canadiens, but he also says he needs to learn from how he handled the play leading up to Ilya Kovalchuk's game-winning goal in the extra frame.
The on-the-job training means losses will likely continue to pile up in the short term, but there are potentially enormous fringe benefits from finishing at or near the bottom.
It's no grand organizational secret that the more the Senators lose, the more they win when it comes to the 2020 NHL draft lottery.
Entering Sunday's games, the Senators owned a 16-per-cent chance of securing Canadian world junior championship star Alexis Lafreniere by winning the draft lottery.
They effectively have two shots at him - with their own pick and the one they secured from the San Jose Sharks in the trade of former captain Erik Karlsson. The Sharks could still make a late run at the post-season, meaning their first round draft pick won't be subject to the lottery, but that's highly unlikely.
In a best-case scenario, the Senators could have two Top 5 choices in June.
That hope could all serve as a welcome starting point for incoming CEO Jim Little in his difficult challenge to sell optimism to the community.
Previous management salesmen Tom Anselmi and Nic Ruszkowski didn't last long after failing to bring back the fans and businesses who have disappeared out of frustration with the uncertainty of the organization under owner Eugene Melnyk.
That has resulted in Canadian Tire Centre being half empty on most nights this season as the Senators trail the league in attendance.
A notable exception came Saturday, when a flood of Canadiens fans came in droves, happily enduring the freezing rain and ice pellets before and after filling the empty seats to cheer on their team. Kovalchuk and goaltender Carey Price left the building to loud applause following the game.
The energy in the building had Smith dreaming about what could be.
"You can feel there's something special when you're playing them and the rivalry," he said.
"Over time, as we build this young team, I think you're going to hear more chants for our guys than you're going to hear for theirs." kwarren@postmedia.com Twitter.com/Citizenkwarren

Full text: MONTREAL About 125,000 Hydro-Québec customers are without power after freezing rain and strong winds sent tree branches crashing onto power lines and caused havoc on the roads.
The largest number of affected customers are in the Montérégie region southeast of Montreal, where about 113 outages have left almost 105,000 people in the dark as of 11 a.m. Sunday.
Environment Canada issued snowfall and winter storm watches for much of the south and east of the province, from the Laurentians north of Montreal to the tip of Gaspésie. Meteorologist Simon Legault says between 15 and 25 centimetres of snow had already fallen on the Quebec City region on Sunday morning, with another 15 or so expected to come.
Blowing snow and difficult driving conditions led to several roads being shut down, including Highway 20, which was closed in both directions between Lévis and Montmagny southeast of Quebec City. THE CANADIAN PRESS

Full text: Transport Quebec is warning motorists that infrastructure work will see road closures imposed in the areas of the Turcot and Angrignon interchanges.
However, provincial authorities warn also that any and all construction could be postponed in case of poor weather, a distinct possibility given the weather cocktail expected to descend on Montreal Saturday and Sunday.
The following closures are planned to be in effect from 11:59 p.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Monday:
? Eastbound Highway 720 between the Turcot Interchange and the access ramp for de la Cathédrale St. and Notre-Dame St. W.
? The ramp from westbound Highway 20 for Exit 65 for Route 138 E. /Angrignon Blvd. /St-Jacques St.
? Access to eastbound Highway 20 from Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Blvd.
If those road closures do not deter you from weekend travel on local roads, just remember that the condition of those roads are expected to be subject to rapid and perhaps treacherous change over the weekend.
Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a "significant" amount of precipitation - 20 to 35 millimetres of rainfall and melting snow on Saturday, and 15-30 millimetres of freezing rain on Saturday evening and Sunday, with wind gusts of 60-70 km/h on Sunday.

Teens hit up SQDC in search of 'quality weed' before age limit changes

Full text: Lily Kisilevich and her two best friends travelled to Montreal from Toronto over the holidays to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city - and also to buy pot.
Kisilevich, Meaghan Smith and Rylee Restoule are all 18, and in Ontario, the legal age to consume cannabis is 19.
So on Monday, despite a nasty weather cocktail of freezing rain and sleet, the trio waited patiently in a long line outside the Société québécoise du cannabis( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cannabis-sqdc-to-open-a-pointe-claire-location-by- end -of-march ) (SQDC) store on Ste-Catherine St.
They were eager to purchase Purple Berry, Shark Shock and the store's other brands. Still, Kisilevich was peeved about one thing: on Jan. 1, Quebec's new pot-smoking age of 21 takes effect.
In a legal twist of fate, Quebec will go from having the lowest minimum age to use cannabis in the country (along with Alberta, which is maintaining the age threshold of 18) to having the highest minimum age. And that means that for the time being, Kisilevich won't be able to buy legal weed anymore - either in Ontario or Quebec.
"It's not fair," Kisilevich said. "The drinking age will stay the same in Quebec at 18, but you'll have to be 21 to buy pot legally. It's not consistent.
"It's like they're asking you to choose between your liver or your lungs," Kisilevich added, as her friends nodded in agreement.
A moment later, and the security guard at the door asked the three to show their ID. They flashed their cards in an instant, shuffling excitedly into the store.
Quebec's junior health minister, Lionel Carmant, has noted that the province now has the strictest cannabis law in the country. In addition to the highest minimum age, Quebec has legislated the lowest home-storage limit of cannabis of any province, at 150 grams. Most other provinces have not imposed limits.
Carmant has defended the decision to raise the legal age( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/as-of-jan-1-2020-quebecers-will-need-to-be-21-to-consume-cannabis ), arguing that it's a matter of public health and keeping cannabis out of the hands of youth. He cited a study by Université de Montréal researchers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/even-infrequent-cannabis-use-by-teens-can-impair-learning-skills-study ) that found that cannabis use by teenagers - even infrequent use - can adversely affect the skills necessary to succeed in school.
But most cannabis consumers interviewed outside the downtown SQDC outlet argued just the opposite, that the new age requirement will drive some 18-year-olds to buy pot that could be laced with LSD, cocaine and even heroin.
"The stuff here, you know it's safe," said 18-year-old Kevin Harder, who drove up to Montreal with his friends from Albany, N.Y., on Monday just to buy what he called "quality weed" from the SQDC.
"It's really not a harmful drug," Harder said of marijuana. "But by raising the legal age to 21, some people are going to buy weed off the streets and you don't know what's in it."
Harder and his buddies had already rented an Airbnb nearby and were keen to buy some marijuana edibles at the start of a short trip to celebrate New Year's Eve in Montreal.
But Harder vowed that he won't return to Montreal next year after learning of the new minimum age.
"Your city is going to lose a lot of tourists because of this," he said. "You're going to lose a lot of tax revenue."

In addition to the highest minimum age, Quebec has legislated the lowest home-storage limit of cannabis of any province, at 150 grams. Most other provinces have not imposed limits.
Carmant has defended the decision to raise the legal age( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/as-of-jan-1-2020-quebecers-will-need-to-be-21-to-consume-cannabis ), arguing that it's a matter of public health and keeping cannabis out of the hands of youth. He cited a study by Université de Montréal researchers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/even-infrequent-cannabis-use-by-teens-can-impair-learning-skills-study ) that found that cannabis use by teenagers - even infrequent use - can adversely affect the skills necessary to succeed in school.
But most cannabis consumers interviewed outside the downtown SQDC outlet argued just the opposite, that the new age requirement will drive some 18-year-olds to buy pot that could be laced with LSD, cocaine and even heroin.
"The stuff here, you know it's safe," said 18-year-old Kevin Harder, who drove up to Montreal with his friends from Albany, N.Y., on Monday just to buy what he called "quality weed" from the SQDC.
"It's really not a harmful drug," Harder said of marijuana. "But by raising the legal age to 21, some people are going to buy weed off the streets and you don't know what's in it."
Harder and his buddies had already rented an Airbnb nearby and were keen to buy some marijuana edibles at the start of a short trip to celebrate New Year's Eve in Montreal.
But Harder vowed that he won't return to Montreal next year after learning of the new minimum age.
"Your city is going to lose a lot of tourists because of this," he said. "You're going to lose a lot of tax revenue."

Full text: Lily Kisilevich and her two best friends travelled to Montreal from Toronto over the holidays to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city - and also to buy pot.
Kisilevich, Meaghan Smith and Rylee Restoule are all 18, and in Ontario, the legal age to consume cannabis is 19.
So on Monday, despite a nasty weather cocktail of freezing rain and sleet, the trio waited patiently in a long line outside the Société québécoise du cannabis (SQDC) store on Ste-Catherine St.
They were eager to purchase Purple Berry, Shark Shock and the store's other brands. Still, Kisilevich was peeved about one thing: on Jan. 1, Quebec's new pot-smoking age of 21 takes effect.
In a legal twist of fate, Quebec will go from having the lowest minimum age to use cannabis in the country (along with Alberta, which is maintaining the age threshold of 18) to having the highest minimum age. And that means that for the time being, Kisilevich won't be able to buy legal weed anymore - either in Ontario or Quebec.
"It's not fair," Kisilevich said.
"The drinking age will stay the same in Quebec at 18, but you'll have to be 21 to buy pot legally. It's not consistent.
"It's like they're asking you to choose between your liver or your lungs," Kisilevich added, as her friends nodded in agreement.
A moment later, and the security guard at the door asked the three to show their ID. They flashed their cards in an instant, shuffling excitedly into the store.
Quebec's junior health minister, Lionel Carmant, has noted that the province now has the strictest cannabis law in the country.

Korf: Grand Parc de l'Ouest is Plante's environmentally friendly gift

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante is no Scrooge this holiday season. She is doling out the Christmas goodies right here in the West Island.
This month, the city of Montreal announced it is purchasing 22 hectares of land in the southwest part of Ile-Bizard and three hectares in the Bois-de-l'Ile-Bizard Nature Park, news welcomed by nature enthusiasts and conservationists. Shortly after this jolly piece of news, a second announcement was made regarding the purchase of 140 hectares in the western sector of Pierrefonds-Roxboro.
Add this to the 10 hectares of natural habitat in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue purchased in October and we are getting closer to the realization of the Grand Parc de l'Ouest, which will comprise 3,000 hectares (7,413 acres) of land, of which 1,600 includes existing nature parks in Anse-à-l'Orme, Bois-de-L'Île-Bizard, Bois-de-la-Roche, Cap-St-Jacques, Morgan Arboretum and Rapides-du-Cheval-Blanc.
The Grand Parc de l'Ouest( https://www.realisonsmtl.ca/grandparcouest ), or Great Western Park, comes with bragging rights. It will be the largest municipal park in Canada; eight times larger than New York City's Central Park. Preservation of these habitats will not only protect green space and wildlife, but wetlands also help to mitigate some of the dangers of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/how-lessons-learned-from-2017-flood-helped-spare-pierrefonds-roxboro ) by acting as a kind of absorbent sponge. Whatever the reason behind this project, I for one am thrilled that I will be able to roam through these protected spaces for years to come.

More from Suzanne Korf, Special to the West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/author/suzanne-korf-special-to-the-montreal-gazette )
Cross-country skiing and tobogganing are among the winter activities seen at Cap-St-Jacques Nature Park in Pierrefonds.
One of my favourite winter activities is cross-country skiing at Cap St-Jacques. Last year, the skiing conditions were not ideal as snowfalls were followed by freezing rain. According to weather forecasts, this year doesn't look more promising. Each year there is less and less snow. It is predicted that in 30 years white Christmases( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/dont-expect-too-many-more-white-christmases-in-montreal ) will be a thing of the past.
Maybe I should just stay home and curl up next to a warm fire. I was a bit confused about whether I could still use my fireplace this winter and looked it up online. It appears that in most West Island municipalities, we may continue to use our existing wood burning stoves and fireplaces, thanks to a grandfather clause, although some municipalities prohibit the use of a fireplace as a primary source of heating.
While researching this, however, I learned that a conventional wood stove or fireplace burning( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-wood-burning-ban-starts-oct-1-what-you-need-to-know ) for nine hours emits as many fine particles as a car does in a year, and that these fine particles penetrate deep into the lungs and seep into the bloodstream, with major repercussions on people's health. No pun intended, but it puts a "damper" on the joy of watching the flames of a crackling fire.
If we don't get some snow, I think I will just slap some crampons on my boots, go for a walk in the neighbourhood and enjoy the Christmas lights and decorations. The city of Pointe-Claire did a nice job lighting up Valois Village this year. I can do a bit of shopping and listen to some music during my stroll - maybe Bing Crosby's "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas." Happy holidays!

The Sudbury Wolves star finally hit the ice on Tuesday at Sixteen Mile Sports Complex in Oakville, Ont., after some travel headaches forced him to skip the opening session on Monday evening.
"I was trying to get a plane down here to Pearson (airport)," the 17-year-old said. "(I) listened to music, hoping the plane would take off. There were a couple of people (still at the terminal in Sudbury). A lot of them kept leaving, so it was getting lonely.
"Seven-hour delay, they finally cancelled it."
Rick Waugh, the Wolves'security/safety adviser and a longtime policeman, is Byfield's billet dad. He came to the rescue.
"He texted me when he saw the freezing rain and hail (in the forecast)," Byfield said. "Luckily, I have such great billets. They drove me down here, it took fourand-a-half hours, and I got here around 10:30 p.m.
"You want to get everything going and you're missing the first day. It puts you behind, but I'm here now and really excited."
He has already been on the ice here more than Alexis Lafreniere, his rival for first overall pick in the NHL draft next June at Montreal. There's a chance the Rimouski Oceanic forward and Quebec league leading scorer won't play in the two exhibition games against university all-stars starting Wednesday.
Lafreniere missed the Canada-Russia series last month, too.
"It was a decision by our group," Canadian GM Mark Hunter said. "We believe he needed (time) to regroup and be ready. He played with the team last year, so going forward, we all know he's going to be on the team this year."
Byfield and Lafreniere have not yet discussed the craziness of constant individual rankings and scouting opinions. So far, on most lists, Lafreniere is first and Byfield is second.
"We've just said 'hi'a couple of times," Byfield said. "He's a busy guy, too. It's hard to talk to him (with their schedules), but he seems really nice. I don't think about (the draft) too much. Every year is my draft year, as I always say. I go with that mindset and that no pressure is on me."
Byfield is the youngest player in camp. He's several months younger than Cole Perfetti of the Saginaw Spirit and defenceman Jamie Drysdale of the Erie Otters, the other 2002-born players in the mix.
He's also the biggest forward at six foot four and 215 pounds. His ability to use that frame against older competition will determine his fate this week.
"He's got to play a power forward style, be up and down the ice and finish his checks and play a hard game," Hunter said. "Of course, he's got great stick and puck skills, and he's a big body that can get to the net, which some of the smaller players can have a harder time (with)."
Despite his size, his OHL foes marvel at his ability to elude defensive players.
"In our pre-scouts, it's always try to shut down (No.) 55 (on Sudbury)," Peterborough goaltender Hunter Jones said. "He kind of gets lost in the offensive zone, gets the puck, and it's in the back of the net. He just finds a way.
"He's here for a reason." The younger junior players must, by international hockey rule, wear full protection to cover their face. Byfield stands out even more with his choice.
"I never wore a cage," he said. "I always had the fish bowl (shield). I wore that all through my minor hockey and I'm kind of used to it. It's not too bad. It gets a little foggy and hot in there. I asked (Hockey Canada's equipment team) to throw it on and they were nice enough to get me one."
The idea is to keep wearing it for another month.
Just last January, he watched his old Sudbury teammate Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, the Sabres prospect and OHL MVP, backstop Finland to world junior gold in Vancouver.
"(He) went through it, so I talked to him a bit - but it's kind of hard to understand him when he's talking to you in Finnish," Byfield said with a laugh. "I try to get the best out of him. There's definitely a step (up). It's going to be a learning curve, but I think you take it in stride." It's just one more chance to impress.
"We figure big things the next couple of days (from him)," Hunter said, "and see where it ends."
Hopefully, back at an airport, but waiting for a flight to Europe - not Sudbury. rpyette@postmedia.com Twitter.com/RyanatLFPress

Expect the ghost of polar vortex past in Montreal, weather forecasters say

Full text: The good news is we can expect a "classic Canadian" winter, according to the Weather Network. Whether that's also bad news depends on your perspective.
The meteorological organization says most of Quebec will see temperatures that are slightly below normal through December, January and February. That'll coincide with above-normal precipitation for the southern third of the province.
The Old Farmer's Almanac( https://www.almanac.com/ ) mostly backs up the Weather Network, forecasting the coldest periods during the second halves of December and January and saying the "snowiest periods will be in late November, early and mid-December, mid-January, mid- to late February and late March."
November has warmed us up, so to speak, for this chillier-than-usual winter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/roads-are-slippery-as-montreal-digs-out-from-first-snowstorm-of-season ).
A polar vortex of consistently cold weather will be punctuated with extended periods of extreme cold, the Weather Network said, and "an active storm track will likely bring above-normal snow totals to much of the region, along with a risk for freezing rain at times, especially across southern Ontario and into southern Quebec."
"It's one of those seasons where you're going to need a parka, you're going to need a shovel - and a snowblower," a Weather Network meteorologist said, suggesting it'll be a great season for skating and skiing. "We could see some ice storms mixed in there as well."
If none of this appeals to you, just hold your breath and wait for the January thaw. It might be the only reprieve till sometime after March, since it looks like chances of an early spring are not good.

If you're somewhere north of your middle years and are leaning into the idea that your workouts should reflect your age, consider the 59-year-old Irish marathoner who ran 2:30:15 at the Rotterdam (Netherlands) marathon this past April - a world record for the 55-59 age group, and 2:27:52 at the Frankfurt marathon in October.

Montreal among Quebec municipalities asking parents to delay Halloween

Full text: With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least 19 Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the following cities are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations: Asbestos, Beloeil, Brossard, Chambly, Drummondville, Longueuil, Magog, McMasterville, Mont-St-Hilaire, Varennes,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) St-Amable, St-Bruno, St-Colomban, Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), St-Lambert, Shawinigan, Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ) and Trois-Rivières.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante joined the chorus Wednesday afternoon. "Weather advisory: I invite little and big Montrealers to have Halloween on Friday because of the rain and strong winds announced tomorrow," Plante said via Twitter. It is believed to be the first time Montreal has suggested postponing Halloween.
In Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 millimetres, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
St-Lazare even put out a press release saying Halloween would be celebrated on Oct. 31 on its streets, although it did urge citizens to be more cautious.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Montreal's children have braved inclement weather before.
October 1933, for example, was snowy and frigid in Montreal.
The temperature dipped as low as minus-7 Celsius, and 22 centimetres of snow had fallen by Oct. 25, Environment Canada statistics show.
"Most heavily hit ... were the children who had for weeks been waiting impatiently to go out in their new costumes to celebrate the festival of Hallowe'en," the Montreal Gazette reported in a 1946 article about the winter of 1933.
The children "were forced to make their rounds of neighbours' homes with collars and scarves hiding their faces, and heavy boots covering their feet, (their) mittened hands reaching out for the customary 'charity.'
"And the strangest sight of all was seeing the kids dragging their booty along the streets in sleighs."
Andy Riga of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this story.

"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
St-Lazare even put out a press release saying Halloween would be celebrated on Oct. 31 on its streets, although it did urge citizens to be more cautious.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Montreal's children have braved inclement weather before.
October 1933, for example, was snowy and frigid in Montreal.
The temperature dipped as low as minus-7 Celsius, and 22 centimetres of snow had fallen by Oct. 25, Environment Canada statistics show.
"Most heavily hit ... were the children who had for weeks been waiting impatiently to go out in their new costumes to celebrate the festival of Hallowe'en," the Montreal Gazette reported in a 1946 article about the winter of 1933.
The children "were forced to make their rounds of neighbours'homes with collars and scarves hiding their faces, and heavy boots covering their feet, (their) mittened hands reaching out for the customary 'charity.'"And the strangest sight of all was seeing the kids dragging their booty along the streets in sleighs."

Full text: With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least 19 Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the following cities are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations: Asbestos, Beloeil, Brossard, Chambly, Drummondville, Longueuil, Magog, McMasterville, Mont-St-Hilaire, Varennes,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) St-Amable, St-Bruno, St-Colomban, Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), St-Lambert, Shawinigan, Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ) and Trois-Rivières.

Full text: With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least eight Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the cities of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ), St-Lambert, Mont-St-Hilaire and St-Colomban are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.
Montreal's children have braved inclement weather before.
October 1933, for example, was snowy and frigid in Montreal.
The temperature dipped as low as minus-7 Celsius, and 22 centimetres of snow had fallen by Oct. 25, Environment Canada statistics show.

Full text: With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least eight Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the cities of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ), St-Lambert, Mont-St-Hilaire and St-Colomban are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante joined the chorus. "Weather advisory: I invite little and big Montrealers to have Halloween on Friday because of the rain and strong winds announced tomorrow," Plante said via Twitter. It is believed to be the first time Montreal has suggested postponing Halloween.
In Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 millimetres, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.
The city's children have braved inclement weather before.
October 1933, for example, was snowy and frigid in Montreal.
The temperature dipped as low as minus-7 Celsius, and 22 centimetres of snow had fallen by Oct. 25, Environment Canada statistics show.
"Most heavily hit ... were the children who had for weeks been waiting impatiently to go out in their new costumes to celebrate the festival of Hallowe'en," the Montreal Gazette reported in a 1946 article about the winter of 1933.
The children "were forced to make their rounds of neighbours' homes with collars and scarves hiding their faces, and heavy boots covering their feet, (their) mittened hands reaching out for the customary 'charity.'
"And the strangest sight of all was seeing the kids dragging their booty along the streets in sleighs."

Halloween postponed in Montreal, surrounding areas amid storm forecast: Environment Canada says the 'Trick-or-Treat-Storm' will usher in long-term cold weather for much of the country

Full text: As children across Canada face the grim prospect of trick-or-treating in heavy rain and even snow, some communities have decided to postpone Halloween.
In Quebec, Montreal and suburban towns such as Longueuil and most major towns south of the city, announced Wednesday that Oct. 31 festivities will be pushed to Friday. They followed similar announcements by U.S. officials citing weather-related safety concerns.
The move comes as most of Canada braces for storms. Near-freezing temperatures and flurries are expected in the Prairie provinces on Thursday, and light to moderate rain is expected in most of Atlantic Canada on Thursday evening. Ontario and Quebec face the prospect of the heaviest precipitation in the country - torrential downpours and fierce winds are projected for much of both provinces. Only British Columbia, which is expected to be dry and cloudy, will be spared.
David Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment Canada, said in an interview that Thursday's weather will break records.
"From Windsor [Ont.] to Wabush, [N.L.] this will be known as the Trick-or-Treat Storm," Mr. Phillips said.
It's been a generally mild October across the country, but that will come to a screeching halt Thursday, Mr. Phillips said.
"It's going to be a weather changer," he said, adding that temperatures will likely cool down for the remainder of fall and winter after Thursday's storms.
Environment Canada says the amount of rain could surpass 50 millimetres and winds could reach up to 90 kilometres an hour in the south of Quebec, while significant snow is expected in northwestern and central parts of the province.
Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante tweeted Wednesday that the rain and winds were enough to ask parents and kids to wait one more night.
Among the communities that have postponed the holiday is the Montreal suburb of Sainte-Julie, a municipality of 30,000, which is expecting 40 mm to 50 mm of rain on Thursday.
"It's a security thing," said Julie Martin, the municipality's communications co-ordinator. "It will be a lot of rain, so for the little children in the street it will be dangerous."
Reaction to the announcement has been mostly positive, said Ms. Martin, but not everyone is on board.
"I don't agree with changing the date of an event that has always happened on October 31, no matter the weather conditions," one resident wrote on the municipality's Facebook page. "Families have prepared accordingly to spend Halloween tomorrow together."
Sainte-Julie resident Amy-Lou Lafontaine said in an interview she's "delighted" with the decision.
"Personally, I didn't see us having a great time running from door to door under our umbrellas, soaking wet, with our children in tow," said Ms. Lafontaine, who has two young children.
She said her son, who is three-years-old, has been excited about Halloween for weeks, but that "it will be easy for us to explain to him that we'll be going out on Friday instead due to the weather conditions."
For Mr. Phillips, moving Halloween in Sainte-Julie was the right call.
"My stance is that if you have that power, and you're thinking of kids' safety, then this might be a good one to postpone."

Full text: Children preparing for Halloween in northwestern and central Quebec hopefully have costumes that work over or under a snowsuit. Montrealers, work a rain poncho into your outfit and hope for candy that melts in your mouth, not your pumpkin basket.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec and significant rainfall in more southern regions.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upwards of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 degrees Celsius, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, Saint-Félicien and Roberval, at Lac-Saint-Jean.
Do you know of community organizations that are holding indoor Halloween events? Let us know in the comments.

Full text: Montreal woke up Wednesday to a just-below-seasonal-average of 13 degrees Celsius yet a frost advisory on the horizon.
Environment Canada warns that the Montreal, Châteauguay and Longueuil areas can expect temperatures to drop to near or below the freezing mark overnight. The agency issues frost advisories when the cold might lead to damage of plants and crops. Overnight temperatures the rest of the week will hover between 4 and 12 C, with rain expected Thursday and Sunday nights.
For vulnerable plants, a light nighttime cover that allows air to circulate, such as frost cloths, straw or evergreen branches can help retain some warmth. You can find more tips at cottagelife.com( https://cottagelife.com/outdoors/9-tips-for-protecting-your-garden-from-frost/ ). The first fall frost is generally expected around Oct. 11, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.
The lowest recorded overnight temperature for the first week of October, experienced in 1996, was minus-4 C.

Kramberger: Help Rudy's Run raise funds for Parkinson's research

Full text: Athletics and charity have always been a part of Rudy Erfle's life, and his ongoing battle with Parkinson's disease isn't stopping him from overseeing a fundraising event to bolster medical research.
Erfle, 58, learned he had the degenerative disorder in 2008. After a decade of living with Parkinson's, he decided it was time to organize a fundraiser - with the backing of Parkinson Canada( https://www.parkinson.ca ) - to help find a cure.
Erfle has participated in community runs, half-marathons and charity golf tournaments over the years, so organizing Rudy's Run for Parkinson's - with the help of his family - seemed like a good fit.
"It was lot of fun last year. It went very well," he said of the inaugural run that raised an impressive $70,000.
The second edition of Rudy's Run for Parkinson's takes place at Voyageur Park, just west of Sources Blvd. in Pointe-Claire, on Saturday. This year's initial target of $30,000 had already been surpassed as of Monday. Proceeds benefit the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital.( https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/ )
Erfle said local health experts have told him they are confident a cure can be found.
"I'm happy to contribute to the research," he said. "The more money they can get to do this research, the faster the cure (can be found)."
Erfle is past president of the Pointe-Claire Oldtimers Hockey league, whose foundation has donated more than $1.7 million to charities and local groups. He also coached minor hockey for many years.
While he has had to stop playing hockey because of Parkinson's, Erfle continues to golf and run despite the impact of the disease on his body.
The Pointe-Claire resident owns a custom cabinet/furniture business and continues to work daily, although the plan is for his sons, who already work with him, to eventually take over.
Rigidity, meaning stiff or inflexible muscles, is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson's.

"We call it 'freezing up,' and (sometimes) my legs won't move when I want them to," Erfle said. "I don't have a lot of the tremors people associate with Parkinson's, but I have this freezing up quite regularly. I've had Parkinson's for 11 years and it's getting worse all the time."
Participants can register online until Thursday or sign up in person Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at Voyageur Park. Registration costs $20 per adult. Participation is free for children 12 and under.
A kids' run/walk kicks off at noon and the 5-km and 10-km runs start at 12:30 p.m. Participants run or walk around the park's track.
There will be live music, a raffle and face painting as well as some food stalls. The event happens rain or shine, and about 300 runners are expected to participate.
Sponsorships and donations from local businesses and companies have helped make the run such a success, said Erfle's daughter, Marina.
"The $70,000 we raised last year was so unexpected," she said.

Josh Freed: Montreal's coneucopia is driving us to the couch

Full text: Montrealers are suffering from a troubling new condition called Post-Traumatic Cone Disorder (PTCD) - and you might be a victim.
I was alerted to the problem by Montreal psychiatrist Norman Hoffman, who wrote to say: "There has been a large increase in anxiety and fear of construction cones, a condition naturally called Orange Coneaphobia."
Dr. Hoffman's letter is written with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. He goes on to warn about other cone syndromes, including Obsessive Cone Disorder (OCD) and Pothole Depression Depression (PDD).
Beneath Hoffman's humour is a ring of truth. After years of ceaseless construction, what psychological effect have our cones had? Ask yourself: Could YOU be suffering from one of the following conditions?
Post-traumatic Cone Disorder: This affects people experiencing nightmares, or recurring flashbacks of stressful moments in conestruction. In their memories, they're surrounded by cones on all sides, yet no matter where they turn there's No Exit.
Some get anxious simply seeing the colour orange, setting off distressing "cone flashbacks." Triggers might include passing an orange construction sign, piles of oranges outside fruit shops, or the Orange Julep.
Other stressful objects to avoid: life vests, cantaloupes, Cheetos, Kraft Dinner, goldfish (the fish), goldfish (the cracker), the Golden Gate Bridge, campfires, sunsets - and Florida.
Construction Confusion Syndrome (CCS): This strikes when a street you took a half-hour ago is suddenly blocked on the way back by 5,000 orange cones that materialized from nowhere. Google Maps says the street is open - but cones and traffic are lined up for kilometres.
Traumatic reactions might include sweating, weeping, cursing or freezing at the wheel in panic, unsure which way to go. This can provoke a fight-or-flight response, causing you to make a sudden U-turn across two lanes of traffic trying to head back where you came - as everyone ho-ooonks.
Welcome to "Game of Cones!"
Coney Island Rage Episodes (CIRE): Many motorists become highly irritable in construction, honking at cyclists, seniors and mothers with strollers. Some scream at the cones themselves, shouting hurtful things like "You @#$%$#$ cones - rot in the rain!"
Please! It is not acceptable to insult, or run over an innocent cone. However, when parking your car, if a cone has been left in an unjustified place, blocking a badly needed parking spot, it's okay to, er ... move it farther down the block.
To eliminate evidence, stuff the cone into your trunk and dispose of it in a distant Dumpster, as advised in Abbie Hoffman's classic book: "Steal this Cone."
Britain is installing "intelligent cones" that scream when moved or hit by vehicles - then spring back into place. But as cones become increasingly smart, perhaps we can just talk to them - especially those that prevent any parking on often deserted downtown streets.
YOU: Please, cone! I just need to park for a few minutes. I'll be long gone before morning when workers arrive. Promise!
CONE: Okay, okay, I'll give you a break this time, but don't make me regret it. I've just taken your facial recognition photo.
Abusive Cone Behaviour (ACB): You know the scenario. You're driving down a Montreal street on a pitch black night when you suddenly see a large, dark cone looming before you like an iceberg threatening a ship. It's supposed to warn there's a pothole there, but the cone is a bigger menace, so you swerve madly to avoid it, using years of Montreal cone-avoidance expertise.
This kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated. We need a Montreal Cone Hot Line where motorists can report reckless cone conduct.
Road Depression Depression: Excessive construction has left many feeling helpless, but health professionals suggest treatments. For instance:
1. When driving, even at night, always wear sunglasses with a dark blue filter that screens out disturbing orange colours. If
coneaphobia strikes, take several deep breaths to enter a more calm, meditative state.
Relax. Relaa-a-xxx. Do not close your eyes while driving.
2. As in Alcoholics Anonymous, it's helpful to have a designated friend to talk you down during coneaphobic episodes. They can offer you guidance, by dictating GPS instructions over your speakerphone: "Okay - put your car in reverse! Now back up down the street right over that line of cones. Take a U-turn into the little alley, cut through the park in front of you and ... you're home free!"
This is considered acceptable road conduct in Montreal, but you risk a $1,000 ticket for driving while talking on the phone.
3. Take a relaxing construction vacation in a cone-free zone. How about Giethoorn Village in Steenwijkerland, Holland, where there are no cones whatsoever because there are no roads?
4. Avoid all possible coneaphobia triggers, especially meeting people named Cohen.
Warning: This St-Jean weekend both the new and old Champlain Bridges into Montreal are closed, with a cornucopia of cones cutting the city in two.
Should you feel overwhelmed, repeat the following wellness mantra: "Every day, I feel better and better because the roads are getting better and better.
"There will no more cones by 2040."
Bonne Fête, everyone.

In Quebec, the official numbers provided by public security officials remained largely the same Thursday as they were Wednesday, with 7,229 homes reported flooded, 4,063 properties isolated, and some 10,895 people forced out due to flooding across the province.
In the nation's capital, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said he didn't expect a second wave of flooding for Ottawa and Gatineau. It's the second bout of major spring flooding in three years in the area, and in 2017 the worst damage was caused by a second round of floods.
Health and safety inspection teams fanned outacross flood-affected regions of New Brunswick Friday, assessing homes and businesses that are still drying out amid receding floodwaters.
Satellite imagery
The Globe and Mail obtained recent satellite imagesof extensively flooded neighbourhoods in and around Greater Montreal.
Quebec
On the ground
In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, northwest of Montreal, some of the 6,000 residents ordered to leave after a dike broke on Saturday returned to houses filled with mud-covered detritus and plates of food abandoned during rushed evacuations.
In all, more than 10,000people remained out of their homes in Quebec on Wednesday, and 7,000 residences were flooded.
Water levels in the corridor along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers between Montreal and the boundary with Ontario threatened residents all week, but appear to have stabilized for the time being.
An overview of April's weather helps explain how spring spawned a flooding disaster for several communities from Ottawa to Montreal.
A snowy winter with below-average temperatures meant about twice the normal average amount of snow was still on the ground in mid-April, according to Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
Then, temperatures began to warm, remaining above freezing day and night.
Finally, rain was falling every two or three days by mid-month. Montreal alone had 128 mm in April, while it usually gets 82 mm.
"We had ideal conditions for a catastrophe," Mr. Cantin said.
Political response
Last Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians must talk abouthow and where to rebuildafter floods, and he did not close the door on using federal dollars to help relocate communities facing the recurring threat of severe flooding.
"Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward," he said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Quebec Premier François Legault has said the government will offer homeowners $200,000 to abandon homes that flood year after year, after capping flood relief compensation at $100,000 starting this year.
New Brunswick
On the ground
Communities from Fredericton to Saint John were flooded in the second half of April, forcing nearly 1,000 people to evacuate their homesand more than 400 to stay in temporary hotel accommodations provided by the Canadian Red Cross.
Officials said about 70 per cent of the roughly 940 people seeking help from the Red Cross this year also registered for assistance a year ago.
Among 84 closed roads across the province was a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway between Oromocto and River Glade. Everyone from community volunteers to federal officials and Canadian Armed Forces pitched in to help - even federal fisheries officers were aiding evacuation efforts in Fredericton, Quispamsis and St. George.
"Minor seasonal flooding has always been a way of life in New Brunswick's southern riverside communities," The Globe and Mail's Atlantic bureau chief Jessica Leeder writes. "But when this year's flood levels began contending with the highs seen in 2018 - a flood billed then as historically destructive - many began wondering how many more years like this they can endure."
Political response
The province rolled out a disaster financial assistance program Friday, announcing that affected property owners could receive a maximum of $160,000 for structural repairs to private residences, and up to $500,000 for small businesses and non-profit organizations.
The program is not available for those with damaged cottages and recreational properties.
"Together, we made major efforts to plan for, prepare for and respond to the flood," said Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart. "Residents, volunteers, first responders and the military worked to protect lives and property. Despite that work there was damage."
Mr. Urquhart said the province was committed to coming up with a better long-term plan to deal with the impact of spring flooding.
Premier Blaine Higgs told reporters during a tour of affected areas that with two floods in as many years, it's clear climate change is changing flooding frequency, and his new Tory government will take this into account in future planning.
'Last year was supposed to be once in a lifetime': Quebec and New Brunswick brace for new reality of perennial floods
Ontario
On the ground
A Saturday morning report from the board that monitors levels in the Ottawa River says near Constance Bay, water levelsare at or above their 2017 levels and are forecast to rise another 47 centimetres. At a measuring spot near Parliament Hill, where paths and parking lots along the river are already underwater, the board forecasts a rise of another 75 centimetres before water levels peak on May 1.
About 400 soldiers were deployed in Ottawa to assist with flooding efforts in the city as water levels on the Ottawa River rise to dangerous levels.
Many roads in the Bracebridge area, in Ontario's cottage country, have been washed out by floodwaters as two nearby lakes are have water levels that exceed those last seen during serious flooding in 2013.
Kashechewan First Nation has been evacuated, as its more than 2,500 members have been flownto other locations across the province and its leaders continue to call for a permanent relocation.
Political response
Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he believes climate changeis among the reasons eastern Ontario homeowners are trying to save their homes from flooding for the second time in three years. Ford was in the rural west end of Ottawa Friday morning, touring flooded areas along the Ottawa River.
The office of Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson says the combination of already high water levels and further rainfall give rise to a situation that "constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm." It said the water levels pose "an ongoing threat" to property, health and safety of nearby residents.
The communities of Bracebridge and Minden HIlls have declared a state of emergency and advising residents in areas prone to flooding to relocate.
Bracebridge Mayor Graydon Smith was joined at a news conference Wednesday by Ford, whose family has a cottage in the area.
The long view
Believing that climate change is the lone issue at play means that we risk missing a major part of the story - and the solution,argues Les Stanfield.
When it comes to facing the risks of large-scale disasters, Wency Leung reports, many people have a hard time envisioning - let alone preparing for - worst-case scenarios.
If floods and forest fires and other calamities can forge a political consensus on the need to combat climate change, then that's progress,writes John Ibbitson.
There are more floods than ever before, and yet our behaviour toward them in the 21st century is just as irrational as that of our pagan ancestors, who considered them a punishment from a vengeful God, wrote Ian Brownin the aftermath of the floods Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Houston in 2017.
The discourse of flood recovery has to turn to getting those in the immediate flood plain permanently out of harm's way,writes Glenn McGillivray, managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss and Reduction. He is advocating for governments to buy out landowners located on floodplains.
Inadequacies in the mapping of coastal areas are hindering Canadians' efforts to protect themselves from flood disaster, The Globe's Matthew McClearn learns.
Engineers and the scientific community need to move more swiftly to design infrastructure that accounts for climate change science,according to one expert.

Full text: With the worst of the flooding probably past in Montreal, the massive job of cleaning up looms, Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday morning.
"Once we remove the dikes and once the level of the river goes down, the cleaning operation is going to start," Plante said at the weekly executive committee meeting.
While everyone needs to remain vigilant, since the weather outlook could change and another breached dike could cause further disaster, it's time to start looking ahead, said the mayor, appearing tired after two weeks of dealing with the flooding crisis.
Plante paid tribute to the massive and well co-ordinated effort by firefighters, police, the army, blue-collar workers, elected officials and citizens to stave off rising waters.
But even once the threat has ended, the work won't be over, she said.
"I want to talk about this because, of course, we have made advance preparations for the floods, but the cleanup will also be very demanding and require workers and volunteers," Plante said.
"I'm appealing to everyone, so that if anyone wants to lend a hand, to spend a nice day coming to take away sandbags, it will be much appreciated."
Plante also appealed to residents of boroughs affected by flooding for patience, over and above that which they have shown in the last few trying weeks, since the cleanup will take time and divert city workers from other seasonal tasks.
"We're asking you to be patient with the different teams from the boroughs, because we know that when we clean the shores, because it has to be done and the sandbags will all have to be picked up, it will slow down spring cleaning operations like street cleaning," she said.
"So I'm asking the public to be understanding."
On Facebook, the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough also thanked residents for their patience, noting that normal spring cleaning operations were behind schedule because of floods.
"If certain regular operations have slowed down, they should be restored as soon as the situation will return to normal," the borough said.
More than 10,300 Quebecers were still out of their homes as of Wednesday afternoon, as Premier François Legault promised an action plan to deal with the aftermath of the floods. A total of 7,060 homes across the province were flooded and 3,431 homes isolated by water.
In Montreal, with colder than usual temperatures and rain expected overnight Wednesday to Thursday, 248 people had been evacuated, with 147 homes flooded and 49 homes isolated. Between two and four centimetres of snow were expected in the Laurentians, turning overnight to freezing rain. mscott@postmedia.com

Montreal crews get busy removing a winter's worth of grime

Full text: The snow of an overly long winter has finally left us, leaving behind six months' worth of dirt, grime and gravel to sweep up.
Montreal is embarking on its annual spring-cleaning blitz, dispatching a rolling army of 775 workers on a $50-million campaign to make the city look presentable for summer.
The city spread roughly 170,000 tonnes of salt and 30,000 tonnes of gravel on the roads and sidewalks this winter, ina season marked by numerous snowfalls and rapid thaws that encased the city in a persistent layer of ice.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-rain-and-ice )
Since most of the snowing and melting occurred during only a two-month period, the city did not use more gravel than normal, city spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said.
"We spread very little abrasives in November and December - remember, it was a green Christmas this year," he said during a tour of the city's street-cleaning operations in western Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Wednesday. "But we made up for it in January and February."
It will take four to six weeks to remove most of the winter detritus from the city's 6,000 kilometres of sidewalks and 4,000 kilometres of streets. Added to that are another 500 kilometres of alleyways, 800 kilometres of bike paths and 1,200 parks.
The battle is tackled in teams of three, with a large silver water tanker leading the charge, spraying down jets that loosen up the layers of filth and packed down leaves left over from last autumn, propelling refuse toward the sidewalk. It also helps keep down the dust.
The city aims to have most of the cleanup done by the end of May.
Next comes the sidewalk tractors, whose multiple nozzles spray garbage, dirt and gravel into the curb. At the rear of the operation is the sweeper-vacuum truck, whose rotating brushes loosen the refuse before Hoovering it into the machine's dumpster.
It is also the machine that suffers the most problems and breakdowns, mostly because of Montreal's lush tree canopy - branches that get sucked into the vacuum tubes often clog up the works, forcing the driver to go in for repairs.
The driver also spends a lot of time jumping out of the cab to pick up branches and other large pieces of garbage in his way, which on Wednesday included branches no thicker than an index finger, a plastic wagon wheel and a rubber floor mat.
Other impediments include parked cars, despite the no-parking signs, and piles of leaves or branches pushed into the street by residents. The trucks drive around the blockages, and will often come back another time to complete the job.
Crews have to wait till the snow's gone and temperatures rise, as below-freezing conditions interfere with the trucks' water systems and could also result in them covering streets in sheets of ice.
Moving steady, a shift of three can cover roughly 30 kilometres a day. Time is lost in returning to the local municipal yards to empty the sweeper truck's hopper four to five times a shift, and refilling water tanks from fire hydrants.
About one-third of the city's gravel, which is purchased at a cost of $30 a tonne from local suppliers, ends up in the city's sewage system, where it travels to Montreal's massive wastewater treatment system in the far east end of the city. It settles to the bottom of swimming-pool sized containment reservoirs, where it is collected, then dumped into landfills.
The other two-thirds is picked up during street cleaning operations and dumped into landfills as well. Since it is contaminated with salt residue, chemicals, contaminants like motor oil and numerous cigarette butts, the gravel cannot be reused, Sabourin said.
The city aims to have most of the cleanup done by the end of May.
For the last 10 years, the city has helped to organize communal spring cleanups, where citizens can come together to clean their local park or alleyway.
In 2018, nearly 25,000 Montrealers participated in more than 500 cleanups, or corvées, as they're known in French. Residents can organize or sign on to one through the city's website, (ville.montreal.qc.ca/corvees/( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/corvees/ )) and the city will supply bags, T-shirts, gloves and rakes.
The city will also help organize "plogging" events, a Swedish innovation in which participants combine jogging with trash collecting.
"The corvée events are good way for citizens to get together and help the environment, and it also fosters a sense of community spirit and of belonging," Sabourin said. "They've become popular traditions in a lot of places."

Quebec on alert after Beauce region hit hard by flooding

Full text: Quebec's Beauce region has so far been the hardest hit by spring flooding affecting many parts of the province, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said Tuesday.
Warm weather and up to 80 millimetres of rain are forecast between Thursday and Saturday in the region, which could aggravate flooding in towns across the area.
On Tuesday, Ms. Guilbault toured downtown Beauceville, located 90 kilometres south of Quebec City. She told reporters about 230 buildings are flooded in the town. Thirty-six people have had to leave their homes and six roads have been affected by the rising waters of the Chaudière River.
"Many regions across Quebec have been affected," she said, "but it's really here that's most critical."
Thomas Blanchet, a spokesman for the Public Security Department, said the water rose quickly Tuesday in downtown Beauceville after an ice jam broke free early in the morning.
He said sunny weather on Wednesday will "stabilize" the flooding for a while, but a new system bringing more precipitation and warm weather - which will increase snow melt - by Thursday risks causing more problems. "We will see how the river reacts," he said.
André Cantin with Environment Canada said temperatures are expected to remain above freezing across much of southern Quebec over the next few days, increasing the risk of flooding.
He said authorities should also be monitoring the water levels of the Ottawa River close to the Montreal area, as up to 50 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in that region by the weekend.
Ms. Guilbault warned that an aid program announced by her government this month would have limits and require difficult choices in situations of repeated flooding.

Full text: A week that at one point saw more than 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region deprived of power by freezing rain and high winds came to a close Friday morning with fewer than 2,000 customers in the Laurentians waiting to be plugged back into the power grid.
As of 7:30 a.m., a total of 1,549 customers in the Laurentians were waiting for power to be restored while Hydro-Québec had re-connected all of but 15 clients in Laval and 26 in the Lanaudière to its network. By 5 p.m. Friday, fewer than 150 customers in all three regions combined were without power, and only 350 province-wide, out of 4.3 million total.
Those numbers contrast starkly with the count 24 hours earlier, when the number of homes and businesses in the dark stood at 106,000.
Since Monday, when the power grid suffered its worst damage, dozens of persons in the affected areas were treated for carbon monoxide intoxication after they resorted to using barbecues and other outdoor heat sources into their homes to combat the cold.
As of Thursday morning, the number patients treated stood at 46.

Full text: Thanks to the work of more than 500 repair crews deployed north of Montreal by Hydro-Québec since Monday's freezing rain and strong winds, the vast majority of customers had their power back by Thursday.
As of 10 p.m., just over 2,000 clients were without power, mostly in Laval, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions. In Laval, where residents were severely affected by the weather, 380 customers still had no electricity.
At dawn Wednesday, 106,000 customers were affected by power outages. At the height of the situation at the beginning of the week, the blackout affected more than 313,000 subscribers.

Full text: Thanks to the work of more than 500 repair crews deployed north of Montreal by Hydro-Québec since Monday's freezing rain and strong winds, the vast majority of customers had their power back by Thursday.
As of 10 p.m., just over 2,000 clients were without power, mostly in Laval, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions. In Laval, where residents were severely affected by the weather, 380 customers still had no electricity.
At dawn Wednesday, 106,000 customers were affected by power outages. At the height of the situation at the beginning of the week, the blackout affected more than 313,000 subscribers.

Full text: The work of more than 500 repair crews deployed north of Montreal by Hydro-Québec since Monday was making itself felt Thursday morning, with the number of clients in Laval, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions without power standing at a little over 12,000.
At the height of the blackouts, caused by a weather system of freezing rain and high winds that punched a hole through much of the utility's distribution network, 313,000 clients had been left in the cold and dark( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ). But by 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Hydro-Québec was reporting 5,569 clients were still off the grid in the Laurentians, 4,117 had yet to be reconnected in the Lanaudière and 2,557 were without power in Laval.
Since Monday, many residents in the affected areas tried to warm themselves up by using barbecues and other outdoor heating sources inside their homes, a practice that saw dozens of cases carbon monoxide intoxication but no fatalities thus far.
On Wednesday Hydro-Québec's task was complicated( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-hit-80000-in-montreals-north-and-east-ends ) by numerous mini-outages caused falling branches and other debris, a situation that made it impossible to restore power to large areas with a single, major repair.

Full text: Premier François Legault said Wednesday the large majority of Quebec homes still without power after an ice storm two days earlier would have electricity restored by 11:59 Wednesday night.
Speaking to reporters in Quebec City, Legault thanked Hydro-Québec crews, whom he said worked through Tuesday night "in very difficult conditions."
Hydro-Québec, which has deployed 500 repair crews, warned that some zones further from urban centres might have to wait until Thursday before the grid was completely operational.
Legault urged people experiencing outages to exercise caution after 10 people were taken to hospital Tuesday night suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning after using barbecues indoors. Fire officials have reported 17 fires caused by candles or generators too close to homes.
"We should be able to fix the large majority of power outages( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ) by tonight, so be careful," Legault said, adding that the utility expects to be able to reconnect all but 15,000 homes by 11 p.m. Wednesday.
Hydro( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/#bis )that 39,000 customers were still without power at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, primarily in the regions of Laval, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.
High winds and freezing rain on Monday left ice accumulated on trees and knocked down power lines. The utility says more than 313,000 customers were in the dark at the height of the outages.
On Tuesday, officials in Laval said police were patrolling the city as phone service was down in some neighbourhoods. Sylvain Gariépy, operations chief for the Laval fire department, said firefighters went door-to-door to check on seniors and other vulnerable people.
Laval Mayor Marc Demers urged families and neighbours to look out for one another. "If you have members of your family - parents, brothers, sisters - who are in a zone that's lacking electricity, check in on their situation to make sure we're not forgetting someone in distress," Demers said.

Full text: There is sun at the end of the snow-swept tunnel.
After several weeks of see-sawing temperatures, full-fledged winter returned on Tuesday and was expected to dump up to 10 centimetres of snow on Montreal.
That's nowhere near a record. On April 9, 2000, Montrealers had to shovel 34 centimetres of snow.
Environment Canada issued a weather statement for the Montreal area on Tuesday morning, noting snow "could bring an additional weight on structures and trees that are already covered in freezing precipitation."
Areas north of Montreal were still recovering from freezing rain and strong winds that took down many power lines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ) on Monday. As of 4 p.m., more than 220,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without power, most of them in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region.
Spring should gradually return in the coming days. In Montreal, highs are expected to reach double-digits by Friday and Environment Canada's forecast calls for a sunny Sunday, with a high of 11 Celsius.
On Tuesday, the weather conditions impeded Canada Post mail delivery in the Montreal region.
"While every effort is being made to deliver the mail, some customers may not receive mail today," the postal service said. "Delivery will resume once it's safe to do so."
The weather also led the City of Montreal to cancel the launch of a flood-prevention campaign on Tuesday.
The city had planned to start an effort to visit more than 3,000 homes affected by spring flooding in 2017.

A combination of wind and slow but steady freezing rain left about 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers without electricity on Monday evening.
As of 8 p.m., the hardest hit was the Laurentides region with close to 94,000 clients off the grid, while power was out for just over 20,000 customers on the island of Montreal.
There were about 90,000 homes in the Lanaudières region, just northeast of the island, still without power on Monday night. Meanwhile, Laval had more than 80,000 businesses and homes without electricity as of 8 p.m.
South of the island, the Montérégie region had 12,000 clients affected by the blackout.
While Montreal Island outages were to be repaired by late afternoon, Hydro-Québec could only assure customers in Laval and the Laurentians that repair crews were on route and would try to re-establish power as quickly as possible.

Hope is on the horizon for Canadiens fans

Full text: The mind is a wonderful thing.
Had the Montreal Canadiens squeaked into the playoffs and been swatted aside in four or five games by the powerful Tampa Bay Lightning, it would have made for a grumpy summer. Fans would grumble, reporters would grouse, the cesspool that is social media would stink like a garbage strike in a heat wave.
Instead, one magical night, one shootout triumph over the hated Toronto Maple Leafs and one scintillating game for 20-yearold Minnesota native Ryan Poehling, and the chilly spring air smells of roses and Stanley Cup dreams.
All this because of Poehling 3.5, the night the rookie centreman's debut dovetailed in beguiling fashion with legendary broadcaster Bob Cole's swansong, the kid scoring three goals in regulation (including the tying goal) and another to win it in the shootout (hence the .5, since the NHL has never quite figured out what to do with The Gimmick in statistical terms).
Just like that, the mood shifted.
It might be a frigid spring, with the forecast calling for freezing rain, light snow and temperatures around one degree as we approach mid-April, but the mood is decidedly sunny. Rather than spending the next six months taking potshots at GM Marc Bergevin and agonizing over Jonathan Drouin's scoring drought, backup goaltender Antti Niemi's failures and the dysfunctional power play, fans will now spend the summer in a state of high anticipation, awaiting October and the season when young master Poehling is unleashed on the NHL for a full campaign.
It's like that when you're on pace for a 246-goal season. Never mind the game against the Leafs was meaningless in terms of the standings and the playoffs. The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career.
It won't always be like this for Poehling, but he's big, strong, involved and he has a scoring touch. In one game, he spent more time in close proximity to the goaltender than Max Pacioretty will spend in his entire NHL career.
All in all, a dazzling debut.
It was the perfect way to end a season that saw the Canadiens restore some lost pride, deliver more entertainment value than they have at any time since the 2014 playoffs and improve in the standings by 25 points.
All that is well and good. If they want the smiles to remain, Bergevin and owner Geoff Molson are going to need to try a little harder. As Global's Brian Wilde pointed out this weekend, enough with pocketing nearly $10 million a year in unused salary-cap space. That's fine when you aren't overpaying for free agents who can't get you to the promised land anyway - but when you get close, it's time to put that cash to work.
Despite the warm, fuzzy feeling left by that final game, the bottom line is that the Canadiens have missed the playoffs three of the past four seasons while resolutely refusing to go for broke. Enough. Now is the time. It will be a good summer for free agents, restricted and unrestricted. Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Erik Karlsson can shift the needle considerably, even if you have to overpay to acquire their services.
There is a solid argument for targeting either Panarin, an unrestricted free agent with the Blue Jackets, or restricted free agent Mitch Marner with the Leafs. The Canadiens have the cap money to make an offer for Marner that free-spending Leafs GM Kyle Dubas simply can't match - thus hamstringing the Leafs and acquiring one of the league's most exciting and dangerous young players in a single stroke.
Panarin, on the other hand, would make it possible for the Canadiens to jettison Drouin by whatever means possible. There are times when you simply have to acknowledge you made a bad deal and move on and this is one of them. Perhaps Bergevin can persuade some other organization that they can turn Drouin's game around but even if he can't, losing Drouin is addition by subtraction.
Then we come to the powerless power play. There were some indications the man-advantage was beginning to function late in the season, but it was far too little, too late. The Canadiens finished with the second-worst power play in the league - and if you think it's because they traded P.K. Subban, his Nashville Predators was the only team that was worse.
No matter what players are brought in, power-play repair has to be the first item of business for the coaching staff because with even a mediocre power play, the Habs would have had a 100-point season and a secure spot in the playoffs.
So fix the power play. Go for broke in free agency. And remember with a smile the night the raw rookie lit up the Leafs. jacktodd46@yahoo.com

The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career despite a bit of churlish poor sportsmanship from Leafs coach Mike Babcock, who called for a replay review with nothing on the line.
Hockey Night in Canada broadcaster Bob Cole was given a Habs jersey by club president Geoff Molson for calling his last game at the Bell Centre against the Leafs before hanging up the mike.
The review from the Toronto War Room, predictably, took forever. Memories of Babcock's sour attempt to spoil the moment will last even longer.

As Global's Brian Wilde pointed out this weekend( https://globalnews.ca/news/5137028/call-of-the-wilde-state-of-the-union/?utm_medium=Twitter&utm_source=%40Global_Montreal ), enough with pocketing nearly $10 million a year in unused salary-cap space. That's fine when you aren't overpaying for free agents who can't get you to the promised land anyway - but when you get close, it's time to put that cash to work.
Artemi Panarin of the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Despite the warm, fuzzy feeling left by that final game, the bottom line is that the Canadiens have missed the playoffs three of the past four seasons while resolutely refusing to go for broke. Enough. Now is the time. It will be a good summer for free agents, restricted and unrestricted. Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Erik Karlsson can shift the needle considerably, even if you have to overpay to acquire their services.
There is a solid argument for targeting either Panarin, an unrestricted free agent with the Blue Jackets, or restricted free agent Mitch Marner with the Leafs. The Canadiens have the cap money to make an offer for Marner that free-spending Leafs GM Kyle Dubas simply can't match - thus hamstringing the Leafs and acquiring one of the league's most exciting and dangerous young players in a single stroke.
Panarin, on the other hand, would make it possible for the Canadiens to jettison Drouin by whatever means possible. There are times when you simply have to acknowledge you made a bad deal and move on and this is one of them. Perhaps Bergevin can persuade some other organization that they can turn Drouin's game around but even if he can't, losing Drouin is addition by subtraction.
Then we come to the powerless power play. There were some indications the man-advantage was beginning to function late in the season, but it was far too little, too late. The Canadiens finished with the second-worst power play in the league - and if you think it's because they traded P.K. Subban, his Nashville Predators was the only team that was worse.
No matter what players are brought in, power-play repair has to be the first item of business for the coaching staff because with even a mediocre power play, the Habs would have had a 100-point season and a secure spot in the playoffs.
So fix the power play. Go for broke in free agency. And remember with a smile the night the raw rookie lit up the Leafs.

Full text: The mind is a wonderful thing.
Had the Montreal Canadiens squeaked into the playoffs and been swatted aside in four or five games by the powerful Tampa Bay Lightning, it would have made for a grumpy summer. Fans would grumble, reporters would grouse, the cesspool that is social media would stink like a garbage strike in a heat wave.
Instead, one magical night, one shootout triumph over the hated Toronto Maple Leafs( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-no-playoffs-but-canadiens-kept-fighting-to-the-very-end ) and one scintillating game for 20-year-old Minnesota native Ryan Poehling( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/ryan-poehling-makes-a-spectacular-debut-with-canadiens-in-6-5-so-win-over-leafs ) and the chilly spring air smells of roses and Stanley Cup dreams.
All this because of Poehling 3.5, the night the rookie centreman's debut dovetailed in beguiling fashion with legendary broadcaster Bob Cole's swansong( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/sports-pmn/hockey-sports-pmn/its-been-a-pleasure-legendary-play-by-play-man-bob-cole-makes-final-call/wcm/a15b118d-5590-4d68-8c43-e4901148a11a ), the kid scoring three goals in regulation (including the tying goal) and another to win it in the shootout (hence the .5, since the NHL has never quite figured out what to do with The Gimmick in statistical terms).
Poehling scores the winning goal.
Just like that, the mood shifted. It might be a frigid spring, with the forecast calling for freezing rain, light snow and temperatures around one degree as we approach mid-April, but the mood is decidedly sunny. Rather than spending the next six months taking potshots at GM Marc Bergevin and agonizing over Jonathan Drouin's scoring drought, backup goaltender Antti Niemi's failures and the dysfunctional power play, fans will now spend the summer in a state of high anticipation, awaiting October and the season when young master Poehling is unleashed on the NHL for a full campaign.
It's like that when you're on pace for a 246-goal season. Never mind that the game against the Leafs was meaningless in terms of the standings and the playoffs. The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career despite a bit of churlish poor sportsmanship from Leafs coach Mike Babcock, who called for a replay review with nothing on the line.
Hockey Night in Canada broadcaster Bob Cole was given a Habs jersey by club president Geoff Molson.
The review from the Toronto War Room, predictably, took forever. Memories of Babcock's sour attempt to spoil the moment will last even longer.
It won't always be like this for Ryan Poehling but he's big, strong, involved and he has a scoring touch. In one game, he spent more time in close proximity to the goaltender than Max Pacioretty will spend in his entire NHL career.
All in all, a dazzling debut. It was the perfect way to end a season that saw the Canadiens restore some lost pride, deliver more entertainment value than they have at any time since the 2014 playoffs and improve in the standings by 25 points.
All that is well and good. If they want the smiles to remain, Bergevin and owner Geoff Molson are going to need to try a little harder.

Full text: The temperature will be a mild 1C on Sunday, but spring is not around the corner. Environment Canada upgraded its warning for the greater Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), increasing the snow prediction by 5 cm: Expect to receive between 15 and 20 cm of snow starting in the morning.
Furthermore, strong winds - northeast 30 km/h gusting to 50 turning southeast 30 km/h gusting to 50 late in the afternoon - will make visibility very poor.
That snow could turn into freezing rain in the afternoon and is expected to continue overnight. Further flurries are expected on Monday.
The worst of the storm - the result of a low-pressure system from Colorado - is expected to hit north and east of the city.
Environment Canada has issued the snowfall warning for southern parts of the Mauricie, Lanaudière, Laurentides and Quebec City regions, as well as the northern part of the Centre-du-Québec region.
"Consider modifying non essential travel plans," Environment Canada said in its snowfall warning.
"Remove snow from roofs to avoid the risk of them collapsing under the weight of the heavy snowfall expected."

Full text: While the temperature might have risen slightly on Saturday, spring is not around the corner. Environment Canada is warning the greater Montreal area can expect to receive between 10 and 15 centimetres of snow starting on Sunday morning.
"Expect poor travelling conditions due to low visibilities and snow accumulation on the roads," the federal weather forecasting service warned.
That snow could turn into freezing rain in the afternoon and is expected to continue overnight. Further flurries are expected on Monday.
However, the worst of the storm - the result of a low-pressure system from Colorado - is expected to hit north and east of the city.
Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning for southern parts of the Mauricie, Lanaudière, Laurentides and Quebec City regions, as well as the northern part of the Centre-du-Québec region.
Those areas are expected to get more than 15 centimetres of snow and strong winds could cause blowing snow.
Environment Canada is encouraging people to modify non-essential travel plans and remove snow from roofs as the weight of the heavy snow that's expected could cause roof collapses.
Montrealers can look forward to warmer temperatures, though, with a high of two degrees and a low minus-one in the forecast for Sunday.

Brownstein: A river runs through ... McGill College Ave.?

Full text: A river runs through it? McGill College Ave., that is. Really.
What could possibly go wrong here?
One of the ideas floated by local and international experts at last week's three-day meeting on the redesign possibilities for McGill College Ave. entailed a body of water that would run down from the mountain through to the city centre( https://montrealgazette.com/news/experts-citizens-meet-to-discuss-future-of-mcgill-college-ave ) - just like in the good old days.
This could even be cost effective. The next time there is a water main leak on upper Peel St., the city, in lieu of fixing the problem, could simply send the cascading waterfall down McGill College. Even toss in a couple of fjords for good measure.
Actually, the city would have to divert the flow of water with isthmuses or something, otherwise McGill University, for whom the avenue is named, would be submerged and students and profs would have to be issued scuba gear for their underwater classes.
In some respects, the good old days are still with us. That's because the waters have never really subsided. There is rarely a week that goes by in town when sewers don't back up and our streets aren't flooded.
Freezing rain in late 1998 turned into a soupy mess on McGill College.
Other ideas that were bandied about at the meeting involved everything from transforming McGill College Ave. into a pedestrian-only square and an elevated park with much green space.
But at least Mayor Valérie Plante and her parks czar Luc Ferrandez appear to be open and realistic about changes.
"We're not going to satisfy everyone," she said.
Ya think?
"Is it a street, is it an avenue, is it a field, is it a river? Everything is open and everything is on the table," he said.
Right. But the far bigger issue on the table is the chaos that is set to descend on the downtown core once this project as well as all the the others, the Phillips Square reboot, the Ste-Catherine St. revamp and the REM station construction, kick in.
What we will then have is the perfectly imperfect storm.
A man jumps over a stream of water from a broken water main at Peel and Ste. Catherine Sts. in in 2016.
Consumers are already turned off from shopping and dining downtown with ongoing gridlock from current road construction projects and detours. All these events coming together simultaneously could transform the city centre into a ghost town.
Well and good to wish to turn the downtown core into a postcard-pretty urban-scape in the future, but at what cost?
In fact, the only group that appears to be profiting from all these beautifying the city schemes - from turning the Mount Royal drive into a car-free corridor to morphing McGill College Ave. into our very own Niagara Falls - is the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM). (Many are waiting with bated breath for the OCPM's long-awaited finding on the future of the mountain road.)
But what really seems to be lost on the city administration is the recent study on folks fleeing the city for the 'burbs in record numbers?
Last month, a report on inter-regional migration by the Institut de la statistique du Québec revealed that Montreal lost 24,000 residents to other regions in the province, which represented the largest net loss( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/new-figures-show-an-exodus-from-montreal-toward-suburbs ) of city dwellers since 2009-2010.
Thanks to births and immigrants, the city's population has continued to grow - although that could soon be curtailed if the CAQ is able to clamp down on the flow of immigrants to this province, as is its intention.
Mayor Plante announced that she plans to address this issue with a three-pronged approach: making city housing more affordable; improving quality of life; and making it easier to get around Montreal.
Good luck here, particularly on that last item. Unless the CAQ wants to pony up for a Pink Line or the city has plans for a monorail or flying cars come into being shortly, this ain't going to be happening any time soon.
As for reaction to the redesign plans, Elena, a barista at the McGill College Ave. Starbucks, feels change is necessary for this artery. "There always seems to be some sort of construction happening on the street," she says. "It would be nice to come up with one solution for the long term and be finished with it. But if they did turn it into a river, at least (Starbucks) is connected to the métro."
So she wouldn't have to swim to work.
Montreal lawyer Sam Minzberg, whose office is on McGill College Ave., would also like to see the area spruced up, but has no desire to swim to work, either.
"I guess I'd have to take a canoe to work," he says. "I wouldn't be wild about that, nor would my clients. It would be the River of Tears for many of us here."

"Is it a street, is it an avenue, is it a field, is it a river? Everything is open and everything is on the table," he said.
Right. But the far bigger issue on the table is the chaos that is set to descend on the downtown core once this project as well as all the the others, the Phillips Square reboot, the Ste-Catherine St. revamp and the REM station construction, kick in.
What we will then have is the perfectly imperfect storm.
A man jumps over a stream of water from a broken water main at Peel and Ste. Catherine Sts. in in 2016.
Consumers are already turned off from shopping and dining downtown with ongoing gridlock from current road construction projects and detours. All these events coming together simultaneously could transform the city centre into a ghost town.
Well and good to wish to turn the downtown core into a postcard-pretty urban-scape in the future, but at what cost?
In fact, the only group that appears to be profiting from all these beautifying the city schemes - from turning the Mount Royal drive into a car-free corridor to morphing McGill College Ave. into our very own Niagara Falls - is the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM). (Many are waiting with bated breath for the OCPM's long-awaited finding on the future of the mountain road.)
But what really seems to be lost on the city administration is the recent study on folks fleeing the city for the 'burbs in record numbers?
Last month, a report on inter-regional migration by the Institut de la statistique du Québec revealed that Montreal lost 24,000 residents to other regions in the province, which represented the largest net loss( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/new-figures-show-an-exodus-from-montreal-toward-suburbs ) of city dwellers since 2009-2010.
Thanks to births and immigrants, the city's population has continued to grow - although that could soon be curtailed if the CAQ is able to clamp down on the flow of immigrants to this province, as is its intention.
Mayor Plante announced that she plans to address this issue with a three-pronged approach: making city housing more affordable; improving quality of life; and making it easier to get around Montreal.
Good luck here, particularly on that last item. Unless the CAQ wants to pony up for a Pink Line or the city has plans for a monorail or flying cars come into being shortly, this ain't going to be happening any time soon.
As for reaction to the re-design plans, Elena, a barista at the McGill College Ave. Starbucks, feels change is necessary for this artery. "There always seems to be some sort of construction happening on the street," she says. "It would be nice to come up with one solution for the long term and be finished with it. But if they did turn it into a river, at least (Starbucks) is connected to the métro."
So she wouldn't have to swim to work.
Montreal lawyer Sam Minzberg, whose office is on McGill College Ave., would also like to see the area spruced up, but has no desire to swim to work, either.
"I guess I'd have to take a canoe to work," he says. "I wouldn't be wild about that, nor would my clients. It would be the River of Tears for many of us here."

Schoolchildren unfairly punished for STM tardiness, parents complain

Full text: A growing number of parents are complaining their children are being unfairly penalized for being late to school because public transit and bus service in particular has been unreliable.
Several Montreal schools have policies dictating that tardy public transit or heavy traffic are not acceptable excuses for lateness. This has forced Katrin Dinkel to call her son's St-Luc High School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce as many as three times a week this winter and give a fake excuse when his 104 bus didn't arrive.
"I can't say the bus was late, although they know it and I know it, because that doesn't count as an excuse," Dinkel said. "So I have to say it was a family emergency. I have to lie to someone who knows I'm lying. It's such a stupid, vicious circle."
The last straw came Friday when her son was late because his bus didn't come and wasn't allowed to attend class. He roamed the hallways until he was able to reach his mother so she could speak to the school authorities.
"So now they are denying him an education because he was late, which was not his fault to begin with."
Westmount High School sent a letter to parents in late February noting that difficult winter conditions have hampered students efforts because "city buses are either late or so full they pass their stops without picking up new passengers."
The school initially excused late arrivals, but advised that as of Feb. 26 it will no longer do so. It suggested students leave earlier, and warned that all latecomers will receive detentions.
The school has contacted the Société de transport de Montréal to lobby for more buses, and suggests parents do the same. In social media posts, several bus routes serving the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce sector were cited for lateness, including the 162, 90, 105 and 104.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal school board has been lobbying the STM to provide more buses, spokesperson Alain Perron said. Schools within the English Montreal School Board each handle the issue of tardiness caused by late buses individually, spokesman Mike Cohen said.
STM spokesperson Amélie Régis said the bus corporation has advised customers several times that this winter has been a particularly difficult one.
"The months of January and February were marked by a large range of changing climactic conditions (cold, freezing rain, thaws, etc)( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-whiplash-yes-montreal-winters-are-getting-wetter-and-icier ) ... These difficult conditions caused late buses, but also breakdowns that could not always be fixed en route," Régis said. "These factors, combined with pressure tactics by hardliners within the maintenance union, affected bus availability, in addition to the usual number of buses that must stay in the garage for planned maintenance, as required by the (provincial insurance board) SAAQ."
The bus corporation signed a tentative agreement with its maintenance union this week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-maintenance-workers-reach-deal-after-intense-overnight-negotiation ), which should bring improvements, Régis said. The STM is conducting an overview of all its bus lines, and school's seeking changes are invited to take part in the consultations that are part of the overview, she said.
A Montreal Gazette investigation determined as much as 30 per cent of the STM's bus fleet is at times unavailable for service( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-doesnt-have-enough-working-buses-to-meet-its-schedules ) because they are parked for maintenance or repairs, so there are not enough working buses to meet the STM's scheduled needs.

Ottawa gets the 'gold medal' for winter misery: While all of Canada was united by unrelenting February weather, climatologist says the country's capital received the worst mix

Full text: It's a good thing February is the shortest month. Canadians probably couldn't bear another brutal day of it.
Piercing cold, ferocious winds, treacherous ice and snow piled into Himalayan peaks on front lawns: This was a picture of Canada in February, as a vast country became united in a coast-to-coast cocktail of meteorological misery.
As March sets in, so is winter weariness.
"February cursed us," said David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment Canada. "Even fans of winter have to say that February was too much. Either too much snow, too much cold, it just went on, there was no break. Nature did not take a breather in February."
Canadians experienced the "too much" of February in their own distinct ways, evoking what Leo Tolstoy said about families: Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
Victoria got record snowfalls, Saskatoon saw wind chills of -50 C, and Montreal got smothered in ice.
Mr. Phillips, who likens himself to the country's "national psychologist," has observed that Canadians feel better about the weather when they look afield. "If Canadians know it's worse somewhere else, they don't feel so bad."
In that vein, they can look at Sudbury. It's been swamped by 334 centimetres of snow this season, 70 per cent more than average.
"It essentially looks like the Arctic here," said Dillan Ruthenberg, president of Maximum Lawn Care and Snow Removal, whose crews have been grabbing sleep between 12-hour shifts of snow removal. February saw 100 cm of snow alone.
"There are extremely high banks everywhere. People are getting stuck on side roads, and there are ruts from where the tires are.
It's absolutely awful." His company is deluged by calls from frantic homeowners who can no longer shovel themselves out.
"People are saying they have nowhere to put the snow," Mr.Ruthenberg said.
Then there's Saskatoon: The city's average temperature in February was -24 C, and several days it was so cold that buses were cancelled and Environment Canada issued frostbite warnings. Wind chills frequently dropped to the -40 C range.
One meteorologist tweeted Wednesday with some good news: "This was Saskatoon's warmest morning of the month with a low temp of -18, feeling like a balmy -29 with wind chill!"
One of the coldest spots in Saskatchewan was the community of Val Marie near the Montana border, where the temperature dipped in February to -45 C.
"It was damn cold," Mayor Roland Facette said from inside his Dodge pickup on his cattle farm on Thursday. The 77-year-old said it was even hard on his cattle, which were out all day. A few people in Val Marie complained, but he's being upbeat.
"It could have been worse.
Heck, there could have been 50mile-an-hour wind," Mr. Facette said. "We didn't have the wind. It was just cold."
Victoria, which likes to remind freezing Canadians that it has the mildest climate in Canada, got an Arctic blast that delivered the second-coldest February on record.
The city's 68 cm of snow last month was 10 times the normal volume and the most since officials began tracking data in 1941.
Mr. Phillips joked that it was retribution for the city's annual "Flower Count" in early March, when Victoria promotes its blooms and blossoms.
"The Arctic outbreak came, and the snow came, and the rest of us cheered," he quipped.
While February saw snowstorms in Vancouver and Victoria, Edmontonians had four days when it was -30 C or colder, and Calgary had its coldest February since 1936.
Canadians like to tease Torontonians for being weather wimps, but residents of Canada's largest city may have whining rights this year. The city has had only nine dry days since Jan. 1, Mr. Phillips said. Something has fallen from the sky every other day, including 130 cm of snow, 50 per cent more than normal.
As for Montreal, winter has felt like a relentless cycle of snow, rain, slush and frozen precipitation. Several sidewalks are coated with enough ice to sustain a decent game of shinny, and stores have seen a run on crampons.
The Urgences-santé ambulance service has had 800 calls for falls, with injuries ranging from wrist and ankle sprains to concussions. "On some surfaces, like parking lots, we're talking about sheer ice," said Valérie Tremblay, a spokeswoman for the service.
"Even the salt and abrasives can't handle it."
Montreal saw nine days of thaws and freezing in February, according to Mr. Phillips, meaning that whatever was liquid on the ground during the day turned to ice overnight.
"It was maple-syrup weather - above freezing during the day, below freezing at night," Mr. Phillips said. "What nature melted, it also froze."
To experience schadenfreude, he suggested looking at the nation's capital. Ottawa got 263 cm of snow this season, 56 per cent more than usual. The city has also been through numerous thawand-freeze cycles. Residents are posting pictures on social media of cars entombed in frozen slush and children practising their hockey moves on the street - in skates. Stores are running low on abrasives.
"If I was giving a gold medal to misery, I think it would probably be Ottawa," Mr. Phillips said.
Arctic air and shifting jet streams help explain Canada's harsh winter conditions this year, particularly the cold, said Gerald Cheng, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.
"Arctic air masses keep invading the south," he said. "The jet stream is dipping south. It allowed colder air from the North Pole to come in."
The effect has spread across the country: ski resorts in Ontario and Quebec dealing with high winds, storms closing schools in Atlantic Canada, and Quebec's Gaspé getting swallowed under 450 cm of snow.
"No one has really been left out of this misery," Mr. Phillips said.
"February will go down in Canadian history from coast to coast to coast as one of the most difficult months. It has been truly Canadian."

Schoolchildren unfairly punished for STM tardiness, parents complain

Full text: A growing number of parents are complaining their children are being unfairly penalized for being late to school because public transit and bus service in particular has been unreliable.
Several Montreal schools have policies dictating that tardy public transit or heavy traffic are not acceptable excuses for lateness. This has forced Katrin Dinkel to call her son's St-Luc High School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce as many as three times a week this winter and give a fake excuse when his 104 bus didn't arrive.
"I can't say the bus was late, although they know it and I know it, because that doesn't count as an excuse," Dinkel said. "So I have to say it was a family emergency. I have to lie to someone who knows I'm lying. It's such a stupid, vicious circle."
The last straw came Friday when her son was late because his bus didn't come and wasn't allowed to attend class. He roamed the hallways until he was able to reach his mother so she could speak to the school authorities.
"So now they are denying him an education because he was late, which was not his fault to begin with."
Westmount High School sent a letter to parents in late February noting that difficult winter conditions have hampered students efforts because "city buses are either late or so full they pass their stops without picking up new passengers."
The school initially excused late arrivals, but advised that as of Feb. 26 it will no longer do so. It suggested students leave earlier, and warned that all latecomers will receive detentions.
The school has contacted the Société de transport de Montréal to lobby for more buses, and suggests parents do the same. In social media posts, several bus routes serving the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce sector were cited for lateness, including the 162, 90, 105 and 104.
Schools within the Commission scolaire de Montréal do not penalize children who are late because of delayed public transit, spokesperson Alain Perron said. The school board has been lobbying the STM to provide more buses. Schools within the English Montreal School Board handle the issues individually, spokesman Mike Cohen said.
STM spokesperson Amélie Régis said the bus corporation has advised customers several times that this winter has been a particularly difficult one.
"The months of January and February were marked by a large range of changing climactic conditions (cold, freezing rain, thaws, etc)( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-whiplash-yes-montreal-winters-are-getting-wetter-and-icier ) ... These difficult conditions caused late buses, but also breakdowns that could not always be fixed en route," Régis said. "These factors, combined with pressure tactics by hardliners within the maintenance union, affected bus availability, in addition to the usual number of buses that must stay in the garage for planned maintenance, as required by the (provincial insurance board) SAAQ."
The bus corporation signed a tentative agreement with its maintenance union this week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-maintenance-workers-reach-deal-after-intense-overnight-negotiation ), which should bring improvements, Régis said. The STM is conducting an overview of all its bus lines, and school's seeking changes are invited to take part in the consultations that are part of the overview, she said.
A Montreal Gazette investigation determined as much as 30 per cent of the STM's bus fleet is at times unavailable for service( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-doesnt-have-enough-working-buses-to-meet-its-schedules ) because they are parked for maintenance or repairs, so there are not enough working buses to meet the STM's scheduled needs.

Emergency calls for icy falls jump 55 per cent in 2019

Full text: Montrealers under the impression this year was a particularly treacherous one in which to tread the city's streets and sidewalks were correct.
Urgences-santé reported Friday the number of calls the ambulance service responded to for outdoor falls in the first eight weeks of the year jumped more than 55 per cent over the corresponding periods in the last three years.
Urgences-santé received 710 calls between Jan. 1 and Feb. 20 requesting aid for falls that occurred outside. In the same period last year, there were 458 calls. In the year before that, there were 439 calls.
The majority of calls were for broken, bruised or sprained wrists, forearms and hips, as well as head injuries.
"Basically, it shows an increase of 55 per cent in comparison to the same period last year," Urgences-santé operations adviser Eddy Afram said, calling the rise unprecedented. "The falls are in direct correlation with the observed winter weather conditions and ice storms we've had over the last few weeks since the beginning of the year."
Urgences-santé, which handles close to 40 per cent of all the calls made in the province of Quebec, said it had "one of our record-breaking days" on Jan. 25, receiving 1,200 calls for all types of medical emergencies. On Jan. 24, the temperature was 3 degrees Celsius and the city was drenched with 17 millimetres of rain. On Jan. 25, temperatures plunged to minus-25. Urgences-santé did not have figures for how many of those calls were related to falls.
This year's winter has been marked by a series of rapid rises and precipitous dips in temperatures as well as rainfalls and snowstorms, resulting in streets and sidewalks encrusted in a thick layer of ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-week-after-snowstorm-icy-sidewalks-dog-montreal-mayor ) that Montreal and its demerged municipalities and Laval have been powerless to remove in several sectors.
Officials with Mayor Valérie Plante's office said because the figures included both Montreal and Laval, the city preferred not to comment on them. On Thursday, Plante noted Montreal is not alone in suffering the vice of ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-puts-ice-breaking-on-hold-as-it-goes-back-to-snow-removal ) - many cities in the region have sidewalks and roads in poor conditions due to temperature swings.
Analyses of this year's weather conditions show Montreal has already had nine instances in which rainfall was followed by below-freezing temperatures, which is twice the average rate.
Citizens can help overtaxed Urgences-santé paramedics by finding other alternatives to ambulances if the fall is not an emergency, by keeping walkways and stairways ice-free in case they have to visit, and by helping elderly people or those at risk in the community by clearing their pathways.

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

The weather statement from Environment Canada said the "core of precipitation" expected Wednesday night through Thursday morning is snow. However, Montreal and regions close to the border could see some freezing rain mixed in.
The high for Wednesday is expected to be minus-5 degrees Celsius, while the high for Thursday could be 5 C. Friday and Saturday should see-saw over the freezing mark, under sunny skies.

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 66 per cent cleared, LaSalle at 70 per cent and Verdun at 75 per cent as of 10 a.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

Full text: After a weekend of roof collapses( https://montrealgazette.com/?s=collapse ) and a month of seesaw weather that has seen heavy snowfalls followed by bouts of freezing rain, thaws and flash freezes, the Quebec minister responsible for building safety is reminding property owners of the importance of clearing snow from their roofs.
"We can never repeat too often that an owner is responsible for the safety of those who live in or use their buildings," said Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, who is also responsible for the province's Régie du bâtiment du Québec. "So it's essential to remain vigilant for the warning signs that could be precursors to the collapse of a roof."

Those signs could include cracks appearing in walls, doors that don't open properly and sagging or other deformations in ceilings.
Laforest also recommends that building owners make a point of ensuring snow has also been removed from balconies and temporary car shelters and that, when necessary, the job be done by specialists who have the proper equipment to carry out the job.

Full text: Every Montrealer and their uncle felt the wrath of this week's snowmageddon one way or another, whether it was shovelling their way out of their home, trudging right up the middle of streets because sidewalks were impassable, or driving along the pothole-riddled, snowbank-lined roads.
I'll leave the bickering over the quality of snow removal to our city officials, except to note that anyone who lives in the West Island and drives downtown for work can see and feel the difference between the city of Montreal and the suburban municipalities.
As a parent and Montrealer, I have never been more preoccupied with weather alerts than I have been this year. Yes, some have been false alarms, but best to err on the side of caution.
This week's alert was the real thing, and by Tuesday, it seemed everyone was bracing for the onslaught.
My kids were jumping up and down when they heard the news that they were going to have a snow day Wednesday. I let out a sigh of relief because as crazy as it can get to have a hyper teen and pre-teen home while you're trying to work, there is nothing quite like knowing your kids are home safe while Mother Nature does her thing.
Not everybody is so fortunate as to be able to take time off from work if there is a weather advisory in effect, nor can every job be done from home, but when we hear about a major storm system moving in, with freezing rain warning or whiteout conditions, it's best to stay home if at all possible. There is no point arguing with someone who does not have a choice in the matter, but those who do have the opportunity but opt not to heed the warnings are merely being foolish.
A few weeks back, as I was leaving downtown late one evening after work, a dear friend messaged me and suggested I stay downtown and not risk driving back to the West Island because the weather was going to be particularly dangerous. I brushed aside the suggestion, and told her I appreciated her concern. After white-knuckling the steering wheel for the 90 minutes it took me to get home, I will think twice about doing that again. Later that evening, I noticed that several off-island Facebook groups were discussing whether to drive home, and a bunch of people were staying near the airport so as to cut short their commute.
Deciding whether to head out can be a life and death matter. I was saddened at the news that a dear family friend and longtime reader of the Montreal Gazette died last week in a multi-car pileup caused by poor weather conditions. She was returning home from the funeral of a relative in Ontario. We were devastated, and as news of her passing spread, the Montreal Pakistani/Indian community grieved the loss of this intelligent, eloquent woman who had given so much to those she loved.
I am amazed by the number of times I'll hear other parents driving across town to take their child to a sporting event during a storm or blizzard. Sports clubs need to cancel practices or games if there is a weather warning in effect. I've heard some say it's because they don't want to lose their deposit for the facility rental. We need to be more cautious when it comes to the safety and well-being of our children.
While we cannot control Mother Nature, we can control how much attention we pay to weather warnings. While we're blessed to have some of the best snow removal in the world (all jokes aside), we all need to do our parts to ensure the safety of ourselves and our families.

Parents, teachers blast CAQ's religious symbols ban at EMSB meeting

Full text: Parents, teachers, former students and some people who fit all three categories took turns speaking out against Premier François Legault's plan to legislate a ban on teachers and other public servants wearing religious symbols in the workplace at a meeting at the English Montreal School Board on Wednesday night.
Their forum was an emergency meeting that had been called two days earlier by the EMSB's human resources committee, which said it was seeking public input to help the school board formulate an "action plan" to fight such a law.
"The secular nature of our school system is clearly reflected in the Quebec education curriculum," Peter Sutherland, the president of the Montreal Teachers Association, the union representing EMSB teachers, told the panel. "These values are ensured by the professional manner in which our teachers deliver this curriculum, not the personal attire the teachers choose to wear."
He added that the union, which opposes any ban on religious symbols, has "never received any report of harm being caused by a teacher wearing a religious symbol."
"Targeting individuals based on what they wear and their personal religious beliefs feeds intolerance and is in complete opposition to the very values of tolerance and inclusion that teachers promote in their classrooms every day," Sutherland said.
"MTA will vigorously defend the rights of any of its members whose job security is threatened by any law that is passed in this regard."
Thirty people registered to speak at the meeting, which attracted about 60 people despite freezing rain.
Most of those who addressed the panel said they consider the law planned by Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government discriminatory and unnecessary, with some of the speakers arguing that Legault should direct his energy at tackling "real problems" in classrooms that result from government cutbacks.
Michael MacKenzie, a parent and a child psychologist, said of the CAQ's plan: "It's hard to comprehend how ... this can be construed as anything other than as a racist and xenophobic policy clearly aimed" at Muslims.
He also said he wondered how the Legault government will be able to defend a policy that it claims is aimed at protecting women from oppression, but tells them what they cannot wear.
"My ultimate goal is to ask how we can support you in opposing this," Michael Dorais-Bunn, a teacher at Marymount Academy, told the panel. "We know this is wrong. There is no reason for teachers to be forbidden to wear the symbols that some of our own students will be wearing. We're supposed to represent everyone in our society."
Stephen Brown, a parent who said he graduated from Royal Vale, said his seventh generation grandfather escaped slavery in the U.S. South and fled to Canada. He also said he remembered as a child being told by his grandfather that they couldn't work at some jobs because they were black.
Yet Brown said he questions how he can be living today "in a place where the government can remove fundamental rights simply because some people in society are uncomfortable with how other people are different."
The planned legislation will have a negative influence on children by teaching them that diversity is bad, he said.
Furheen Ahmed, a teacher at Westmount High School who wears a hijab, told reporters that she felt heartened as she listened to the speakers.
"I'm frustrated and I'm annoyed that somebody is forcing me to choose between my faith and my career," she said. "But hearing what my colleagues and my community is saying here tonight, I feel so supported. I feel good. I have faith that this is not going to go through." lgyulai@postmedia.com Twitter.com/CityHallReport

Full text: Parents, teachers, former students and some people who fit all three categories took turns speaking out against Premier François Legault's plan to legislate a ban on teachers and other public servants wearing religious symbols in the workplace at a meeting at the English Montreal School Board on Wednesday night.
Their forum was an emergency meeting that had been called two days earlier by the EMSB's human resources committee( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-calls-emergency-meeting-for-wednesday-on-quebec-plan-to-ban-religious-symbols ), which said it was seeking public input to help the school board formulate an "action plan" to fight such a law.
"The secular nature of our school system is clearly reflected in the Quebec education curriculum," Peter Sutherland, the president of the Montreal Teachers Association, the union representing EMSB teachers, told the panel. "These values are ensured by the professional manner in which our teachers deliver this curriculum, not the personal attire the teachers choose to wear."
He added that the union, which opposes any ban on religious symbols, has "never received any report of harm being caused by a teacher wearing a religious symbol."
"Targeting individuals based on what they wear and their personal religious beliefs feeds intolerance and is in complete opposition to the very values of tolerance and inclusion that teachers promote in their classrooms every day," Sutherland said.
"MTA will vigorously defend the rights of any of its members whose job security is threatened by any law that is passed in this regard."
Thirty people registered to speak at the meeting, which attracted about 60 people despite freezing rain.
Most of those who addressed the panel said they consider the law planned by Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government discriminatory and unnecessary, with some of the speakers arguing that Legault should direct his energy at tackling "real problems" in classrooms that result from government cutbacks.
Michael MacKenzie, a parent and a child psychologist, said of the CAQ's plan: "It's hard to comprehend how ... this can be construed as anything other than as a racist and xenophobic policy clearly aimed" at Muslims.
He also said he wondered how the Legault government will be able to defend a policy that it claims is aimed at protecting women from oppression, but tells them what they cannot wear.
"My ultimate goal is to ask how we can support you in opposing this," Michael Dorais-Bunn, a teacher at Marymount Academy, told the panel. "We know this is wrong. There is no reason for teachers to be forbidden to wear the symbols that some of our own students will be wearing. We're supposed to represent everyone in our society."
Stephen Brown, a parent who said he graduated from Royal Vale, said his seventh generation grandfather escaped slavery in the U.S. South and fled to Canada. He also said he remembered as a child being told by his grandfather that they couldn't work at some jobs because they were black.
Yet Brown said he questions how he can be living today "in a place where the government can remove fundamental rights simply because some people in society are uncomfortable with how other people are different."
The planned legislation will have a negative influence on children by teaching them that diversity is bad, he said.
Furheen Ahmed, a teacher at Westmount High School who wears a hijab, told reporters that she felt heartened as she listened to the speakers.
"I'm frustrated and I'm annoyed that somebody is forcing me to choose between my faith and my career," she said. "But hearing what my colleagues and my community is saying here tonight, I feel so supported. I feel good. I have faith that this is not going to go through."

Broken water main floods Pointe-Claire neighbourhood

Full text: Trevor Coulton awoke at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday to an unfamiliar sound coming from the basement of his home on Brunet Ave. in Pointe Claire.
"It sounded like the washing machine filling up with water, only louder," said Coulton, who went downstairs to discover his semi-finished basement filling up with ice-cold water caused by a broken water main on a nearby street.
"I must have had 6.5-feet of water in the basement."
Coulton's home was among a dozen or so residences in the area that flooded or suffered water damage as a result of a burst 14-inch water main which forced the closure of streets in the neighbourhood east of the Pointe-Claire Village.
"The break was on Victoria Ave., near Ste.Claire Ave," said Pointe-Claire Mayor John Belvedere. "Around 10 or 12 houses were flooded. Some on Marie-Anne and Victoria streets, on Brunet, and Drayton Ave. The water came in people back yards and then worked its way across, all the way down to Lakeshore Rd. "
City crews eventually closed the main water valve in the affected area, but streams of water flowed down Brunet and Victoria avenues.
Snow plows also pushed aside pools of accumulated ice and slush, the cocktail of choice for Mother Nature this winter.
Belvedere said the city throw almost all of its available resources at the affected area, including Pointe-Claire Volunteer Rescue Unit, public security, local fire dept. and public works. "Even Baie-D'Urfé was here helping out," he said.
City crews were still busy pumping water from flooded basements on Wednesday afternoon.
Still, seeing people with flooded homes saddened the mayor.
"You hate to see this happen," said Belvedere, who lives nearby and even had some flood water accumulate at the foot of his own driveway.
Belvedere did not know why the water main burst, but suspects it may be due to significant fluctuations in winter temperatures from Tuesday through Wednesday.
Belvedere said extreme weather conditions appear to the new normal in Montreal, which has been hit with mix of snow, rain and freezing in recent weeks.
"It had to be the weather. We had minus-25 C then plus-6 C, so that's a perfect storm for a water main to break."
The mayor said bottled water would be distributed to residents in the area.
Coulton praised the city's efforts in dealing with the emergency situation.
"They were here pretty quick," he said. "City workers, the fire dept, even volunteers, it was nice to see. "
While some residents were forced to leave their homes due to the flood that knocked out basement furnaces, Coulton was relieved to be staying in his home Wednesday night.
"I've still got heat and electricity, so I'll be alright. A hot meal and a warm bed."
But many personal effects, such as family photographs, were likely lost in the flood, he added.
"That's the stuff you can't replace."

Beis says suburbs put Montreal to shame on snow clearing

Full text: Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis says Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante shouldn't be telling anyone how to go about snow removal operations.
Beis said his suburban borough puts the city centre to shame when it comes to snow clearing.
"Well, (Plante) can send her team to the West Island and we'll show them how to do it. You can quote that because it's ridiculous."
Beis was reacting to a letter Plante( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ) sent out to Montreal's 19 borough mayors last week, calling upon them to do a better job of clearing away the white stuff.
City officials came under criticism after a frigid January blizzard, combined with freezing rain, left city streets and sidewalks caked in ice.
Beis, who called the state of icy downtown streets a "war zone," bristled at Plante's letter.
"It's an insult we would receive something like this when they're only trying to cover up their own misfortunes in the city centre," Beis said.
Plante's letter told the borough mayors said she wouldn't accept inadequate results.
"I'm counting on you to pay particular attention to operations in your respective boroughs. Over the next few days, I want every one of you to be able to show your satisfaction in the work done," Plante wrote. "My expectations are very high and I will not accept, under any pretext, inadequate execution, because the population of Montreal expects, and has a right to expect, high quality services without fail on the entire territory."
Plante later told reporters that she wanted to achieve the same snow-clearing standards in all parts of the city. "It's not about targeting and saying this one is good, this one is bad," she said.
Beis called the mayor's letter "strictly a PR move" to deflect criticism of treacherous road and sidewalk conditions in the city centre.
"We could give them lessons," he added. "Unfortunately the problem is they have no communication with us. They don't reach out.
"What they need to do is get in their car and drive around and see some of their neighbours before they throw out some orders like this.
"It's not only us, it's also the rest of the West Island. As I said on Facebook, the West Island cities can also be used as models because we get it right."
In 2015, Montreal's City Council, then under Mayor Denis Coderre, adopted a snow removal policy that standardized snow removal practices across its territory. Under the policy, snow loading operations are to commence at the same time in all 19 boroughs. The policy also sets out standards on snow clearance, spreading abrasives and snow loading.
Once the signal is given by the city centre to begin operations, ultimately the boroughs are responsible for removing snow and spreading abrasives on streets and sidewalks.
Beis admitted snow removal and de-icing by city crews can be difficult under extreme weather conditions.
"It's not always perfect because of the weather, but we certainly do a better job than some of our counterparts in the centre city. They can spew all kinds of nonsense by saying they have cars and (street) parking and whatever they want. But sidewalks don't have cars."
Beis said he was appalled by the messy road conditions while visiting a friend at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in the east end two weekends ago.
"I have to tell you it was a horror story over there. You couldn't even walk on the sidewalks and you couldn't park anywhere, and this is near a hospital.
"Downtown is the same thing, and neighbouring boroughs are the same thing."
Beis said these treacherous road conditions would be unacceptable to residents of Pierrefonds and Roxboro.
"If I had this in my community, I'd tell you I'd be out tomorrow.
"Like I've said many times, it's not perfect out here, but we know the recipe of what has to get done."

No end in sight for parents lining up overnight to register for school spots

Full text: The annual February spectacle of parents lining up overnight in the snow to enrol their children in kindergarten is likely to endure, due to current issues with overcrowding and the will of parents, the English Montreal School Board says.
Officials hope that opening a new school annex will alleviate the overcrowding issue at some of the schools.
Normally a phenomenon reserved mainly for Royal Vale School, where parents have been queuing for 30 years, lineups sprouted outside at least five westend schools over the weekend - Edinburgh, Merton, Royal Vale, Gardenview and Willingdon.
Parents shivered in the snow and freezing rain or idled in their cars to ensure their children would get one of the 17 to 40 spots remaining in each school's French-immersion kindergarten classes. Some parents at Edinburgh and Royal Vale camped out for three nights.
"All schools in the west end, they're in the same boat as the French boards are - all schools are full, or nearly full," EMSB spokesman Mike Cohen said Tuesday.
"They're bursting at the seams."
The lineups have spurred questions over whether the board should alter its registration process.
The EMSB will review its system, as it does every year, Cohen said. But the process is largely decided by the governing board of each school, and past experience has shown parents opt for lineups.
Popular for its extracurricular activities and specialized science, math and Hebrew offerings, Royal Vale has 480 spots in its elementary school. Unlike most of the 35 mainstream elementary and 16 high schools in the board, Royal Vale has no boundaries, meaning anyone from Montreal can enrol their children, creating a wider pool of possible applicants. Last weekend a tent camp housing nearly 40 people sprouted on the front grounds, with people huddling around a camp fire and watching the Super Bowl projected onto a white blanket.
"Every year we go to the principal and the governing board, they discuss (the lineups), and they decide to opt for the status quo," Cohen said. "Because the only real alternative is the lottery; beyond that, there are no real options."
This year and last were exceptional in that parents had to line up for three nights. But even after last year's wait, the school's governing board chose to stay with lining up because it gives determined parents the ability to choose by acting, as opposed to leaving it up to chance with a lottery system.
"When the topic comes up, it seems that parents prefer to have control over their children's education," said principal Nathalie Lacroix-Maillette. "They want to be able to make the decision. If it means lining up early, so be it."
Using an online registration system was rejected as well, she said, because it would only award those lucky enough to get through in the first few seconds or minutes after the registration period opened, akin to fans vying for rock-concert tickets.
Royal Vale had 40 spots available in its elementary school this year, as compared to 29 last year.
The board has proposed moving students out of the nearly empty Coronation School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and using that as an annex for one of the schools that is dealing with overcrowding. The board has proposed either Merton, Willingdon or Edinburgh use it as a junior campus for kindergarten to Grade 2. Students in Grade 3 to 6 would remain in the existing school, which means siblings could be separated.
Nearly 400 parents at Edinburgh, in Montreal West, signed a petition saying they do not want that option, preferring to have modular classes installed or a school extension to keep children together.
They say the school board should have addressed their overcrowding issues years ago.
The board has responded that modular classes are expensive and hard to attain.
A decision regarding the annex and modular classes is expected on Feb. 20, Cohen said. rbruemmer@postmedia.co

But even after last year's wait, the school's governing board chose to stay with lining up because it gives determined parents the ability to choose by acting, as opposed to leaving it up to chance with a lottery system.

"When the topic comes up, it seems that parents prefer to have control over their children's education," said principal Nathalie Lacroix-Maillette. "They want to be able to make the decision. If it means lining up early, so be it."
Using an online registration system was rejected as well, she said, because it would only award those lucky enough to get through in the first few seconds or minutes after the registration period opened, akin to fans vying for rock concert tickets.
Royal Vale had 40 spots available in its elementary school this year, as compared to 29 last year.
The board has proposed moving students out of the nearly empty Coronation School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and using that as an annex( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-wont-open-new-school-but-offers-plan-to-ease-west- end -overcrowding ) for one of the schools that is dealing with overcrowding. The board has proposed either Merton, Willingdon or Edinburgh use it as a junior campus for kindergarten to Grade 2. Students in Grade 3 to 6 would remain in the existing school, which means siblings could be separated.

A decision regarding the annex and modular classes is expected on Feb. 20, Cohen said.

Full text: The annual February spectacle of parents lining up overnight in the snow to enrol their children in kindergarten is likely to endure, due to current issues with overcrowding and the will of parents, the English Montreal School Board says.
Officials hope that opening a new school annex will alleviate the overcrowding issue at some of the schools.
Normally a phenomenon reserved mainly for Royal Vale School, where parents have been queuing for 30 years, lineups sprouted outside at least five west-end schools over the weekend - Edinburgh, Merton, Royal Vale, Gardenview and Willingdon.
Parents shivered in the snow and freezing rain or idled in their cars to ensure their children would get one of the 17 to 40 spots remaining in each school's French-immersion kindergarten classes. Some parents at Edinburgh and Royal Vale camped out for three nights.
All schools in the west end, they're in the same boat as the French boards are - all schools are full, or nearly full."
"All schools in the west end, they're in the same boat as the French boards are - all schools are full, or nearly full," EMSB spokesman Mike Cohen said Tuesday. "They're bursting at the seams."
The lineups have spurred questions over whether the board should alter its registration process. The EMSB will review its system, as it does every year, Cohen said. But the process is largely decided by the governing board of each school, and past experience has shown parents opt for lineups.
Popular for its extracurricular activities and specialized science, math and Hebrew offerings, Royal Vale has 480 spots in its elementary school. Unlike most of the 35 mainstream elementary and 16 high schools in the board, Royal Vale has no boundaries, meaning anyone from Montreal can enrol their children, creating a wider pool of possible applicants. Last weekend a mini-tent camp housing nearly 40 people sprouted on the front grounds, with people huddling around a camp fire and watching the Super Bowl projected onto a white blanket.
"Every year we go to the principal and the governing board, they discuss (the lineups), and they decide to opt for the status quo," Cohen said. "Because the only real alternative is the lottery; beyond that, there are no real options."

The warmth and fun are over: Flash freeze warning issued for Montreal

Full text: Montreal's respite from harsh winter weather is already over.
Environment Canada has issued a flash freeze warning for the areas of Montreal, Longueuil, Chateauguay and Laval.
"Temperatures are forecast to fall rapidly," the government agency warns. "Ponding water, slush, and any falling precipitation will freeze as the temperature drops."
After a warm morning, where roads and sidewalks began to thaw as temperatures climbed above zero, there's plenty of water and slush to freeze over.
The temperature in Montreal is expected to dip below zero in mid-afternoon on its way to a nighttime low of minus 12 degrees Celsius.
Cameron McConnell enjoys a mild winter morning as he heads to class at Concordia University in Montreal, on Tuesday, February 5, 2019.Earlier on Tuesday the Commission scolaire des Samares and Commission scolaire des Laurentides( https://www.cslaurentides.qc.ca/ ) schools announced that their schools would be closed for the day. A number of schools in the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board are also closed( https://www.swlauriersb.qc.ca/?page=EMERGENCYCLOSURES_MORE ).
The flash freeze is expected to complicate matters over the next 24 hours and produce a difficult Wednesday morning commute.
Another low pressure system is expected to create another meteorological roller coaster on Thursday and Friday.
The forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) for the coming weekend is sunny but cold, with a high for Saturday of minus 11.

Full text: First there was ice, now there's water - and soon it may all be ice again.
Montrealers woke up to a Tuesday morning without any weather warnings from Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ), but a glance outside their windows confirmed that one warning still applies: Be careful out there.
The forecast high for Tuesday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-63Rh ) could reach 6 degrees Celsius, but much of what melts could later be freeze over as temperatures are forecast to drop to minus 10 by midnight and minus 14 in time for the Wednesday morning commute.
While the city of Montreal has said its priority is to spread abrasives to lessen the risk to motorists and pedestrians, the results Tuesday morning were mixed. Major thoroughfares( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) were mostly ice free but still patched with some ice. Sidewalks on side streets - even those downtown - were frosted with a new layer of ice that forced some pedestrians into the street.
Environment Canada's freezing rain warning remains in effect for Québec, Saguenay, and the Charlevoix and Rimouski areas.
Transports Québec reported that by sunrise Tuesday many highways and roads were covered in ice, most notably Highway 20 between Ontario and Montreal, Highway 50 in the Outaouais, Highway 132 in the Montérégie, Highway 125 in Lanaudière, Highway 175 in the Réserve faunique des Laurentides and Highway 40 between Trois-Rivières and Quebec City.
All Commission scolaire des Samares and Commission scolaire des Laurentides( https://www.cslaurentides.qc.ca/ ) schools are closed for the day, as are a number of schools in the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board( https://www.swlauriersb.qc.ca/?page=EMERGENCYCLOSURES_MORE ).
While the Tuesday-Wednesday flash freeze will complicate matters over the next 24 hours, another low pressure system is expected to create another meteorological roller coaster for Thursday-Friday.
The forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) for the coming weekend is sunny but cold, with a forecast high for Saturday of minus 11.

"I did this involuntarily," Picciuto said Saturday morning, after spending the night in his car, parked in front of the school. "I came to the school to find out how many spots were left after sibling registration and found out there were 17 spots. I came back out and phoned my wife, and someone pulled up beside me and said: 'Are you waiting in line?' I said: 'I guess I am now.' Within a half an hour, there were six of us."
Picciuto, who lives two blocks from the school, began standing in line Friday afternoon( https://montrealgazette.com/news/its-madness-parents-lining-up-ahead-of-monday-school-registration ) so his son Sal could get one of the limited spots available for new kindergarten students next September. He plans to be in front of the school until Monday morning when the school opens its doors for registration.
Picciuto wrote his name on a paper posted on the school's front door, his waiting period starting around 5 p.m. Friday. By Saturday morning, 12 other parents were also in line, and by Sunday evening, two more had joined the lineup. This is the second year in a row parents have been lining up for a spot in Edinburgh, though last year, parents only started their campout on the day before school registration began.

Edinburgh has been dealing with an overcrowding problem for several years, and while the school board has said it could add temporary classrooms or accommodate students in a nearly empty school nearby, nothing has so far been decided. If no extra places are created, there will likely only be 17 spots for new students in two kindergarten classes next year, as siblings get priority. That's up from 12 spots last year.
Picciuto said he was spending the whole weekend parked in his car in front of the school because he wants his two sons, age 5 and 3, to be in a French immersion program.
"It's the only French immersion school in the district. I think in this day and age it's ridiculous that we have to do this, but it's a good community. They make it very easy. It has been peaceful and fun. These are good people."
Andrea Palumbo and her husband were taking turns doing 12-hour shifts over the weekend in a bid to secure two places for their four-and-a-half-year-old twin girls at the school.
"Edinburgh was my own elementary school and we moved back to the area with the hope that they would go here. So there's an element of nostalgia," she said, when asked why it is so important that her kids go to this school.
As they shivered in the cold, snow, and later Sunday, freezing rain, Palumbo said parents had a lot of time to discuss why the board has not introduced a better system for deciding who gets the spaces. An online system or a lottery would be better than having people wait outside in severe winter weather, she said, adding it is "excessive" and possibly dangerous.
"It would only take one incident for this not to be seen as a positive PR exercise," she added.
Cars parked on Hudson Ave. in front of the school had yellow Bristol boards propped up on the windshields bearing the names of those waiting and their number on the list.
Edinburgh's governing board had been trying to avoid such a scenario, working with the English Montreal School Board since June to try to free up more space. It asked the EMSB if it could take over nearby Mountainview School, which is 400 metres away, but the school board decided the at-risk high school students who attend Mountainview need their own building.
The board has not yet responded to a request to install portable, modular classrooms( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/parents-at-emsbs-edinburgh-school-seek-modular-classrooms-to-ease-overcrowding ) at Edinburgh, and if that request is accepted a third kindergarten class will be opened and there will be ample room to accept more students.
"Why is this happening again this year when it was predictable and preventable? It's a bit silly to say the least," said Adrienne Winrow, No. 10 on the list for a place at Edinburgh.
She worries about elitism.
"The public schools are supposed to be accessible to all," Winrow said. "We are people who have partners, families, cars that can keep us warm all night. One family who couldn't be here constantly has (paid) people to fill in for them. That takes resources that not everyone has. There are single parents who don't have access to resources that would allow them to do this for three nights and three days. That's inequitable."
But Edinburgh isn't the only school dealing with overcrowding. About 20 people were waiting in their cars outside Merton School in Côte-St-Luc Sunday evening, in a lineup that began just before 6 a.m..

Ali Maislin, first in line, said the parents were told there would be two kindergartens of 21 children each, and that siblings of kids already at the school had priority. That meant one classroom was already full.
"So that leaves about 20 spots left for a zoned school, for the only decent public school in the English Montreal School Board in this zone, so you gotta do what you gotta do," Maislin said.
She was worried about the dangers of parents waiting in freezing temperatures.
"I hope it's not going to take a catastrophe for the school board to look at change," she said. But she added that some parents are concerned that a lottery, or an online sign-up system might be open to tampering.
"A lot parents stand by this system. They say this is the only way to keep it 100 per cent honest and clean," she said.
Parents keep warm with a fire, and entertained watching the Super bowl in front of Royal Vale School in anticipation of getting a place for their children starting kindergarten on Sunday.
At Royal Vale School - also in N.D.G. - where parents have been lining up for roughly the last 30 years( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/parents-camp-out-at-royal-vale-school-for-precious-kindergarten-spots ), the atmosphere was almost festive on Sunday evening. Some parents had pitched tents, others were huddled around a bonfire watching the Super Bowl, which someone had managed to stream from a cell phone and project onto a white blanket.
On the door of the school was a hand-drawn list with 36 names on it, each hoping to snag one of 40 spots expected to be available next September.
Erik Nisbet wasn't aware of a pact made on Facebook by prospective parents to hold off on camping out until at least Saturday. He showed up with his tent on Friday to be first in line.
"I'm not on social media and, apparently, there was a huge group that decided not to camp out on Friday. I didn't know about that, but I was told by several people to get here early. I heard there would only be 17 spots, so the pressure was on," said Nisbet. "I was called all sorts of names when people saw me here, but people can be angry at me all they want. I just want to do what I can so my son gets a good education."
EMSB spokesperson Mike Cohen said the lineups are a good sign schools are offering excellent education options that are popular with parents.
"It's the greatest form of flattery," Cohen said. "We have been asked: 'Can't you do something for the parents and let them inside the school for the weekend?' People have to understand our registration is Monday morning. We don't advertise that people have to sleep on the street. We simply say for the whole system, that's when registration begins. There happens to be a growing number of schools that are extremely popular, and parents know that if they go sleep outside, there's an honour system and that will be a way for them to get into the school. We don't discourage it, but we don't promote it."
Cohen said there could be more space available next year because the board has proposed moving students out of the nearly empty Coronation School and using that as an annex( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-wont-open-new-school-but-offers-plan-to-ease-west- end -overcrowding ) for one of the schools that is dealing with overcrowding. The board has proposed either Merton, Willingdon or Edinburgh take over the building and use it as a junior campus for kindergarten to Grade 2. Students in Grade 3 to 6 would remain in the existing school, which means siblings could be separated. The governing boards of the three schools will discuss the plan and the EMSB will make a final decision on which school would get to use Coronation as an annex by Feb. 20.

Full text: Mike Picciuto didn't intend on being the first person in line to get his son into Edinburgh School - it just worked out that way.
"I did this involuntarily," Picciuto said Saturday morning, after spending the night in his car, parked in front of the school. "I came to the school to find out how many spots were left after sibling registration and found out there were 17 spots. I came back out and phoned my wife, and someone pulled up beside me and said: 'Are you waiting in line?'I said: 'I guess I am now.'Within a half an hour, there were six of us."
Picciuto, who lives two blocks from the school, began standing in line Friday afternoon so his son Sal could get one of the limited spots available for new kindergarten students next September. He plans to be in front of the school until Monday morning when the school opens its doors for registration.
Picciuto wrote his name on a paper posted on the school's front door, his waiting period starting around 5 p.m. Friday. By Saturday morning, 12 other parents were also in line, and by Sunday evening, two more had joined the lineup. This is the second year in a row parents have been lining up for a spot in Edinburgh, though last year, parents only started their campout on the day before school registration began.
Edinburgh has been dealing with an overcrowding problem for several years, and while the school board has said it could add temporary classrooms or accommodate students in a nearly empty school nearby, nothing has so far been decided. If no extra places are created, there will likely only be 17 spots for new students in two kindergarten classes next year, as siblings get priority. That's up from 12 spots last year.
Picciuto said he was spending the whole weekend parked in his car in front of the school because he wants his two sons, age 5 and 3, to be in a French immersion program.
"It's the only French immersion school in the district. I think in this day and age it's ridiculous that we have to do this, but it's a good community.
They make it very easy. It has been peaceful and fun. These are good people."
Andrea Palumbo and her husband were taking turns doing 12-hour shifts over the weekend in a bid to secure two places for their four-and-a-half-year-old twin girls at the school.
"Edinburgh was my own elementary school and we moved back to the area with the hope that they would go here. So there's an element of nostalgia," she said, when asked why it is so important that her kids go to this school.
As they shivered in the cold, snow, and later Sunday, freezing rain, Palumbo said parents had a lot of time to discuss why the board has not introduced a better system for deciding who gets the spaces. An online system or a lottery would be better than having people wait outside in severe winter weather, she said, adding it is "excessive" and possibly dangerous.
"It would only take one incident for this not to be seen as a positive PR exercise," she added.

She worries about elitism. "The public schools are supposed to be accessible to all," Winrow said. "We are people who have partners, families, cars that can keep us warm all night. One family who couldn't be here constantly has (paid) people to fill in for them. That takes resources that not everyone has.

"A lot parents stand by this system. They say this is the only way to keep it 100 per cent honest and clean," she said.
At Royal Vale School - also in N.D.G. - where parents have been lining up for roughly the last 30 years, the atmosphere was almost festive on Sunday evening. Some parents had pitched tents, others were huddled around a bonfire watching the Super Bowl, which someone had managed to stream from a cellphone and project onto a white blanket.
On the door of the school was a hand-drawn list with 36 names on it, each hoping to snag one of 40 spots expected to be available next September.
Erik Nisbet wasn't aware of a pact made on Facebook by prospective parents to hold off on camping out until at least Saturday. He showed up with his tent on Friday to be first in line.
"I'm not on social media and, apparently, there was a huge group that decided not to camp out on Friday. I didn't know about that, but I was told by several people to get here early.

I just want to do what I can so my son gets a good education."
EMSB spokesperson Mike Cohen said the lineups are a good sign schools are offering excellent education options that are popular with parents.
"It's the greatest form of flattery," Cohen said. "We have been asked: 'Can't you do something for the parents and let them inside the school for the weekend?'People have to understand our registration is Monday morning. We don't advertise that people have to sleep on the street. We simply say for the whole system, that's when registration begins. There happens to be a growing number of schools that are extremely popular, and parents know that if they go sleep outside, there's an honour system and that will be a way for them to get into the school. We don't discourage it, but we don't promote it."
Cohen said there could be more space available next year because the board has proposed moving students out of the nearly empty Coronation School and using that as an annex for one of the schools that is dealing with overcrowding. The board has proposed either Merton, Willingdon or Edinburgh take over the building and use it as a junior campus for kindergarten to Grade 2. Students in Grade 3 to 6 would remain in the existing school, which means siblings could be separated. The governing boards of the three schools will discuss the plan and the EMSB will make a final decision on which school would get to use Coronation as an annex by Feb. 20. jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

At Montreal's best English public schools, parents camp out all weekend for a spot in kindergarten

Full text: Mike Picciuto didn't intend on being the first person in line to get his son into Edinburgh School - it just worked out that way.
"I did this involuntarily," Picciuto said Saturday morning, after spending the night in his car, parked in front of the school. "I came to the school to find out how many spots were left after sibling registration and found out there were 17 spots. I came back out and phoned my wife, and someone pulled up beside me and said: 'Are you waiting in line?' I said: 'I guess I am now.' Within a half an hour, there were six of us."
Picciuto, who lives two blocks from the school, began standing in line Friday afternoon( https://montrealgazette.com/news/its-madness-parents-lining-up-ahead-of-monday-school-registration ) so his son Sal could get one of the limited spots available for new kindergarten students next September. He plans to be in front of the school until Monday morning when the school opens its doors for registration.
Picciuto wrote his name on a paper posted on the school's front door, his waiting period starting around 5 p.m. Friday. By Saturday morning, 12 other parents were also in line, and by Sunday evening, two more had joined the lineup. This is the second year in a row parents have been lining up for a spot in Edinburgh, though last year, parents only started their campout on the day before school registration began.
Andrea Plaumbo, left, Mike Picciuto and Adrienne Winrow wait outside the front door of Edinburgh Elementary School in Montreal in anticipation of getting a place for their children starting kindergarten on Sunday.
Edinburgh has been dealing with an overcrowding problem for several years, and while the school board has said it could add temporary classrooms or accommodate students in a nearly empty school nearby, nothing has so far been decided. If no extra places are created, there will likely only be 17 spots for new students in two kindergarten classes next year, as siblings get priority. That's up from 12 spots last year.
Picciuto said he was spending the whole weekend parked in his car in front of the school because he wants his two sons, age 5 and 3, to be in a French immersion program.
"It's the only French immersion school in the district. I think in this day and age it's ridiculous that we have to do this, but it's a good community. They make it very easy. It has been peaceful and fun. These are good people."
Andrea Palumbo and her husband were taking turns doing 12-hour shifts over the weekend in a bid to secure two places for their four-and-a-half-year-old twin girls at the school.
"Edinburgh was my own elementary school and we moved back to the area with the hope that they would go here. So there's an element of nostalgia," she said, when asked why it is so important that her kids go to this school.
As they shivered in the cold, snow, and later Sunday, freezing rain, Palumbo said parents had a lot of time to discuss why the board has not introduced a better system for deciding who gets the spaces. An online system or a lottery would be better than having people wait outside in severe winter weather, she said, adding it is "excessive" and possibly dangerous.
"It would only take one incident for this not to be seen as a positive PR exercise," she added.
Cars parked on Hudson Ave. in front of the school had yellow Bristol boards propped up on the windshields bearing the names of those waiting and their number on the list.
Edinburgh's governing board had been trying to avoid such a scenario, working with the English Montreal School Board since June to try to free up more space. It asked the EMSB if it could take over nearby Mountainview School, which is 400 metres away, but the school board decided the at-risk high school students who attend Mountainview need their own building.
The board has not yet responded to a request to install portable, modular classrooms( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/parents-at-emsbs-edinburgh-school-seek-modular-classrooms-to-ease-overcrowding ) at Edinburgh, and if that request is accepted a third kindergarten class will be opened and there will be ample room to accept more students.
"Why is this happening again this year when it was predictable and preventable? It's a bit silly to say the least," said Adrienne Winrow, No. 10 on the list for a place at Edinburgh.
She worries about elitism.
"The public schools are supposed to be accessible to all," Winrow said. "We are people who have partners, families, cars that can keep us warm all night. One family who couldn't be here constantly has (paid) people to fill in for them. That takes resources that not everyone has. There are single parents who don't have access to resources that would allow them to do this for three nights and three days. That's inequitable."
But Edinburgh isn't the only school dealing with overcrowding. About 20 people were waiting in their cars outside Merton School in Côte-St-Luc Sunday evening, in a lineup that began just before 6 a.m..
Ali Maislin sits in her car outside of Merton School in Côte-St-Luc in anticipation of getting a place for her child starting kindergarten on Sunday.
Ali Maislin, first in line, said the parents were told there would be two kindergartens of 21 children each, and that siblings of kids already at the school had priority. That meant one classroom was already full.
"So that leaves about 20 spots left for a zoned school, for the only decent public school in the English Montreal School Board in this zone, so you gotta do what you gotta do," Maislin said.
She was worried about the dangers of parents waiting in freezing temperatures.
"I hope it's not going to take a catastrophe for the school board to look at change," she said. But she added that some parents are concerned that a lottery, or an online sign-up system might be open to tampering.
"A lot parents stand by this system. They say this is the only way to keep it 100 per cent honest and clean," she said.
Parents keep warm with a fire, and entertained watching the Super bowl in front of Royal Vale School in anticipation of getting a place for their children starting kindergarten on Sunday.
At Royal Vale School - also in N.D.G. - where parents have been lining up for roughly the last 30 years( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/parents-camp-out-at-royal-vale-school-for-precious-kindergarten-spots ), the atmosphere was almost festive on Sunday evening. Some parents had pitched tents, others were huddled around a bonfire watching the Super Bowl, which someone had managed to stream from a cell phone and project onto a white blanket.
On the door of the school was a hand-drawn list with 36 names on it, each hoping to snag one of 40 spots expected to be available next September.
Erik Nisbet wasn't aware of a pact made on Facebook by prospective parents to hold off on camping out until at least Saturday. He showed up with his tent on Friday to be first in line.
"I'm not on social media and, apparently, there was a huge group that decided not to camp out on Friday. I didn't know about that, but I was told by several people to get here early. I heard there would only be 17 spots, so the pressure was on," said Nisbet. "I was called all sorts of names when people saw me here, but people can be angry at me all they want. I just want to do what I can so my son gets a good education."
EMSB spokesperson Mike Cohen said the lineups are a good sign schools are offering excellent education options that are popular with parents.
"It's the greatest form of flattery," Cohen said. "We have been asked: 'Can't you do something for the parents and let them inside the school for the weekend?' People have to understand our registration is Monday morning. We don't advertise that people have to sleep on the street. We simply say for the whole system, that's when registration begins. There happens to be a growing number of schools that are extremely popular, and parents know that if they go sleep outside, there's an honour system and that will be a way for them to get into the school. We don't discourage it, but we don't promote it."
Cohen said there could be more space available next year because the board has proposed moving students out of the nearly empty Coronation School and using that as an annex( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-wont-open-new-school-but-offers-plan-to-ease-west- end -overcrowding ) for one of the schools that is dealing with overcrowding. The board has proposed either Merton, Willingdon or Edinburgh take over the building and use it as a junior campus for kindergarten to Grade 2. Students in Grade 3 to 6 would remain in the existing school, which means siblings could be separated. The governing boards of the three schools will discuss the plan and the EMSB will make a final decision on which school would get to use Coronation as an annex by Feb. 20.

What they call in U.S. a national emergency we just call winter

Full text: Dear America: I've been following your "extreme weather" news coverage, and I know you've been in crisis - under assault from the polar vortex.
There were "whiteouts" in North Dakota, scary weekly snowfalls of 37 inches in Buffalo, and temperatures plunging to minus 23 F (minus -30.5 C) in Chicago with a "real feel" of minus 29 F (minus -33.8 C).
The New York Times calls it "The Big Freeze" - but frankly, it just sounds like another winter day in Quebec and Canada.
Here in Montreal, we've been going through rougher weather for weeks: an ever-changing smorgasbord of blizzards, followed by rainstorms, followed by freezing temperatures, murderous wind chills, treacherous ice.
But for us, it's just crummy winter weather, while for you it's a national emergency. U.S. governors declared national disasters, closing schools and universities for days. Iowa officials warned people to "avoid taking deep breaths, and to minimize talking" if they stepped outside.
Newspaper headlines across America shrieked it was "colder than Alaska" ... "colder than Antarctica" ... "colder than Mars."
Reading it all, I certainly felt some sympathy, since we Montrealers have been there often. But I did have mixed feelings. I confess that like many people here, I also got a certain satisfaction from knowing you were sharing our pain.
It's that unique Canadian joy of knowing others are as cold, or colder than us.
I call that feeling schaden-froid, my version of the German word schadenfreude, which means the guilty happiness you sometimes get from someone else's misfortune.
You may experience schadenfreude when your office rival has just been fired, or your ex-boyfriend's house has burned down, or you've just heard someone you don't like mispronounce the fancy German word schadenfreude.
In fact, I rarely get more response to this column than when things in my life go wrong, whether I lose my phone, drop my car keys down a drain or my balcony gets taken over by pigeons.
I've often said the worse my week, the happier I make my readers, as they experience schadenFreed. But schaden-froid is a unique and especially powerful emotion here in Canada during winter, when we all get a tiny bit of joy from other countries' cold.
It's nothing personal, America, just part of being a Canadian and especially a Montrealer, who lives in one of the coldest, snowiest cities on Earth.
After all, we know people elsewhere are always hearing about our winter weather and thinking: "Boy, I'm happy I don't live there!" So it's only natural for us to do the same when we get a rare chance.
But schaden-froid actually runs much deeper in our Canadian psyche. That's why when Canadians go away on winter holiday, they obsessively follow the weather back home, eager to see what they've escaped.
"Listen up everyone! It's minus 28 in Montreal today, with 43 centimetres of snow expected tomorrow," they'll announce gleefully to everyone on their Costa Rican beach. "Wow, I'm glad I'm not there, heh-heh."
Part of any good Canadian winter holiday is knowing what others at home are living through that you're not.
That's also why in Florida, the Weather Network gets huge ratings whenever there's a winter storm in the North. It's a million Canadian snowbirds (and New England ones) all dying to see what horrible weather they're missing.
That said, you can only take this sleazy emotion so far. People enjoying a little schaden-froid should always do it politely, and even secretly - keeping it between others in the same temperature zone as them.
No one wants to get an email photo of you sacked out on the beach, a margarita in your hand, while they're waiting for the 15 bus, in -22 degrees, while hanging onto the bus stop pole to keep from slipping on a five-inchthick slab of glacial sidewalk ice.
So don't be a schaden-showoff
- and keep your schaden-froid to yourself. In fact, if you're on an exotic vacation and sending photos, I'd prefer to see one of you caught in a tropical storm.
Besides, you'll get plenty of schaden-envy once you get home - and every last person you meet says: "Boy, you really timed your holiday well, It was as cold as Mars here, only worse."
But of course how couldn't you time your vacation well, when you took it during the middle of a Montreal winter? Yet for all my schaden-froid about the recent U.S. cold snap, I also feel some schaden-shame - a twinge of guilt for feeling good about their weather misfortune.
After all, I know people in the U.S. were freezing, or without power, or worse, while thousands of flights were cancelled.
I ask myself: How can I be so heartless, so petty, so shallow, so mean? My schaden-froid and my schaden-shame struggle like angels and devils on my shoulder - fighting for my soul.
Yet somehow my schaden-froid often wins and I suspect yours does, too. But if you want to know why, you'll have to read Freud, not Freed. joshfreed49@gmail.com

Going places never easy in winter's messy conditions

Full text: I am finding lately that getting around anywhere is somewhat of an adventure. Or should I say misadventure? Usually, I take the train from Pointe-Claire to work downtown but sometimes I need to drive in. Last week, on such an occasion, there were no fewer than four cars stopped on different sections of the Decarie expressway, making the already messy drive agonizingly slow. There were flares set up behind one of the cars and I saw a worker filling a pothole the size of a small crater. Passing close to two of the cars, I saw they had badly damaged tires, obviously having made an unfortunate acquaintance with one of Montreal's infamous "nids de poule."
On the drive home to the West Island, all seemed to be going well and I was feeling quite pleased at being able to access westbound St-Jacques from Decarie Boulevard, until a police cruiser pulled in front of an intersection with flashers on and closed the street, detouring everyone up to St-Antoine, which had met a similar fate. All routes were sadly red on my trusty Waze app and I found myself crawling through stops and lights with hundreds of other drivers heading to the 15 to take the 40 home. Just another day on the road, right? Cold, rain, ice, snow. Potholes, traffic, road closures. It really makes one long for warm weather.
But heading for sunshine anywhere on an airline has its own set of challenges.
A few weeks ago, I headed down to Mexico. To catch a 7 a.m.
flight, I left the house at 4 a.m., which is a wonderful time to drive if you want to avoid traffic, although it won't help with the potholes.
Not only does air travel take a lot longer with security checks and lineups, but it has become more expensive with additional charges for luggage and seat selection, and more stressful with people vying to board early so they can find space in the overhead compartment for their carry-ons.
Self check-in and printing your own boarding pass should make things cheaper, but airlines are trying to make additional money on seat selections. They are shortening the time for online seat selection from 24 to 12 hours and the time when you can select your seat only at boarding is coming. Soon families will find themselves spread out all over the airplane, unless they are willing to dish out $40 per person (on Sunwing) for a return trip.
Once you are finally on the plane, forget about thinking of catching up on any sleep. The compulsory safety instructions are followed by lengthy advertorials for excursions, menu selections and duty-free purchases. As a result, you are wide-awake and ready for the inflight movie, but with the seat headphone jacks not functioning, you can only watch in frustrated silence and maybe practise your lip-reading skills or compose angry letters to Sunwing that you will never mail.
As I trudge to the train wearing my crampons and praying the train is on time, I hope that soon there will be a snowfall not followed by freezing rain so that I may cross-country ski at Cap St-Jacques, and I remind myself that spring is less than two months away. Hallelujah! Suzanne Korf, a resident of Pointe-Claire since 1991, is a professional fundraiser who has worked for non-profit organizations for more than 25 years. She is a senior director of development for the Montreal Children's Hospital Foundation.

Full text: I am finding lately that getting around anywhere is somewhat of an adventure. Or should I say misadventure?
Usually, I take the train from Pointe-Claire to work downtown but sometimes I need to drive in. Last week, on such an occasion, there were no less than four cars stopped on different sections of the Decarie expressway, making the already messy drive agonizingly slow. There were flares set up behind one of the cars and I saw a worker filling a pothole the size of a small crater. Passing close to two of the cars, I saw they had badly damaged tires, obviously having made an unfortunate acquaintance with one of Montreal's infamous "nids de poule".
On the drive home to the West Island, all seemed to be going well and I was feeling quite pleased at being able to access west-bound St-Jacques from Decarie Boulevard, until a police cruiser pulled in front of an intersection with flashers on and closed the street, detouring everyone up to St-Antoine which had met a similar fate. All routes were sadly red on my trusty Waze app and I found myself crawling through stops and lights with hundreds of other drivers heading to the 15 to take the 40 home. Just another day on the road, right?
Cold, rain, ice, snow. Potholes, traffic, road closures. It really makes one long for warm weather. But heading for sunshine anywhere on an airline has its own set of challenges.
A few weeks ago, I headed down to Mexico. To catch a 7 a.m. flight, I left the house at 4 a.m. which is a wonderful time to drive if you want to avoid traffic, although it won't help with the potholes.
Not only does air travel take a lot longer with security checks and lineups, but it has become more expensive with additional charges for luggage and seat selection, and more stressful with people vying to board early so they can find space in the overhead compartment for their carry-ons.
Self check-in and printing your own boarding pass should make things cheaper, but airlines are trying to make additional money on seat selections. They are shortening the time for online seat selection from 24 to 12 hours and the time when you can select your seat only at boarding is coming. Soon families will find themselves spread out all over the airplane, unless they are willing to dish out $40 per person (on Sunwing) for a return trip.

Full text: In Case You Missed It (#ICYMI) is a daily feature highlighting news in and around Montreal.
To many police investigators familiar with the many conflicts Tony Magi seemed to be involved in over the course of many years, what happened in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce on Thursday was inevitable. Magi, a construction entrepreneur who once had close business ties to Montreal Mafia leader and survived being kidnapped in April 2005 and at least three attempts on his life that followed, died shortly after he was taken to a hospital after having been shot.

Montreal women's march to be held downtown Saturday

Full text: A rally in support of advancing gender equality and empowering women is set for downtown Montreal at midday on Saturday.
The Montreal event, one of dozens of marches or rallies scheduled across Canada on Saturday as part of Women's March Canada( https://www.womensmarchcanada.com/ ), is starting out at Place Émilie Gamelin at 11 a.m. and is expected to last until about 1 p.m.
UPDATE: WE WILL BE MEETING AT PLACE GAMELIN - BERRI UQAM METRO.

Organizers of this year's protest in Montreal( https://www.womensmarchcanada.com/women_s_march_canada_montreal_20190119 ) say on their site that "the progress made in 2017 was not enough. There is still so much work to do to protect and advance the rights of women, and the rights of all vulnerable citizens in our country."
The original Women's March in Washington in 2017 was held the day after U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration, drawing hundreds of thousands of people. The exact size of the turnout remains subject to a politically charged debate, but it's generally regarded as the largest Washington protest since the Vietnam era.
Organizer this year submitted a permit application estimating that up to 500,000 people would participate, but the actual turnout is expected to be far lower. Parallel marches were planned in dozens of U.S. cities, across Canada and around the world.
The original plan in Washington called for participants to gather on the National Mall. But with the forecast calling for snow and freezing rain and the National Park Service no longer plowing the snow, organizers changed the march's location and route to start at Freedom Plaza, a few blocks from the White House, and head down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Trump International Hotel.

Pedestrians Are On Thin Ice; Making our slippery sidewalks safe isn't as easy as you might think

Full text: Our city merits a far better theme song than Tourisme Montréal's just-launched and excessively kitschy Reviens-moi - which doesn't even name Montreal.
I propose Vanilla Ice's vintage Ice Ice Baby, which doesn't name the city either, but whose creators must have had Montreal in mind. The tune is catchier and one can even dance to it - except on Montreal sidewalks.
"Yo, VIP, let's kick it Ice ice baby Ice ice baby ..." But please, don't kick it, because you could wind up in a hospital emergency ward, having to deal with anything from a badly bruised behind to a broken hand or hip, or a combination thereof.
Our sidewalks have morphed into skating rinks. Perhaps you've even taken the plunge, unintentionally performing a double Lutz before landing on your butt. One would have to possess the dexterity of a Cirque du Soleil performer not to go Slip Slidin'Away (another candidate for city anthem) while trying to walk one's pooch.
Admittedly, it doesn't help that climate change has resulted in wildly fluctuating temperatures and rapid weather shifts, leading to snow, ice pellets, freezing rain and sundry plagues from the heavens that have left our sidewalks in perilous conditions at times.
The good news is that the Plante administration is ready for battle. The city even purchased eight croque-glaces - which only sounds like designer cocktails or sandwiches made of ice. At a cost of nearly $20,000 each, they are actually ice-crushers or chewers - sidewalk plows replete with rotating, spiked barrels that can eradicate cursed crusts by reducing them to shreds of slush. Swell. The bad news is that our croque-glaces have had to stay in garages. While our sidewalks are slippery enough, it seems there isn't enough ice for us to utilize these gizmos.
Our sidewalk ice is just too thin.
A thickness of at least one inch is required before the croque-glaces are let loose.
So I guess the answer is that we will have to water our sidewalks, then wait for them to freeze in order to achieve the mandatory ice for the city to deploy its mini-army of croque-glaces.
In the interim, some citizens have taken to attaching crampons to their boots, because nothing else seems to work. Our current mix of salt and sand has been largely ineffective. And no one appears to have come up with some magical, cost-effective abrasive that can actually melt ice without forever damaging the environment.
Some have even suggested grandiose antidotes to our winter, such as erecting a massive dome over the city.
As an ex-chemist and inventor, not to mention inveterate walker, one might expect former Westmount mayor Peter Trent to be secretly working in his lab to come up with some ice-combating concoction.
Alas, he is not. "Unlike many people, I don't get too exercised about the use of salt," Trent says. "First, it is an absolute necessity for safety, especially in hillier parts of the city, and there really is no other alternative. Nor am I absolutely convinced it is so terrible for the environment, and being someone so concerned about the environment, I have never seen many studies proving the use of salt is really deleterious."
But salt is not effective in particularly cold weather, which is problematic. Ideally, sidewalks would be salted before ice is formed, but one would have to be a psychic to determine when that might be. There are also other de-icers out there, but they are far more costly than salt.
Trent is not high on a dome - although citizens might be, with all the accumulation of second-hand weed smoke.
"Quite apart from the cost, the resultant ventilation and condensation problems and buildup of gases would be horrendous within a dome," says Trent, an inventor of polymer composite material who has several worldwide patents to his name.
But Trent is high on heated sidewalks. "I'm a huge fan, but not all sidewalks - on heavily travelled ones, particularly downtown. It so improves livability in the city."
The Plante administration put the kibosh on heating Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks - first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre - largely because of cost.
"In heavily used areas, it's economically logical," notes Trent, who was recently appointed to the STM's board of directors. "It's an investment for the downtown retail trade, which will pay off in the long run.
"But, really, whatever that cost may be, is it enough to allow people to have an accident that could incapacitate them not just for months, but maybe years? That is catastrophic. We really have to think about the quality of life of our citizens." bbrownstein@postmedia.com Twitter.com/billbrownstein

One would have to possess the dexterity of a Cirque du Soleil performer not to go Slip Slidin' Away (another candidate for city anthem) while trying to walk one's pooch.
Admittedly, it doesn't help that climate change has resulted in wildly fluctuating temperatures and rapid weather shifts, leading to snow, ice pellets, freezing rain and sundry plagues from the heavens that have left our sidewalks in perilous conditions at times.
The good news is that the Plante administration is ready for battle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/icy-conditions-persist-and-valerie-plante-wants-answers-again ). The city even purchased eight croque-glaces - which only sounds like designer cocktails or sandwiches made of ice. At a cost of nearly $20,000 each, they are actually ice-crushers or chewers - sidewalk plows replete with rotating, spiked barrels that can eradicate cursed crusts by reducing them to shreds of slush.
Swell.
The bad news is that our croque-glaces have had to stay in garages. While our sidewalks are slippery enough, it seems there isn't enough ice for us to utilize these gizmos.
Our sidewalk ice is just too thin. A thickness of at least one inch is required before the croque-glaces are let loose.
So I guess the answer is that we will have to water our sidewalks, then wait for them to freeze in order to achieve the mandatory ice for the city to deploy its mini-army of croque-glaces.
In the interim, some citizens have taken to attaching crampons to their boots, because nothing else seems to work. Our current mix of salt and sand has been largely ineffective. And no one appears to have come up with some magical, cost-effective abrasive that can actually melt ice without forever damaging the environment.
Some have even suggested grandiose antidotes to our winter, such as erecting a massive dome over the city.
As an ex-chemist and inventor, not to mention inveterate walker, one might expect former Westmount mayor Peter Trent to be secretly working in his lab to come up with some ice-combatting concoction.
Alas, he is not.
"Unlike many people, I don't get too exercised about the use of salt," Trent says. "First, it is an absolute necessity for safety, especially in hillier parts of the city, and there really is no other alternative. Nor am I absolutely convinced it is so terrible for the environment, and being someone so concerned about the environment, I have never seen many studies proving the use of salt is really deleterious."
But salt is not effective in particularly cold weather, which is problematic. Ideally, sidewalks would be salted before ice is formed, but one would have to be a psychic to determine when that might be. There are also other de-icers out there, but they are far more costly than salt.
Trent is not high on a dome - although citizens might be, with all the accumulation of second-hand weed smoke.
"Quite apart from the cost, the resultant ventilation and condensation problems and buildup of gases would be horrendous within a dome," says Trent, an inventor of polymer composite material who has several worldwide patents to his name.
But Trent is high on heated sidewalks. "I'm a huge fan, but not all sidewalks - on heavily travelled ones, particularly downtown. It so improves livability in the city."
The Plante administration put the kibosh on heating Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ) - first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre - largely because of cost.
"In heavily used areas, it's economically logical," notes Trent, who was recently appointed to the STM's board of directors( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-shakes-up-its-board-ejects-marvin-rotrand-and-welcomes-peter-trent ). "It's an investment for the downtown retail trade, which will pay off in the long run.
"But, really, whatever that cost may be, is it enough to allow people to have an accident that could incapacitate them not just for months, but maybe years? That is catastrophic. We really have to think about the quality of life of our citizens."

Full text: The first of two storms expected to sweep across much of Quebec between Tuesday and Thursday made itself felt early Tuesday.
Expected to drop anywhere between 10 to 15 centimetres of snow over the next two days, the storm system hit the Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Outaouais regions on Monday, moved in to the Montreal area Monday night and barrelled toward the eastern half of the province on Tuesday morning.
Environment Canada warned that certain areas could expect a tough morning commute( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-winter-snow-blowing-snow-rain ) and that prediction was realized on and off the island of Montreal. While the snow had stopped by 7:30 a.m., blowing snow and road conditions ranging from wet pavement to snow or slush-covered slowed traffic on Montreal Island highways and was blamed for several multi-vehicle accidents on the north and the South Shores. The eastbound lanes of Highway 10 in Chambly were temporarily closed after two tractor trailers skidded off the road.
Less than a day after Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante questioned the efficiency of her city's snow removal operations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/icy-conditions-persist-and-valerie-plante-wants-answers-again ), city crews were out in force at 1 a.m. Tuesday, concentrating on access to schools, hospitals, métro stations and bus stops as well as main thoroughfares.
Approximately 1,000 vehicles have been deployed by the city and are expected to be in operation for four to eight hours after the snowfall ends.
The city of Montreal says it expects to gradually begin snow removal operations as of 7 a.m. Wednesday.
Transport Quebec reported that the situation on many highways in the storm's path was complicated by blowing snow, which reduces visibility and creates snow dunes on exposed stretches of road.
Highways affected by the windswept conditions include Highways 30 and 104 in the Montérégie region as well as Highways 50 and 148 in the Outaouais and Highway 116 in the Eastern Townships.
The forecast for Tuesday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius and snow mixed with freezing drizzle changing to rain or drizzle near noon. A local accumulation of about 2 centimetres of snow is expected. Tonight, periods of rain or drizzle will change to snow as the temperature is expected to hover around zero.

Plante seeks answers for icy areas; 'I want to find solutions': mayor

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante wants an explanation for why the city's roads, sidewalks and bike paths continue to be covered with ice.
"There has to be an analysis of what can be done differently," Plante said. "Is there a lack of employees, a lack of resources? I want to find solutions."
Plante has ordered all boroughs to submit a report about the state of ice-removal operations so she can determine which jurisdictions appear to have the best method for keeping roads and sidewalks slipfree.
"It's clear that some boroughs had no problems, but in others, it's more difficult," the mayor said. "I know it's not perfect because I walk outside and I see what people are posting on social media.
"I want to have a report on everything that happened over the holidays so we can improve for next time."
Plante noted the central city has control of snow-removal operations but ice removal is left to individual boroughs.
As for the city's much-vaunted ice-crushers - made available to boroughs last year to scrape ice off sidewalks - they operate only when ice is at least one inch thick. Eight trucks were ordered at a cost of about $20,000 each, but none has been put to use so far this season.
Plante said she appreciates residents who flag problem areas by calling 311 or posting photos on social media.
She said the city must become better at ice removal, because climate change will likely mean more episodes of freezing rain.
"We seem to be doing well with snow-removal operations, but we'll have more ice episodes, for sure," she said.
If Plante's comments sound familiar, that's because she made roughly the same ones about a year ago when sidewalks were covered with ice.
On Jan. 31 of last year, Plante said she was concerned about uneven service among boroughs following a minor ice storm, saying some had sent teams out to spread abrasives six times, while others just sent them out once.
At that time, she said she would meet with the boroughs about best practices. jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Full text: Montreal police are investigating the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a 35-yearold man in Lachine early Tuesday morning after believing initially that he died after slipping on an icy street.
"There were some new elements that were brought to the attention of the investigators that caused them to reopen the investigation," said Const. Jean-Pierre Brabant, a spokesperson for the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
"It's now considered to be a suspicious death.
"The investigators are on the scene to know exactly what happened to the man."
At approximately 4 a.m., police and Urgences Santé responded to a 911 call, and found the man lying near a parked car on Provost St. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Earlier Tuesday, police said the probable cause of death was an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.

Only in Montreal, 2018: City slips up on snow-clearing waiting for a thaw

Full text: We should preface this item by noting if complaining about snow-clearing isn't the favourite winter pastime of Montrealers, it's certainly among the Top 10.
With that said, it would have been hard to accuse anyone in the city of garden-variety whining following the inauspicious first winter of snow-clearing under the then-recently elected administration of Mayor Valérie Plante.
It was, to be sure, a brutal, vexing winter, alternating between heavy snow, rain and everything in between. But it was also painfully evident the new administration's lack of experience exacerbated matters.
Mother Nature vs. city hall came to a head in late January following a particularly copious snowfall hardened by freezing rain, the kind of treacherous weather cocktail that had many of us slipping, falling and hurting ourselves.
Unavoidable? Perhaps. But the city did its residents no favours by refusing to clear the snow from that huge storm, incorrectly predicting a forecast mild spell would thaw everything, negating the need for an expensive city-wide snow-clearing operation (estimated to cost as much as $20 million per storm).
The public outcry over the city's ill-advised delay was loud and sustained, to the point where Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow-clearing, made a public admission of error, apologized and reversed course( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ), ordering the snow to be cleared, albeit several days after the epic storm. (And, it's worth noting, following a public spat with Anjou borough Mayor Luis Miranda( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ), who ignored the city's directives and cleared the snow for his 46,000 constituents.)
For her part, Plante pleaded extraordinary circumstances - a snow crisis( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-snow-crisis-more-like-snow-fiasco ), as she put it - and pledged to do better on the snow-and-ice- clearing front (in part by authorizing boroughs to purchase their own "croque-glace" machines - essentially ice-crushers).
Postscript: Winter 2 of the Plante administration is upon us. Time, and weather, will tell if it learned from its shaky debut.

Flammable load spills on Route 117 north of Mont-Tremblant

Full text: A semi-trailer carrying flammable material on Route 117 tipped over, causing its load to spill and forcing the evacuation of three homes in the Laurentians town of Lac-Saguay, 200 kilometres north of Montreal.
Route 117 was closed overnight Thursday, and was still closed Friday morning over 20 kilometres between Lac-Saguay and Lac des-Écorces, farther north, while crews were cleaning up the material. The driver was not injured.
A detour was in place using Route 105 or Route 309.
Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Marc Tessier said freezing rain and a slippery road surface could have contributed to the accident. He was not able to say when the residents of the area would be able to return or when the road would be reopened.

While you were sleeping: Homeless men help themselves - to a stranger's kitchen

Full text: Did you have a good rest? Here's what happened while you got some shuteye.
No business like snow business: Quebec ski hills have been suffering from what they call sidewalk syndrome( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-ski-hills-brace-for-more-bad-weather-but-say-conditions-are-good ) - when local skiers see green lawns and bare sidewalks and elect to stay home. "I got pictures from Mont Sutton today, and it looks like a picture perfect Christmas over there, but sitting in Montreal you can't imagine that this could be the case," said Yves Juneau, the CEO of the Quebec Ski Area Association. Most area ski hills are reporting hard-packed surfaces, but Juneau said the fact there has not been a major snowfall in more than a month is merely a perception problem. The freezing rain, rain and warm temperatures in the forecast for most of the province is decidedly bad marketing, but Juneau doesn't believe the wet weather will put a huge damper on ski conditions. "When you're at 3,000 feet in altitude, like in Mont Tremblant, I can pretty much guarantee the mountain will get some snow."
The stars are aligned: Quebecer Frederic Pelletier is boldly predicting he and his team will get the New Horizons spacecraft( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/quebecs-pelletier-leads-farthest-exploration-of-any-planetary-body-in-history/wcm/918b0479-f607-4bc1-a6a2-72450fad75d9 ) exactly where it should be on New Year's Day - 1.6 billion kilometres beyond Pluto to rendezvous with a space rock known as Ultima Thule. The goal of the NASA mission is to pass by the region known as the "Kuiper Belt" and send data back to Earth that can help explain the origins of the solar system. The flyby of Ultima Thule is being described by the space agency as the "farthest exploration of any planetary body in history." NASA contracted Pelletier to be the chief navigator of the spacecraft for the New Horizons mission, whose original plan was to fly past Pluto. The team reached its goal when the vehicle successfully flew by the dwarf planet on July 14, 2015, and sent back data "that resulted in profound new insights about Pluto and its moons," according to the space agency's website. Pelletier said: "I'm a bit nervous, but I feel confident ... all the stars are aligned."
The prodigal Clydesdale: Cindy Thomas's Christmas present this year has very hairy legs, weighs almost a tonne and goes by the name of Molly. Molly the Clydesdale disappeared last fall from the family's property near Evansburg, Alta., without a trace. But on Christmas Eve the six-year-old draft horse mysteriously turned up again on their land, brushed and groomed. Thomas did not think she would ever see Molly again and recently returned money people had donated for a reward that was offered for the mare's return. Thomas has called Molly her "big shy girl" and says she couldn't be happier to have her home. She calls it "the best gift ever."
Helping themselves: Two homeless men have been charged with burglary after a California man said he came home to find them cooking dinner. Robby Spillman tells KNBC-TV he returned from Christmas shopping last Friday to find the men in his Santa Monica apartment. Spillman says the men, who stank and wore filthy, ripped clothing, told him they hadn't expected him home so soon and asked if they could "hang out" for a while. Spillman says he played along, asked if they had enough food, then pretended to take his French bulldog for a walk and called 911. Nineteen-year-old Markis White and 29-year-old Elijah Smart were arrested. It's unclear whether they have a lawyer. Meanwhile, Spillman and his pregnant girlfriend plan to find a new home.

Galchenyuk adjusting to a new way of life; Former Hab struggling with Coyotes, but keen to improve his performance

Full text: Alex Galchenyuk looked a lot more comfortable in his skin when he met with the Montreal media Thursday morning at the Gila River Arena before facing the Canadiens for the first time Thursday night as a member of the Arizona Coyotes.
Galchenyuk appeared to be in a good mood while answering questions for more than eight minutes. He also seemed very calm, unlike the deer-in-the-headlights look he often had during media scrums as a member of the Canadiens when he seemed to measure his words very, very carefully. On Thursday morning, the 24-yearold seemed relaxed and honest in his answers.
"I'm not going to lie ... I'm not going to stand here and say it's just another day and another game," Galchenyuk said about facing the Canadiens for the first time since last summer's trade that sent him to Arizona in exchange for Max Domi. "I have so many friends on the other team and playing for the first time (against them) it's always a little bit different. I spent six years in Montreal."
What was the biggest lesson Galchenyuk learned - on and/or off the ice - during those six seasons after being selected third overall at the 2012 NHL Draft? "I'll be here all day," he said with a smile. "I learned a lot, not just as a hockey player. As a human being, I matured a lot. A lot of things that happened over the last six years have definitely helped not just my career, but my life in general."
It would be nice to see things work out for Galchenyuk in sunny Arizona and away from the bright Montreal spotlight. The pressure was always on him in Montreal, whether it came from management, fans, the media or his family, with his ever-present father and sister. There were times I actually felt sorry for him. But while Domi has thrived in the Montreal spotlight, Galchenyuk has struggled in Arizona. Heading into Thursday night's game, Domi had 14-19-33 totals in 35 games and was plus-4, while Galchenyuk had 3-8-11 totals in 23 games and was minus-7.
"I don't feel any extra pressure because of who I got traded for," Galchenyuk said. "I still have to do my job, be the player like I was and be better. That's the way I look at it."
Things got off to a bad start in Arizona for Galchenyuk when he suffered a lower-body injury during training camp and missed the first seven games of the regular season. He missed three more games this month with a lower-body injury and had gone 14 games without a goal before facing the Canadiens. He has also been moved from centre to the wing - the same thing that happened in Montreal.
"I spoke to (coach Rick Tocchet) before the situation and he said you're better off on the wing and see if I can do a little bit more offensive there, and that's fine," Galchenyuk said.
"I'm here to help my team win.
I got to be better, whether it's centre or wing."
Tocchet said he really likes Galchenyuk and is trying to help him.
"He's a coachable kid," Tocchet said. "He really wants to get better. He recognizes that he's got to get better in certain areas of his game, which I like. He's recognizing it. He's a great kid to work with. A really great personality, I love working with him. Obviously, positional hockey is something he's got to work on."
Maybe Tocchet will eventually have better luck with Galchenyuk on that front than Michel Therrien or Claude Julien did with the Canadiens. Time will tell.
Life is a lot different for Galchenyuk now in Arizona, both on and off the ice. While Montrealers were bracing for a blast of freezing rain Thursday night, it was sunny and 23 C in Arizona - just a gorgeous day.
"I feel like even if I wasn't a hockey player, only human, you move from Montreal to Arizona, it's already a completely different environment," Galchenyuk said. "That being said, hockey's still the same game. The game doesn't change, but definitely the drive is different, the weather is different. But at the same time, the goal is still the same.
"It was a fresh start and everybody felt like that," he added about the trade.
Does he feel less pressure? "To say less pressure ... I don't know if I'll use that because at the end of the day whatever is pressure in Montreal, pressure here, I still have a lot of pressure," Galchenyuk said.
"I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed and, obviously, the media coverage is completely different and all that stuff. But it was never really a big deal for me, the media in Montreal or the media here. I always put a lot of pressure on myself to perform."
On Thursday morning, Galchenyuk certainly looked and sounded like there was a lot less pressure on his shoulders. scowan@postmedia.com Twitter.com/StuCowan1

Cannabis aside, smoke was also one of the top weather stories of 2018

Full text: David Phillips isn't pulling any punches: "The weather's gotten weird and wild and wacky and variable. The climate has changed."
The senior climate scientist for Environment Canada revealed his top 10 weather stories for 2018, and Quebec was affected by more than half of them, from a cruel winter to windstorms to a deadly heat wave to tornadoes to a spring and fall that were missing in action.
"It was almost a smorgasbord of everything that could go wrong," Phillips said. "I don't think there was anything missing."
He named smoke as Canada's top weather story this year. A cold spring delayed the start of fire season. But once it warmed up, it didn't take long for sparks to strike( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/forest-fires-a-primer-on-what-not-to-do-on-your-vacation ).
There were more than 250,000 lightning strikes in southern British Columbia between April and August. On one day alone there were 20,000. The resulting huge wildfires thickened skies from coast to coast with smoke that could be detected as far away as Europe.
While factors including forestry practices and urban spread influence the effects of wildfires, Phillips said it comes down to weather.
"This is too dry, too hot, for too long."
Speaking of hot, Canada took full part in a global heat wave that involved four continents. It was Phillips's No. 2 story.
"It's a big country, Canada, and you don't often see people experiencing the same weather from Vancouver Island to Bonavista (in Newfoundland), but this year we saw that with record temperatures."
In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ). July 1 in Ottawa set records for heat and humidity and the conditions cut Canada Day attendance to 6,000 from an expected 20,000. Moose Jaw, Sask., reached 42.3 C one day in August.
But it wasn't all smoke and heat. Phillips said the No. 3 story was the disappearance of spring and fall, "the almost non-existence of the transition seasons."
A long, cold spring kept frost in the ground as deep as two metres in some places, which meant a late start to the crop year for farmers. Then, with the fields ready in August and a nice start to the harvest, unprecedented snow crushed hopes. More than $4 billion worth of crop was flattened under record snowfall.
Where else did Quebec measure up? It's No. 4 on the list with a devastating May windstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/strong-winds-could-cause-damage-friday-environment-canada-warns ) that saw hundreds of thousands of people left without power here and in Ontario. Winds gusted up to 94 kilometres per hour and knocked down trees and Hydro poles.
At No. 5, a twisters ripped through the Gatineau and Ottawa regions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-homes-damaged-in-dunrobin-possible-tornado/wcm/2678a04d-42c2-4405-89d2-6612b0477aec ), flattening homes and causing millions of dollars of damage.
"You could hear things ripping. The wind was just amazingly strong," said a Gatineau resident( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evacuations-in-gatineau-following-severe-weather-and-tornado-watch ). "It was intimidating and scary."
We also made the list at Nos. 9 and 10 - cold, long winter, and the cruellest April - the cruellest( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/fish-and-birds-die-in-magog-pet-shop-because-of-low-temperatures ) we've seen in 71 years.
Like most climatologists, Phillips is circumspect about blaming any one weather event on climate change, but he did say that despite a long, colder-than-normal winter, Canada was again slightly warmer than usual - the 22nd year in a row of above-normal temperatures.
"Scientists have kind of shown the fact that these things are directly related to human activity," he said.
Phillips has been drawing up Top 10 weather lists for 23 years. Some years, he confesses, there wasn't much to talk about.
"There weren't a lot of things happening back then. Summers were hot, winters were cold. In 23 years, it has changed," he said.
A man and woman embrace as they survey the damage to a home in Gatineau Sept. 23, 2018. Houses and Apartment buildings had roofs torn off and windows blown out and automobiles were damaged after a tornado caused extensive damage.
The top 10 weather events for 2018
1. Smoky skies: Driven by hot, dry conditions, the number of fires was higher than last year and the area burned was double the 25-year averages. Smoke from wildfires in British Columbia and down the Pacific Coast to California darkened skies and soured air for more than 10 million Canadians.
2. Canada and the global heat wave: It was hot from coast to coast. Canada Day in Ottawa was the second-warmest in more than 130 years. Three Saskatchewan cities broke all-time records with temperatures into the 40s C. In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes.
3. Spring and fall disappear: The coldest April on record slammed into the hottest-ever May. A few months later, the Prairie harvest ground to a halt when 30 centimetres of snow fell in some areas in September and October.
4. Billion-dollar windstorm: Hundreds of thousands in Quebec and Ontario were left without power in May as 120-km/h winds snapped power poles, damaged homes and hurled tree branches into vehicles like armour-piercing spears. The clean-up tab is estimated at more than $1 billion.
5. Ottawa tornadoes: A series of tornadoes tore up the boundary region between Ontario and Quebec on Sept. 21. One of them was the most powerful recorded anywhere in North America last summer. Insurance costs are expected to be about $307 million.
6. British Columbia floods: A snowpack nearly twice the norm, a wet spring and high late-spring temperatures produced flooding in several river valleys in southern B.C. Almost 5,000 people were forced from their homes by river levels not seen in 50 years.
7. Fast flooding in New Brunswick: Floods on the Saint John River are an old story, but even old-timers were surprised by the speed of the water in 2018. Deep snow, heavy rains and sudden heat created the largest, most damaging flood in modern New Brunswick history down river of Fredericton in April and May. The Reversing Falls stopped reversing.
8. Toronto's tiny, perfect storm: On Aug. 7, a compact storm dumped 58 millimetres of rain downtown and 72 millimetres on Toronto Island, while the suburbs and the airport got almost nothing. Two men nearly drowned in an underground parking elevator and Blue Jays baseball fans got rained on despite the closed roof at Rogers Centre.
9. Cold start, long winter: Six months of it. Albertans faced wind-chill cold of -45 C on New Year's Eve. In early January, Toronto was colder than Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T.
10. The cruellest month: Nationally, it was the coldest April in 16 years and in 71 years if you lived through it in Ontario and Quebec. In those provinces the misery was compounded with up to 12 centimetres of freezing rain, snow and ice pellets. Windows on Parliament Hill were smashed. The CN Tower was closed after Rogers Centre was bombed by ice falling from the tower.

Get ready for Sammy II - The Bridge!

Full text: Seriously? They're naming the Champlain Bridge replacement the Samuel De Champlain Bridge. They must have thought long and hard on that one.
And once the span linking Montreal to the South Shore opens on June 30, it will be known as .... the Champlain Bridge. Much like the Honoré-Mercier Bridge is pretty much only known as the Mercier Bridge.
The "Samuel De" will be dropped by motorists faster than the first pileup and first dropped hubcap on the new bridge.
Almost lost in the naming of the new bridge on Wednesday by Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne was the fact that it was actually slated to open Friday. Yes, the first day of winter. Brilliant.
For the record, the weather forecast for early Friday is freezing rain.
One can only imagine what kind of calamitous opening that might have made. We should probably be grateful for the sixmonth delay, unless higher powers decide to unleash anger on us by unloading hail and locusts from the skies on our vehicles June 30.
With all due respect, the feds, under whose domain the bridge falls ... er ... rests, could have gone a lot more creatively in seeking to pay homage to French explorer Champlain. Samuel II? Le Sam? Sammy the Sequel? Super Sammy? Then again, the latter could have been misconstrued for Sugar Sammy, which, in consideration of some of the more farcical aspects of our bridge traffic, might have been entirely appropriate.
And what about some other pioneers? Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve is a mouthful, and he already has a boulevard named for him. But while Jeanne Mance has a street named for her, the founder of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1644 - the first hospital in North America north of Mexico - merits more.
But, in truth, if they were to name the bridge for an original Quebec inhabitant, that honour should really go to an Indigenous pioneer, whose people had been established here thousands of years before Champlain or Jacques Cartier ever hit these shores.
Perhaps Donnacona, the Iroquoian chief who took offence when Cartier erected a cross in the Gaspé in 1534.
Better still, let present-day Indigenous leaders make the call on whom they would wish to have that honour.
The feds could have gone outside this controversial box altogether and named the new structure for one of the many influential Montrealers from the worlds of sports, arts, science or politics.
Few would argue against the Jean-Béliveau Bridge, a tribute to one of the classiest Habs of them all. Such a name might even induce a breakout of good manners and etiquette on the span. Right! But one can always dream.
The Rocket, named for the greatest Canadiens stick-man of all, Maurice Richard, would also have been a nice touch, save for the fact it would imply speedway when we all know that it would be the exact opposite with gridlock being the norm.
Similarly, the Gilles-Villeneuve Bridge would have sent the wrong message, and the lategreat FI driver already has the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve named for him. The Boom-Boom-Geoffrion Bridge, while also an interesting choice, would have ended up hitting too close to home on the collision front.
If the feds really wanted to quell fears about the bridge's support structure, they could have done worse than name it for legendary Québécois strongman Louis Cyr, the pride of St-Cyprien-de-Napierville who died far too young at 49 in 1912.
Turning to the arts, Lise Payette or Nelly Arcan could have been considered.
Honestly, though, who better a bridge-builder than Leonard Cohen, loved and respected as much by francophones as anglos? Oscar Peterson could also fill the bill on that front.
From the world of science, there is physician/microbiologist Armand Frappier, who devoted much of his career to battling tuberculosis.
And can't forget Pierre Dansereau, considered to be a "father of ecology," which, of course, would make for a rather incongruous choice for a bridge honour.
And then there's the political spectrum, which would have taken eons to decide upon. It's hard to imagine there would ever be consensus in choosing to name the bridge for either Robert Bourassa, Jean Drapeau, René Lévesque, Claude Ryan or Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
I would have been partial to Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, the 14th premier of Quebec and the namesake for the Brossard boulevard some of us have to exit in order to avoid the traffic chaos on the Champlain Bridge - and, doubtless, on the new Samuel De Champlain Bridge. bbrownstein@postmedia.com Twitter.com/billbrownstein

Full text: Seriously? They're naming the Champlain Bridge replacement the Samuel De Champlain Bridge. They must have thought long and hard on that one.
And once the span linking Montreal to the South Shore opens on June 30, it will be known as .... the Champlain Bridge. Much like the Honoré-Mercier Bridge is pretty much only known as the Mercier Bridge. The "Samuel de" will be dropped by motorists faster than the first pile-up and first dropped hubcap on the new bridge.
Almost lost in the naming of the new bridge on Wednesday by Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne was the fact that it was actually slated to open Friday. Yes, the first day of winter. Brilliant.
For the record, the weather forecast for early Friday is freezing rain. One can only imagine what kind of calamitous opening that might have made. We should probably be grateful for the six-month delay, unless higher powers decide to unleash anger on us by unloading hail and locusts from the skies on our vehicles June 30.
With all due respect, the feds, under whose domain the bridge falls ... er ... rests, could have gone a lot more creatively in seeking to pay homage to French explorer Champlain. Samuel II? Le Sam? Sammy the Sequel? Super Sammy? Then again, the latter could have been misconstrued for Sugar Sammy, which, in consideration of some of the more farcical aspects of our bridge traffic, might have been entirely appropriate.
And what about some other pioneers? Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve is a mouthful, and he already has a boulevard named for him. But while Jeanne Mance has a street named for her, the founder of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1644 - the first hospital in North America north of Mexico - merits more.
But, in truth, if they were to name the bridge for an original Quebec inhabitant, that honour should really go to an Indigenous pioneer, whose people had been established here thousands of years before Champlain or Jacques Cartier ever hit these shores. Perhaps Donnacona, the Iroquoian chief who took offence when Cartier erected a cross in the Gaspé in 1534.
Better still, let present-day Indigenous leaders make the call on whom they would wish to have that honour.
The feds could have gone outside this controversial box altogether and named the new structure for one of the many influential Montrealers from the worlds of sports, arts, science or politics.

Full text: Gazette photo journalists take countless shots every year, from classrooms to cafés to crime scenes. What you see published in the paper is just a small sampling of their work. Here are some of their favourites from 2018 that never made it to publication.
Pierre Obendrauf: It's not all fun and games (but sometimes it is)
Oct. 10, 2018.
It took 35 years on staff at The Montreal Gazette for me to get the chance to cover an NBA game - a pre-season game at that. It was nice to cover something other than the Habs at the Bell Centre. Here, Brooklyn Nets guard D'Angelo Russell blows past Toronto Raptors guard Lorenzo Brown during the second half of the game in Montreal.
Sept. 25, 2018
On a typical rainy day in September, I was waiting in my car for a photo subject to arrive for a shoot. Rain was falling on the windshield, and I waited for someone with an umbrella to walk by.
Aug. 16, 2018.
An interactive art machine generated much enthusiasm from a crowd around St-Laurent métro station. It was said that people could talk to the art piece and it would answer back in some way. This person seemed to engage in a conversation with it, but I'm not sure whether he agreed with the response.
Dave Sidaway: Memory, vision, and how to be cool
May 29, 2018.
Montreal received this public artwork, Source by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, for its 375th anniversary, thanks to the contribution of two major patrons, France Chrétien Desmarais and André Desmarais. The sculpture is on loan to Montreal for at least 25 years. I like the idea of combining the new artwork with the Farine Five Roses sign, which is, in my view, a piece of art on its own.
June 4, 2018.
As a kid, I had a season pass to Expo 67 as well as Man and his World. The U.S. pavilion was a hit and the lineups were so long that I wasn't able to visit it in 1967. However, I did get inside when it was converted to an aviary. Today the pavilion in Jean-Drapeau Park is illuminated with a variety of colours.
June 27, 2018.
I frequently cycle along the Lachine Canal, which gives me an opportunity to scout photo-op locations. I chanced across this little guy cooling off in the Peel Basin.
John Mahoney: It's all about the timing
July 15, 2018.
When France defeated Croatia to win the World Cup in July, thousands of French fans flooded the intersection of St-Denis and Rachel Sts. There were pictures all around me as fans poured out of bars and restaurants and danced and sang in the street. Nathanael Haury showed up with a replica of the World Cup trophy and with a couple of joyous friends was hoisted onto soccer fans' shoulders. When several thousand French fans all sang La Marseillaise, I had my picture.
Nov. 22, 2018.
I was working the late shift and had a couple of outside assignments on the West Island that had to be done before sunset. The November day was unseasonably, bitterly cold and I was asked to keep an eye out for a cold-weather feature picture. After my last assignment in Dorval, I headed to Pointe Claire Village hoping to get something near the water with the setting sun. Because of rush hour traffic, I missed the best of what appeared to be a spectacular sunset so I turned east to head toward downtown and ran smack into this tableau of the moon rising over Pointe Claire with Lac St-Louis in the foreground. I pulled my car over and shot several frames with a 70-200mm zoom lens then went back to my car for a longer lens. By then, the moon had risen considerably and in doing so had gotten much brighter. The best photos were when it was lower in the sky and not as bright, which allowed the exposure of the moon to balance better with the ambient outside light and the warm light of the house on Lakeshore Rd.
April 16, 2018.
On that April morning, Montreal was hit with freezing rain, so I headed to the corner of Dr. Penfield Ave. and Peel St. to look for pictures of pedestrians navigating that notoriously slippery intersection. I didn't have to wait long before Xinkai Xu lost his footing and starting sliding down Peel on his back, almost taking out an unsuspecting woman waiting to cross the street.

April 1, 2018.
Montreal Canadiens right wing Brendan Gallagher tries to shake it off after having his head driven into the ice by New Jersey Devils defenceman Ben Lovejoy. I was shocked by how hard the hit to Gally was, and that one person came to help him up from the ice, which took some time. He skated back to the bench unaided.

Being a photojournalist allows us to meet and speak with a really wide group of people. Chatting with Keish in her portrait studio before shooting her picture was a nice moment and after we shot a "classic" portrait, the one that was published, I started to pack up. Then I grabbed a quick, wider, more environmental picture of Keish, which I was happy with.

A simple portrait, but the time I spent at Restaurant Lawrence with sommelier Linda Milagros Violago was fun and interesting. I told her I wanted something a little different and she pulled out her corkscrew and lined it up with the centre of her eye. In a few seconds, I had the shot.

Blizzard warning fizzles, drizzle now in forecast for Montreal

Full text: Environment Canada warned on Monday that by the time it was over on Wednesday there could be 25 centimetres of snow on the ground( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/beware-says-environment-canada-snowfall-could-be-fast-and-flurrious ).
But by Tuesday morning the light, wet snowflakes that had begun to fall hours earlier were gone, the temperature was slightly above freezing, and by the time it's all over on Wednesday, the forecast now says we'll see a mix of snow and rain.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada's snowfall warning, issued Monday for the Montreal area, had disappeared as quickly as the remnants of Tuesday's snow flurries.
However, the rest of Quebec remains braced for more serious accumulations over the course of Tuesday.
A total of 10-15 centimetres are expected to fall on Sherbrooke by Wednesday while about 12 centimetres are expected in the Trois-Rivières area.
The Quebec City region meanwhile is expecting between 15-20 centimetres as well as whiteouts caused by wind gusts of up to 90 kilometres and hour. But the winter wallop( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ) seems poised to hit hardest in the Charlevoix region, where 20 to 30 centimetres of snow are expected Tuesday afternoon. The region is expected to receive a further 15 to 25 centimetres Tuesday night and another 10 to 15 centimetres on Wednesday.

Woman who slipped on icy sidewalk will get $28,000 from Montreal

Full text: A court has ordered the city of Montreal to pay $28,000 to a woman who slipped on an icy sidewalk( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-to-unveil-new-plan-to-deal-with-icy-sidewalks ) and broke her ankle.
In a Nov. 19 judgment, Quebec Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin found the city should have spread abrasives( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-city-promises-to-do-better-this-year ) on the sidewalk "to avoid as much as possible the creation of ice sheets and thus minimize the risk of falling, especially on a sidewalk located near a school."
However, he also noted that the woman, who had been walking on sidewalks in the area for about eight minutes before the fall, "should have seen that there was no evidence of abrasives and she should have been more cautious."
On Jan. 20, 2016, Maude Vermette Saint-Cyr, a 24-year-old substitute teacher, was on her way to École Charles-Lemoyne in Pointe-St-Charles, part of the Sud-Ouest borough.
Just under eight centimetres of snow had fallen over the previous two days - 6.3 centimetres on Jan. 18 and 1.3 cm on Jan. 19. After getting off the métro, Vermette Saint-Cyr headed to the school, a minute walk away. No snow had fallen that day. It was cloudy and minus-9 Celsius.
Evidence presented in court showed that the city cleared the sidewalk after the Jan. 18 snowfall, but not after the one on Jan. 19. No abrasives were spread and the city documents indicated there were patches of ice on sidewalks in the area.
At 8 a.m., Vermette Saint-Cyr reached Grand-Trunk and Shearer Sts., on the block where the school is located. She slipped on ice and fell. A passerby flagged down a police car. The police officer told Vermette Saint-Cyr that no abrasives had been spread.
An ambulance took her to a hospital. Doctors performed surgery on her foot the next day and she was unable to return to work for four months. She can no longer ski or take long hikes. She still experiences pain due to her injuries.
In her lawsuit, Vermette Saint-Cyr demanded $85,000 in damages from the city to make up for lost wages, permanent partial incapacity and pain and suffering.
The city argued in court that "the sidewalk was in good condition, considering the climatic conditions."
Montreal contended that the fall was the woman's own fault, according to the judgment.
The city's lawyers told the judge that Vermette Saint-Cyr "neglected to take the necessary measures to ensure her own safety by ignoring the prevailing weather conditions in the days preceding the fall," the judgment says.
Justice Gouin found fault with both parties.
He ruled that the city should have spread abrasives on the sidewalk after clearing the snow( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/snow-removal ) on Jan. 18 or after realizing there were icy patches on Jan. 19.
Gouin found it was "rather surprising" that the city considers the sidewalk in question at the bottom of its list of snow-clearing and de-icing priority areas, despite the fact that it's near a school and is heavily used.
However, he ruled the woman should have known that there could be ice patches on the sidewalk, as they cannot be expected to be completely ice-free at all times.
"Such is our lot in the winter," the judge said.
Gouin calculated her damages to be $56,000. Since she was partially responsible for the incident, he awarded her half - $28,000.
In 2014, Montreal Gazette photographer Dario Ayala wrote about taking shots at people slipping on the ice - and how difficult that can be when your instinct is to help. Tap here to read that first-person account.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/photographers-help-too )

One reported dead in multi-vehicle crash on Highway 117

Full text: A woman in her mid-30s has apparently died in a multi-vehicle collision Saturday night on Route 117, near Lac-Pythonga, 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the La Vérendrye wildlife reserve.
Around 8 p.m., a 53-foot truck transporting food skidded and jackknifed on the icy road,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/environment-canada-issues-freezing-rain-warning-for-montreal ) dumping part of its load, said Sûreté du Québec spokesperson Sgt. Claude Denis. The driver of a long-distance bus was unable to stop because of the icy conditions and crashed into the truck at low speed, he said.
A second truck swerved off the road to try to avoid the pileup and landed on top of a car. Emergency workers used hydraulic tools to rescue the car driver but she showed no vital signs when she was brought out, Denis said.
The truck drivers and the driver and passengers of the bus were unharmed, but the driver of another vehicle was seriously injured and taken to a hospital in Montreal. The person's life was not to be in danger, Denis said.
Because of the investigation and the load spilled on the highway, it was partly closed, with drivers forced to alternate in each direction, he said.

Full text: By 9 a.m., it was minus-15 Celsius in Montreal, breaking a record set in 1972, when the low was minus-14.4C. With the wind chill, this Nov. 22 feels like minus-26.
That's approximately the temperature at which your nose hairs freeze. And when you go indoors, your glasses fog up. Normals for this day are a high of 3 C and low of minus-4 C.
Still, it's a lot balmier than the coldest place in Canada on Thursday, which is Thomsen River, NT, at minus-38 C. they won't get much relief this week, but we will.
The temperature in the Montreal area should ease back up in the next few days. According to Environment Canada, the high on Friday will be minus-6 C, then minus-1 C on Saturday. The early part of next week is expected to be above freezing, with some rain or light snow possible at the beginning of the workweek.

Full text: Add Michel Trépannier to the long list of experts and skeptics who warned the government's deadline for completing the new Champlain Bridge was a pie-inthe-sky forecast.
"We know that a comparable bridge to the one being built here, that we've seen in other countries, we're talking four to five years," said Trépannier, president of the Conseil provincial du Québec des métiers de la construction (International), the union representing the majority of the bridge workers.
"So from the start we knew it was practically impossible.
"But the workers did an amazing job to get to where they did," in just three years, he said. Many haven't taken a holiday in that time.
On Thursday, federal Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne confirmed the bridge, originally scheduled to be completed by Dec. 21 to replace its crumbling predecessor, could take as much as six months longer to finish because freezing conditions are putting a halt to the final paving touches.
The new bridge will be open by June 2019, "at the latest," the minister said.
"The government of Canada's priority is to ensure the new tollfree Champlain Bridge is built to endure without ever compromising the safety of workers or the public," Champagne said at a news conference at the offices of Signature sur le Saint-Laurent (SSL), the consortium responsible for building the bridge.
In April, the federal government and SSL announced the deadline for building the bridge had been moved from Dec. 1 to Dec. 21.
Since then, inclement weather, a lightning strike on a bridge crane in July and strikes by crane operators caused more delays and pushed the end of the project into the winter months, said Daniel Genest, the director of co-ordination for SSL.
He and federal officials knew by the end of September they couldn't meet deadline.
The government intends to adhere to the contract, which calls for the levying of late fees - $100,000 a day for the first seven days, and $400,000 for each day after that.
The maximum penalty is $150 million.
The consortium says much of the delay on the $4.2-billion bridge was caused by "unforeseen elements," and any fines will be negotiated.
While the main structure will be completed by Dec. 21, the laying of a thin rubber membrane to waterproof the bridge and the application of two coats of asphalt will take at least two months, officials said.
Since the work can be done only in temperatures above 2 C and under specific humidity conditions, workers will have to wait until April or May to finish that work.
Contractors could cover the bridge deck in tents and heat the surface to do the work sooner, Genest said.
But the cost would be high and would have to be negotiated with Ottawa.
The main deck of the bridge is almost completed; a 37.5-metre gap remains in the 3.4-kilometre span.
The gap is expected to be closed by the end of November.
Officials said the old bridge is "monitored, stable and safe."
The delay will cost an extra $10 million in maintenance costs, adding to the $300 million already spent on repairs to keep it in operation.
In May, federal auditor general Michael Ferguson released a scathing report about the new Champlain, saying: "It's uncertain whether it will be completed by the December 2018 deadline."
The report found Ottawa bungled planning and didn't manage risks to mitigate cost delays and overruns.
Delays in approving the new span cost taxpayers $500 million in avoidable expenditures, the report said.
Even Genest of the SSL joked last year the company was hoping for "no winter and no rain for the next 14 months" to be able to finish the project on time.
Prior to 2018, two labour strikes and weight restrictions on the old bridge that forced SSL to use barges on the Saint-Lawrence River to transport heavy materials also slowed work.
The missed deadline won't mean further delays for the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) lightrail train that is to run on the new bridge by 2021.
The $6.3-billion train line will have a station built into the bridge, where it meets Nun's Island. REM spokesman Jean-Vincent Lacroix said the work on the tracks and station is to start in the fall of 2019 and won't require lane closures on the new bridge.
About 58-million cars and trucks and 200,000 buses use the Champlain annually to cross the river, making it one of Canada's busiest spans. Jason Magder of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this report. rbruemmer@postmedia.com

Add Michel Trépannier to the long list of experts and skeptics who warned the government's deadline for completing the new Champlain Bridge was a pie-in-the-sky forecast.

Full text: Montrealers woke up to freezing temperatures and an Environment Canada-issued frost advisory Thursday morning.
The advisory warns that temperatures will drop below the freezing mark overnight, which could do some damage to plants left in outside gardens. This is the second overnight frost advisory the federal meteorological service has issued this week.
Things will improve over the weekend, with highs in the double digits throughout Friday and most of Saturday. Expect rain Friday night and Saturday during the day, then more frigid temperatures overnight.
Next week we're back to below-10 C temperatures and, if we're very lucky, we might see some flurries.

Is this October even gloomier than Montrealers expected?

Full text: In its usual understated way, Environment Canada put a small asterisk beside Wednesday's weather forecast and called it an "abnormal temperature trend."
That's what happens when the temperature drops during the day or rises overnight, as if we didn't have enough trouble deciding how to dress on autumn mornings.
It's been abnormally chilly in Montreal since the beginning of October, even with Tuesday's notable 27-degree-Celsius blip. According to Environment's Canada's historical data, most Octobers start off at a mild 16 C and drop by less than half a degree each day till we hit 9 C by Oct. 31. Some of those later days could see temperatures drop near freezing at night.
This October, however, we started at 13.7 C and have wavered around 10 C, with two above-20 days. The next week will continue to hover in the lower double digits. Accuweather, which makes longer-term predictions than Environment Canada, promises more of the same, with a few seasonably warm days in a chilly sea of clouds and rainfall.
"Latest trends support a reinforcing shot of colder air into eastern Canada after Oct. 16 as a strong ridge builds over British Columbia," Accuweather head meteorologist Brett Anderson says. "The air may be cold enough for snow showers across Ontario and Quebec around Oct. 17. Directly downwind and close to the abnormally warm lakes, it will be mostly rain with the potential for thunder and waterspouts."
Less sunlight might contribute to a feeling of gloom. The sun doesn't rise till after 7 these days, and it's setting before suppertime. In 25 days, it'll be time to turn back the clocks, and there will be fewer and fewer sunshine hours till Dec. 21.
But is it gloomier than we expected? Montrealers are no strangers to wearing snowsuits under Halloween costumes and two pairs of gloves while biking to work. We layer like champions and our most Québécois dishes are designed for cozy evenings with the heat cranked up.

Candiac's self-driving bus test the first of its kind in Canada; Pilot project will see technology's trial application in winter conditions

Full text: The South Shore city of Candiac announced Friday it will embark on a pilot project to provide an electric, self-driving shuttle bus to take people to one of the city's park-and-ride lots.
The project, to which the Quebec government is contributing $350,000, is the first long-term demonstration project of a 100 per cent electric autonomous shuttle on public roads in Canada, according to Keolis Canada, the company providing the shuttle.
"This is the first self-driving pilot project we have received to date," Transport Minister André Fortin said in Candiac Friday. "We have hopes that there will be others."
Fortin said the pilot project announced Friday, which will begin the last week of August, is made possible by changes his government made last spring to the Highway Safety Code to allow autonomous vehicles on public roads.
The minibus, which costs about $400,000, has a capacity of 15 people. It will take a one-kilometre trip along Montcalm Blvd., making five stops along the way from the intersection of Marie-Victorin Blvd. to the park-and-ride lot north of Highway 15 that has several bus lines, including express buses over the Champlain Bridge.
The shuttle will travel at a maximum speed of 25 kilometres per hour, said Marie Hélène Cloutier, the vice-president of marketing and sales for Keolis Canada. It will be in service for 12 months, but during the winter months (from December to April), it will not take passengers, because Keolis will be testing how it fares in a cold climate. The shuttle can run for about 225 kilometres on a single charge, which will allow the bus to offer service for nine hours per day. An operator must be on board at all times, according to the terms of the pilot project, though the bus has no steering wheel. Cloutier said the operator will steer the shuttle using a Sony PlayStation-brand video-game controller.
The bus will communicate with smart traffic lights that will stay green when the bus is approaching. The bus can also be hailed by a smartphone, and riders will be able to tell it to skip a stop using a touchscreen on board. However, those options will not be available as part of this project.
Candiac Mayor Normand Dyotte said he believes the shuttle will be used often by Candiac citizens, since its route begins at a senior citizens residence and stops near several industrial buildings.
"It's a nice project for us," Dyotte said. "We want to give our citizens a good transportation system, and this kind of project is complementary to what we already provide our citizens."
"We have to work on micro-transit, meaning the first and last mile," she said. "This is really a complementary service that is designed to increase use of public transit."
She added the pilot project will also help Keolis improve its technology. Even though the shuttle has already been used in 17 other countries, this is the first time the technology is being tested in harsh winter conditions. She said the buses have not been properly tested below 10 degrees Celsius.
"In Quebec, there is freezing rain, and a lot of situations that can be more complicated, so we have to work to make the shuttle responsive to Quebec's winter conditions," she said. "The shuttle improves every time it goes out."
Sarah Houde, a spokesperson for Propulsion Quebec, which represents the electric and smart vehicle industry, said she hopes this project will help Quebec become a world leader in autonomous vehicles, and that other companies will come to the province to test autonomous buses in the province's weather.
The city of Montreal also recently announced a pilot project for self-driving shuttle buses in its Olympic Park by the end of summer. jmagder@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonmagder facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Full text: The South Shore city of Candiac announced Friday it will embark on a pilot project to provide an electric, self-driving shuttle bus to take people to one of the city's park-and-ride lots.
The project, to which the Quebec government is contributing $350,000, is the first long-term demonstration project of a 100-per-cent electric autonomous shuttle on public roads in Canada, according to Keolis Canada, the company providing the shuttle.
"This is the first self-driving pilot project we have received to date," Transport Minister André Fortin said in Candiac Friday. "We have hopes that there will be others."
Fortin said the pilot project announced Friday, which will begin the last week of August, is made possible by changes his government made last spring to the Highway Safety Code( http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-165-41-1.html ) to allow autonomous vehicles on public roads.
The minibus, which costs about $400,000, has a capacity of 15 people. It will take a one-kilometre trip along Montcalm Blvd., making five stops along the way from the intersection of Marie-Victorin Blvd. to the park-and-ride lot north of Highway 15 that has several bus lines, including express buses over the Champlain Bridge.
The shuttle will travel at a maximum speed of 25 kilometres per hour, said Marie Hélène Cloutier, the vice-president of marketing and sales for Keolis Canada. It will be in service for 12 months, but during the winter months (from December to April), it will not take passengers, because Keolis will be testing how it fares in a cold climate. The shuttle can run for about 225 kilometres on a single charge, which will allow the bus to offer service for nine hours per day. An operator must be on board at all times, according to the terms of the pilot project, though the bus has no steering wheel. Cloutier said the operator will steer the shuttle using a Sony PlayStation-brand video-game controller.
"We want to give our citizens a good transportation system," said Candiac Mayor Normand Dyotte.
The bus will communicate with smart traffic lights that will stay green when the bus is approaching. The bus can also be hailed by a smartphone, and riders will be able to tell it to skip a stop using a touchscreen on board. However, those options will not be available as part of this project.
Candiac Mayor Normand Dyotte said he believes the shuttle will be used often by Candiac citizens, since its route begins at a senior citizens residence and stops near several industrial buildings.
"It's a nice project for us," Dyotte said. "We want to give our citizens a good transportation system, and this kind of project is complementary to what we already provide our citizens."
Cloutier said cities are looking for services like autonomous buses to transport smaller numbers of people in less densely populated areas towards heavy mass transit services.
"We have to work on micro-transit, meaning the first and last mile," she said. "This is really a complementary service that is designed to increase use of public transit."
She added the pilot project will also help Keolis improve its technology. Even though the shuttle has already been used in 17 other countries, this is the first time the technology is being tested in harsh winter conditions. She said the buses have not been properly tested below 10 degrees Celsius.
"In Quebec, there is freezing rain, and a lot of situations that can be more complicated, so we have to work to make the shuttle responsive to Quebec's winter conditions," she said. "The shuttle improves every time it goes out."
Sarah Houde, a spokesperson for Propulsion Quebec, which represents the electric and smart vehicle industry, said she hopes this project will help Quebec become a world leader in autonomous vehicles, and that other companies will come to the province to test autonomous buses in the province's weather.
The city of Montreal also recently announced( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-announces-pilot-project-for-autonomous-buses )a pilot project for self-driving shuttle buses in its Olympic Park by the end of the summer, but those buses are only expected to run on closed, private roads.

Full text: Montrealers like to have a good snicker at Toronto's expense every once in while.
What kind of uptight nanny state bans tobogganing in its parks or street hockey (at least until recently)? "Loosen up! Live a little!" we who buy our beer in dépanneurs and jaywalk fearlessly have often said about Toronto's overzealous safety culture.
Well, guess who's the skittish city now? The nervous nellies in the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough have just taken aim at baseball, saying one of two diamonds in Jeanne Mance Park must close permanently because the possibility an errant ball could strike a pedestrian or a car makes it too dangerous.
The diamond, affectionately known as the North Field, has been in use for 50 years. It was shut down last summer - temporarily, everyone thought - because of construction on the nearby tennis courts. But an incident requiring a payout to an injured party has the borough running scared.
It's unclear when this particular event occurred, given the North Field hasn't been in use for a year now, but the city must have received one hell of a lawyers' letter. After commissioning a "ballistics report" on the potential trajectory of balls, the borough made the call to end a half-century tradition.
While the adjacent diamond to the south will remain open, the league and players who have been waiting to reclaim their second home base feel blindsided. They are lamenting not only the demise of one of their playing surfaces, but also of the friendships forged and the community it helped kindle. Some are saying the knee-jerk reaction smacks of elitism, a sign of changing tastes in the gentrifying Plateau. FEAR OF LIABILITY It also seems like a move right out of an overprotective, overbearing, overregulated society where policy is driven by fear of liability and personal responsibility is non-existent. Montreal has mostly managed to rise above these unfortunate tendencies.
But if softball and baseball are too hazardous - what's next? Will we have to curtail slapshots to prevent airborne hockey pucks from flying over the boards and hitting someone at all the city's outdoor rinks (including the one in Jeanne Mance Park)? Will this put the brakes on tobogganing on Mount Royal, lest a reckless sledder slam into a person climbing back up the hill? Do we need to crack down on the possibility of stray footballs, soccer balls or Frisbees hitting picnickers in our busy parks? Beaconsfield just restricted use of its diving boards because the depth of its 50-year-old outdoor community pools no longer meets modern safety standards. At this rate, our parks and sports facilities may soon be strangled with yellow hazard tape, given the age of infrastructure in Montreal and area.
It's clear that a pop fly to the head of an unsuspecting passerby could do a lot of damage. And no one is suggesting what passed for security in the 1960s is up to snuff today. But the swiftness of the decision to jettison the North Field and the lack of effort put in to finding another solution speaks volumes.
Couldn't a fence or some netting be erected to contain wayward baseballs? Couldn't the path (one of many arteries through the park) be redirected out of harm's way? Couldn't the orientation of the diamond be changed or a new one created nearby? Couldn't a sign be put up to warn passersby to keep their heads up when there's a baseball game in progress or use one of the other pathways? A sign, after all, is what we usually do to mitigate the city's legal liability in even more dire circumstances. When an elite cyclist descending Mount Royal died last year after he slammed into an SUV driven by a tourist pulling an illegal U-turn, no one was held accountable. But signs - in French - were posted to warn motorists not to pull the unsafe manoeuvre.
There seem to be some major inconsistencies in assessing peril and responding to it.
We all must contend with risk every time we step out the door. We probably have more chance of falling on an icy sidewalk after one of Montreal's increasingly frequent freezing rain storms than we do of getting clocked on the head with a wayward baseball, but snow-clearing doesn't drastically improve from one winter to another.
Where do we draw the line between the duty to protect the public from harm and becoming an anxious, bubble-wrapped city that fun forgot? Common sense shouldn't become as rare in Montreal as a diamond to play baseball on. ahanes@postmedia.com

Beaconsfield just restricted use of its diving boards( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/inspections-close-diving-boards-at-beaconsfield-community-pools ) because the depth of its 50-year-old outdoor community pools no longer meets modern safety standards. At this rate, our parks and sports facilities may soon be strangled with yellow hazard tape, given the age of infrastructure in Montreal and area.
It's clear that a pop fly to the head of an unsuspecting passerby could do a lot of damage. And no one is suggesting what passed for security in the 1960s is up to snuff today. But the swiftness of the decision to jettison the North Field and the lack of effort put in to finding another solution speaks volumes.
What remains of the baseball field in the northern part of Jeanne Mance park on Tuesday June 5, 2018.
Couldn't a fence or some netting be erected to contain wayward baseballs? Couldn't the path (one of many arteries through the park) be redirected out of harm's way? Couldn't the orientation of the diamond be changed or a new one created nearby? Couldn't a sign be put up to warn passersby to keep their heads up when there's a baseball game in progress or use one of the other pathways?
A sign, after all, is what we usually do to mitigate the city's legal liability in even more dire circumstances. When an elite cyclist descending Mount Royal died last year after he slammed into an SUV driven by a tourist pulling an illegal U-turn, no one was held accountable. But signs - in French - were posted to warn motorists not to pull the unsafe manoeuvre.
There seem to be some major inconsistencies in assessing peril and responding to it.
We all must contend with risk every time we step out the door. We probably have more chance of falling on an icy sidewalk after one of Montreal's increasingly frequent freezing rain storms than we do of getting clocked on the head with a wayward baseball, but snow-clearing doesn't drastically improve from one winter to another.
Where do we draw the line between the duty to protect the public from harm and becoming an anxious, bubble-wrapped city that fun forgot?
Common sense shouldn't become as rare in Montreal as a diamond to play baseball on.

Full text: Jesse Galganov's mother will be flying to Peru next week to help in the search for her missing son after new information was discovered in an area where he was last seen.
Galganov seems to have vanished without a trace. No one has responded to the family's reward offer, now at US$30,000, to find him. The authorities suspect a criminal act is behind his disappearance early last fall.
His mother, Alisa Clamen, told the Montreal Gazette said she is hoping for a miracle.
"But I am preparing myself for the worst. The fact that nothing has been found, not a single item, is indicative to them of something criminal."
The 22-year-old left Montreal in September for what was to be an eight-month backpacking trip through South America and Southeast Asia.
After spending a few days in Lima, he texted his mother on Sept. 28 saying he would be out of contact for a few days because he was planning a four-day hike on the Santa Cruz Trek, a popular route through a mountain range in the Andes.
His 23rd birthday was in February.
Clamen plans to participate in a search May 15-17 with about 80 local police from Huaraz and nearby villages. Two members of the Canadian embassy will be on hand to "observe and liaise," Clamen said.
In October, frustrated with local police efforts she deemed to be less than diligent, Clamen hired an elite Israeli team, Magnus International Search and Rescue. It has sent several drones into the area, she said, and interviewed everyone connected with Jesse's trek.
"They will find him," Clamen said Thursday.
A separate search spearheaded by Jesse's father, Todd Galganov, who went to Lima in October, is to include remote villagers living near the trail, said Rex Broekman, editor of the Huaraz Telegraph in Peru.
Last week, Broekman said he acted as a translator for the father during a meeting with the former president of an agrarian federation, Carlos Milla, who knows the leaders of these local communities, some of which are no more than a collection of five houses.
"(Milla) took flyers to the meeting and some people had never heard of the case, which is strange because this is the area where Jesse went missing," Broekman said.
Milla helped unite villagers reluctant to speak to local police to participate in a search covering new ground that hasn't been explored yet.
"Even if villagers saw him, they might not have shared this information with police because they don't trust them," Broekman said. "They have their own community laws and leaders."
Galganov's disappearance has baffled authorities, and theories abound about what might have happened.
One unlikely theory suggests that he simply left for the jungle despite Peru's unpleasant rain and freezing weather in this remote region.
Another scenario suggests Galganov suffered from acute altitude sickness, tried to find shelter or a place to sleep and then fell into a crevice.
Or that Galganov blacked out, then got robbed and dumped somewhere.
"But this is pure speculation," Broekman said.
What is known is that the initial investigation was hampered by delays. The mountain search team, a department of Peruvian national police that covers remote areas, wasn't informed that the young Canadian had gone missing for nearly three weeks.
For some reason, Galganov had apparently gone into the park without registering his presence.
Surveillance footage shows him getting off the bus in Huaraz. But it was not until the Magnus team located two French hikers who had camped beside Galganov on the trail on Sept. 30 that his presence on the trail was confirmed.
The men reported Galganov had arrived at the campsite late that evening because "he had got a little lost or disoriented."
Reached in Lima, Galganov's father said no family should go through the pain of losing a son.
He condemned the national park's lack of guards and satellite phones.
He also said he is planning to start a foundation in his son's name to fund simultaneous marches of awareness starting this Mother's Day (May 13) in Toronto and Montreal, as well as in Peru, Florida and New York.
As for Clamen, this will be her third trip to Peru since her son went missing. She will be hiking the same trail as her son.
She's pinning her hopes on the new intelligence Magnus unearthed, which is "Jesse's exact location at the last point of known contact ... his pace and his direction," she said.
Peruvian forces co-ordinated by Magnus are to comb the eastern side of the trek called the Punta Union next week.
There's a possibility Jesse is still alive, she said.
But Clamen, who has started therapy with a professional who also lost a son, believes nothing would have kept her son from getting in touch with her.
"As a mother ... I have hope of finding my son's body," she said. "My goal, simply put, is to find my son and bring him home. No matter the result."

Motorists should be prepared for bad road conditions, especially if there's snow or ice buildup Sunday or Monday. Poor weather could lead to airline travel delays.
A low-pressure system will cross the border from the U.S. Midwest, bringing with it a "wintry mix."

Mayor'S First 100 Days: In Her Own Words

Full text: In a wide-ranging interview with the Montreal Gazette, Valérie Plante discusses her proudest achievement, her greatest regret and the biggest surprise about her new job. Andy Riga takes her pulse on five hot-button issues - from Pink Line to snow clearing
Mayor Valérie Plante arrives carrying soup in a paper cup. It's a noon-hour interview and she's nursing a bad cold that literally left her speechless at city council three days earlier.
"I love soup and I'm sick," she says, laughing, by way of explanation.
Though clearly still under the weather, Plante's voice is back and she's not about to skip the round of 100-days-in-office chats with reporters. The reviews of her baptism by fire haven't been good and she wants to set the record straight.
In a wide-ranging interview with the Montreal Gazette, Plante discusses her proudest achievement, her biggest regret and what she has found to be most surprising about being mayor. She also gives her take on some of the key moments in her first three and a half months in office.
The mayor does not hesitate when asked her greatest feat so far: ordering 300 new hybrid transit buses to deal with chronic overcrowding.
"Montrealers are looking for more mobility and it's something I talked a lot about during my campaign," she says. Fulfilled thanks to financial help from Quebec, the purchase served to prove her detractors wrong about her having no sway with the provincial government, she adds.
Her biggest regret? A fat tax hike that contradicted her election promise not to exceed inflation.
"It was the right thing to do and I stand by it and it is a tax dedicated to water - we're not going to have a party with that money," Plante says. But in hindsight, she says, she realizes she should have made clear during the campaign that her tax pledge only referred to part of the municipal tax bills - and she should have better explained the tax hike once it was announced.
The backlash from the botched budget is still being felt.
Which may explain Plante's biggest eye-opener: the high expectations Montrealers have for their mayor.
"I'm surprised by the level of expectations. People have lots of hopes," she says.
That can result in "people saying, 'Well, Mme. Plante, we wish you would have done this differently,'but sometimes it's just something I don't have control of."
At the same time, she realizes "being the mayor brings out a lot of aspirations for Montrealers and I take that seriously. It just gives me energy to do my best to solve as many problems as I can."
Here are five key issues from the first 100 days, and what Plante has to say about them.
TAXES
WHAT HAPPENED: During the election campaign, Plante promised not to raise municipal taxes by more than the inflation rate, which was expected to be about 2 per cent in 2018. So voters were shocked when the average hike in her first budget, made public on Jan. 10, was 3.3 per cent. Adding to taxpayers'consternation was Plante's attitude. She initially dismissed critics, contending she wasn't actually breaking the pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was due to a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." But that rationale didn't wash with many voters, since both taxes are based on property value and both are charged on the same bill. Also, nowhere in its platform did Projet Montréal say it was going to raise the water tax.
PLANTE'S POSITION: She should have chosen her words more carefully during the campaign, Plante acknowledges. But she contends she was blindsided by a financial hole left behind by the previous Coderre administration. "You become mayor and you open the books and you see this big projected deficit: $358 million. That's seven per cent of our entire budget - it's huge." Her administration also made the decision to ramp up work repairing and replacing the city's notoriously leaky water infrastructure. Montrealers would have understood the reasons for the tax decision had her administration done a better job of communicating about the budget, she says.
MOUNT ROYAL
WHAT HAPPENED: After a cyclist was killed on Mount Royal during the election campaign, Projet Montréal vowed to make the mountain safer for pedestrians and cyclists, but did not spell out details. In February, Plateau-Mont-Royal Mayor Luc Ferrandez, Plante's point man on big parks, announced a pilot project that would block drivers from using Camillien-Houde Way /Remembrance Rd. as an eastwest artery, eliminating a popular route linking Côte-des-Neiges and Plateau-Mont-Royal. The aim was to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety but the announcement caused an uproar. The initial announcement was short on details. For example, it only later emerged that the city would allow drivers arriving from the west to use the bigger Smith House parking lot on the eastern side when the smaller Beaver Lake lot is full. Ferrandez had promoted the idea of cutting the road in two for years but his declaration surprised even some of his fellow Projet councillors since the party's election platform referred to "gradually reducing transit traffic" on the mountain, not an abrupt shutdown. Drivers are furious about losing a popular crosscity route. Mountain users are worried about being cut off from parts of the mountain. Les amis de la montagne, whose mandate is to protect and promote Mount Royal, says the plan, on which it has not been consulted, could create more problems than it solves.
PLANTE'S POSITION: During the election campaign, when asked about Ferrandez's idea of banning through traffic on Mount Royal, Plante only said she would consider the idea. "When we took power, I was able to look at all that was done and it just makes sense," Plante says of the pilot project. She noted the city studied the idea in two reports, in 2008 and 2013. "A lot of people who use this transit road are upset. Well, I will prove to them that there are ways to go around the mountain and still go to work and do what you have to do, while giving Montrealers and tourists better access to the mountain." She says previous mayors have mulled over the idea, which she says is better for the environment as well as for people on foot and bike. "It's not an easy one," Plante says of the through-traffic problem. "That's probably why other politicians have never decided to take the lead on this one." She says an impact study will be made public after the pilot project.
SNOW AND ICE
WHAT HAPPENED: In January, snowstorms followed by freezing rain left in their wake snowclogged streets, slippery sidewalks and furious Montrealers. The Plante administration blamed the rougher-than-usual winter. But its case wasn't helped when it hesitated over a snow-clearing operation, hoping milder weather would eliminate the snow and ice. Mother Nature didn't co-operate. One borough mayor - Luis Miranda of Anjou - ignored city directives and had ice-free sidewalks, while much of Montreal's remained treacherous. Miranda became something of a folk hero after his good deed was met with a warning that Anjou could be hit with a fine of at least $200,000 for contravening city rules.
PLANTE'S POSITION: "We did well with the previous snowstorms and then we had the one with ice and we realized that some practices had to be reviewed," she says. Montreal is an expert on carting off snow but falters when it comes to dealing with slippery sidewalks, she admits. "When it comes to sidewalks, it's a borough responsibility, but as a city, it is our job to say, 'Hey, there's ice everywhere and we need to do better,'" Plante says. Montreal will spend an extra $1.5 million on salt this winter and "ice crushers" will be ordered to deal with treacherous sidewalks starting next winter, she says. With city snow dumps overflowing, Montreal is also opening a new one and has ordered extrastrong blowers so it can stuff more snow into existing ones. "This is a crazy winter," she says. "For me, it was important to say, here's what we should have done better and here's how we can do better" in the future.
PUBLIC TRANSIT
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's highest-profile election promise was the Pink Line - a new 29-station métro line linking Montreal North and Lachine. So far, little has come of the idea - not even money for a study of the concept, which critics say will cost far more than the $6-billion figure Projet put forward during the campaign. However, a transit pledge she deemed her "No. 1 priority" is materializing. Plante convinced Quebec to help finance the purchase of 300 new hybrid buses by 2020, increasing the Société de transport de Montréal's fleet by 15 per cent, to 2,100 buses. Critics suggest the purchase is premature because the STM has run out of garage space and will have nowhere to park them. The transit agency says it will find a solution in time.
PLANTE'S POSITION: Plante says her administration has set up an internal committee to hash out the details of the Pink Line. "We are already putting energy and thinking behind the Pink Line." But she notes that a regional body - the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain - will eventually have to come up with the proposal that will go to the provincial and federal governments, which would have to finance the new line. She hopes the ARTM will have set up an office to study the Pink Line by the fall of 2021. Plante admits she was "too excited" early in the election campaign when she suggested digging on the new line would start at the end of a first Projet Montréal mandate. She corrected that later, suggesting work would only start during a second mandate, meaning no sooner than late 2021. "My hope is that in a second mandate we'll be able to present some real action" on the Pink Line, she says.
STE-CATHERINE ST.
WHAT HAPPENED: Plante's party was unimpressed with Coderre's plan for a major revamp of Ste-Catherine St. Projet wanted a more pedestrian-friendly, car-light version. So far, Plante has nixed two parts of Coderre's ideas: there will be no heated sidewalks, nor will inflatable street coverings be installed during construction. However, Plante's vision for Montreal's marquee shopping street is still unknown. The new plan is due in March.
PLANTE'S POSITION: She won't give any hints about her new plan but says "we want to make sure that people will be happy with what they see in the end. Often, people feel like we do something that's really costly but they don't necessarily see the difference." That was one of the criticisms of the $50-million St. Lawrence River to Mount Royal promenade that Coderre built for Montreal's 375th anniversary. In the case of Ste-Catherine, Plante says she wants to ensure the makeover results in a "fantastic" experience for shoppers and pedestrians, with special attention paid to cleanliness and snow removal. As for heated sidewalks, she says it would have cost at least $142 million to install them along 3.3-kilometres of Ste-Catherine. "That was a crazy expense," especially since the city was not sure about the technology's effectiveness, she says. ariga@postmedia.com twitter.com/andyriga

Full text: The snow really has been relentless in Montreal this winter.
Between November and mid-February, 193 centimetres fell.
That's 36 cm more than Montreal normally gets by the end of February, according to an analysis of data collected by Environment Canada at Trudeau Airport.
And Montreal's current tally is only 15 cm short of the 208 cm the city normally gets in an entire snow season (November to April).
The season came in like a lamb, with Montreal receiving 13 cm fewer than normal in November (six, compared with the normal 19).
But in December, 61 cm fell, 12 more than usual.
And in January, 86 cm fell, 37 more than usual.
So far in February, 40 cm has fallen, compared with the 42 cm normally seen in the entire month.
As for rain, there has been less than usual this winter.
The exception was January when 44 millimetres fell - 63 per cent more than the 27 mm that normally falls that month.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration and some boroughs have been criticized in recent weeks for snow-clearing operations deemed inadequate and for failing to properly de-ice sidewalks after freezing rain.
Montreal is in the middle of a reprieve.
The last snowfall occurred on Feb. 10 and there is only a hint of snow in Environment Canada's forecast (a 30-per-cent chance of flurries on Monday).
The city says it's ready for the return of snow.
On Wednesday, it announced that it will rent heavy-duty snowblowers for the next two months to help it deal with overflowing snow dumps.
By next winter, Montreal says some boroughs will have "ice crushers" to better clear sidewalks. ariga@postmedia.com twitter.com/andyriga

The Week in Review: Sidewalks, Code White, snowmageddon, task force and tax bills

Author: Carroll, Ron

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/week-review-sidewalks-code-white-snowmageddon/docview/1993751318/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Historically, orderlies, security guards and nurses have been members of such response teams, but the MUHC is now resorting to recruiting secretaries, housekeeping staff and food preparers as well to subdue highly agitated or violent individuals during emergencies known as Code Whites. The recruitment campaign for Code White volunteers comes after the publication of an investigative series in the Montreal Gazette( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-new-safety-concerns-arise-at-montreal-general ) last week that exposed numerous security problems at the Montreal General Hospital (part of the MUHC) following the near-strangulation of a nurse( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-anatomy-of-a-nurse-attack-at-montreal-general ) by a patient last September. The average tax hike for residential homeowners is 3.3 per cent, an increase for which Plante has taken heat( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/activist-peter-sergakis-promise-city-hall-protest-during-budget-vote ) because she campaigned on a promise( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/promise-tracker-valerie-plante-and-projet-montreals-pledges-for-first-year-in-office ) to raise taxes by no more than the rate of inflation (about 2 per cent).

Montreal ices plan to heat Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks )
The dream of heated sidewalks for Ste-Catherine St. is over. The administration of Mayor Valérie Plante has decided not to pursue the idea, first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre, because it has been judged too expensive, potentially prone to costly breakdowns and could delay the first phase of the infrastructure overhaul that has just begun on Montreal's main commercial artery. The cost estimate for heating the entire 3.3 kilometres of sidewalks to be dug up as part of the Ste-Catherine St. and Phillips Square makeover has ballooned to $120 million. For the first phase of the project alone, which involves rebuilding 700 metres of Ste-Catherine and its underground infrastructure from Mansfield to Bleury Sts., the estimated cost has risen to $32 million, when granite slabs are factored in. The initial estimate was closer to $20 million.
MUHC launches Code White team recruitment campaign( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muhc-launches-code-white-team-recruitment-campaign )
Facing a shortage of hospital personnel willing to respond to Code White violent incidents involving patients and visitors at the McGill University Health Centre, the MUHC launched an internal recruitment campaign on Friday. Historically, orderlies, security guards and nurses have been members of such response teams, but the MUHC is now resorting to recruiting secretaries, housekeeping staff and food preparers as well to subdue highly agitated or violent individuals during emergencies known as Code Whites. Participation in the response teams dwindled after the MUHC in 2016 eliminated Code White premiums - so-called danger pay -under pressure from Health Minister Gaétan Barrette to slash operating costs( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/union-slams-120-million-in-budget-cuts-to-muhc-over-past-five-years ). The recruitment campaign for Code White volunteers comes after the publication of an investigative series in the Montreal Gazette( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-new-safety-concerns-arise-at-montreal-general ) last week that exposed numerous security problems at the Montreal General Hospital (part of the MUHC) following the near-strangulation of a nurse( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-anatomy-of-a-nurse-attack-at-montreal-general ) by a patient last September.
Snow piles up at Angrignon Blvd. site on Jan. 17, 2018.
Allison Hanes: Snow crisis? More like snow fiasco( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-snow-crisis-more-like-snow-fiasco )
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, are blaming trouble with city snow-clearing operations this winter on extraordinary circumstances. But the events of the last few days seem more like the result of extraordinary incompetence. There has been more snow this winter, Parenteau claimed (incorrectly) on Wednesday. The snow dumps are almost full, he warned. Climate change is resulting in more freezing rain, Plante noted (correctly). We're in the midst of a snow crisis, the mayor insisted. More like a snow fiasco. Montreal has existed for 375 years and counting. We can be reasonably sure it has snowed in each and every one of those years. So at this point, we should be experts when it comes to clearing roads and sidewalks. The only thing different about this winter is the people in charge at city hall. Montreal is not in a snow crisis. But the Plante administration sure is.
Union decries Concordia plan to pick students for task force on sexual misconduct( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/student-union-dismayed-by-concordias-plan-to-tackle-sexual-violence )
The Concordia Student Union lashed out Thursday against the university's planned sexual violence task force, saying it's not properly representing students. At a news conference in the morning, Leyla Sutherland, the CSU's student life co-ordinator, said she is concerned the university is nominating students to the task force when that job should be left to the CSU, which represents students. Concordia launched a Task Force on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence,( https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2018/01/25/message-jan-25.html?c=about/administration-governance ) which will include student, staff, faculty and administration representatives. The university issued a call for potential members on Jan. 25, and the deadline for applications is Feb. 8 at 6 p.m. The school has said it will choose which students sit on the committee and they must be students in good academic standing. The task force was set up in the wake of allegations of lecherous behaviour by some professors in the Creative Writing program. The university also issued new guidelines on professor-student relationships( http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/docs/policies/official-policies/BD-4-guidelines-relationships.pdf ) last week.
"We feel cheated," said St-Michel resident Mario Caluori, who will pay $3,454 in taxes this year. "This is a heavy burden for people on low income who do not have cost-of-living increases built into their revenue."
Montreal tax bills are going out and they may shock some taxpayers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-tax-bills-are-going-out-and-they-may-shock-some-taxpayers )
Montreal sent out tax bills this week, detailing for the first time exactly how taxpayers will be affected by a controversial tax hike Plante imposed in her first budget( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-city-council-poised-to-vote-on-budget-controversial-tax-hike ). This weekend, as taxpayers take a closer look, they might be surprised by what they find. That's because the figures bandied about in news articles, press releases and politician sound bites can be misleading. The average tax hike for residential homeowners is 3.3 per cent, an increase for which Plante has taken heat( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/activist-peter-sergakis-promise-city-hall-protest-during-budget-vote ) because she campaigned on a promise( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/promise-tracker-valerie-plante-and-projet-montreals-pledges-for-first-year-in-office ) to raise taxes by no more than the rate of inflation (about 2 per cent).

Abstract: The largest cities in two of the world's three happiest countries, as ranked in the latest World Happiness Report published by the United Nations( http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/HR17-Ch2.pdf ), have heated sidewalks. The failure of that trial run along with the escalating costs of heating a 3.3-kilometre stretch of Ste-Catherine Street were cited Monday as sources confirmed to the Montreal Gazette that the city's plan for heated sidewalks was dead( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ).

Full text: The largest cities in two of the world's three happiest countries, as ranked in the latest World Happiness Report published by the United Nations( http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/HR17-Ch2.pdf ), have heated sidewalks.
In Reykjavik, Iceland, thermal energy harvested from hot springs is used for snow melting. Hot water is pumped through tubes under many of the sidewalks. It's like in-floor heating, but outside. Meanwhile in Oslo, Norway, uses electric heating elements embedded in sidewalks to melt snow.
Montreal's experiment with heated sidewalks at Place Vauquelin also used electric elements. While the world's happiest country successfully implemented this system, Montreal had to replace the first elements it installed in the square after they failed to function properly( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ste-catherine-st-project-begins-in-downtown-core ).
The failure of that trial run along with the escalating costs of heating a 3.3-kilometre stretch of Ste-Catherine Street were cited Monday as sources confirmed to the Montreal Gazette that the city's plan for heated sidewalks was dead( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ).
This decision might not have improved Montreal's happiness quotient, seeing as the city's coming off a week of freezing rain and ice-covered sidewalks.
Incidentally, Canada lags behind Iceland and Norway in the latest World Happiness Report.

Full text: The dream of heated sidewalks for Ste-Catherine St. has been iced.
The administration of Mayor Valérie Plante has decided not to pursue the idea, first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre, because it has been judged too expensive, potentially prone to costly breakdowns and could delay the first phase of the infrastructure overhaul that has just begun on Montreal's main commercial artery.
The cost estimate for heating the entire 3.3 kilometres of sidewalks to be dug up as part of the Ste-Catherine St. and Phillips Square makeover has ballooned to $120 million. For the first phase of the project alone, which involves rebuilding 700 metres of Ste-Catherine and its underground infrastructure from Mansfield to Bleury Sts., the estimated cost has risen to $32 million, when granite slabs are factored in. The initial estimate was closer to $20 million.
After weeks of speculation, sources confirmed the plan was dead Monday to the Montreal Gazette. In addition to the high cost, it was forecast the extra work could delay the street reconstruction by several months, causing price overruns for the city and businesses planning to do renovation work on their buildings. The main focus of the city administration and affected merchants is that the timeline be respected.
After the freezing rain that encased Montreal in a layer of ice last week, the idea of heating the sidewalks had become more appealing than ever. Proponents said it was a sure way to revitalize the city's central strip by enticing shoppers from the malls and convincing an older generation leery of broken hips to venture downtown.
But price surges and Montreal's failed trial run at heating a relatively small, isolated public square next to city hall gave the new administration cold feet over warm sidewalks.
Mayor Plante had expressed strong reservations about spending millions on a technology little used on this continent and potentially prone to costly breakdowns.
The concept was first floated by Coderre in 2015, when his administration unveiled plans to reconstruct( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-plan-for-revamped-ste-catherine-st ) a 2.2-kilometre stretch of the city's iconic downtown thoroughfare and close to another kilometre of side streets, forced by the need to replace geriatric underground water mains and sewers.
Rare in North America, heated sidewalks have been used for decades in Scandinavian countries and places like Sapporo in Japan( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/josh-freed-dreaming-of-snow-free-sidewalks-and-a-bustling-downtown ), which receives more than 15 feet of snow a year. Last year, the city sent a delegation to study the technologies used in Helsinki, Finland, Norway's capital of Oslo and Reykjavik in Iceland. The first two use electricity to heat the sidewalks in portions of their commercial districts, while the Icelandic capital draws on its large stores of underground geothermal energy.
Officials also visited Holland, Mich.( http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2016/02/why_holland_spends_millions_to.html ), near Chicago, which uses free energy supplied by heated waste water from its municipal plant, running it through hoses placed under its sidewalks. The system has been in place for nearly three decades.
"Can we not have the means of our ambitions and do something spectacular for Ste-Catherine St? Think of the potential for economic development," said Opposition leader Lionel Perez.
Montreal engineers also considered using excess heat wasted by large buildings( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/are-heated-sidewalks-a-good-idea-for-montreal ) that heat with steam or hot water.
"We were in favour of that system, and perhaps using geothermal energy," said André Poulin, executive director of the merchants association Destination Centre-Ville. "But city officials said it would be too expensive."
The city decided it would go with running a mixture of water and glycol, a type of antifreeze, in polyethylene tubes resembling garden hoses beneath the sidewalk slabs, heated by electricity.
"The costs (of those types of systems) are very high, for installation and annual repairs and maintenance, and the risks are high that we will have to constantly dig up the sidewalk to repair breaks," Poulin said last week. "So we will not be overly disappointed if the idea does not go through."
Unlike the locales studied, Quebec suffers from vast temperature swings that "are the kiss of death" for those types of heated sidewalk systems, a source within the administration said. "Then we would be digging up the sidewalks all the time for repairs. It would be a nightmare."
The current administration was further disquieted by the city's failed attempts at Place Vauquelin, a pedestrian square next to city hall that was torn up and completely rebuilt last year at a cost of $14.7 million. An electric system installed to power the fountain and the snow-melting system failed two weeks after the square reopened in late June, putting an end to the waterworks and the heating. Then the city discovered in December that it needed a steam-pumping system on its heat exchanger. It's hoping the heating system needed to melt the snow will be ready in February.

Full text: The dream of heated sidewalks for Ste-Catherine St. has been iced.
The administration of Mayor Valérie Plante has decided not to pursue the idea, first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre, because it has been judged too expensive, potentially prone to costly breakdowns and could delay the first phase of the infrastructure overhaul that has just begun on Montreal's main commercial artery.
The cost estimate for heating the entire 3.3 kilometres of sidewalks to be dug up as part of the Ste-Catherine St. and Phillips Square makeover has ballooned to $120 million. For the first phase of the project alone, which involves rebuilding 700 metres of Ste-Catherine and its underground infrastructure from Mansfield to Bleury Sts., the estimated cost has risen to $32 million, when granite slabs are factored in. The initial estimate was closer to $20 million.
After weeks of speculation, sources confirmed the plan was dead Monday to the Montreal Gazette. In addition to the high cost, it was forecast the extra work could delay the street reconstruction by several months, causing price overruns for the city and businesses planning to do renovation work on their buildings. The main focus of the city administration and affected merchants is that the timeline be respected.
After the freezing rain that encased Montreal in a layer of ice last week, the idea of heating the sidewalks had become more appealing than ever. Proponents said it was a sure way to revitalize the city's central strip by enticing shoppers from the malls and convincing an older generation leery of broken hips to venture downtown.
But price surges and Montreal's failed trial run at heating a relatively small, isolated public square next to city hall gave the new administration cold feet over warm sidewalks.
Mayor Plante had expressed strong reservations about spending millions on a technology little used on this continent and potentially prone to costly breakdowns.
The concept was first floated by Coderre in 2015, when his administration unveiled plans to reconstruct( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-plan-for-revamped-ste-catherine-st ) a 2.2-kilometre stretch of the city's iconic downtown thoroughfare and close to another kilometre of side streets, forced by the need to replace geriatric underground water mains and sewers.
Rare in North America, heated sidewalks have been used for decades in Scandinavian countries and places like Sapporo in Japan( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/josh-freed-dreaming-of-snow-free-sidewalks-and-a-bustling-downtown ), which receives more than 15 feet of snow a year. Last year, the city sent a delegation to study the technologies used in Helsinki, Finland, Norway's capital of Oslo and Reykjavik in Iceland. The first two use electricity to heat the sidewalks in portions of their commercial districts, while the Icelandic capital draws on its large stores of underground geothermal energy.

Racing pro helps conquer icy roads

Full text: Driving in the Montreal region is not for the faint of heart - especially once winter hits, bringing months of slippery, snowy road conditions, whiteouts, black ice, freezing rain and worse.
Since we can't spend five months a year inside at home waiting for spring, we drive.
Or at least, we think we do. But according to former pro race car driver Claude Bourbonnais, who now operates a winter car control clinic (claude-bourbonnais.com) on the ice near Ch. de l'Anse in Vaudreuil-Dorion, most people aren't really driving at all.
"They're just guiding the car along in a straight line, and usually nothing is happening. They're having a Starbucks and a cellphone conversation. So when something does happen, they're not ready," said Bourbonnais.
Last Friday's class included drivers with a broad range of experience, who came from all over the Montreal area and even as far as Sherbrooke.
Jean-Christophe Trahan just got his driver's licence last spring. He decided to take the course after an acquaintance of his lost control on an icy back road and crashed, killing one of the three young friends in his car.
"It scared me and I want to be able to handle a situation like that if it happened to me," said Trahan. "If I encounter a patch of ice, I don't want to be surprised. I want to know how to react."
Another student, Julie Quenneville, survived a terrifying head-on collision on an icy country road near St-Denis-de-Brompton two years ago, and now suffers from anxiety when she has to drive in winter.
"I want to regain my confidence as a driver in wintry, icy conditions," she said.
Bourbonnais said although his winter driving course tends to draw new drivers, newcomers unused to Montreal winters, and those who have experienced losing control on icy roads, everyone can benefit from testing their reflexes on the ice in a safe environment.
The class meets in groups of five or six at an old ice-fishing hut with brightly painted trim, which Bourbonnais calls his "winter palace."
Most of the four-hour winter driving course is spent behind the wheel, repeatedly coaxing the car to slide, spin or skid so the students can practise regaining control.
When a car begins to slide on ice, most drivers instinctively turn the wheel and hit the brakes, sending the car into an uncontrollable spin, said Bourbonnais. The key is to keep a cool head, ease off the gas, focus your gaze on where you want to go, and turn a little less to stop the skidding, he said.
It's a counterintuitive response for most people, so most of Bourbonnais's class is spent drilling: zigzagging through a slalom course on the ice, driving in a big circle designed to provoke the car to slide, repeatedly spinning out and recovering after a hard turn at moderate speed, and so on.
As for this reporter, at the end of four hours of slippery driving, I came away feeling both humbled and more confident. It is not easy to get the knack of turning the wheel just the right amount at just the perfect time when the car begins to slide and spin. It really does take your full attention - and both hands on the wheel. Best to put the cellphone away and finish the coffee before you hit the road.

Abstract: All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices for today. While the start of métro service was delayed slightly early Tuesday, all lines were functioning normally as of 7:30 a.m. There were no reports of disruptions to STM bus service, but road and sidewalk conditions virtually guarantee delays over the course of the day and will likely affect handicapped transportation services.

Full text: Highways seem passable - for the time being - while sidewalks, where they can be found, are at best treacherous.
Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day. All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices for today.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While the start of métro service was delayed slightly early Tuesday, all lines were functioning normally as of 7:30 a.m. There were no reports of disruptions to STM bus service, but road and sidewalk conditions virtually guarantee delays over the course of the day and will likely affect handicapped transportation services.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Tuesday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.
Montreal area commuter trains serving the Candiac, Deux-Montagnes, St. Jerome and Vaudreuil-Hudon lines were reporting no problems with operations as of 7:30 a.m.
At Trudeau airport, scores of departures( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights/departures ) scheduled for this morning were cancelled or delayed and the outlook was just as grim for arrivals.( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights/arrivals )

Late Tuesday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.
Montreal area commuter trains serving the Candiac, Deux-Montagnes, St. Jerome and Vaudreuil-Hudon lines were reporting no problems with operations as of 7:30 a.m.
At Trudeau airport, scores of departures( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights/departures ) scheduled for this morning were cancelled or delayed and the outlook was just as grim for arrivals.( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights/arrivals )

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.
This story will be updated.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
"Bomb cyclone" causes flight cancellations at Trudeau International Airport( http://montrealgazette.com/news/bomb-cyclone-causes-flight-cancellations-at-montreals-trudeau-airport )
The "bomb cyclone" sweeping its way up the eastern seaboard Thursday has largely spared Montreal but it caused 101 flight cancellations at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. The storm - which battered the coast with freezing rain and snow - led to 70 cancellations to and from the United States as well as postponing 31 flights to and from Atlantic Canada.
Montrealers rally in support of Iran protests( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rally-supports-popular-uprising-in-iran-they-are-killing-people-in-the-streets )
About 100 people gathered on a street corner in downtown Montreal Thursday afternoon in solidarity with recent widespread anti-government protests that began last month in Iran. The popular uprising has grown to include demands for free elections, a secular state, and a free press. More than 20 protesters are reported to have died in the unrest and hundreds have been imprisoned in the last six days. In Montreal, protesters gathered peacefully on the corner of Guy St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd. Thursday afternoon and chanted slogans such as "Down with dictatorship" and "Down with the Islamic Republic of Iran."
Lac-Mégantic trial: defence warns jury against vindictive spirit in closing arguments( http://montrealgazette.com/news/lac-megantic-trial-defence-warns-jury-against-vindictive-spirit-in-closing-arguments )
In his last chance to address the jury, defence lawyer Gaétan Bourassa downplayed his client's role within Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway, casting doubt on what his actual responsibilities were the night of the 2013 Lac-Mégantic train derailment. Jean Demaître, the company's train operations manager, was the third and last link in the "chain of security" that could have prevented the derailment, Bourassa said in his closing arguments Thursday. "But the breaking, the cracking, of that chain of security" happened before Demaître, he said. Demaître, 53, locomotive engineer Thomas Harding, 56, and traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, are on trial for criminal negligence causing the death of 47 people.
Two Montreal law firms seek to file class-action lawsuit against Apple( http://montrealgazette.com/news/two-montreal-law-firms-seek-to-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-apple-over-battery-life )
Two Quebec law firms are seeking authorization from Quebec Superior Court to file a class action lawsuit against Apple, claiming that its warranty policies violate Quebec's Consumer Protection Act. The application, filed on Dec. 29, comes after Apple admitted that it slows the performance( https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/ ) of some iPhone models in certain situations. The company said that's done to prevent unexpected shutdowns that result from aging, which makes batteries less effective. That acknowledgment, along with the price of Apple products, is evidence that the company is violating Quebec's Consumer Protection Act, said Joey Zukran, a lawyer at LPC Avocats.

Unstable weather systems jeopardize white Christmas: Expert says odds of a Yuletide snowfall is uncertain for many regions, but most of Canada can expect a late-month freeze

Full text: One of Canada's most high-profile weather forecasters says dreaming of a white Christmas will be easier than planning for one this year.
The Weather Network says most regions that currently have snow on the ground can count on keeping it on Christmas Day.
But unstable weather systems sweeping across most of Canada are leaving forecasters in doubt about conditions for much of the rest of the country.
Chief meteorologist Chris Scott says residents across much of Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada may not know if a white Christmas is in the cards until the day itself.
He says prospects for snow are more likely in most of British Columbia, southern Alberta, parts of Saskatchewan and northern Canada.
What's most certain is a spell of bitterly cold weather that Mr. Scott says will settle in just after Christmas from Saskatchewan to all points east.
The period leading up to the festivities, however, is likely to feature highly changeable weather that could complicate some holiday travel plans.
"In the next seven to eight days, we've got a lot of active weather that could make travel dicey," Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview.
"Not necessarily major snowstorms, but a lot of precipitation that could fall as snow, a bit of freezing rain, over to rain and back again. And when we see that, we know the roads can get messy."
Mr. Scott said the central and eastern provinces are most likely to get caught in the unstable weather patterns, with at least two significant weather systems slated to roll through in the week leading up to Christmas.
People hoping for a white Christmas, he said, may have to wait until the last minute to see if their hopes are fulfilled.
Areas such as Ottawa, Montreal, Fredericton and parts of Newfoundland and Labrador, which all have snow on the ground, can expect to see it remain there on Dec. 25.
Some of the variable systems passing through regions including southern Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, however, may bring enough warm air to wipe out possibilities of a white Christmas.
A different story is expected on the opposite coast, with Mr. Scott predicting that snowy conditions will prevail across the southern Interior of B.C. and southern Alberta.
Even typically temperate areas such as Vancouver and regions around Victoria may see a dusting of snow if forecasts pan out as expected, he added.
West Coast residents, however, will likely be spared the one thing forecasters seem confident about - a pending cold snap that's expected to grip the majority of the country starting on or just after Christmas Day.
"We really lock in the cold from essentially Saskatchewan and Manitoba on through Ontario, Quebec and much of Atlantic Canada as well," Mr. Scott said, adding some of those regions will feel arctic conditions they haven't experienced in well over a year.
In some areas, Mr. Scott said daytime highs will top out in the negative teens. The wintry weather is expected to last for most of the stretch between Christmas and New Year's Day.

Snow removal nearly complete in Montreal

Full text: Snow removal operations across the city of Montreal were all but complete on Sunday evening, following the first major snowfall of the season that dumped about 20 centimetres on the region last Tuesday and Wednesday. Most boroughs were reporting snow removal operations were 100 per cent complete by Sunday evening, except for LaSalle (97 per cent), Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (99 per cent), Plateau Mont Royal (90 per cent) and Saint-Laurent (90 per cent). Light snow and freezing rain are expected in Montreal Monday, with accumulation of perhaps a centimetre of snow by Tuesday. Then Montreal should see temperatures up above zero on Wednesday, and then they will dip again on Thursday and Friday. Forecasters are still cautiously predicting a white Christmas for Montreal, with temperatures staying cold enough to hold onto most of the snowpack. Some were calling for milder temperatures and even rain on Dec. 23, but then things will cool off and there is a possibility of some new snow on Christmas Eve.

Full text: From September to May, I see cars park on streets near high schools with engines idling for up to an hour before the last bell.
Why are we not ticketing or issuing warnings to these drivers? Turn off your engines, folks. Better yet, put your teenagers on public transit.
Similarly, every morning since September, I see motorists idling for 30 minutes or more before they head out to work. Again, turn those engines off. Please.
We had smog warnings lately with instructions to not use fireplaces.
But in these public announcements, no mention is made of cars needlessly idling all over the city.
According to the City of Montreal, "the bylaw regarding nuisances caused by motor vehicles stipulates that all persons who let their vehicles idle for more than three minutes are subject to a fine."
There are some exceptions, including emergency vehicles and taxis, and "when the outside temperature is below -10 C and it is necessary to warm up the vehicle because someone is inside and "when there is freezing rain or ice on the vehicle and it is necessary to heat it up in order to ensure safe driving."

Fall Colours; Laurentians a popular destination for leaf-peeping day trippers, Susan Schwartz writes

Full text: Ghislain Parizeau of Croisieres Alouette in Ste-Agathe-des-Monts, about 100 km north of Montreal in the Laurentians, has a question for passengers boarding one of his boats for a cruise of Lac des Sables and a view of the splendid fall foliage: Have they noticed, he asks, the red maple leaf in the centre of the Canadian flag?
As the days shorten and the nights lengthen, many of Quebec's trees don their autumn palette of oranges and golds as well as the reds that evoke the flag's stylized 11-point maple leaf. The wardrobe change usually begins in September, with the colours appearing first in higher elevations. The rate and timing of the change vary from species to species, as do the colours: Oaks turn red, brown or russet, for instance, red maple becomes a brilliant scarlet and black maple goes a glowing yellow.
Among passengers joining the 50-minute tours on Parizeau's Alouette V or VI are international tourists, here from as far away as Europe or the Far East; many time their visits to coincide with the fall foliage. To him, viewing the colours from the water enhances the experience: The colours and the sky are reflected in the lake, "which is calm this time of year, sometimes almost like a mirror, especially in early morning and late afternoon."
Whatever your perspective, there's something spectacular about autumn in Quebec. One finds fall colour nearly anywhere in the province by mid-October, but the Laurentians north of Montreal, with their mountains, lakes and rolling hills, are among the most popular destinations for day-tripping leaf peepers.
A fall foliage map on the Quebec government tourism site (quebecoriginal.com/en-ca), updated every Thursday, tracks the progress of the season. Call Tourisme Quebec at 1-877-BONJOUR (266-5687) to learn where the colours are at their most glorious.
And check out the Tourisme Laurentides website for activities and events in the Laurentians - everything from ziplining or taking a helicopter ride for a bird's-eye view of the foliage to riding the chairlift at a ski hill or simply taking in the scenery on foot, on a bicycle or by car. Merely getting behind the wheel this time of year and heading north on Highway 15 virtually guarantees a scenic drive. Here are four suggested stops: Visit the small Laurentian town of Prevost, at Exit 55 off the 15. If you're there between Wednesday and Sunday, a lovely place for breakfast, brunch or lunch is the Bistro Merci la Vie bakery and cafe, 2988 Cure-Labelle Blvd. Also on Cure-Labelle, at 2480, find Les Sentiers Commemoratifs de la Riviere, a natural cemetery featuring two km of footpaths, flanked by the Riviere-du-Nord, a wooded park, several rest areas, a waterfall, a pond and a play area for children.
The graves, which are for funeral urns, are scattered in nature with flat stones marking grave sites and landscaping featuring plants native to the region.
The final edition for 2017 of the terrific Val-David Saturday summer market was Oct. 7, but the pretty little town is still worth a stop. Visit Kinya Ishikawa's studio and garden at 2435 rue de l'Eglise, 1001 Pots. Ishikawa is the founder of the hugely successful month-long 1001 Pots summer exhibition showcasing the work of potters; this summer it celebrated its 28th edition. Take Exit 76 off Highway 15 and Route 117 to Val-David. The 230-km-long P'tit Train du Nord linear park, a multiuse recreational trail that was once a railway track and is now used for biking, hiking and cross-country skiing, runs through Val-David.
For habitues, a trip to the Laurentians is not complete without a visit to the cosy Creperie Bretonne Au Tournesol, 5825 Labelle Blvd. in nearby Val-Morin (The address is listed as Val-David in some directories.) My favourite is their cheese and mushroom crepe - and the green salad is big enough for two. Closed Monday and Tuesday.
Ste-Agathe, about 100 km north of Montreal (Exit 86 off Highway 15), is where Mordecai Richler set his 1959 novel, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. Its downtown area features restaurants, bars and terrasses; the P'tit Train du Nord runs through its outskirts and Alouette cruises leave several times daily from the municipal dock at the end of Rue Principale.
In the vast Mont-Tremblant provincial park, trails in the Diable sector including La Roche, La Corniche and la Chute du Diable provide superb backdrops where "the colour makes its magic," said Annie Morrisseau, the park's head of client services. Highway 15 north merges just beyond Ste-Agathe with Route 117. Take Exit 107 off the 117 toward St-Faustin-Lac-Carre, continue toward Lac Superieur and follow signs to the La Diable registration centre. Park admission is $8.50 per person.
Gorgeous as the Laurentians are, you can take in the fall colours without leaving town. Mount Royal, of course, has its own beauty, and les Amis de la Montagne offer guided walking tours until the end of October.
Melanie Dappen, naturalist in charge of educational services for GUEPE, says her favourite place in the Montreal area to observe colourful fall foliage is the Boisde-Saraguay nature park in Ahuntsic-Cartierville. It's the newest in a network of nature parks administered by the City of Montreal. So far, Bois-de-Saraguay has only two km of trails, but there is a lot to see, including black maple and red oak. Enter from Jean Bourdon and Joseph Saucier Sts.
Nearby is the larger and more established Bois-de-Liesse Nature Park, featuring old-growth hardwood and forest surrounded by streams. It covers nearly 400 acres in the northwestern part of the island and extends through the Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Pierrefonds-Roxboro and St-Laurent boroughs.

Some years, Quebec's fall foliage dazzles; others, it is quieter.
"The main feature that controls when the colours change is what we call the photoperiod, or length of daylight," said Jim Fyles, associate dean for student affairs in McGill University's agricultural and environmental sciences faculty and Professor and Tomlinson Chair in Forest Ecology in the department of Natural Resource Sciences. "Most plants can detect the change from dark to light and light to dark, and the period between is a reliable indicator of how the season is progressing."
Daylight wanes at the same rate from one year to the next, but colour change is affected also by such factors as weather and soil moisture; like a great deal about nature, these are not entirely predictable.
"Trees don't stick to a calendar," observed Pascal Lynch Caron, head of communications, development and marketing for the organization of educators and naturalists in the city of Montreal's nature parks, the Groupe uni des educateursnaturalistes professionnelles en environnement (GUEPE).
Spectacular fall foliage requires a confluence of factors: a warm, wet spring, fine summer weather and warm and sunny fall days with cool, but above-freezing, nights. Spring in Quebec this year was not so warm, summer was wet and not so fine, and September had few cool nights: The unseasonably hot and humid weather and the lack of rain may have blunted the intensity of the colours.
By late September, for instance, much of the vibrant red foliage Laurentian resident Veronica Baruffati had observed earlier in the month had fallen from the trees around the lakeside community near Ste-Agathe she calls home, and the remaining foliage was "much more muted in colour than usual."
Colour change "is part of the senescence process, by which the trees prepare to go dormant for winter," Fyles explained. As the days grow shorter, production of the chlorophyll responsible for the green in leaves slows and eventually stops. As its concentration is reduced, other contents of the leaf become visible: Carotenoids, responsible for the yellows, are always there, but masked in summer by chlorophyll. Anthocyanins, which give colour to red apples, cherries and blueberries, are produced by sugars in the leaf. Sunny days are needed for what remains of the chlorophyll to produce those sugars, along with cool nights to keep them in the leaf.
"If a tree is under stress, it may senesce and turn colour earlier," Fyles said. "The tree is trying to retrieve nutrients from the leaves before they fall."
Because there was so much rain during the summer, "this year has been a bit strange ... I have seen colours changing in unexpected places over the past few weeks which I have attributed to trees that are stressed by having their roots flooded too much during the year," he said in an email in late September. "In a similar circumstance, we have had so little rain lately that some trees may turn colour early because they are stressed by lack of water."

Full text: Oh, how Montrealers snickered some 18 years back when former Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman conscripted the Canadian Army to wage war against a most stubborn enemy, Mother Nature. Yup, tanks rolled through the streets of T.O. to deal with the ravages of two heavy snowstorms.
Regardless, chaos was largely averted, and no shots were fired - other than a few errant snowballs. And, far from being shamed, Lastman has since stuck by his decision and said he would do the same all over again.
And, oh, how some Montrealers - this cynic, anyway - snickered last Monday when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency, on the basis of reports that the Big Apple could be inundated with the blizzard of the century and receive up to 60 centimetres of snow. Schools were cancelled for the following day and aboveground train transport was shut down.
CNN had bundled-up reporters stationed in the heart of Central Park, ready to take a weather beating for the greater good.
Alas, somewhere between 10 to 15 centimetres fell in New York, and one CNN reporter claimed the freezing rain was hard on his face and getting into his eyes. Sad. But chaos was averted in New York, as it was in Philadelphia and Boston, whose mayors made similar choices in keeping citizens off the streets last week. Of course, here in Montreal, we never overreact. We're tough. We live to smite the snow. Or we used to. Not so much anymore.
Perhaps we should have overreacted to weather reports, because we were utterly unprepared to deal with what transpired last Tuesday.
CNN may not have reported that Montreal was on the verge of getting hit with the storm of the winter and century, but local weathercasters were aware and were letting inhabitants know.
Apparently, our transport officials and police were on a different frequency, perhaps catching Seinfeld re-runs.
If 300 vehicles had been stranded on New York City's Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive - as was the case on Highway 13 - why CNN top-dog Wolf Blitzer himself would have been parachuted onto the scene to report first-hand and even cease commenting on alleged wiretaps of the Trump Tower or Ivanka's line of shmatas.
It's worth noting that de Blasio had 2,400 sanitation workers and 1,600 snowplows at the ready last Monday to deal with the storm that never really was.
So how is it that after all these years Montreal could be so caught with its long johns down? How is it that a couple of stuck trucks can cripple a major highway for 12 hours? How is it that the cops can't take definitive action? Miraculously, no one perished, but that was due to sheer good fortune and nothing more.
The excuses are classic. Apparently, politicians and transport officials claim they knew nothing about the Highway 13 catastrophe until the following morning.
This highway falls under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, yet Transport Minister Laurent Lessard and Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux admitted to being unaware of the situation. Really? I happened to have been thousands of kilometres out of the country last Tuesday, but thanks to that Internet machine, I was brought instantly up to speed on weather conditions and the parking lot that was Highway 13.
Social media was abuzz with horror stories, and yet our transport minister - and CNN - were out of the loop. Hmmm ... So what about taking this tack the next time we hear about a storm threatening to come our way: have the salt spreaders and snowplows at the start line as the first flakes begin to fly; have the cops out in force to take charge; have the schools cancelled; and, oh yeah, have someone send wake-up calls to our transport and public security ministers.
And so what if they snicker in Toronto or New York about how Montreal has over-reacted to a potential snowstorm. It beats the alternative all to hell. bbrownstein@postmedia.com twitter.com/billbrownstein

Snowy sidewalks make it tough to appreciate winter; Getting around Montreal a real pain for pedestrians when every step is a challenge

Full text: My neck is sore. My back is aching. My arms are like spaghetti.
No, I didn't try to break any Olympic weightlifting records by hoisting a barbell over my head. This is how I feel after two days of pushing a stroller around town on Montreal's snowy sidewalks. Since Saturday, the city has been blanketed in nearly 40 centimetres of snow at last count.
But not all of it fell in one go, complicating clearing efforts that Montrealers love to complain about in the best of times.
But on this occasion they have reason to gripe. Before the tractors and plows completed their cleanup after the first dump, the skies opened again (and again) covering their tracks.
The result is a winter wonderland that is beautiful to behold but difficult to navigate - for some more than others.
I have sympathy for drivers, who have to dig out their cars, scramble to find one of the few unburied parking spaces and drive down streets reduced to a single lane in some instances while awaiting snow-clearing operations.
Public transit users also face obstacles. Passengers waiting on platforms are getting pummelled by snow tsunamis as commuter trains arrive in some stations. Bus riders have to jump snow banks and slush puddles getting on board or disembarking.
Winter cyclists, I salute you. You are bold and much braver than I will ever be. But it looks like many bike paths are getting cleared, so you're probably having an easier time getting around.
Pedestrians on the other hand, seem to be an afterthought. On some streets they are forced to walk single file like goats along a mountain cliff. Even on major roads that have been plowed - once, perhaps, at some point in the midst of these never-ending squalls - there is enough soft snow underfoot to make walking slippery and slow. Try shoving a 27-pound toddler in a stroller through the drifts and you start to feel like Sisyphus - even if you don't actually have to climb a hill.
As I trudged along over the past few days, with other pedestrians stuck behind me or forced to stand aside to let me pass, I started to wish I had a blade mounted on the front of the stroller.
Given it felt like shovelling anyhow, at least I could have cleared a path in the process. (Note to potential inventors: feel free to steal this idea. Just let me test drive the prototype, OK?) Of course, pushing a stroller is nothing compared to the challenges faced by those with mobility issues. Is it even possible to get around in a wheelchair right now given the depth of the snow and the narrowness of the passageways? Those needing crutches or a walker wouldn't fare much better due to the unevenness of the snow-covered ground. Anyone who is a bit unsteady faces real hardship.
I had to take the arm of an elderly woman struggling to keep her balance clambering through a snowbank that a private contractor had left in the middle of the sidewalk after plowing out an apartment building parking lot downtown. I guess they figure the elusive sidewalk plows will push it aside. Eventually ...
City crews struggle to keep up with the demand, even as they work around the clock. Dense boroughs like the Plateau-Mont-Royal, Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace and the beleaguered Sud-Ouest seem to be the toughest to get a handle on. But five, going on six, days after the first flakes fell, clogged sidewalks are becoming a security risk.
Don't get me wrong. I love winter. I prefer snow to horrid freezing rain that turns the streets into luge tracks and covers the parks in glacial ice the consistency of cement. I thrive on confronting the elements. But winter is best enjoyed when you have nowhere to go in a hurry.
If only we could find a way to bring the serenity of a crosscountry ski trail or the thrill of a toboggan run to everyday life.
If we find ways to embrace the season and its transportation possibilities rather than fighting it all the time, winter might be far less miserable.
How about snowshoe trails through back alleys or an urban skateway traversing the city? Why not a snowmobile lane over one of the bridges or along a major artery? Practically speaking, not every road can be transformed into an outdoor enthusiast's playground. But until then, I'll count down the days until we get heated sidewalks on Ste-Catherine Street.

'It's all coming to an end': Snow on way for Sunday

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a special weather statement Friday morning, saying driving conditions may be difficult in parts of the province, especially for those without winter tires.

Full text:   Enjoy this weekend, because it could be the last one with unseasonably warm temperatures and green grass.
"It's all coming to an end," said Environment Canada meteorologist Robert Michaud, who is one of the people happy about the return to seasonal norms. "I'm kind of glad; it's going to be a bit of a relief, especially for allergy sufferers like me. It has been as bad as the middle of September, because it hasn't gone below freezing, so everything is still growing."
Michaud said Saturday will likely be the last day this month with temperatures significantly warmer than normal - a high of 14 Celsius is forecast under sunny skies. Then, snow will be the weather maker for Sunday outside the Montreal region. Abitibi, Vald'Or, the Laurentians, Quebec City, and the Eastern Townships could all see significant accumulation over the course of the day. While it was too soon to say with certainty on Friday, the Abitibi region could see as much as 10 centimetres of accumulation, he said.
As for Montreal, Sunday will be rainy for most of the day, but a low-pressure system will cause temperatures to plummet and the rain will change to snow at night.
Monday morning should be marked by a "blanket of snow," Michaud said, but it won't be around for long. Just long enough to wreak havoc with the morning commute.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement Friday morning, saying driving conditions may be difficult in parts of the province, especially for those without winter tires. In Montreal, it could make for a messy commute to work on Monday, with some snow and lots of slush expected on the roads.
"Monday morning will be a difficult rush hour," Michaud said. "The temperature will be around zero or plus-one, so it's hard to say how much snow will actually fall."
The Weather Network is predicting about five centimetres of snow for the Montreal region on Monday. As for people who have not yet installed their winter tires, Michaud recommends staying in the city. "You should be fine here, because it's going to be melting" he said. "If you decide to go to the St-Jovite area, and anywhere with mountains, it's a good idea (to have winter tires)."

Building The Legacy

Author: Riga, Andy

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/building-legacy/docview/1806280986/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Events have included Montreal Impact soccer games, Blue Jays exhibition games, the FIFA Women's World Cup, and AC/DC and One Direction concerts. The Velodrome was "an extravagance without any relation to the Olympic requirements or the city's needs after the Games," the Malouf inquiry into cost overruns found in 1980. Since 1992, the building has been known as the Biodome, a popular living nature museum that's about to undergo a $22-million renovation.

Full text:   After the medals were handed out, Montreal was left with an abundance of world-class facilities. Many had been built wildly over-budget. The inquiry into Olympic cost overruns found one facility to be a 'real white elephant' and another of 'an extravagance without any relation to the Olympic requirements or the city's needs after the Games.' Andy Riga looks at the key venues.
OLYMPIC STADIUM
Olympic use: The centrepiece of the Montreal Games, the Olympic Stadium was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, most track and field events, soccer finals and the equestrian Grand Prix team jumping event.
Designed by French architect Roger Taillibert, the oval-shaped stadium was to have a retractable roof and tower rising obliquely above, but the roof and tower weren't built until years later.
Budgeted at $106 million in 1972, the Stadium and adjacent aquatic centre ended up costing more than $600 million by the time the Games opened, the Malouf inquiry determined in its 1980 report. That did not include the cost of the tower and roof. A retractable roof, made of Kevlar, was finally installed in 1987. But it was opened and closed a grand total of only 88 times before it was left permanently closed, due to repeated tears.
It was replaced in late 1998 by a fixed fibreglass-membrane roof. In January 1999, that roof ripped, sending tonnes of snow down on workers setting up the Montreal auto show. Five people were injured.
In 1991, a 55-tonne concrete beam outside the stadium broke loose and crashed onto a walkway. No one was injured.
During the Games, the stadium featured permanent seating for 60,000 and space for an additional 10,000 during the Games. After the Games, the stadium was used by the Expos and the Alouettes. Current use: Sports, concerts and other events. In 2015, it was used on 168 days and welcomed 589,000 visitors. Events have included Montreal Impact soccer games, Blue Jays exhibition games, the FIFA Women's World Cup, and AC/DC and One Direction concerts.
The roof has ripped repeatedly. But authorities say they have managed to reduce the number of tears. In an August 2015 inspection, 496 rips were counted. That's down from 1,905 found in May 2013.
Use of the stadium is limited between November and April because of fears snow and freezing rain will cause rips in its fragile roof. A proposed new roof would reportedly cost $215 million. The stadium currently seats 56,000.
In 2015, more than 230,000 visitors used the funicular to ride up the tower and take in the view from the summit, 165 metres up. In March, the Mouvement Desjardins announced it would rent seven storeys of the tower to house 1,000 call-centre workers.
OLYMPIC AQUATIC CENTRE
Olympic use: Swimming competitions.
Current use: Known as the Olympic Stadium Sports Centre, the centre, nestled under the Olympic Stadium tower, reopened last year after $30 million in renovations. It features seven pools, including ones for competition, diving and synchronized swimming, as well as training gyms. The facilities are used by the public and athletes in training, and for competitions. Before the renovations began, the centre was being used by more than 300,000 people annually.
VELODROME
Olympic use: Built next to the Olympic Stadium, the Velodrome, designed by French architect Roger Taillibert, was used for cycling and judo competitions.
Resembling a turtle shell, its dramatic, perforated roof was designed with four supports on its edges, allowing it to be completely free of interior supports. It featured 7,500 spectator seats.
The building cost almost $75 million, more than four times its original budget. The Velodrome was "an extravagance without any relation to the Olympic requirements or the city's needs after the Games," the Malouf inquiry into cost overruns found in 1980. Current use: Since 1992, the building has been known as the Biodome, a popular living nature museum that's about to undergo a $22-million renovation. More than 800,000 people visit annually.
MAURICE-RICHARD ARENA
Olympic use: Opened in 1961, the circular building near the Olympic Stadium was used for preliminary boxing rounds and for finals in freestyle wrestling.
Current use: Renovated in 1994, the 4,800-seat arena is used for sporting events. It is Speedskating Canada's national short-track training centre.
PIERRE-CHARBONNEAU CENTRE
Olympic use: Opened in 1960, the centre, adjacent to the Olympic Stadium, was used for all Greco-Roman wrestling matches during the Montreal Games.
Current use: It is now a fitness, sports and cultural facility.
OLYMPIC VILLAGE
Olympic use: Across the street from the Olympic Stadium, the two pyramid-shaped towers housed nearly 9,000 athletes and team officials during the 1976 Games.
Units in the buildings were equipped to house from five to 14 athletes. Each athlete was provided with a bed, a chest for personal belongings, a clothes rack and a lamp.
The entire Village was surrounded by a high wire security fence. Originally budgeted at $30 million, the 19-storey complex ended up costing $98 million. Current use: Rental apartments. In 2012, the 980 residential suites were sold for $176.5 million.
OLYMPIC BASIN
Olympic use: Montreal didn't have facilities for rowing and canoeing so part of Ile Notre-Dame was converted into the Olympic Basin.
The basin was 2.2 kilometres long and 110 metres wide, with a depth of 2.3 metres. There was seating for 10,000, in addition to standing room for another 20,000.
A three-storey concrete building housed offices for Games organizers and teams. Next door, a tower contained photo-finish equipment.
The basin, which cost $25 million to build, was used "very little" after the Games and became "a real white elephant," the Malouf inquiry into Olympic cost overruns found in 1980.
Current use: The basin is used for rowing, canoe-kayak and dragon boat training and competitions.
The athletes' quarters built for the Games are used as a training facility, with a weight room, rowing tanks and workout rooms. On Aug. 14, the basin is holding a free Olympic Initiation event for kids. Rowing and dragonboating will be on tap.
CLAUDE-ROBILLARD CENTRE
Olympic use: Built for the Olympics, the centre featured an Olympic-sized pool for water polo and a big hall for handball competition. It also housed training facilities for field hockey, track and field, soccer, swimming and diving. Seating capacity was 4,700 for handball and 2,800 for water polo. Current use: A major training centre, past users have included Alexandre Despatie, Emilie Heymans, Bruny Surin and Lucian Bute.
The interior features a running track, tennis courts, a gymnasium, as well as facilities for gymnastics, archery, fencing, wrestling, karate, judo, bodybuilding and weightlifting, boxing, squash and racquetball.
Outside, athletes can use a running track, two soccer fields and 12 tennis courts. The centre's aquatic facilities were renovated in 2009.
ETIENNE-DESMARTEAU CENTRE
Olympic use: In the planning stages before the Olympics, the centre's two ice-hockey rinks provided the perfect space for basketball competition, with seating for 5,000 spectators. It was named after a Montreal athlete who won Canada's first Olympic gold medal - for the 25-kg weight throw at the 1904 Games in St. Louis. Current use: Now known as the Etienne-Desmarteau Arena, it features two rinks for hockey, ringette, broomball and skating. It's also home to Les Canadiennes, of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.
OLYMPIC EQUESTRIAN CENTRE
Olympic use: Most equestrian events were held at the Olympic Equestrian Centre in Bromont, where a dressage and jumping stadium, training and competition fields and stables were built. Seating was available for more than 15,000 spectators, with standing-room capacity on surrounding hills pegged at 20,000. Current use: The Bromont Equestrian Olympic Park is an equestrian training and competition facility.
PAUL-SAUVE ARENA
Olympic use: Opened in 1960, the multi-purpose athletic facility was used for preliminary volleyball rounds for the Games (the semifinals and finals were held at the Forum).
Current use: It was demolished in the early 1990s. Residential buildings now cover the area.

Full text: Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes see snow and below-zero temperatures replace the balmy weather they had been enjoying
? Ski season is saved. Quebec City's ice hotel might stay frozen. Montreal's Fête des neiges will be worthy of the name. Ottawa's Rideau Canal finally has a thin layer of ice to build on.
Toronto, well, enjoy the slush.
Winter finally arrived in full splendour in much of Eastern Canada on Tuesday, with more than 30 centimetres of fluffy snow in some places and temperatures well below zero - five days after a rainy Christmas Eve with temperatures in the teens that was more bewildering than pleasant for those who like some winter.
The snow fell across Eastern Ontario, southern Quebec and into the Maritimes. Newfoundland, one of the few eastern places that had decent snowfall before Christmas, was expected to see more flakes by the end of the week. As usual, flights were delayed and cancelled, cars slid off roads and people shovelled.
Before the break of dawn, Elvio Galasso and his son, Dante, had the car packed and were ready to roll to Mont-Saint-Bruno, the ski hill nearest to Montreal. "I promised him we were going no matter what," Mr. Galasso said. "It was a great day of skiing."
Mr. Galasso, a chef instructor at a Montreal culinary school, is among those not seduced by the weird December T-shirt weather fuelled by El Nino. "We need snow in Montreal for winter," he said. "It's who we are, we grew up with it. The streets are gloomy without it. Everything will light up now."
The view was more sombre in Southern Ontario. Toronto was hit by a "smorgasbord" of winter precipitation, from snow to freezing rain to ordinary drizzle that has made the city a slushy mess, Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips noted.
"You pick your poison," he said. "I often wonder who has it more miserable. Montreal has had 30 centimetres of snow ... but at least they're only dealing with the snow! Here what we've had in Southern Ontario is the buffet."
While many pined for a white Christmas when the weather was verging on tropical, the chilly morass of Toronto's streets has some ruing what they wished for. "We've gone from euphoria to ‘Oh no!'" Mr. Phillips said.
Bassel and Dina Ramadan fell victim to Toronto's fickle weather during a family visit from Tampa, Fla. They tried to go skating at Nathan Phillips Square on Monday but left because it was too busy. Returning on Tuesday, they found the rink closed and pockmarked with puddles.
Shrugging off their bad luck, the couple's son and daughter hurled soggy snowballs at each other. "If they're happy, we're happy," Mr. Ramadan said.
Winter clothing sellers are also reaping the harvest of the city's meteorological misfortune. The Toronto shoe store Getoutside was packed with shoppers belatedly, if not begrudgingly, buying Sorels and Blundstones on Tuesday. "The day after the snowstorm, people come flooding in," Clive Gayle, a salesman, said.
In Quebec, the absence of snow and cold has hard economic consequences for a province where everything from Quebec City's Carnaval to the flow of maple syrup relies on a proper frozen winter.
Tiny Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade has waited anxiously for the local river to freeze for the annual eight-week tomcod ice-fishing extravaganza, which draws 100,000 visitors from the cities and brings in $5-million in activity.
The river was only 60-per-cent frozen on Tuesday and the season will likely be cut in half. "This isn't the first time freeze-up is late, but this year we were really scared," Steve Massicotte, the festival organizer, said.
While most of the country east of Manitoba waited for winter, it's been well installed to the west for some time.
Since November, Theresa Leinenweber, the economic development officer for the town of Kindersley in western Saskatchewan, has jogged in much worse weather than anything seen in Montreal or Toronto. Trying to add a little levity to winter's early onset, the local RCMP detachment sent out a rap version of a winter weather warning to drivers 35 days ago.
Like most hardy Prairie residents, Ms. Leinenweber is bemused at the shock that the normal onset of winter seems to provoke in the urban east every year.
"My brother from Ottawa was here. He packed his long johns because it was -15. Really?" Ms. Leinenweber said. "I go jogging in a -30 wind chill here, but I have my limits, too. After that I usually wuss out."
But even in winter-hardened Saskatchewan, Ms. Leinenweber said people have basked in (relatively) balmy temperatures for much of December, with the occasional snowfall to keep things bright.
"I can't say I'm even that jealous of what they've been getting out east. These minus 10s here have actually been really nice," she said. It was actually -18 in Kindersley while she spoke.

Full text: This year, we have had rain practically every day throughout November and December, a time of the year when we should be seeing some snow
No snow for Christmas? And a temperature of 7 C? Maybe a high of 12? This cannot be happening.
What are holidays without snow? They're just ordinary, boring days, without magic or joy. The sight of a snow-covered street or park is uplifting; rain is depressing. True, we had a Christmas Day without snow in 2006 - the meteorologists keep reminding me.
Here in Montreal, people are gloomily going through the last motions of gift buying, trying to avoid the puddles on the sidewalks, their paper gift bags tearing under the rain, their heads bowed down under their umbrellas.
And we're all confused about our footwear: The unseasonal temperatures have kept our snow boots in the closet, collecting dust instead of the white stuff. Wellies would be more appropriate but most people here don't own any.
This year, we have had rain practically every day throughout November and December. According to Environment Canada, this month is breaking the record for the warmest December.
Don't get me wrong: I am no fan of Old Man Winter. I detest the face-freezing, biting cold. I don't ski, I don't skate. But snow, snow I love. The beauty of which I blissfully admire from my downtown apartment, close to public transit - I'm spared all the miseries linked to snow. I haven't seen a shovel for years, and I never have to go through the back-breaking efforts of trying to free my car from a snow bank.
This season, on the bus, people lose themselves in their smartphones, their dripping umbrellas between their legs, their trip rhythmed by the repetitive sound of the bus's giant windshield wipers. A far cry from the magic of seasons past, when strangers wished the driver a Merry Christmas as they stomped the snow from their feet.
The sellers of ski equipment, let alone the ski-slopes operators, are desperate. So are millions of parents, who fear their kids will spend the whole holiday period inside, huddled over their video games instead of building snow castles in the fresh, healthy winter air.
Sometimes - a fleeting Christmas miracle: We see snowflakes dancing in the air. But why must they melt as soon as they touch the ground?
No, this is not real snow: The authentic stuff stays, builds, and leaves glorious layers of soft white meringue.
"Wishing you a merry brown Christmas," some cynics say. Because of its distasteful associations, brown is not a lovely colour. In France, this word - - has been virtually erased from the vocabulary. No self-respecting salesperson will ever sell you "a brown jacket." They will refer to "" ( is a nice word, meaning "chestnut").
The media are trying to put a positive spin on this sad phenomenon of snowlessness. They're talking of a "green Christmas," "." But let's stop kidding ourselves. There's nothing green in Montreal (or in the country, for that matter). The only green in sight is the pines, which, at this time of year, should be weighed down with piles of snow gleaming under the bright happy sun of a real Canadian winter.
Is this the beginning of the effects of climate change? Will Montreal become like Vancouver, a glorious city in summertime whose beautiful mountains disappear in November under low skies and constant rain?
But then, would the St. Lawrence Valley become as lush as the Okanagan, and yield a cornucopia of sweet fruits and gorgeous wines?
That sounds lovely - but don't fool yourself. Nothing beats snow at Christmas.

Report details what went wrong during ice storm; City did a poor job of prioritizing the spreading of abrasives

Full text:   The city of Montreal does not have enough machinery and manpower to clear its snow and spread abrasives on its sidewalks at the same time. So in times of crises, it must prioritize.
In the case of the snow and ice storm that hit Montreal starting Jan. 3, most boroughs chose the wrong priority, opting to clear the snow before putting down salt or gravel on sidewalks.
This was the main cause of the city's failings determined by an internal audit of the snow-clearing operations presented Wednesday. The report was compiled by the office of city comptroller Alain Bond through telephone interviews with the heads of public works of all 19 of the city's boroughs at the request of Mayor Denis Coderre. Bond's report said poor weather forecasts, machinery that was either broken down or couldn't handle slippery sidewalks, and poor communication with its boroughs and citizens exacerbated the problems. In retrospect, many boroughs admitted they wished they had stopped their snow-clearing operations to concentrate on making their sidewalks safer.
Vowing last week to find out "who did not do their jobs" leading to more than 3,000 calls to the city's help hotline, Coderre toned down his message Wednesday, saying he was merely trying to determine causes and find solutions.
Coderre vowed to put in place the 16 recommendations from the report, which include establishing a standard level of service to be followed by all boroughs, improved communications, better training of workers and creating a pool of employees and equipment that can be shared among boroughs in times of need.
"It's clear it was a series of small failings that explained this situation," he said. "I think it is clear that today those recommendations will be applied. We will create a new snow-clearing policy. ... We can't have 19 different policies for 19 boroughs."
He added that the issue was not one of money or budgets, as opposition parties have suggested, but of better management.
Opposition party Projet Montreal scoffed at Coderre's assertion money wasn't the issue, saying Coderre's cutting of boroughs' snow budgets by seven per cent was in part to blame for the lack of human resources and equipment.
"Mr. Coderre said last week he was embarking on a witch hunt to find out who was responsible. Today, we see the guilty party is M. Coderre," Projet Montreal leader Luc Ferrandez said. A lack of communication from the central city, employee absenteeism in several boroughs and poor weather forecasts created a "general chaos" during which Coderre abdicated his role as leader, Ferrandez said.
The comptroller found: Weather reports paid for by the city predicted the coming snow and freezing rain, but failed to predict plummeting temperatures to follow. Because of that, many boroughs decided to finish clearing the snow before switching to sanding sidewalks. (A presentation by the city's civil servants last week, however, said that the weather forecasts they surveyed were very accurate.)
Boroughs are mostly unable to carry out snow clearing and spreading abrasives at the same time.
Many borough decision makers felt pressed to move to snow-clearing mode as soon as possible.
The effectiveness of the spreading of abrasives differs widely from borough to borough, and even within the same borough depending on whether it's handled by city workers or private contractors. In one borough, private contractors were able to complete salting in five hours, while blue collars required nine hours.
In many boroughs, sidewalk abrasive spreaders were deemed dangerous because their rubber tires caused them to slide offsidewalks and couldn't handle steep hills.
Employee absenteeism was not an issue in most boroughs, except Ahuntsic-Cartierville and the Sud-Ouest borough.
In Ile-Bizard-Ste-Genevieve, roughly 50 per cent of equipment was broken. Some boroughs lacked mechanics to fix broken machinery.
Coderre's assertion the city can impose similar norms on each borough for snow clearing shows he has a complete lack of understanding of snow-clearing operations, Projet Montreal councillor Guillaume Lavoie charged. All boroughs have different needs based on density, parking, kilometres of roads and sidewalks, and cannot fit into one standard.
Michel Parent, head of the city's blue-collar union responsible for snow clearing, said boroughs used to share resources and manpower, until they were forced to merge. Now boroughs are hesitant to share equipment for fear it will break and they will be saddled with the cost.
Ferrandez said boroughs employees are worked to the limit during snowstorms, and have no excess time to share with other boroughs.

Full text: With flights cancelled, and rail and trucking routes temporarily shut down, freezing weather could have dramatic effect on economy
For ski resorts and beach-bound tour operators, the wild winter weather is good news. For many other businesses, however, the frigid temperatures gripping much of Canada and the U.S. Midwest are making life difficult.
Few sectors have been hit as hard as transportation, where winter storms and the intense cold have snarled key routes and stranded travellers.
American Airlines Inc. had cancelled 900 flights by mid-day Monday, on top of the 1,800 cancellations in the four-day aftermath of the ice storm that hit Canada and the United States before Christmas.
It got so cold in Chicago that the glycol used to de-ice aircraft froze. One type freezes at -14 Fahrenheit (-26 C), American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said from Dallas.
The weather is "certainly is wreaking havoc on our operations," he said.
Just as operations at Air Canada were returning to normal after disruptions from the pre-Christmas ice storm, freezing rain forced the closing of airports in Montreal and Ottawa Sunday night, Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said.
The airline gave out 2,200 hotel rooms to stranded passengers in the Toronto area Sunday night, and added two special flights to Montreal Monday with its biggest aircraft - Boeing 777-300s.
Porter Airlines cancelled about two dozen flights out of Toronto on Monday because of runway conditions and poor weather in Boston and Newark, spokesman Brad Cicero said. Where possible, Porter has added flights to try to get stranded passengers on their way.
The weather's broader effect on the economy is likely to be largely temporary, but while it lasts, the impact can be dramatic. Spot prices for natural gas in the New York city area skyrocketed Monday for any utilities in need of immediate supply.
Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., said a significant proportion of business that is lost during outbreaks of bad weather can be recouped when the sun comes out. "[Companies] can play catch up the next day or the next week or the next month." While some businesses - such as restaurants - may not get back what they lost, most others will be able to make up the difference, he said.
Mr. Porter noted that during the massive ice storm of 1998, when huge swaths of Quebec and eastern Ontario were paralyzed for weeks, there was a significant short-term hit to the economy, but then it roared back very quickly.
In the current spell of wild weather, companies are doing what they can to keep their operations running.
Canadian National Railway Co. said it is running shorter trains and taking detours in regions where the snow and below-normal temperatures are affecting switches and railroads. CN, which operates about 32,000 kilometres of rail in Canada and the United States and serves ports on Canada's East and West Coasts, has installed heaters and blowers at some switches to ensure trains can safely move from one track to another.
"The cold snap is affecting shipments from Edmonton to Northern Ontario, and the railway has implemented a winter operating plan," said CN spokesman Mark Hallman.
Canada's truckers absorb a double-whammy when the temperature drops. Not only does fuel consumption increase when the thermometer plunges, the price of diesel also usually climbs because of higher demand for heating oil, said David Bradley, president of the Canadian Trucking Alliance. At the same time, many truckers pay to have their rigs cleared of snow and ice, and if they end up in the ditch, the towing is expensive, Mr. Bradley said.
Janine Chapman, vice-president of marketing at Sunwing Travel Group, said the charter vacation operator sees an immediate spike in website traffic as soon as the weather becomes bitterly cold. There is the same effect after several consecutive days without sunshine.
However, the nasty weather also makes it much harder to operate the airline. The company doesn't cancel flights, because there are always customers at the sunny destinations who have to return to Canada. But there can be long weather delays, and that creates "an unfortunate domino effect which may last beyond the day of the storm," Ms. Chapman said. It also means high costs for overnight accommodation for travellers, meal vouchers, and extra crew costs, she said.

Ontario braces for extreme cold as the West warms up

Full text: Parts of Ontario expected to be blanketed in snow, while Calgary temperatures, in particular, predicted to soar this week
As bone-chilling Arctic winds descend on Ontario and plunge Toronto into a deep freeze, warm Arizona breezes are wafting into Alberta, where the mercury is set to crack double-digits by the middle of the week.
The stark contrast between Central Canada and the Prairies is just the latest in a pattern of strange winter weather, in which temperatures have veered up and down, Christmas looked more like Easter and snow has sometimes been replaced by rain.
"It's almost as if nature can't decide what to give us," Environment Canada climatologist David Phillips said. "There's a yo-yo back and forth."
Temperatures in Montreal plunged to -14 Monday night and were set to stay at that level Tuesday, when Torontonians woke up to a freezing city, with a wind chill that made it feel as cold as -26.
An extreme cold weather alert is in effect in that city, where outreach workers are patrolling the streets and encouraging homeless people to seek refuge. Shelters have added space for an extra 172 people, and the city is offering free transit tokens to help get people to them.
To the north and west, the cold air caused the Great Lakes to produce snow and whipped up flurries in London and Barrie Monday.
While it was an inconvenience for some, the white powder was a blessing for winter sports enthusiasts. By late afternoon, the ski hill at Blue Mountain, 130 kilometres from Toronto, reported a base snow pack of 50 centimetres, a jump of 10 to 20 from last week.
Residents of the Prairies, however, won't have much need for snow to enjoy some outdoor recreation this week, as temperatures are set to climb above 5 degrees across the region. If Winnipeg reaches 6 degrees Thursday, as it is currently forecast, the city will be 18 degrees above its usual January temperature. Calgary, meanwhile, may even see a high of 13 on Wednesday.
The West Coast will be similarly mild, with Vancouver set for several days of high single digits during the daytime. The forecast for the East is somewhat less pleasant, with the mercury dancing around the freezing mark and a mix of rain and snow forecast throughout the week in Halifax.
But Ontarians and Quebeckers can take solace in one thing: The fickle weather means their brethren in the rest of the country won't be razzing them for long. In Montreal, for instance, the temperature is expected to make a 13-point climb to hit 2 degrees on Saturday.
That day, Winnipeg will be down to -17.

The stark contrast between Central Canada and the Prairies is just the latest in a pattern of strange winter weather, in which temperatures have veered up and down, Christmas looked more like Easter and snow has sometimes been replaced by rain.
"It's almost as if nature can't decide what to give us," Environment Canada climatologist David Phillips said. "There's a yo-yo back and forth."
Temperatures in Montreal plunged to -14 Monday night and were set to stay at that level Tuesday, when Torontonians woke up to a freezing city, with a wind chill that made it feel as cold as -26.
An extreme cold weather alert is in effect in that city, where outreach workers are patrolling the streets and encouraging homeless people to seek refuge. Shelters have added space for an extra 172 people, and the city is offering free transit tokens to help get people to them.
To the north and west, the cold air caused the Great Lakes to produce snow and whipped up flurries in London and Barrie Monday.
While it was an inconvenience for some, the white powder was a blessing for winter sports enthusiasts. By late afternoon, the ski hill at Blue Mountain, 130 kilometres from Toronto, reported a base snow pack of 50 centimetres, a jump of 10 to 20 from last week.
Residents of the Prairies, however, won't have much need for snow to enjoy some outdoor recreation this week, as temperatures are set to climb above 5 degrees across the region. If Winnipeg reaches 6 degrees Thursday, as it is currently forecast, the city will be 18 degrees above its usual January temperature. Calgary, meanwhile, may even see a high of 13 on Wednesday.
The West Coast will be similarly mild, with Vancouver set for several days of high single digits during the daytime. The forecast for the East is somewhat less pleasant, with the mercury dancing around the freezing mark and a mix of rain and snow forecast throughout the week in Halifax.
But Ontarians and Quebeckers can take solace in one thing: The fickle weather means their brethren in the rest of the country won't be razzing them for long. In Montreal, for instance, the temperature is expected to make a 13-point climb to hit 2 degrees on Saturday.
That day, Winnipeg will be down to -17.

Full text: In Sherbrooke, Quebec, police urged people not to leave their homes
? Snowmobiles were deployed to help heart-attack victims, people skied down sidewalks and cars slipped and slid as a monster storm walloped Quebec and New Brunswick on Monday.
Up to 70 centimetres was expected in pockets of the region and there were multiple road closures as snowfall greatly exceeded forecasts.
New Brunswick Hydro reported 3,000 customers were without electricity Monday afternoon in Fredericton and Bouctouche, after freezing rain also fell on that province.
In southeastern Quebec, snowmobiles were being pressed into service to help ambulances reach patients.
The police in Sherbrooke, Que., about 120 kilometres southeast of Montreal, used their snowmobiles to aid the ambulance crews by creating a path for the emergency vehicles.
In two cases Monday morning, the snowmobiles helped ambulance attendants reach two heart-attack victims who were stricken while shovelling the heavy snow.
Martin Carrier, a Sherbrooke police spokesman, said the victims were a man and a woman in their 50s.
"I've been told they're stable," Mr. Carrier said later Thursday. "There's no danger to their lives."
Police and firefighters were also deployed to help three doctors to get to the hospital, one of them a surgeon who had to perform urgent surgery.
The storm had other effects on medical services in the city, which is the largest in the Eastern Townships. The Sherbrooke university hospital centre, the area's biggest hospital, rescheduled appointments and elective surgery.
Police took the exceptional step of urging residents not to leave their houses.
"Visibility is nearly zero and there's a lot of accumulation in the streets," said Mr. Carrier at the storm's peak.
"The Sherbrooke police service is asking people to avoid travelling on the road and to stay at home."
The city put its emergency measures plan into effect in the wee hours as it became clear the weather situation was deteriorating and travel along city streets became virtually impossible.
A command post was set up to monitor snow-clearing and co-ordinate emergency response. The city's bus service was shut down. Schools and university classes in the area were cancelled.
Police urged people to only use the 911 emergency line for only the most urgent situations. The system had been flooded with calls as the storm intensified.
In several cases, cars sat in their parking spaces buried under a mountain of snow with only hints of metal peeking through the powder.
People found unique means to make their way around the city, as the air filled with the roar of snowblowers and passing plows shoved mountains of the powdery white stuff in front of them.
Snowmobiles zipped along streets as pedestrians put on snowshoes and cross-country skis to make their way around town. Some of the more adventurous even flew down hilly streets on snowboards.
Cars crawled and sometimes slipped and slid off the road, resulting in a few crunched fenders.
Elsewhere around Quebec, the provincial transport department closed some highways due to poor visibility.
Montreal got around 20 centimetres, with gusting winds. An army of snow removal equipment hit the streets in Montreal in the early-morning hours and city officials said operations were going well.
Andre Cantin, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the wintery blast was "quite a big storm."
"A very significant amount of precipitation fell over the Eastern Townships and just south of Montreal - in fact over the south shore all the way to Rimouski and even Gaspe," he said.
"All those regions, they got between 40 to 60 and even 70 centimetres of snow."
Mr. Cantin said the storm was not unusual for this time of year, although the amount of snow may be a record for some areas.
"The month of March is generally where we get our worst snowstorms because the air gets warmer, there's more humidity in the air, more humidity available to form precipitation."
Snowfall was greater for some areas than predicted because a weather system moved slightly from the path it was being tracked on.
Monday's storm followed the 40th anniversary of a blizzard that dumped close to 50 centimetres of snow on Montreal on March 4, 1971. That storm was blamed for 30 deaths in Quebec, 17 of them in Montreal.
Mr. Cantin said forecasters expected better weather in the coming days.
"I don't think winter is over yet but we'll get relief."

? Montreal: Julia Monkman
Julia Monkman, 27, of Montreal, also gardens at work - Santropol Roulant, a meals-on-wheels community group that cooks with vegetables grown in an urban garden on campus at McGill University.
How long have you been gardening?
It'll be the first summer that I'm actually planting in the ground - I got a new apartment with a backyard. But I've volunteered on farms and gardened with the Santropol, so roughly seven years.
What are you putting in the ground?
We're putting in a lot of tomatoes. I have seven different varieties. We have kale, chard, sage, basil, thyme and lavender, and we're going to do beans off the balcony. We're also planting the Montreal melon. There's a legend that it grows on the mountain in Montreal. It's a cantaloupe. It's in the same family as cucumbers so it's a really big leafy plant that takes over and only produces a couple of fruits.
How much of what you plant goes on the plate?
We'll see what happens this summer. It's hard to know. We have a farmer that we go to every week, but this is more for the experience of growing the food ourselves. It will be trial and error.
Given the weather, do you think this could prove to be one of the best planting seasons?
We've had a really warm spring in Montreal and the forecasts say it's going to be a hot summer. That's really great for tomatoes, which we chose because they're so productive compared to other things that farmers are expert at growing. Last summer was super rainy and the tomatoes couldn't handle it.
Calgary: Laurie Leier
Laurie Leier, 42, arts administrator in Calgary. This is the sixth season Ms. Leier and her husband, Greg Stein, will be tending to their 6- by 7.5-metre backyard garden plot, which enjoys all-day sun exposure and is cordoned off from the wild neighbourhood rabbits.
How long have you been gardening?
"In the beginning it was more, why not try it? It would be good to have our own veggies. It was definitely trial and error at first. You try to remember what your parents did when you were 10."
What are you putting in the ground?
Tomato plants were seeded indoors in pots in March, and outdoor planting began last week. This year, the couple will have 17 types of vegetables, seven herbs and five kinds of greens. Produce ranges from staples such as carrots and potatoes to spinach, arugula and unusual items such as kohlrabi. "It's relaxing, but it's also very rewarding. Determination and love: It's totally what we've thrown into this garden."
How much of your what you plant ends up on your plate?
Their garden supplies all of their vegetable needs from mid-July through the end of October, as well as the tables of their friends and neighbours. "We give away so much throughout the year." In addition to freezing and storage, they've added canning and pickling. "We're learning how to stretch it out. One of the coolest things is having a freezer full of your own food."
Given the weather, what are your expectations for this year's crop?
Gardening in Calgary can be tricky. The region is blessed with an boatload of sun, but snow is in the forecast again this holiday weekend.
Ms. Leier said her plants seem to "green-up" better when quenched by rain - plus, a liberal amount of rain makes it easier on the water bill and means less work for the gardener. She's optimistic this will be a good growing season. "I think it's going to be fine as far as the veggies go."
Toronto: Chris Wong
Chris Wong, 24, founder of Young Urban Farmers
How long have you been gardening?
Since I was a young child. That's how I got started, helping my parents set up and tend to a vegetable garden when I was young. I stopped doing it for a couple of years in high school and in my university studies, being away from home. But once I finished my studies and got back to the city, I started up my garden again.
What do you like about it?
I just love the thrill of harvesting, picking and eating your own fresh grown produce. The taste just can't compare with anything else.
What kind of things do you grow?
I've got a whole variety of stuff in my garden. I've got a cherry tree, sunchokes, I just put in some rhubarb. I'm growing tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, Swiss chard, beans and peas. I'm growing Mexican tomatillos this year. I'm starting broccoli and I'm starting an interesting variety of snowpea, it's a purple snowpea that turns back to a green colour when you cook it.
How big a yard do you have?
It's not a big area. One of the big misconceptions is that you need a big space to grow your own vegetables. Even if you have small containers or a small space, as long as you have enough sun you can grow lots of great and delicious produce.
What do you think the planting season's going to be like this year?
It's well under way for us already. I think the forecast for this summer is supposed to be hot and dry, so our plants should do really well this year. It might be a bit of a hit on our water bills because of how much we're going to water our gardens, but it's definitely worth it in terms of saving money at the grocery store.
Victoria: Mary Ann Bodenberg
Mary Ann Bodenberg is a community-garden activist in Victoria.
How long have you been gardening?
Throughout my whole life, my parents had a large garden. ... But New Jersey was really steamy, it put me off until I moved to Victoria. I started again with an allotment garden in 1996 and I've been gardening seriously ever since.
What are you putting in the ground?
I grow vegetables 12 months of the year here. [Already in: turnips, potatoes and bare-root strawberries, gourmet lettuce, tomatoes. This weekend, she hopes to plant beans and transplant leeks.]
How much of what you plant goes on the plate?
We eat everything I produce - we either eat it right away or freeze it. [She's dining this week on spinach quiche thanks to an early winter harvest. But she'd like to have more space.] I keep inching my flowers out and sneaking my vegetables and herbs in.
And given the weather (Victoria has had a cold, windy spring), do you think this could prove to be one of the best planting seasons?
If this is like last year, it's going to be slow coming. Everything was late last year. This year I'm trying to grow only Early Girl tomatoes. [But like a Canucks fan, she's eternally hopeful that this year will be better than last.]

Full text: ? Liberal leadership hopeful Michael Ignatieff pulled out ahead after the first ballot early Saturday morning, only a few hours after Joe Volpe endorsed second-place candidate Bob Rae Friday night, crossing the floor with his supporters in tow just as the final speech was complete.
Mr. Ignatieff had just finished his presentation when Mr. Volpe began his march and ended in an embrace with Mr. Rae on the convention floor surrounded by a crush of photographers and reporters.
The move was a prelude to a final night of arm-twisting as candidates dispatched organizers to Montreal's bars, hotels and hospitality suites to woo delegates still chewing on the last speeches before the final balloting Saturday.
Campaign sources said Friday night Mr. Volpe decided to endorse Mr. Rae because of his foreign policy, particularly on Afghanistan.
Mr. Volpe had criticized Mr. Ignatieff earlier in the campaign for his strong support of Canada's mission in the troubled country.
In his speech to delegates Friday night Mr. Rae said delivering on "the right" vision of Canada is going to take a lot of work but he is ready to do the job.
"The Liberal Party has succeeded because it has been able to find itself in the heartland of Canada and its values have always tried to reflect the values of Canadians," Mr. Rae said in the speech that he delivered without the aid of notes or a lectern.
He talked about a country where foreign policy is as critical as domestic policy, where poverty is eliminated and pollution is reduced.
Mr. Ignatieff painted a portrait of Canada as the world's leader in environmental sustainability and health care, a country where aboriginals live as equals with the majority population and young people have the biggest dreams and opportunities.
All that is needed for that dream to be true is political leadership - leadership only the Liberal Party can offer, Mr. Ignatieff told his party's convention.
"We are Liberals of a new generation in a new century [and]tonight we have a choice to make.
"Let us choose unity over division. Direction over drift. Courage over fear, and compassion over indifference."
Mr. Ignatieff was the last of the eight candidates to speak as the Liberal leadership hopefuls entered the crucial phase of their campaigns, trying to woo delegates with passionate pleas from the podium.
He asked his party's delegates to "give me the chance to lead you. A chance to inspire. A chance to serve you. I will make you proud. I will give you victory."
Mr. Volpe's endorsement of Mr. Rae was the first movement at the convention, where rumours swirled about which bottom-tier candidates would throw their support to which camp.
The word was out that Ignatieff-Brison stickers had been printed before Scott Brison delivered his convention speech. And that Ignatieff-Hall Findlay stickers had been printed before Martha Hall Findlay gave her speech - reports denied by both the Ignatieff and Hall Findlay camps.
There was consensus that Ms. Hall Findlay had met with all four of the leading contenders - Mr. Ignatieff, Mr. Rae, Gerard Kennedy and Stéphane Dion - and that rewards in return for her support had been discussed.
After Mr. Volpe joined Mr. Rae on the floor he predicted that he would be able to deliver his supporters to Mr. Rae, although only half of his delegates were at the convention.
"I'm obviously very pleased," said Mr. Rae, noting that was also happy to win the backing of some of Mr. Volpe's supporters in caucus such as Massimo Pacetti and Wajid Khan.
"He's going to bring the party together," said Mr. Volpe, adding that Mr. Rae has a vision for the country. "I've said all along that the country needs experience."
Earlier in the campaign, when Mr. Volpe was facing controversy over campaign donations, Mr. Rae seemed lukewarm when a reporter asked how he would react to a Volpe endorsement.
Mr. Rae dismissed the question as hypothetical at that time.
Mr. Volpe's support could bring some delegates to the Rae camp, but it is not clear whether the endorsement could also saddle Mr. Rae with some of Mr. Volpe's political baggage.
Mr. Volpe's campaign suffered a scandal in the spring, when his campaign accepted 20 donations of $5,400 each from five current and former executives of drug-maker Apotex Inc., and their family members - including two donations from 11-year-olds. Mr. Volpe said he would return the donations to those donors.
The speeches started nearly an hour behind schedule following a day of technical challenges and travel difficulties brought about by weather woes. But once the speeches were under way, the packed Palais des congrès was filled with the cheers of raucous supporters.
Mr. Kennedy, who was the third last candidate to speak, said the Liberal Party can win the next federal election only if it concentrates on policies that improve the lives of ordinary Canadians.
Evoking the memory of Pierre Trudeau, underscored by an introduction by the late prime minister's son, Justin, Mr. Kennedy did not wait long before raising his opposition to the motion recognizing the Québécois as a nation.
"This week, many Canadians were made to stop and think about our identity as a country. As Liberals, we've shared different points of view. But though it all, we've never questioned each other's love for our country or our belief in it," he said.
The former Ontario cabinet minister used his speech to cover a lot of bases. Much of it was delivered in French to counteract the criticism throughout the leadership campaign that his lack of fluency would handicap him in Quebec.
He used his status as an outsider to the federal scene to push for new accountability provisions for leaders and to pledge that he could unify the party after more than a decade of fractious rivalries.
Stéphane Dion, who is considered one of the four front-runners tore strips off the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois.
Mr. Dion promised, who spoke before Mr. Kennedy to deliver an electoral program that is strong on social justice, economic development and environmental progress, saying it will allow the Liberal Party to win back the hearts of Canadians.
Mr. Dion started his speech by attacking Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative government's decision to "blindly" commit the Canadian Forces' in Afghanistan until 2009.
"Canada has a prime minister who thinks that the United States is not only our ally, but also our model," Mr. Dion said, accusing Mr. Harper of "mirroring" U.S. President George W. Bush.
Mr. Dion also took aim at the Bloc Québécois, saying Quebeckers can fulfill their aspirations in a united Canada.
To win the leadership, Mr. Dion, who was in fourth place, needed to jump ahead of Mr. Kennedy on the second or third ballot. Mr. Dion's success is linked to his ability to convince delegates that he is more than a competent minister, and that he can actually be a leader with pan-Canadian appeal.
But his speech last night lacked the lustre many delegates felt he'd need to sway supporters and when it ran long, he was cut off by organizers who cued music.
As he arrived at the Palais des congres for his speech, Mr. Dion was accompanied by former minister and ambassador Allan Rock, who praised Mr. Dion's abilities as a politician.
Ken Dryden, who spoke before Mr. Dion, delivered a passionate speech full of hockey references that blasted the Conservatives for taking the country in a narrow and divisive direction.
The former Montreal Canadians goaltender portrayed Mr. Harper as a Prime Minister who is taking the country further right than previous Tory governments.
"Cutting isn't a vision," he said, in a speech typical of his emotional style, complete with a few fist poundings on the podium.
"We're a good country. We have a conscience. We don't like the poor being poor."
Though Mr. Dryden insists he still has a shot at winning, his support is highly coveted by the four front runners. The entire convention gave him a standing ovation, and fourth place candidate Mr. Dion started another midway through Mr. Dryden's speech.
Mr. Dryden has not offered any hints as to who he might support should he not win, and some of his delegates think he might even stay neutral.
Candidate Scott Brison, who spoke before Mr. Dryden, said the Liberal Party should make the fight against global warming its foremost mission in the 21st century.
Mr. Brison said he was committed to making Canada a world leader in clean energy.
"Governments need to go green, and that means buying green, and building green," he said.
Mr. Brison, 39, is the youngest of the eight contenders in the race to replace Paul Martin. A former investment banker who started his first business renting mini-fridges at university, he also served as a senior minister in the Martin government.
In 2003, Mr. Brison ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party. He crossed the floor to the Liberals after he came in last.
Yesterday, he criticized Mr. Harper's Conservatives for abandoning the Kyoto objectives on greenhouse gas reduction and said he supported a tax on carbon emissions, which could subsidize research.
Martha Hall Findlay the bottom-ranking Liberal leadership candidate played up her status as the only woman in the race, hoping to gather support from ex-officio delegates.
"We will be the political movement of the 21st century by being truly inclusive," she said. "Trust me, as a woman standing here before you, I know. We are not yet inclusive enough."
During her 20-minute speech to delegates, Ms. Hall Findlay also reaffirmed her support for a one-tier health-care system and spoke against the motion to recognize "the Québécois" as a nation.
The 47-year-old Toronto telecommunications lawyer garnered the least number of delegates of all eight leadership candidates. She is fighting to keep her leadership bid alive past the first ballot, in which delegates are bound to vote along their declared allegiance lines.
Mr. Volpe, who along with Mr. Dion is one of only two long time Liberal MPs in the race, was the third speaker of the evening: His address played heavily to his Italian immigrant heritage.
First-ballot voting at the Liberal leadership convention was delayed for more than hour Friday because of technical problems accrediting alternates for voting delegates, some of whom were battling freezing rain and sleet to get to Montreal.

Full text: ? Liberal leadership hopeful Michael Ignatieff pulled out ahead after the first ballot early Saturday morning, only a few hours after Joe Volpe endorsed second-place candidate Bob Rae Friday night, crossing the floor with his supporters in tow just as the final speech was complete.
Mr. Ignatieff had just finished his presentation when Mr. Volpe began his march and ended in an embrace with Mr. Rae on the convention floor surrounded by a crush of photographers and reporters.
The move was a prelude to a final night of arm-twisting as candidates dispatched organizers to Montreal's bars, hotels and hospitality suites to woo delegates still chewing on the last speeches before the final balloting Saturday.
Campaign sources said Friday night Mr. Volpe decided to endorse Mr. Rae because of his foreign policy, particularly on Afghanistan.
Mr. Volpe had criticized Mr. Ignatieff earlier in the campaign for his strong support of Canada's mission in the troubled country.
In his speech to delegates Friday night Mr. Rae said delivering on "the right" vision of Canada is going to take a lot of work but he is ready to do the job.
"The Liberal Party has succeeded because it has been able to find itself in the heartland of Canada and its values have always tried to reflect the values of Canadians," Mr. Rae said in the speech that he delivered without the aid of notes or a lectern.
He talked about a country where foreign policy is as critical as domestic policy, where poverty is eliminated and pollution is reduced.
Mr. Ignatieff painted a portrait of Canada as the world's leader in environmental sustainability and health care, a country where aboriginals live as equals with the majority population and young people have the biggest dreams and opportunities.
All that is needed for that dream to be true is political leadership - leadership only the Liberal Party can offer, Mr. Ignatieff told his party's convention.
"We are Liberals of a new generation in a new century [and]tonight we have a choice to make.
"Let us choose unity over division. Direction over drift. Courage over fear, and compassion over indifference."
Mr. Ignatieff was the last of the eight candidates to speak as the Liberal leadership hopefuls entered the crucial phase of their campaigns, trying to woo delegates with passionate pleas from the podium.
He asked his party's delegates to "give me the chance to lead you. A chance to inspire. A chance to serve you. I will make you proud. I will give you victory."
Mr. Volpe's endorsement of Mr. Rae was the first movement at the convention, where rumours swirled about which bottom-tier candidates would throw their support to which camp.
The word was out that Ignatieff-Brison stickers had been printed before Scott Brison delivered his convention speech. And that Ignatieff-Hall Findlay stickers had been printed before Martha Hall Findlay gave her speech - reports denied by both the Ignatieff and Hall Findlay camps.
There was consensus that Ms. Hall Findlay had met with all four of the leading contenders - Mr. Ignatieff, Mr. Rae, Gerard Kennedy and Stéphane Dion - and that rewards in return for her support had been discussed.
After Mr. Volpe joined Mr. Rae on the floor he predicted that he would be able to deliver his supporters to Mr. Rae, although only half of his delegates were at the convention.
"I'm obviously very pleased," said Mr. Rae, noting that was also happy to win the backing of some of Mr. Volpe's supporters in caucus such as Massimo Pacetti and Wajid Khan.
"He's going to bring the party together," said Mr. Volpe, adding that Mr. Rae has a vision for the country. "I've said all along that the country needs experience."
Earlier in the campaign, when Mr. Volpe was facing controversy over campaign donations, Mr. Rae seemed lukewarm when a reporter asked how he would react to a Volpe endorsement.
Mr. Rae dismissed the question as hypothetical at that time.
Mr. Volpe's support could bring some delegates to the Rae camp, but it is not clear whether the endorsement could also saddle Mr. Rae with some of Mr. Volpe's political baggage.
Mr. Volpe's campaign suffered a scandal in the spring, when his campaign accepted 20 donations of $5,400 each from five current and former executives of drug-maker Apotex Inc., and their family members - including two donations from 11-year-olds. Mr. Volpe said he would return the donations to those donors.
The speeches started nearly an hour behind schedule following a day of technical challenges and travel difficulties brought about by weather woes. But once the speeches were under way, the packed Palais des congrès was filled with the cheers of raucous supporters.
Mr. Kennedy, who was the third last candidate to speak, said the Liberal Party can win the next federal election only if it concentrates on policies that improve the lives of ordinary Canadians.
Evoking the memory of Pierre Trudeau, underscored by an introduction by the late prime minister's son, Justin, Mr. Kennedy did not wait long before raising his opposition to the motion recognizing the Québécois as a nation.
"This week, many Canadians were made to stop and think about our identity as a country. As Liberals, we've shared different points of view. But though it all, we've never questioned each other's love for our country or our belief in it," he said.
The former Ontario cabinet minister used his speech to cover a lot of bases. Much of it was delivered in French to counteract the criticism throughout the leadership campaign that his lack of fluency would handicap him in Quebec.
He used his status as an outsider to the federal scene to push for new accountability provisions for leaders and to pledge that he could unify the party after more than a decade of fractious rivalries.
Stéphane Dion, who is considered one of the four front-runners tore strips off the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois.
Mr. Dion promised, who spoke before Mr. Kennedy to deliver an electoral program that is strong on social justice, economic development and environmental progress, saying it will allow the Liberal Party to win back the hearts of Canadians.

Liberal leadership race wide open

Full text: Ignatieff wins first ballot; Stéphane Dion makes surprise move to third place
? Front-runner Michael Ignatieff won on the first ballot but fell short of the crucial 30-per-cent mark and Stéphane Dion squeaked past Gerard Kennedy for third place in first-round voting for the Liberal leadership.
The results will likely only amplify the sentiment that Mr. Ignatieff has little room for growth: his support on the first tally stayed flat, when front-runners normally win stronger backing from party officials. His tally didn't stray much from the level he achieved after the selection of elected delegates two months ago.
Bob Rae remained in second with 20.3 per cent, also identical to his expected support going in.
Perhaps the biggest surprise after the first ballot was that fourth-place Mr. Dion had jumped over Mr. Kennedy to take third place, by the tightest of margins. Mr. Dion won 856 delegates of the 4,815 delegates who voted, or 17.8 per cent - just two votes ahead of Mr. Kennedy.
Ken Dryden finished fifth, and as expected, far below the top four contenders, with 238 delegates, or 4.9 per cent. Scott Brison won 192 delegates, or 4 per cent.
Martha Hall Findlay was last, with 130 delegates, or 2.7 per cent - and so will fall off the ballot before the second round of voting Saturday.
That means six contenders, at most, will contest the second ballot. But there was wide spread speculation after midnight that Mr. Brison would also pull out.
The night was still a good for Mr. Rae, who won the first endorsement from a withdrawing candidate when Toronto MP Joe Volpe pulled out just after the first round of voting finished. Mr. Volpe won 156 votes, or 3.2 per cent of the delegates for the first ballot.
That gives him a whiff of momentum - although it was not clear how much, as Mr. Volpe's campaign manager, Nick Discepola, immediately went to Mr. Ignatieff.
But it was also a good night for Mr. Rae because all of his opponents all had something go wrong.
Mr. Ignatieff only just managed to hold together his existing level of support - and even his own campaign advisers had been predicting he would tally two or three percentage points higher. There have long been doubts about whether Mr. Ignatieff can gain support from other camps when the balloting continues Saturday.
In the crucial race for third, Mr. Dion surprised by passing Mr. Kennedy so quickly - but it ended as a night of mixed blessings.
Mr. Dion's speech, viewed as a crucial test of political charisma he is thought to be lacking, was not rated by delegates as the crowd-rouser he needed to push him to a win. And Mr. Kennedy, now already dropping down the ballot, is likely to be seen as lacking the momentum he needs to build to victory.
Earlier, the candidates delivered their crucial final speeches that will weigh heavily on delegates who enter final balloting today. And then organizers for the campaigns scattered for a long night of courting delegates in Montreal's bars and hotels.
Mr. Ignatieff had just finished his presentation when Mr. Volpe began his march and ended in an embrace with Mr. Rae on the convention floor surrounded by a crush of photographers and reporters.
Mr. Volpe's aides said Friday night he decided to endorse Mr. Rae because of his foreign policy, particularly on Afghanistan. Mr. Volpe has long nursed bitterness for Mr. Ignatieff, which started in the spring when the front-runner commented that Mr. Volpe's fundraising scandals had hurt the party's reputation.
Mr. Rae's speech stood out for its style: he eschewed the podium and teleprompters, and strode the stage holding the microphone.
"The Liberal Party has succeeded because it has been able to find itself in the heartland of Canada and its values have always tried to reflect the values of Canadians," Mr. Rae said.
He stressed that foreign policy is as critical as domestic policy, and lauded former prime minister Jean Chrétien for keeping Canadian troops out of the U.S. invasion of Iraq - which his rival, Mr. Ignatieff, supported as a Harvard academic.
Mr. Ignatieff focused his speech on party unity and portrayed himself as a strong leader, with convictions and a bold style.
He painted a portrait of Canada as the world's leader in environmental sustainability and health care, a country where aboriginals live as equals with the majority population and young people have the biggest dreams and opportunities.
"We are Liberals of a new generation in a new century [and]tonight we have a choice to make," he said.
"Let us choose unity over division. Direction over drift. Courage over fear, and compassion over indifference."
He asked his party's delegates to "give me the chance to lead you. A chance to inspire. A chance to serve you. I will make you proud. I will give you victory."
Mr. Volpe's endorsement of Mr. Rae was the first movement at the convention, where rumours swirled about which bottom-tier candidates would throw their support to which camp.
Ms. Hall Findlay had met with all four of the leading contenders - Mr. Ignatieff, Mr. Rae, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Dion - and all four offered to help her find a safe Toronto riding in which to launch a bid for Parliament.
After Mr. Volpe joined Mr. Rae on the floor he predicted that he would be able to deliver his supporters to Mr. Rae.
"I'm obviously very pleased," said Mr. Rae, noting that was also happy to win the backing of some of Mr. Volpe's supporters in caucus such as Massimo Pacetti and Wajid Khan.

Technical troubles delay Liberal voting

Full text: ? First-ballot voting at the Liberal leadership convention was delayed for more than hour Friday because of technical problems accrediting alternates for voting delegates, some of whom were battling freezing rain and sleet to get to Montreal.
The vote was to begin at 3 p.m. local time in what is considered one of the most wide-open Liberal conventions in a generation.
But the processing of "bumping up" alternates to fill vacancies of elected delegates who did not make it here did not go as smoothly as party officials had hoped.
Officials expected that the delay would not be too long, but hundreds of delegates waited outside the doors to the polling stations Friday afternoon to be among the first to vote.
First-ballot voting was to continue until about 10 p.m., an hour after the last candidate's speech. Second and subsequent ballots are to be held.
The problems started in the morning when delegates rushed to register at the convention before the 9 a.m. deadline. Anyone who is not registered could not vote in the afternoon.
Adriana Galloro, a supporter of Stéphane Dion, was the last delegate to squeeze through the doors of the registration room before the doors were shut in the morning.
John Lyras, a Gerard Kennedy supporter who was on the same delayed Air Canada flight as Ms. Galloro, didn't make it. Sweating and winded, he raced up the escalator to the registration room to see the doors shut before him.
Liberal officials later relented and extended registration by a few minutes to accommodate Mr. Lyras and the handful of other late arrivals who were on the same flight from Toronto but not as fleet of foot as Ms. Galloro.
The intensity of that final foot highlights just how wide-open this convention is.
The Kennedy-Dion competition for votes is particularly intense. They are neck-neck, believed to be almost tied for third position on the first ballot later Friday. The third-place spot is generally considered an ideal slot if the two front-runners, Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae, deadlock or stumble.
Mr. Dion bagged the support of former minister and ambassador Allan Rock.
Officials in the Dion camp said that Mr. Rock, who long harboured leadership aspirations of his own, is announcing Friday that he is supporting his former cabinet colleague.
The endorsement is expected to provide a boost to the candidacy of Mr. Dion, who has yet to convince all Liberal delegates that he has all the leadership abilities of a prime minister.
Mr. Rock is Canada's former ambassador to the United Nations, and a former minister of health and industry in the Chrétien government. He is back to his law practice.
The weather shouldn't be the deciding factor in the leadership contest, Mr. Lyras said.
Ms. Galloro, a teacher from Richmond Hill, Ont., said the dash to get here was a nightmare.
"We found out about one o'clock this morning our flight was cancelled because of the weather. We finally got going about 7 o'clock" from the Toronto airport.
Morning rush hour traffic added to the tension as her cab driver battled icy highways from the Montreal Trudeau Airport to the convention centre."
"But I made it. This is going to be an exciting weekend," she said.
But after registration she planned to check into her hotel and catch a few hours of sleep.
About 4,000 delegates are expected to attend the wide-open convention. There are eight candidates.

Full text: It's the kind of headache any National Hockey League goaltending coach would love to have.
Montreal Canadiens head coach Guy Carbonneau has said he wants to work goalies David Aebischer and Cristobal Huet in rotation. The idea is the make sure neither one goes cold from idleness. What he's wound up with is a case of hot and hotter, as the two netminders engaged in one-upmanship this week.
Aebischer had an admirable and acrobatic 47-save performance in a shootout loss against the Toronto Maple Leafs last Saturday, then came back undaunted for a 31-save win against the Ottawa Senators Tuesday. But Carbonneau, rather than anointing a No.1 goalie, decided to star Huet Thursday night against the Carolina Hurricanes on the road. Huet merely responded with his 12th shutout performance in the NHL, 4-0, and his eighth shutout in only 42 games with the Canadiens.
At the end of October, Carbonneau said he'd eventually go with a system of a No. 1 goalie and backup, but this week's events haven't done anything to settle the issue. Carbonneau said he talks every day with goalie coach Roland Melanson about how his keepers are performing and practicing. Neither is willing to give ground. They've both been showing up on the ice a half hour before practice to do extra work. Aebischer has marginally better statistics, with a 4-1 record and .924 saves percentage and 2.60 goals against average. Huet now has a record of 3-1-2 this season with a 2.45 goals against average and saves percentage of .917.
Don't suggest to Carbonneau that there are too many Europeans in the NHL. Aebischer, 28, was born in Fribourg, Switzerland. He won a world junior bronze for the Swiss in 1998 and backed up Patrick Roy in Colorado's 2001 Stanley Cup season. Huet, 31, was born in Saint-Martin-d'Heres, France and has played in two Olympics for the French before being Jose Theodore's understudy in Montreal.
Though Huet may come to be known as the best French hockey player in history, his heart is in backstopping the Canadiens.
"I can't forget what Cristobal did last season against Carolina," Carbonneau said of Huet's playoff work. "That's one of the reasons we're keeping to our [rotation]schedule."
What he did in Raleigh this week was to shut down the team that bounced Montreal from the Stanley Cup playoffs last season. The Habs were up 2-0 in the series when captain Saku Koivu suffered a sight-threatening eye injury. The steam went out of the Canadiens and the Panthers went on to win the Stanley Cup. Huet wanted to heal that wound. He's always played well against the Hurricanes, both as a Los Angeles King and as a Canadiens. In four regular season games against the 'Canes, he has a 1.56 goals against average.
"It's a good standard to start the year - if we can beat them, it'll let them know that it's not going to be like last year, maybe," Huet said. "But there is no revenge or anything like that. We're just happy to beat a very good team."
The Montreal media will be sure to stoke the goaltending situation as a rivalry. So far, the only fluid spilled is ink, unlike happened in a Florida's goalie rivalry in which Florida's Eddie Belfour reportedly wrestled with Alex Auld and the latter wound up with a gash over his eye.
"We have a good competition and I think the guys are OK with it," said Carbonneau. "They're both competitive guys and they want to play and they'll push each other. Cristobal was strong from the start [against Carolina] He was square to the puck and he didn't give rebounds. That's his game."
Huet's NHL game dates back to 2001 when he was drafted by the Kings in the 7th round. He played 41 games for the Kings in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. He was traded to the Canadiens in a three-team deal that sent Mathieu Garon to Los Angeles and Radek Bonk from the Ottawa Senators to Montreal. During the lockout, Huet played for Adler Mannhein in the German pro league. He took the team to the finals, but lost four straight games to Eisbären Berlin.
In the 2005-06 season, Huet made his name well known by playing phenomenally, earning seven shutouts, good enough for second in the league even though he played less than half than the number of games leader Miikka Kiprusoff played. His 2.20 goals against average(GAA) was the league's fourth best. Huet won the Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award, the trophy given to the goaltender with the best save percentage, finishing at .929.
His big opportunity came last February. After freezing rain coated Montreal during the 2005-2006 Olympic break, Jose Theodore fell down his outdoor stairs and broke his foot, giving Huet the starting role for the next eight weeks. Theodore's heel took that long to recover, but he never recovered his starting job.

Montreal 'quintessential' Canadian weather city

Full text: Ever wonder which Canadian city has the most thunderstorms? It's Windsor, Ont.
What about the windiest? That dubious honour goes to St. John's, Newfoundland.
For all those who love weather lore, Environment Canada released an analysis Monday of 30 years of weather data for Canada's 100 largest cities on a Weather Winners Web site.
The results are somewhat surprising but are also hoped to be useful to governments and the tourism and recreation industries.
"The study analyzes 72 categories of weather and ranks Canada's cities according to their most notable weather features," Environment Canada meteorologist David Phillips said in a statement.
"Most communities have something they can either brag about or curse."
The analysis, conducted by Mr. Phillips, includes categories such as most high wind-chill days (Yellowknife), sunniest city (Medicine Hat, Alta.) and the snowiest city (Gander, Nfld.).
Overall, people living in St. John's and Gander are the hardiest, according to the Statistics Canada data. The two cities are tied for the toughest weather in Canada. The communities were ranked on 13 categories of tough weather, including amounts of fog, snow, winds or freezing rain.
Residents of Victoria and Nanaimo, B.C., meanwhile, are living in two of the most pleasant weather cities, with both rating highest in the "most comfortable climate" category.
They were found to have the best combination of 23 categories of "comfortable" weather, including mild winters, lots of sunshine, little fog, low humidity and light winds.
Montreal has few extremes in temperature but definitely experiences a range of seasons, so it was rated Canada's "quintessential" weather city, followed by Fredericton and Kingston.
The top 100 cities were selected from 2001 Canadian census data, on the basis of population.
All cities in the data have a population of 15,000 or more people and an official weather station nearby where Environment Canada instruments are used and its observing procedures are followed.

See also: Snow doesn't stop tech workers Much of Ontario and Quebec was covered with a thick blanket of snow Tuesday, leading to problems for planes, trains and automobiles.
The severe snowstorm, which began in Windsor on Monday morning and gathered momentum as it moved eastward to Quebec, left a path of snow, freezing rain and ice pellets in its wake.
Most areas received at least 20 centimetres of snow, and as much as 66 centimetres is expected by the time the storm finishes Tuesday afternoon.
Homes and cars literally buried by snow in central Canada stood in stark contrast to the conditions in the Maritimes where temperatures hit as high as 13 C, said meteorologist Peter Lewis, at the Martimes Weather Centre, in Dartmouth, N.S.
The snow wreaked havoc at airports. Air Canada announced early Tuesday morning that it was cancelling or delaying more than half of its morning flights in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.
Tuesday afternoon, Air Canada said operations were starting to return to normal in Toronto's Pearson International Airport. By the end of the day, the airline said, customers will be put on alternate flights.
On Monday night, 70 per cent of the flights out of Pearson International Airport were cancelled.
But blowing snow and high winds have resulted in the cancellation or delay of Tuesday night flights in Ottawa and Montreal.
In Quebec, about 30 flights in and out of Montreal's Dorval Airport were cancelled as the storm began to hammer the southwestern region of the province. Thousands of schoolchildren got the day off school.
Flights are regularly cancelled in anticipation of bad weather to ensure passenger safety, said Laura Cooke, spokeswoman for Air Canada.
Schools were closed in towns and cities across Ontario and in parts of Quebec, as buses were unable to navigate treacherous roadways.
Children were seen playing in the snow throughout the day as hundreds of schools were closed in towns and cities across Ontario and in parts of Quebec. It was feared buses could not navigate treacherous roadways.
The first day of work was delayed for some of Canada's 48 rookie MPs who faced knee-high snowdrifts when they arrived at Parliament Hill for the first orientation session since the Nov. 27 election.
Those who managed to trudge through the snow arrived with their hair caked in the stuff.
"Some of them didn't come prepared," said Cheryl Gallant, MP for Renfrew-Nipissing.
While Ontario's major highways were mainly clear Tuesday morning, a number of tractor-trailers jack-knifed on entrance ramps, blocking access in spots. Police say a number of cars and trucks had also slid into guardrails and ditches.
Morning rush hour went smoothly in downtown Toronto despite the blowing snow and clogged sidestreets, said Sgt. Robb Knapper.
"People have either taken public transit or stayed home entirely. North of us, it's a mess."
In Toronto, Tuesday's snow cleanup is the first big test of the city's improved snow-clearing capacity, given a boost after several major storms in January, 1999, paralyzed Toronto and prompted Mayor Mel Lastman to call in the army.
The city has 1,177 pieces of snow-clearing equipment for the coming winter season, up 160 from last year. Toronto's snow-clearing budget for 2001 is projected to come in at $55-million, up $10-million from this year and up $21-million from 1999.
GO transit was reporting delays after some routes were closed, and as the trains dealt with commuter backlog.
At Toronto's Eaton Centre shopping mall patrons were scrambling for winter clothing such as boots and gloves.
"Some people weren't prepared for the weather. It's definitely busier than usual for this time of the week," said Matt Kaiser, assistant manager at the Stoneridge shoe store.
Students were using the school closures to squeeze in some holiday gift shopping.
"We really don't have time otherwise so this was great," said 15-year-old Emma Bongers, whose school was closed Tuesday. "I'm sure we're not the only ones," said Emma's friend Laura Vickery, also 15.
Midwestern Ontario, along the Lake Huron shore, was one of the hardest-hit areas, where heavy winds created metre-high snowdrifts. All schools were closed.
Sgt. David Rektor said roads were closed for most of the day, with roads littered with as many as 100 abandoned vehicles.
In Orillia, Ont., a report of 66 centimetres of snow could make the storm's record snowfall for the province, said Ron Miller, a weather expert from Environment Canada.
The storm began as a jet stream hit a cold front sitting over Colorado Monday. The jet stream created a low-pressure area, where Colorado's cold air clashed with warmer air sucked in from Texas and Oklahoma.
Fuelled by powerful winds, the whole weather system headed northeast toward the Great Lakes and grew in intensity.
