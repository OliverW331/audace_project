Full text: In 2016, the end of December was dominated by "Worst Year Ever" memes.
It was a year of terror attacks, police shootings, Zika and Brexit. The year Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen died, the year Donald Trump was elected and "dumpster fire" became the phrase on everybody's lips. Then, the following year, a call for revision: 2017 was the worst. But those years and the two that followed were mere middling warm-ups for 2020, which feels less like a dumpster fire and more like a tire fire - or the Centralia mine blaze, a coal seam fire that turned a Pennsylvania city into a ghost town and that isn't expected to finish burning for another 250 years.
We can't afford to put 2020 behind us. The lessons have been too painful, and the COVID-19 infection numbers too dire. Here in Quebec, they are the worst they have ever been. With two approved coronavirus vaccines, it might feel like the end is in sight, but things will almost certainly get worse before they get better.
If the holiday shutdown doesn't flatten the curve, many dread that schools and non-essential businesses will be closed beyond Jan. 11. Others, like myself, have the opposite fear: that the shutdown, coming too late, is too short to significantly reduce daily case numbers. But no matter when schools and businesses reopen in 2021, the Quebec government must mandate masking for all grade levels in schools and in offices, since - as absurd as it feels to be spelling this out in the final week of 2020 - sitting at a desk is no protection from an airborne virus. Huge masking exemptions at schools and workplaces facilitate rampant community transmission and are undermining the real sacrifices being made by millions of Quebecers.
By June, half of Canadians may well be vaccinated. By the end of the July, Osheaga could even happen and Montreal's summer of 2021, with its promise of safer outdoor gatherings, has the potential to be truly glorious. And in the fall, things might finally return to some semblance of normal - but only if we are not still traumatized by the tragedy of a worsening second wave.
One good thing we can count on for 2021: Inauguration Day in the United States, Jan. 20, when the Trump presidency's daily assault on civil norms and its relentless insinuation on the consciousness of Canadians will come to an end. I can't wait to reclaim the part of my brain that has been unwillingly preoccupied by the fear of an impromptu, tweet-instigated nuclear war.
Other 2021 aspirations: I hope more artists I like release lockdown albums. I hope we can keep up our new-found pandemic passions for birding, for gardening, for sourdough baking, for not catching communicable diseases. I hope that when cultural events are finally happening again in person, they remain available via Zoom for those who live elsewhere or who would prefer to attend virtually. It has been an amazing year for sharing Montreal literary readings and musical events with the rest of Canada, and a unique opportunity for all Canadians, rural and urban alike, to attend cultural events right across the country.
Likewise, I hope the adaptations we have made for online learning and working from home will continue to improve accessibility and offer flexibility for students and employees.
I hope that we continue to recognize the precious value of caregivers and educators and artists.
I especially hope that the movement for universal basic income, which gained traction throughout the pandemic, continues to grow momentum and soon becomes a reality in Canada.
But prognostication in this era can't afford to avoid the negative. We should look at what the finance world calls "grey swans," known unknowns that are highly probable yet still vaguely unpredictable - like, say, a pandemic-level virus - that have the potential for huge global impact. In 2021, we ought to prepare for more fallout from growing income inequality, for the possibility that the food crisis already underway might sharply worsen, and for further climate-change events such as devastating hurricanes and killer heat waves.
Will Trump, cast out of the White House, begin tweeting in 2021 to his MAGA crew about the reality of aliens? Very possibly. Will we be seeing more discombobulating commercials for banks or lingerie set to '60s political anthems, now that Bob Dylan has sold the rights to his songwriting catalogue? Almost a certainty. Will the hardships of this past year eventually lead to a bon vivant era of indulgence, a modern roaring '20s? I think the chances are excellent. Will the seeds of change planted in 2020 - for action on racial justice, decarbonization, an improved social safety net - start to yield real policy results in 2021? Only if we can hold onto their urgency.
Because there's one 2020 lesson we have learned perhaps more thoroughly than any other: we have no idea what's coming next.

Non-electric cars to be banned downtown by 2030; City's climate plan has 46 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

Full text: The city of Montreal will plant 500,000 trees, ban non-electric cars downtown, remove parking around mÃ©tro stations, adopt the most stringent regulations in Canada for greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, and impose a "climate test" on itself when it makes decisions, according to a 10-year climate plan unveiled by Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante on Thursday.
The Climate Plan 2020-2030 also calls for the city to develop incentives for the public to adopt environmentally responsible habits, such as by providing municipal funding to businesses that deliver goods with bikes since they produce zero greenhouse gas emissions.
"Even if the pandemic isn't over, it's important for us to present this plan today," Plante said at a news conference. "On the eve of having a vaccine (for COVID-19) ... there's a glimmer of hope there, there's light at the end of the tunnel, so it's the best time to recall a fight that's even bigger, more immense and more mammoth than the pandemic, which was a challenge, and it's climate change."
The plan lists 46 measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The ultimate goal, it says, is to render the city of Montreal's operations carbon neutral by 2040 and make the city as a whole carbon neutral by 2050.
However, the opposition at city hall called the plan "greenwashing" and a "communications stunt" since no budgets or deadlines are attached to measures.
"This climate plan, which unfortunately has no binding legal value, will not result in concrete measures," said city councillor Francesco Miele, Ensemble Montreal's spokesperson on environmental matters. "I'm left to wonder if Projet MontrÃ©al wanted really to shift from their usual greenwashing and inaction over the last three years."
The measures include:
Planting 500,000 trees over the next 10 years, with priority given to areas that are susceptible to heat waves. The city says that's over and above replacing diseased trees. - Encouraging "sustainable mobility" in neighbourhoods and future urban developments, such as the zero-carbon emission neighbourhood planned for the former Hippodrome site. - Increasing the proportion of electric vehicles, notably by converting all of the municipal fleet to electric. The plan also calls for a ban on non-electric vehicles in the greater downtown core by 2030. The city says it will consult businesses and residents before implementing the ban. Other cities have banned gasoline-powered cars in their downtown core. Paris, for example, uses a permit system to regulate vehicle access to its core. - Encouraging car sharing and reducing the number of single-passenger car trips by 25 per cent. - Eliminating outdoor parking around mÃ©tro stations to make way for greening projects and real-estate development. The ban would cover municipal parking spaces and private and institutional parking around businesses and schools.
Using municipal bylaws and subsidies to encourage owners to make their buildings energy efficient. - Improving the energy performance of large buildings through a rating system and by publicizing their energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. - Adapting all municipal buildings so they produce zero carbon emissions. - Integrating a climate test into city decision-making so that the GHG emission impact of a decision, and whether it helps achieve the city's climate goals, is taken into consideration. - Dedicating 10 to 15 per cent of the city's 10-year capital expenditure program to climate change adaptation. Plante pegged the value at $1 billion.
The plan also calls for the city to produce an annual report to track its progress on the different measures.
Environmental group Ãquiterre said it considers Montreal's climate plan innovative.
"There are a lot of interesting measures in the plan, but we are particularly pleased to see that a climate test will be imposed on all of the city's decisions," Marc-AndrÃ© Viau, the organization's director of government relations, said in a statement. "It sets a standard for all public administrations."
Ãquiterre also lauded the plan to turn downtown Montreal into Canada's first zero-emission zone and the commitment to spend 10 to 15 per cent of the 10-year capital works program on climate change adaptation.
However, the group ended with a note of caution, saying it's "concerned about Montreal's ability to meet its GHG reduction targets. Its plan for reductions up until 2030 is unclear and the roadmap to 2050 remains to be defined."
Ensemble Montreal's Miele said he doesn't consider even the specific measure of banning non-electric cars downtown by 2030, ahead of the Quebec government's target to ban the sale of new gasoline cars by 2035, to be credible. That's because the Projet MontrÃ©al administration has yet to provide dates for its existing environmental commitments, such as when it will start producing a carbon budget and when it will ban oil heating systems, he said.
Miele also pointed to an article in La Presse on Thursday revealing the city and the Quebec government had quietly agreed to allow contaminated industrial soil from Montreal's east end to be shipped to Ontario, where it can be landfilled, instead of decontaminating it in Quebec. Plante's office said the change emanated from Quebec.
The Plante administration is also behind on existing environmental projects, Miele said, noting that a new composting centre and biomethanation plant are again delayed.
As well, the Lachine recycling sorting centre, inaugurated a year ago, still doesn't have glass sorting equipment so the material is sent to landfill, he said.
"We're not against the objectives.
We just don't believe Projet MontrÃ©al's greenwashing anymore," Miele said, adding that failure to deliver on current promises makes it difficult "to believe them on what they're going to be planning for 2030." lgyulai@postmedia.com Twitter.com/CityHallReport

The plan also calls for the city to produce an annual report to track its progress on the different measures.
Environmental group Ãquiterre said it considers Montreal's climate plan innovative.
"There are a lot of interesting measures in the plan, but we are particularly pleased to see that a climate test will be imposed on all of the city's decisions," Marc-AndrÃ© Viau, the organization's director of government relations, said in a statement. "It sets a standard for all public administrations."
Ãquiterre also lauded the plan to turn downtown Montreal into Canada's first zero-emission zone and the commitment to spend 10 to 15 per cent of the 10-year capital works program on climate change adaptation.
However, the group ended with a note of caution, saying it's "concerned about Montreal's ability to meet its GHG reduction targets. Its plan for reductions up until 2030 is unclear and the roadmap to 2050 remains to be defined."
Ensemble Montreal's Miele said he doesn't consider even the specific measure of banning non-electric cars downtown by 2030, ahead of the Quebec government's target to ban the sale of new gasoline cars by 2035, to be credible. That's because the Projet MontrÃ©al administration has yet to provide dates for its existing environmental commitments, such as when it will start producing a carbon budget and when it will ban oil heating systems, he said.
Miele also pointed to an article in La Presse on Thursday revealing the city and the Quebec government had quietly agreed to allow contaminated industrial soil from Montreal's east end to be shipped to Ontario, where it can be landfilled, instead of decontaminating it in Quebec. Plante's office said the change emanated from Quebec.
The Plante administration is also behind on existing environmental projects, Miele said, noting that a new composting centre and biomethanation plant are again delayed. As well, the Lachine recycling sorting centre, inaugurated a year ago, still doesn't have glass sorting equipment so the material is sent to landfill, he said.
"We're not against the objectives. We just don't believe Projet MontrÃ©al's greenwashing anymore," Miele said, adding that failure to deliver on current promises makes it difficult "to believe them on what they're going to be planning for 2030."

Full text: The city of Montreal will plant 500,000 trees, ban non-electric cars downtown, remove parking around mÃ©tro stations, adopt the most stringent regulations in Canada for greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, and impose a "climate test" on itself when it makes decisions, according to a 10-year climate plan unveiled by Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante on Thursday.
The also calls for the city to develop incentives for the public to adopt environmentally responsible habits, such as by providing municipal funding to businesses that deliver goods with bikes since they produce zero greenhouse gas emissions.
"Even if the pandemic isn't over, it's important for us to present this plan today," Plante said at a news conference. "On the eve of having a vaccine (for COVID-19) ... there's a glimmer of hope there, there's light at the end of the tunnel, so it's the best time to recall a fight that's even bigger, more immense and more mammoth than the pandemic, which was a challenge, and it's climate change."
The plan lists 46 measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The ultimate goal, it says, is to render the city of Montreal's operations carbon neutral by 2040 and make the city as a whole carbon neutral by 2050.
However, the opposition at city hall called the plan "greenwashing" and a "communications stunt" since no budgets or deadlines are attached to measures.
"This climate plan, which unfortunately has no binding legal value, will not result in concrete measures," said city councillor Francesco Miele, Ensemble Montreal's spokesperson on environmental matters. "I'm left to wonder if Projet MontrÃ©al wanted really to shift from their usual greenwashing and inaction over the last three years."
The measures include:
- Planting 500,000 trees over the next 10 years, with priority given to areas that are susceptible to heat waves. The city says that's over and above replacing diseased trees;
- Encouraging "sustainable mobility" in neighbourhoods and future urban developments, such as the zero-carbon emission neighbourhood planned for the former Hippodrome site;
- Increasing the proportion of electric vehicles, notably by converting all of the municipal fleet to electric. The plan also calls for a ban on non-electric vehicles in the greater downtown core by 2030. The city says it will consult businesses and residents before implementing the ban. Other cities have banned gasoline-powered cars in their downtown core. Paris, for example, uses a permit system to regulate vehicle access to its core;
- Encouraging car-sharing and reducing the number of single-passenger car trips by 25 per cent;
- Eliminating outdoor parking around mÃ©tro stations to make way for greening projects and real-estate development. The ban would cover municipal parking spaces and private and institutional parking around businesses and schools;
- Using municipal bylaws and subsidies to encourage owners to make their buildings energy efficient;
- Improving the energy performance of large buildings through a rating system and by publicizing their energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
- Adapting all municipal buildings so they produce zero carbon emissions;
- Integrating a climate test into city decision-making so that the GHG emission impact of a decision, and whether it helps achieve the city's climate goals, is taken into consideration;
- Dedicating 10 to 15 per cent of the city's 10-year capital expenditure program to climate change adaptation Plante pegged the value at $1 billion.

The Climate Plan 2020-2030 also calls for the city to develop incentives for the public to adopt environmentally responsible habits, such as by providing municipal funding to businesses that deliver goods with bikes since they produce zero greenhouse gas emissions.
"As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Paris Accord in two days' time, Montreal is responding with a climate plan made by and for Montrealers," Plante said in a press release. "This plan responds to the concerns and the urgency to act through concrete actions. The work that we must begin together is essential and will allow us to ensure a healthier future for our children and their children's children."
The mayor's plan contains 46 concrete measures to help the city achieve a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The ultimate goal, it says, is to render the city of Montreal's operations carbon neutral by 2040 and the city as a whole by 2050.
The measures include:
Planting 500,000 trees over the next 10 years, with priority given to areas that are susceptible to heat waves. The city says that's over and above replacing diseased trees;
Encouraging "sustainable mobility" in neighbourhoods and future urban developments, such as the zero-carbon emission neighbourhood planned for the former Hippodrome Blue Bonnets site;
Favouring and increasing the percentage of electric vehicles downtown. In practical terms, that means a ban on non-electric vehicles in the greater downtown core by 2030. The city says it will consult businesses and residents who would be affected by the measure before implementing the ban. The city also says it's modelled on other cities that have banned cars in their downtown core. Paris, for example, using a permit system to regulate what vehicles can access its core;
Converting outdoor parking spaces, particularly around mÃ©tro stations, to make way for greening projects and urban development. The ban on parking spaces around mÃ©tro stations would encompass municipal parking spaces and private and institutional parking, such as businesses and schools;
Using municipal bylaws and subsidy programs to encourage the energy efficiency of all types of buildings;
Improving the energy performance of large buildings through a rating system and by publicizing their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions;
Adapting all municipal building operations so they produce zero carbon emissions;
Imposing a climate test on the city's own decisions so that any decision is made in consideration of its greenhouse gas emission impact and whether it works toward the city's climate goals;
Dedicating 10 to 15 per cent of the city's 10-year capital expenditure program to adapting to climate change
The plan calls for the city to produce an annual report tracking the progress on the different measures.

4:30 p.m. Canada expects 6M doses of vaccine before end of March
Iain Stewart, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, confirmed Friday afternoon that Canada expects six million doses of two COVID-19 vaccines before the end of March, The Canadian Press reports.
There are four million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and two million of Moderna's in the mix, but neither will be delivered until they complete their final clinical trials and Health Canada approves them for use in Canada.
Stewart said there are negotiations right now with the provinces and territories about how the vaccines will be divided between them, but noted that for personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests, the distribution has been done partly based on population and partly on other factors, including need.

3:45 p.m. B'nai Brith slams Quebec's religious 'favouritism' amid pandemic
B'nai Brith Canada is urging the Quebec government to "work with Jewish community and religious leaders when deciding upon pandemic rules and restrictions that impact religious holidays, while also ensuring the health and safety of all Quebecers."
In a press release this afternoon, the organization said it is "very disappointed in the government of Quebec's lack of consideration towards the Jewish community, as it relates to the newly released plan on December holiday gatherings."
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault "has not addressed the concerns and needs of several minority groups in Quebec, including the Jewish community," said Michael Mostyn, chief executive officer of B'nai Brith Canada.
"While we applaud the notion of a seven-day family quarantine in late December, it fails to allow accommodation for Jews to celebrate the eight-day Jewish holiday of Chanukah.
"The Quebec government must take the needs of minority communities, including the Jewish community, into consideration, and work proactively with these communities prior to the lifting or imposition of unilateral COVID-19 restrictions. There must be no favouritism. The premier must be the premier of all Quebecers."
3:30 p.m. U.S. officials worry about Thanksgiving spike as coronavirus surges
From the Reuters news agency:
U.S. health authorities braced for further increases in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths on Friday, capping a week in which the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerated ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases reached more than 165,000 on Thursday, while the seven-day average for deaths climbed to 1,359, more than any day since late May, according to a Reuters tally of public health data.
With hospitalizations rising across much of the nation, straining already exhausted medical staff, officials in more than 20 states have imposed restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said the virus is spreading at a high rate across more than half the country and that Thanksgiving gatherings should be limited to immediate family members rather than a maximum number of people.
"I don't like it to be any number... if you say it can be 10, and it's eight people from four different families, then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household," Birx told CNN on Friday.
3:10 p.m. Montreal cartoonist Michel Rabagliati's everyman Paul is where we all are: at home

The English translation of the Montreal cartoonist's 10th graphic novel - first published in 2019 as Paul Ã  la maison - now finds itself landing in a very different world, one where domesticity, for many of us, is full time and enforced.

On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Religious minorities say Quebec's decision to allow Christmas gatherings shows a double standard
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.
Reporter RenÃ© Bruemmer has the details in our full story
Columnist Allison Hanes, for her part, writes that in attempting to accommodate every family scenario, "there is a risk of encouraging overindulgence we will all pay for in the new year."
9:25 a.m. Quebec will not allow Hanukkah or New Year's Eve gatherings, Legault says 9:20 a.m. Trudeau will conduct briefings back at his home as cases surge

4:30 p.m. Canada expects 6M doses of vaccine before end of March
Iain Stewart, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, confirmed Friday afternoon that Canada expects six million doses of two COVID-19 vaccines before the end of March, The Canadian Press reports.
There are four million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and two million of Moderna's in the mix, but neither will be delivered until they complete their final clinical trials and Health Canada approves them for use in Canada.
Stewart said there are negotiations right now with the provinces and territories about how the vaccines will be divided between them, but noted that for personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests, the distribution has been done partly based on population and partly on other factors, including need.

3:45 p.m. B'nai Brith slams Quebec's religious 'favouritism' amid pandemic
B'nai Brith Canada is urging the Quebec government to "work with Jewish community and religious leaders when deciding upon pandemic rules and restrictions that impact religious holidays, while also ensuring the health and safety of all Quebecers."
In a press release this afternoon, the organization said it is "very disappointed in the government of Quebec's lack of consideration towards the Jewish community, as it relates to the newly released plan on December holiday gatherings."
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault "has not addressed the concerns and needs of several minority groups in Quebec, including the Jewish community," said Michael Mostyn, chief executive officer of B'nai Brith Canada.
"While we applaud the notion of a seven-day family quarantine in late December, it fails to allow accommodation for Jews to celebrate the eight-day Jewish holiday of Chanukah.
"The Quebec government must take the needs of minority communities, including the Jewish community, into consideration, and work proactively with these communities prior to the lifting or imposition of unilateral COVID-19 restrictions. There must be no favouritism. The premier must be the premier of all Quebecers."
3:30 p.m. U.S. officials worry about Thanksgiving spike as coronavirus surges
From the Reuters news agency:
U.S. health authorities braced for further increases in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths on Friday, capping a week in which the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerated ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases reached more than 165,000 on Thursday, while the seven-day average for deaths climbed to 1,359, more than any day since late May, according to a Reuters tally of public health data.
With hospitalizations rising across much of the nation, straining already exhausted medical staff, officials in more than 20 states have imposed restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said the virus is spreading at a high rate across more than half the country and that Thanksgiving gatherings should be limited to immediate family members rather than a maximum number of people.
"I don't like it to be any number... if you say it can be 10, and it's eight people from four different families, then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household," Birx told CNN on Friday.

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.

4:30 p.m. Canada expects 6M doses of vaccine before end of March
Iain Stewart, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, confirmed Friday afternoon that Canada expects six million doses of two COVID-19 vaccines before the end of March, The Canadian Press reports.
There are four million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and two million of Moderna's in the mix, but neither will be delivered until they complete their final clinical trials and Health Canada approves them for use in Canada.
Stewart said there are negotiations right now with the provinces and territories about how the vaccines will be divided between them, but noted that for personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests, the distribution has been done partly based on population and partly on other factors, including need.

3:45 p.m. B'nai Brith slams Quebec's religious 'favouritism' amid pandemic
B'nai Brith Canada is urging the Quebec government to "work with Jewish community and religious leaders when deciding upon pandemic rules and restrictions that impact religious holidays, while also ensuring the health and safety of all Quebecers."
In a press release this afternoon, the organization said it is "very disappointed in the government of Quebec's lack of consideration towards the Jewish community, as it relates to the newly released plan on December holiday gatherings."
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault "has not addressed the concerns and needs of several minority groups in Quebec, including the Jewish community," said Michael Mostyn, chief executive officer of B'nai Brith Canada.
"While we applaud the notion of a seven-day family quarantine in late December, it fails to allow accommodation for Jews to celebrate the eight-day Jewish holiday of Chanukah.
"The Quebec government must take the needs of minority communities, including the Jewish community, into consideration, and work proactively with these communities prior to the lifting or imposition of unilateral COVID-19 restrictions. There must be no favouritism. The premier must be the premier of all Quebecers."
3:30 p.m. U.S. officials worry about Thanksgiving spike as coronavirus surges
From the Reuters news agency:
U.S. health authorities braced for further increases in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths on Friday, capping a week in which the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerated ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases reached more than 165,000 on Thursday, while the seven-day average for deaths climbed to 1,359, more than any day since late May, according to a Reuters tally of public health data.
With hospitalizations rising across much of the nation, straining already exhausted medical staff, officials in more than 20 states have imposed restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said the virus is spreading at a high rate across more than half the country and that Thanksgiving gatherings should be limited to immediate family members rather than a maximum number of people.
"I don't like it to be any number... if you say it can be 10, and it's eight people from four different families, then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household," Birx told CNN on Friday.
3:10 p.m. Montreal cartoonist Michel Rabagliati's everyman Paul is where we all are: at home
When Michel Rabagliati was working on the book that would become Paul at Home, he had no way of knowing just how freighted with meaning that title would become.
The English translation of the Montreal cartoonist's 10th graphic novel - first published in 2019 as Paul Ã  la maison - now finds itself landing in a very different world, one where domesticity, for many of us, is full time and enforced.

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Religious minorities say Quebec allowing Christmas gatherings shows double standard
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.
Reporter RenÃ© Bruemmer has the details in our full story
Columnist Allison Hanes, for her part, writes that in attempting to accommodate every family scenario, "there is a risk of encouraging overindulgence we will all pay for in the new year."
9:25 a.m. Quebec will not allow Hanukkah or New Year's Eve gatherings, Legault says 9:20 a.m. Trudeau will conduct briefings back at his home as cases surge
To underscore the importance of minimizing contacts, today Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will conduct a news conference outside his home, Rideau Cottage - the site of his daily briefings during the first wave of the deadly pandemic last spring.

4:30 p.m. Canada expects 6M doses of vaccine before end of March
Iain Stewart, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, confirmed Friday afternoon that Canada expects six million doses of two COVID-19 vaccines before the end of March, The Canadian Press reports.
There are four million doses of Pfizer's vaccine and two million of Moderna's in the mix, but neither will be delivered until they complete their final clinical trials and Health Canada approves them for use in Canada.
Stewart said there are negotiations right now with the provinces and territories about how the vaccines will be divided between them, but noted that for personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests, the distribution has been done partly based on population and partly on other factors, including need.

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop

The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.

10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students

3:45 p.m. B'nai Brith slams Quebec's religious 'favouritism' amid pandemic
B'nai Brith Canada is urging the Quebec Government to "work with Jewish community and religious leaders when deciding upon pandemic rules and restrictions that impact religious holidays, while also ensuring the health and safety of all Quebecers."
In a press release this afternoon, the organization said it is "very disappointed in the Government of Quebec's lack of consideration towards the Jewish community, as it relates to the newly released plan on December holiday gatherings."
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault "has not addressed the concerns and needs of several minority groups in Quebec, including the Jewish community," said Michael Mostyn, chief executive officer of B'nai Brith Canada.
"While we applaud the notion of a seven-day family quarantine in late December, it fails to allow accommodation for Jews to celebrate the eight-day Jewish holiday of Chanukah.
"The Quebec government must take the needs of minority communities, including the Jewish community, into consideration, and work proactively with these communities prior to the lifting or imposition of unilateral COVID-19 restrictions. There must be no favouritism. The premier must be the premier of all Quebecers."
3:30 p.m. U.S. officials worry about Thanksgiving spike as coronavirus surges
From the Reuters news agency:
U.S. health authorities braced for further increases in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths on Friday, capping a week in which the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerated ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases reached more than 165,000 on Thursday, while the seven-day average for deaths climbed to 1,359, more than any day since late May, according to a Reuters tally of public health data.
With hospitalizations rising across much of the nation, straining already exhausted medical staff, officials in more than 20 states have imposed restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said the virus is spreading at a high rate across more than half the country and that Thanksgiving gatherings should be limited to immediate family members rather than a maximum number of people.
"I don't like it to be any number... if you say it can be 10, and it's eight people from four different families, then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household," Birx told CNN on Friday.
3:10 p.m. Montreal cartoonist Michel Rabagliati's everyman Paul is where we all are: at home

The English translation of the Montreal cartoonist's 10th graphic novel - first published in 2019 as Paul Ã  la maison - now finds itself landing in a very different world, one where domesticity, for many of us, is full time and enforced.

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Religious minorities say Quebec allowing Christmas gatherings shows double standard
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Religious minorities say Quebec allowing Christmas gatherings shows double standard
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.

3:30 p.m. U.S. officials worry about Thanksgiving spike as coronavirus surges
From the Reuters news agency:
U.S. health authorities braced for further increases in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths on Friday, capping a week in which the spread of the novel coronavirus accelerated ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday.
The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases reached more than 165,000 on Thursday, while the seven-day average for deaths climbed to 1,359, more than any day since late May, according to a Reuters tally of public health data.
With hospitalizations rising across much of the nation, straining already exhausted medical staff, officials in more than 20 states have imposed restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said the virus is spreading at a high rate across more than half the country and that Thanksgiving gatherings should be limited to immediate family members rather than a maximum number of people.
"I don't like it to be any number... if you say it can be 10, and it's eight people from four different families, then that probably is not the same degree of safe as 10 people from your immediate household," Birx told CNN on Friday.

The English translation of the Montreal cartoonist's 10th graphic novel - first published in 2019 as Paul Ã  la maison - now finds itself landing in a very different world, one where domesticity, for many of us, is full time and enforced.

3:10 p.m. Montreal cartoonist Michel Rabagliati's everyman Paul is where we all are: at home
When Michel Rabagliati was working on the book that would become Paul at Home, he had no way of knowing just how freighted with meaning that title would become.
The English translation of the Montreal cartoonist's 10th graphic novel - first published in 2019 as Paul Ã  la maison - now finds itself landing in a very different world, one where domesticity, for many of us, is full time and enforced.

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Religious minorities say Quebec allowing Christmas gatherings shows double standard
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.
Reporter RenÃ© Bruemmer has the details in our full story
Columnist Allison Hanes, for her part, writes that in attempting to accommodate every family scenario, "there is a risk of encouraging overindulgence we will all pay for in the new year."
9:25 a.m. Quebec will not allow Hanukkah or New Year's Eve gatherings, Legault says 9:20 a.m. Trudeau will conduct briefings back at his home as cases surge
To underscore the importance of minimizing contacts, today Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will conduct a news conference outside his home, Rideau Cottage - the site of his daily briefings during the first wave of the deadly pandemic last spring.

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result
Quebec has also published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Quebec's decision to allow Christmas gatherings questioned by religious minorities
Some leaders of Quebec's religious minorities are questioning the wisdom of allowing gatherings over the Christmas holidays.
The Legault government is adopting a double standard by allowing gatherings for four days over Christmas, said Yusuf Faqiri, a representative of the Conseil national des musulmans canadiens.
"There needs to be consistency," Faqiri said. "Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities have followed the rules, as we should, but why is there a double standard? It's very disappointing."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.
Reporter RenÃ© Bruemmer has the details in our full story
Columnist Allison Hanes, for her part, writes that in attempting to accommodate every family scenario, "there is a risk of encouraging overindulgence we will all pay for in the new year."
9:25 a.m. Quebec will not allow Hanukkah or New Year's Eve gatherings, Legault says 9:20 a.m. Trudeau will conduct briefings back at his home as cases surge
To underscore the importance of minimizing contacts, today Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will conduct a news conference outside his home, Rideau Cottage - the site of his daily briefings during the first wave of the deadly pandemic last spring.

The decision to allow get-togethers over Christmas is a reminder that minority religions are not taken as seriously as the majority, said Rabbi Lisa Grushcow of Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom in Westmount.
"There's this constant push and pull of Quebec calling itself a secular society, but the four days they chose are the days people are celebrating Christmas," Grushcow noted.
"We are shifting the school schedule, but God forbid there would be a teacher with a hijab in the classroom."

He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Quebec's decision to allow Christmas gatherings questioned
The decision to allow get-togethers over Christmas is a reminder that minority religions are not taken as seriously as the majority, said Rabbi Lisa Grushcow of Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom in Westmount.
"There's this constant push and pull of Quebec calling itself a secular society, but the four days they chose are the days people are celebrating Christmas," Grushcow noted.
"We are shifting the school schedule, but God forbid there would be a teacher with a hijab in the classroom."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students
Late yesterday afternoon, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault announced Quebec's pandemic Christmas plan
People will be allowed to congregate in groups of 10, be they family members or friends, from Dec. 24 to 27.
And there will be some remote learning for students before they go on their Christmas break, and high school students will get an extra week off in January.
Reporter RenÃ© Bruemmer has the details in our full story
Columnist Allison Hanes, for her part, writes that in attempting to accommodate every family scenario, "there is a risk of encouraging overindulgence we will all pay for in the new year."

12:50 p.m. Stay two metres apart at Christmas gatherings, Quebec says
On the province's coronavirus page about the holidays, the government says that from Dec. 24 to Dec. 27, "participation in private gatherings is allowed."
Under the rules, gatherings must be limited to not more than 10 people.
"Individuals from different households must always remain two metres apart," the rules stipulate.
"It will be especially important to display the utmost rigour in the case of individuals 70 years of age and over, those suffering from chronic diseases or those whose immune systems are weakened or deficient."
In addition, the following individuals must avoid participating in gatherings:
Anyone who has COVID-19
Anyone who is isolating after coming into contact with a case of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is displaying symptoms
Anyone displaying symptoms, regardless of whether the person has been tested
Anyone who has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the result

Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students

"The idea that young and old alike will go into a sort of quarantine for a week before Dec. 24 and a week after Dec. 27 is a pipe dream."

12:50 p.m. Quebec's holiday calendar
Quebec today published a calendar to help illustrate its holiday plan.
It shows the period during which people should self-isolate before and after the four days when Christmas gatherings are allowed.
12:45 p.m. Updated charts: Quebec cases, deaths
12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Quebec's decision to allow Christmas gatherings questioned
The decision to allow get-togethers over Christmas is a reminder that minority religions are not taken as seriously as the majority, said Rabbi Lisa Grushcow of Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom in Westmount.
"There's this constant push and pull of Quebec calling itself a secular society, but the four days they chose are the days people are celebrating Christmas," Grushcow noted.
"We are shifting the school schedule, but God forbid there would be a teacher with a hijab in the classroom."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop

12:15 p.m. 'A normal Christmas is right out of the question' - Trudeau
Speaking from outside his home in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed Canadians this afternoon.
"We have a long winter ahead," he said. "As the weather drives us indoors, we are really in danger of seeing more transmission and far too many more deaths. It will be tough, but we know what we have to do."
He added: "A normal Christmas, quite frankly, is right out of the question."
A journalist asked about reports that some Liberal MPs are not happy that Quebec will allow holiday get-togethers of up to 10 people.
In response, Trudeau said he understands why Premier FranÃ§ois Legault is allowing gatherings over a four-day period around Christmas.
"I think Premier Legault is doing all he can to recognize the reality in which people live," Trudeau said.
Is it wise to allow people to get together amid the pandemic?
Christmas is still a way off and much can change in the meantime, Trudeau responded.
"What kinds of limits we have in place (at Christmas) will depend a lot on what we do right now, so over the coming weeks let's tighten up, let's be careful. We've done this before, we can do it again."
British Columbia has urged Trudeau to ask Canadians not to travel between provinces.
Asked if he will restrict interprovincial travel, the prime minister said he is telling people not to travel if they don't have to.
11:55 a.m. Immigration system slowed sharply during pandemic's first months
New data is painting a stark picture of how the shutdown of the immigration system due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected thousands of lives, The Canadian Press is reporting.
The figures show approvals for immigration applications fell by more than half in the months between March and August when compared to the first two months of 2020.
At the same time, the number of extensions given to people with existing permits skyrocketed. The data was tabled in the House of Commons in response to a question from NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan.
She says extensions need to be made automatic so Immigration Department staff can focus on new files and avoid the risk of a backlog that could take years to clear.
The information obtained by the NDP shows that at the end of March, the department was operating at 38-per-cent capacity but is now nearing 90 per cent.
11:30 a.m. Quebec's decision to allow Christmas gatherings questioned
The decision to allow get-togethers over Christmas is a reminder that minority religions are not taken as seriously as the majority, said Rabbi Lisa Grushcow of Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom in Westmount.
"There's this constant push and pull of Quebec calling itself a secular society, but the four days they chose are the days people are celebrating Christmas," Grushcow noted.
"We are shifting the school schedule, but God forbid there would be a teacher with a hijab in the classroom."

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.
10:45 a.m. Resto resilience: How chefs are combatting the second wave
With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days.
And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery.

10:15 a.m. Hospital capacity could be surpassed outside Montreal by mid-December
With cases on the rise, there is a risk that hospitalizations outside Greater Montreal could exceed hospital capacities over the next month.
That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.

That's one of the conclusions of the latest weekly projection by public health researchers at the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux.
"The data suggest a less marked increase in hospitalizations than expected in Montreal and adjacent regions, so hospital capacity overruns are not expected in these regions for the next four weeks," the institute said this morning.
"However, in other regions of Quebec the increase in projected hospitalizations is higher. Thus, a risk of exceeding capacities cannot be excluded, in particular because of outbreaks observed" in seniors' residences.
"Although the situation has been fairly stable over the past few weeks, increasingly high risks of hospital capacity overruns are starting to emerge, especially in certain regions outside of Montreal," Health Minister Christian DubÃ© said.
"With the holidays ahead, it remains crucial to be even more disciplined and to do everything to further protect the most vulnerable.
"The situation remains under control, but our room for manoeuvre is thinning, and that is why I invite the entire population to redouble their efforts for the coming weeks."

9:50 a.m. Cases are soaring in Canada
These charts are from a document the Public Health Agency of Canada published this morning.
They show the current situation in Canada, longer-range forecasts and a comparison with other countries.
9:40 a.m. Canada could see 60,000 daily cases by year-end, projections show
From The Canadian Press:
Canada's chief public health officer says there's "urgency" to bringing infections down as officials released dire new forecasts indicating that COVID-19 case counts have far surpassed levels seen during the first wave.
Dr. Theresa Tam says COVID-19 cases could skyrocket to 60,000 per day by the end of the year if Canadians increase their contact rates.
The modelling predicts that at current rates of contact, Canada is careening towards a surge of more than 20,000 cases per day by the end of December.
But if socialization increases, the projections indicate that as 2020 draws to a close, Canada could see twelvefold increase from the current level of around 5,000 cases per day, which is already straining the health-care system in some regions.
The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.
9:30 a.m. Quebec allows Christmas parties over four days, adjusts holiday breaks for students

11:05 a.m. Quebec reports 1,259 new cases, 32 deaths as hospitalizations drop
Quebec's caseload increased by more than 1,200 again on Friday, with 32 additional deaths reported - but hospitalizations fell.
The province recorded 1,259 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest government update.
That's 52 more than Thursday.
Montreal added the most new infections of any region - 294, followed by Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (213) and MontÃ©rÃ©gie (159).
Of the 32 deaths, nine occurred over the past 24 hours. Twenty-two others occurred between Nov. 13 and 18, and one on an unknown day.
Two deaths previously attributed to COVID-19 have been removed from the death toll.
The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped by 27. The new total: 624.
Among those hospitalized, 96 are in intensive care - five fewer than the previous day.
On Wednesday, Quebec conducted 34,703 tests. That's the last day for which screening data is available.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Quebec has reported 129,699 cases and 6,774 deaths linked to COVID-19.

The forecasts predict that at current rates Canada's case total could land between 366,500 and 378,600 and the death toll could fall between 11,870 and 12,120 by the end of the month.
Currently, Tam says an average of 4,800 cases are being reported daily - about a 15 per cent increase compared to last week.
The data says the percentage of people testing positive has increased to about 6.5 per cent, above the World Health Organization's benchmark of five per cent.
Tam says this could indicate that Canada is not testing enough, and is a clear sign that the spread of the virus is accelerating.
Tam says there are about 52,000 active cases in Canada to date, with a cumulative tally of more 315,000 cases.
Still, Tam says that amounts to less than one per cent of the population that has tested positive, meaning the vast majority of Canadians are still susceptible to infection.

Allison Hanes: Plante's poll numbers show Montrealers are in sour mood

Full text: There's nothing like a major catastrophe to burnish the credibility of a strong leader.
Former mayor Colette Roy Laroche's reputation as Lac-MÃ©gantic's beloved "Granite Lady" was forged in her graceful handling of the rail disaster that claimed 47 lives and put a close-knit small town at the centre of the international spotlight.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's empathetic response to the massacre at a mosque in Christchurch in 2019, along with tough measures that twice crushed COVID-19, helped assure her decisive re-election this month.
Premier John Horgan's pandemic election gamble in British Columbia helped the New Democratic Party secure the largest victory in its history over the weekend - as well as demonstrate that in times of crisis voters tend to embrace familiar incumbents.
But a year out from the next municipal election, COVID-19 is not having the same effect on Montreal Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante's fortunes.
According to new polling data for Radio-Canada, support for Plante has eroded. While 41 per cent of respondents told Ad Hoc Research they would definitely or likely still give her their vote in 2021, six in 10 Montrealers said they probably or most certainly would not. Plante unseated former mayor Denis Coderre with a 51-per-cent share of the ballots cast in 2017.
Even among those who played a role in Plante's win, 47 per cent said they would be less inclined to support her a second time around. Plante's strongest backers are, not surprisingly, younger. Just over half of 18- to 34-year-old Montrealers polled said they were planning to endorse her next year. But 63 per cent of those surveyed between the ages of 35 and 54, and 66 per cent of respondents older than 55 indicated they intend to vote against Plante.
There's only so much you can read into a poll conducted a full year out from the next election. That's a lifetime in politics and the world could be turned upside down yet again by the time Montrealers are ready to mark their ballots. Besides, 41-per-cent support is not negligible.
However, the absence of any real opponent is worth noting here. At the very least, it's a warning shot across the bow by an increasingly disgruntled and grumpy electorate that they would opt for a question mark in this time of uncertainty over the mayor who has led the city through a tough time.
Even Premier FranÃ§ois Legault, who is taking heat for reconfining most of the province again as a second wave of COVID-19 sweeps Quebec, has solid ratings. Sure, they've taken a tumble from lofty heights as his detractors have grown louder. But 61 per cent of Quebecers surveyed by CROP this month gave his handling of the crisis positive reviews and Legault outpaces all the opposition leaders by far.
This most recent poll showing waning patience for Plante echoes others from late summer, including one that put her behind her old adversary Coderre And he hasn't even declared his candidacy.
It begs the question: why have so many Montrealers grown disenchanted with their mayor at a time most citizens tend to stick with known quantities?
To be fair, many of the worst problems plaguing the city at the moment - from second-wave pandemic restrictions closing restaurants and bars to office workers abandoning the beleaguered downtown since spring - are beyond Plante's control. And many of the solutions are outside of her authority.
Still, the public has not found Plante's pandemic response soothing, despite her generally sunny, upbeat demeanour.
In the midst of a crisis, where people tend to resist change and crave stability, Plante has rapidly altered the Montreal landscape, adding temporary health corridors for pedestrians on some commercial strips and installing permanent cycling infrastructure on others. Some of these measures might have been in her platform all along and others may be emergency steps in keeping with Projet Montreal's vision, but many Montrealers have been spooked by them. Plante may have misread the public's appetite for new approaches and projects at this time.
Pushback from businesses on some streets slated for transformation - including St-Denis St. in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Bellechasse St. in Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie - have created a perception the city is kicking entrepreneurs while they are down. And this is in spite of tax relief, reduced-price terrasse permits over the summer and the announcement of free street parking during the critical holiday shopping season to bolster local merchants.
Far from running to their mayor with open arms as the pandemic wears on, some Montrealers have soured on Plante.
The question is, can she yet find a way to make lemonade amid all this bitterness?

Beach battles: fighting for more waterfront access for Montrealers

Full text: The pandemic has given Montrealers a new appreciation for this city's natural spaces, particularly waterfronts.
Restrictions on travel sent Montrealers flocking to local beaches and waterfront parks this summer. The beach at Cap-Saint-Jacques and the new one in Verdun were swamped during the heat waves, while Jean-DorÃ© Beach on Ãle Notre-Dame had would-be beachgoers signing up online to reserve short stays in advance.
The increased demand has emboldened longtime advocates to beat their drums even louder for better public access to the shores and waterways that surround the island. They say the public should have access not only to the shorelines, for strolling, cycling and picnicking, but to the lakes and rivers themselves to practise water sports, including swimming.
Here is an update on three projects, each at different stages of realization, that dangle the promise of full public access to the natural bodies of water that surround us.
Artist rendering shows a new nautical park the city plans to create where the Lachine marina currently operates.
The Lachine River Park
In a few weeks, Montreal's city council will be adopting a 10-year capital spending plan for nature parks and riverbanks, including a $25-million envelope to create a new "nautical park" in Lachine.
The idea, announced by the city in July, is to transform the Port de plaisance de Lachine, a 750-metre-long peninsula currently accessible only to pleasure boaters who rent berths in its marina, into a "nautical park" open to the public year-round. The project necessitates, controversially, the closure of the province's largest marina at the mouth of the Lachine Canal.
The city claims the marina has been a drag on public finances ever since the former city of Lachine took over the lease from the Iroquois Yacht Club in 1986. The financial history of the marina is long and complicated, but suffice to say that millions of dollars of public funds were invested and large debts to Lachine and to Montreal were forgiven over the years.
In 2015, responsibility for the marina was transferred from the borough of Lachine to the parks service of the central city, although the borough remained responsible for day-to-day operations.
The site suffered heavy damage during spring flooding in 2017 and 2019, which only added to a long list of repairs required at the marina site. Shores are eroding, docks need repair, the gas station reservoirs and septic tanks need replacing, electrical and communications systems are out of date, and the site's three buildings require renovations. The parks department estimates the facility would need work totalling $16.5 million, much of it urgent, to continue as a marina.
"It is this $16.5-million investment, for a facility reserved for 450 boat owners and their guests, that we cannot justify," says Lachine borough Mayor Maja Vodanovic in a long Facebook post explaining the history of the site and why she supports the closure of the marina to create a nautical park.
"It represents a total of $37,000 per boat. We don't believe the users of the marina have the means to pay for the investment, just as they did not have the means in 1985, in 2004 or in 2012, since we would have to more than double their annual fees, which would cause many to leave."
The plan has not gone over well with pleasure boaters, as this protest on Aug. 24, 2020 shows.
Preliminary designs for the proposed park include plans to rehabilitate the shoreline, remove most of the concrete and asphalt on the peninsula and replace it with vegetation, add a pedestrian link to nearby Parc RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque and floating islands and wetland areas to improve water quality. There is also a plan to repurpose the marina's docks for sunbathing and swimming, pending the results of water quality and safety studies.
At a meeting on Sept. 14, Lachine borough councillors adopted a motion that ends the management contract of the marina, and it is set to close at the end of October.
Not surprisingly, the plan has not gone over well with pleasure boaters. JosÃ©e CÃ´tÃ©, president of the Pleasure Boaters' Association of the Port de plaisance de Lachine, is outraged the city decided to close the marina without consulting boaters. The group is seeking an injunction to block the city's plan.
"Motorized and non-motorized water sports have co-existed well in Lachine for 100 years already, and we will continue to speak up so that this co-existence can continue and be improved," CÃ´tÃ© said. "We are not giving up."
She says the cost of needed repairs to the marina is only about $5.3 million, and boaters are prepared to cover that cost through higher rental fees. They have come up with a plan that would open the site to the public, yet allow the marina to stay open. That plan would see some environmental improvements to the site and separate zones for motorized boats and other water sports. The city has dismissed it as unworkable from a safety standpoint and financially untenable.
CÃ´tÃ© objects to attempts to paint the pleasure boaters as wealthy members of a private club. Rental costs for a berth for the season currently range from $850 for a small boat to $3,500 for the biggest boats, she said.
"It's a public marina. It belongs to the city of Montreal. It's a public service that we rent. It's not private. Anyone can join as long as they have a boat and they pay their fees and there is availability. ... If you have a boat you can rent a dock. They say it's private because we have a gate for security reasons."
She says the city has not considered the human aspect, adding some boating families have been using the marina for more than 30 years, and so are losing their summer community.
"We are not rich people. Most of us, our boats cost the same price as a new car, on average. There are big boats and really small ones too. We are middle-class people," she said.
"Motorized and non-motorized water sports have co-existed well in Lachine for 100 years already, and we will continue to speak up so that this co-existence can continue and be improved," says JosÃ©e CÃ´tÃ©, president of the Pleasure Boaters' Association of the Port de plaisance de Lachine.
Alan DeSousa, Ensemble MontrÃ©al's critic on finance, administration and transportation, says he is all for improving public access to Montreal's waterfront. But he thinks the Projet MontrÃ©al administration is moving too fast in Lachine, without proper consultation on whether the vocation of the site should be changed.
"To announce something without consultation out of the blue in the middle of summer with no effort made to recognize there are people impacted by the decision ... that is against not just everything this administration said they would do, but it's in line with a long line of other decisions that freeze out public consultation."
He says the administration is jumping the gun to suggest the site could offer a swimming area before water studies have been done.
"That little finger of land is backfill and it was made primarily to act as some sort of docking point. ... Is (the sediment) contaminated? We don't know. Is the water clean? ... I haven't seen anything serious that is documented and real. In the absence of a solid file, I think it is people winging it."
But Vodanocic says the nautical park idea was borne out of years of reflection.
"Even though some people were surprised by this announcement, it was not improvised," Vodanovic told the borough council meeting. "It is the result of an internal reflection at the city of Montreal that has been going on for more than ten years, supported by many technical studies under three different mayors. The studies indicate that the maintenance of the marina is not possible solely through fees paid by the pleasure boaters."
Public consultations and fine-tuning of the park's design are projected to take until the end of next year. Then environmental impact studies, including water quality testing, would likely go on until the end of 2022. Construction would start in April of 2023 and, if all goes as planned, the nautical park will open officially in 2025.
Construction of a boardwalk is part of the work underway to create a waterfront park called the Plage de l'Est in Pointe-aux-Trembles.
The Plage de l'Est
A beach project at the eastern tip of the island in Pointe-aux-Trembles, the Plage de l'Est is still under construction and swimming is not yet permitted.
Decades of lobbying by environmental and community groups in the borough finally began to bear fruit in 2018 when the first phase of the project was completed. That phase included a chalet, volleyball courts and some park furniture. An illuminated concrete boardwalk, part of which will extend out over the water, is currently under construction. Eventually, there will be a pebbly beach with, in theory, full access to the water for swimming and platforms for sunbathing.
The water access portion has been delayed by a 2017 study that revealed contaminated sediment from a former marina at the site. The project awaits authorization from the provincial environment department and a $5-million decontamination process, expected to be completed in time for summer 2022.
Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie, is hoping the city will get behind his group's harbour bath project for the Old Port, which he says would be even bigger and better than the city's idea.
The Harbour Bath
You can still find Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante's 2017 campaign promise for a Copenhagen-style "harbour bath" online and it was very clear:
"The shores belong to Montrealers, more and more of whom want to take them back, as demonstrated by the tens of thousands of people who flock to the beaches of Jean-Drapeau Park, Cap-Saint-Jacques and the Clock Tower Quay. I promise to offer them a harbour bath during my first mandate."
But more recently, the Plante administration has indicated the harbour bath project - basically a floating swimming pool just off the Clock Tower Quay in the Old Port - is not going to happen; at least not at that location, and not during this mandate.
"The city of Montreal has carried out numerous technical studies to proceed with the Harbour Bath project and to respond to the challenges posed by co-existence with port activities," executive committee spokesperson GeneviÃ¨ve Jutras told the Montreal Gazette. "Unfortunately, the conclusion of the studies and of discussions between the city and the port was that the site chosen was incompatible with port activities."
She said the Plante administration remains committed to establishing a harbour bath in the Old Port sector. "The city is studying other sites and continues to work in collaboration with the Port of Montreal and the Old Port to ensure the compatibility of the project with port activities."
Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie (ACSM), is hoping the city will get behind his group's harbour bath project, which he says would be even bigger, better and technically simpler to install than the one the city had in mind.
The group, which has been advocating for better public access to the river in the south-central neighbourhoods of Montreal for the past decade, proposes the establishment of a massive swimming area in the Clock Tower Basin. One side of that basin already has an artificial beach, but the ACSM proposes that beach be expanded to line the basin on three sides.
"We saw that basin there and it just looks perfect to have some swimming, so people can go right into the river," says Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie.
"We say build a huge beach, that really looks like a beach, all around the Clock Tower Basin," Balsis said. "Give us the idea that we have really gone to the beach, but we are staying downtown. It would be a big advantage for the city for tourism and it would encourage people who live in the city to stay in the city."
The project would require the removal or displacement of the Yacht Club de MontrÃ©al marina, a 205-berth marina in the Clock Tower basin. Balsis suggests the marina could be moved to one of the other basins of the Old Port.
"We saw that basin there and it just looks perfect to have some swimming, so people can go right into the river," Balsis said. "For people who live downtown, the Plateau, Centre-Sud and Griffintown, it's in walking distance to all those places. Wouldn't that be fantastic?"
The idea does not go over particularly well with Sylvain Deschamps, president of the Yacht Club de MontrÃ©al. The establishment of a marina in the Clock Tower Basin was a passion project for Deschamps since 1993. He got the financing together to upgrade the site and the marina opened in 2006 with a 20-year lease.
"At the time (1993), that basin was a wreck," Deschamps said. "It was only old boats, not commercially developed. ... Now after 14 years, the marina is in good shape and all around it everything is nicer. Now people say, 'That's a nice spot, maybe we should put a beach over there.' Where were they back in 2000?"
Balsis said his group has been trying to meet with the Port of Montreal to discuss the project for some time, but no luck.
Other sources told the Montreal Gazette the port authority is against the whole idea of a harbour bath.
MÃ©lanie Nadeau, director of communications for the Port of Montreal, said the port authority would not comment on the harbour bath project. The Port of Montreal is an autonomous federal agency that builds and maintains facilities in the Old Port and leases them out to private companies.
Balsis said it's unacceptable if the port authority is blocking a project that is supported by elected officials and on publicly owned lands and waterways.
"Why can't we have access to our river? Why do you have to own a boat or pay to take a tour? Why can't we put our toes in the river, or go right in?"

Full text: The pandemic has given Montrealers a new appreciation for this city's natural spaces, particularly waterfronts.
Restrictions on travel sent Montrealers flocking to local beaches and waterfront parks this summer. The beach at Cap-Saint-Jacques and the new one in Verdun were swamped during the heat waves, while Jean-DorÃ© Beach on Ãle Notre-Dame had would-be beachgoers signing up online to reserve short stays in advance.

"It is this $16.5-million investment, for a facility reserved for 450 boat owners and their guests, that we cannot justify," says Lachine borough Mayor Maja Vodanovic in a long Facebook post explaining the history of the site and why she supports the closure of the marina to create a nautical park.
"It represents a total of $37,000 per boat. We don't believe the users of the marina have the means to pay for the investment, just as they did not have the means in 1985, in 2004 or in 2012, since we would have to more than double their annual fees, which would cause many to leave."
The plan has not gone over well with pleasure boaters, as this protest on Aug. 24, 2020 shows.
Preliminary designs for the proposed park include plans to rehabilitate the shoreline, remove most of the concrete and asphalt on the peninsula and replace it with vegetation, add a pedestrian link to nearby Parc RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque and floating islands and wetland areas to improve water quality. There is also a plan to repurpose the marina's docks for sunbathing and swimming, pending the results of water quality and safety studies.
At a meeting on Sept. 14, Lachine borough councillors adopted a motion that ends the management contract of the marina, and it is set to close at the end of October.
Not surprisingly, the plan has not gone over well with pleasure boaters. JosÃ©e CÃ´tÃ©, president of the Pleasure Boaters' Association of the Port de plaisance de Lachine, is outraged the city decided to close the marina without consulting boaters.
"Motorized and non-motorized water sports have co-existed well in Lachine for 100 years already, and we will continue to speak up so that this co-existence can continue and be improved," CÃ´tÃ© said. "We are not giving up."
She says the cost of needed repairs to the marina is only about $5.3 million, and boaters are prepared to cover that cost through higher rental fees. They have come up with a plan that would open the site to the public, yet allow the marina to stay open. That plan would see some environmental improvements to the site and separate zones for motorized boats and other water sports. The city has dismissed it as unworkable from a safety standpoint and financially untenable.
CÃ´tÃ© objects to attempts to paint the pleasure boaters as wealthy members of a private club. Rental costs for a berth for the season currently range from $850 for a small boat to $3,500 for the biggest boats, she said.
"It's a public marina. It belongs to the city of Montreal. It's a public service that we rent. It's not private. Anyone can join as long as they have a boat and they pay their fees and there is availability. ... If you have a boat you can rent a dock. They say it's private because we have a gate for security reasons."
She says the city has not considered the human aspect, adding some boating families have been using the marina for more than 30 years, and so are losing their summer community.
"We are not rich people. Most of us, our boats cost the same price as a new car, on average. There are big boats and really small ones too. We are middle-class people," she said.
"Motorized and non-motorized water sports have co-existed well in Lachine for 100 years already, and we will continue to speak up so that this co-existence can continue and be improved," says JosÃ©e CÃ´tÃ©, president of the Pleasure Boaters' Association of the Port de plaisance de Lachine.
Alan DeSousa, Ensemble MontrÃ©al's critic on finance, administration and transportation, says he is all for improving public access to Montreal's waterfront. But he thinks the Projet MontrÃ©al administration is moving too fast in Lachine, without proper consultation on whether the vocation of the site should be changed.
"To announce something without consultation out of the blue in the middle of summer with no effort made to recognize there are people impacted by the decision ... that is against not just everything this administration said they would do, but it's in line with a long line of other decisions that freeze out public consultation."
He says the administration is jumping the gun to suggest the site could offer a swimming area before water studies have been done.
"That little finger of land is backfill and it was made primarily to act as some sort of docking point. ... Is (the sediment) contaminated? We don't know. Is the water clean? ... I haven't seen anything serious that is documented and real. In the absence of a solid file, I think it is people winging it."
But Vodanocic says the nautical park idea was borne out of years of reflection.
"Even though some people were surprised by this announcement, it was not improvised," Vodanovic told the borough council meeting. "It is the result of an internal reflection at the city of Montreal that has been going on for more than ten years, supported by many technical studies under three different mayors. The studies indicate that the maintenance of the marina is not possible solely through fees paid by the pleasure boaters."
Public consultations and fine-tuning of the park's design are projected to take until the end of next year. Then environmental impact studies, including water quality testing, would likely go on until the end of 2022. Construction would start in April of 2023 and, if all goes as planned, the nautical park will open officially in 2025.
Construction of a boardwalk is part of the work underway to create a waterfront park called the Plage de l'Est in Pointe-aux-Trembles.
The Plage de l'Est
A beach project at the eastern tip of the island in Pointe-aux-Trembles, the Plage de l'Est is still under construction and swimming is not yet permitted.
Decades of lobbying by environmental and community groups in the borough finally began to bear fruit in 2018 when the first phase of the project was completed. That phase included a chalet, volleyball courts and some park furniture. An illuminated concrete boardwalk, part of which will extend out over the water, is currently under construction. Eventually, there will be a pebbly beach with, in theory, full access to the water for swimming and platforms for sunbathing.
The water access portion has been delayed by a 2017 study that revealed contaminated sediment from a former marina at the site. The project awaits authorization from the provincial environment department and a $5-million decontamination process, expected to be completed in time for summer 2022.
Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie, is hoping the city will get behind his group's harbour bath project for the Old Port, which he says would be even bigger and better than the city's idea.
The Harbour Bath
You can still find Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante's 2017 campaign promise for a Copenhagen-style "harbour bath" online and it was very clear:
"The shores belong to Montrealers, more and more of whom want to take them back, as demonstrated by the tens of thousands of people who flock to the beaches of Jean-Drapeau Park, Cap-Saint-Jacques and the Clock Tower Quay. I promise to offer them a harbour bath during my first mandate."
But more recently, the Plante administration has indicated the harbour bath project - basically a floating swimming pool just off the Clock Tower Quay in the Old Port - is not going to happen; at least not at that location, and not during this mandate.
"The city of Montreal has carried out numerous technical studies to proceed with the Harbour Bath project and to respond to the challenges posed by co-existence with port activities," executive committee spokesperson GeneviÃ¨ve Jutras told the Montreal Gazette. "Unfortunately, the conclusion of the studies and of discussions between the city and the port was that the site chosen was incompatible with port activities."
She said the Plante administration remains committed to establishing a harbour bath in the Old Port sector. "The city is studying other sites and continues to work in collaboration with the Port of Montreal and the Old Port to ensure the compatibility of the project with port activities."
Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie (ACSM), is hoping the city will get behind his group's harbour bath project, which he says would be even bigger, better and technically simpler to install than the one the city had in mind.
The group, which has been advocating for better public access to the river in the south-central neighbourhoods of Montreal for the past decade, proposes the establishment of a massive swimming area in the Clock Tower Basin. One side of that basin already has an artificial beach, but the ACSM proposes that beach be expanded to line the basin on three sides.
"We saw that basin there and it just looks perfect to have some swimming, so people can go right into the river," says Victor Balsis, president of Les AmiEs du Courant Sainte-Marie.
"We say build a huge beach, that really looks like a beach, all around the Clock Tower Basin," Balsis said. "Give us the idea that we have really gone to the beach, but we are staying downtown. It would be a big advantage for the city for tourism and it would encourage people who live in the city to stay in the city."
The project would require the removal or displacement of the Yacht Club de MontrÃ©al marina, a 205-berth marina in the Clock Tower basin. Balsis suggests the marina could be moved to one of the other basins of the Old Port.
"We saw that basin there and it just looks perfect to have some swimming, so people can go right into the river," Balsis said. "For people who live downtown, the Plateau, Centre-Sud and Griffintown, it's in walking distance to all those places. Wouldn't that be fantastic?"
The idea does not go over particularly well with Sylvain Deschamps, president of the Yacht Club de MontrÃ©al. The establishment of a marina in the Clock Tower Basin was a passion project for Deschamps since 1993. He got the financing together to upgrade the site and the marina opened in 2006 with a 20-year lease.
"At the time (1993), that basin was a wreck," Deschamps said. "It was only old boats, not commercially developed. ... Now after 14 years, the marina is in good shape and all around it everything is nicer. Now people say, 'That's a nice spot, maybe we should put a beach over there.' Where were they back in 2000?"
Balsis said his group has been trying to meet with the Port of Montreal to discuss the project for some time, but no luck.
Other sources told the Montreal Gazette the port authority is against the whole idea of a harbour bath.
MÃ©lanie Nadeau, director of communications for the Port of Montreal, said the port authority would not comment on the harbour bath project. The Port of Montreal is an autonomous federal agency that builds and maintains facilities in the Old Port and leases them out to private companies.
Balsis said it's unacceptable if the port authority is blocking a project that is supported by elected officials and on publicly owned lands and waterways.
"Why can't we have access to our river? Why do you have to own a boat or pay to take a tour? Why can't we put our toes in the river, or go right in?"

Full text: The pandemic has given Montrealers a new appreciation for this city's natural spaces, particularly waterfronts.
Restrictions on travel sent Montrealers flocking to local beaches and waterfront parks this summer. The beach at Cap-Saint-Jacques and the new one in Verdun were swamped during the heat waves, while Jean-DorÃ© Beach on Ãle Notre-Dame had would-be beachgoers signing up online to reserve short stays in advance.
The increased demand has emboldened longtime advocates to beat their drums even louder for better public access to the shores and waterways that surround the island. They say the public should have access not only to the shorelines, for strolling, cycling and picnicking, but to the lakes and rivers themselves to practise water sports, including swimming.
Here is an update on three projects, each at a different stage of realization, that dangle the promise of full public access to the natural bodies of water that surround us. THE LACHINE RIVER PARK In a few weeks, Montreal's city council will be adopting a 10-year capital spending plan for nature parks and riverbanks, including a $25-million envelope to create a new "nautical park" in Lachine.
The idea, announced by the city in July, is to transform the Port de plaisance de Lachine, a 750-metre-long peninsula currently accessible only to pleasure boaters who rent berths in its marina, into a "nautical park" open to the public year-round. The project necessitates, controversially, the closure of the province's largest marina at the mouth of the Lachine Canal.
The city claims the marina has been a drag on public finances ever since the former city of Lachine took over the lease from the Iroquois Yacht Club in 1986. The financial history of the marina is long and complicated, but suffice to say that millions of dollars of public funds were invested and large debts to Lachine and to Montreal were forgiven over the years.
In 2015, responsibility for the marina was transferred from the borough of Lachine to the parks service of the central city, although the borough remained responsible for day-to-day operations.
The site suffered heavy damage during spring flooding in 2017 and 2019, which only added to a long list of repairs required at the marina site. Shores are eroding, docks need repair, the gas station reservoirs and septic tanks need replacing, electrical and communications systems are out of date, and the site's three buildings require renovations. The parks department estimates the facility would need work totalling $16.5 million, much of it urgent, to continue as a marina.
"It is this $16.5-million investment, for a facility reserved for 450 boat owners and their guests, that we cannot justify," says Lachine borough Mayor Maja Vodanovic in a long Facebook post explaining the history of the site and why she supports the closure of the marina to create a nautical park.

Latest COVID lockdown could be boon for Montreal's Les Weekendeurs

Full text: Anne-Marie GiguÃ¨re and Kassandra Brochu aren't the least bit happy to see the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hitting their home province. Both women come from the local restaurant biz and say they feel sadness seeing their friends and colleagues in the resto scene once again having to close their doors.
But there's no denying this second lockdown, which includes closing all restaurants in Montreal for 28 days this month, could be good for their business. GiguÃ¨re and Brochu started up Les Weekendeurs in March during the first lockdown and its unique spin on restaurant delivery was a big hit.
The company, which they co-own, works with seven happening eateries, many of which are located in Sud-Ouest borough, where they both live. The restaurants are Verdun Cambodian spot Les Street Monkeys, gay-village vegan resto Bistro Tendresse, funky taco-and-much-more outlet Grumman '78, pizza and pasta specialists Moleskine, tapas spot Mauvais GarÃ§ons, Lebanese themed Sumac, and French bistro Restaurant Wellington.
The twist with Les Weekendeurs is you can make your own menu, picking and choosing from any or all of the seven restaurants. They deliver all of the ingredients and you just put the finishing touches on the meal in your kitchen.
"It's a delivery service that brings the best of what Montreal restaurants have to offer but in a very new way, which is ready-to-cook at home," GiguÃ¨re said in a phone interview Thursday. "So it's a very different equation than what we see with Uber Eats or DoorDash and all of that stuff. Hot food that you order and receive within the hour. Our service is much more based on sitting down around a table and having a nice meal with perhaps a few other people, at least when we're allowed to. It brings up the quality of the finished product. So you're not necessarily receiving a hot mess at your house (like with other delivery services)."
GiguÃ¨re and Brochu met a few years ago at the Atwater Cocktail Club. GiguÃ¨re was working in administration with the Groupe Barroco, which owns a bunch of restaurants and bars, including the Atwater Cocktail Club, and in fact she still works with them part-time. Brochu was a waitress.
They became friends and in the spring began talking about the notion of creating this upscale delivery service. It was partly because they had time on their hands. Brochu had been editing and writing for the website restomontreal.ca and had been laid off because of the pandemic. GiguÃ¨re had gone from full-time to part-time at Barroco for the same reason. The idea was to come up with meals that were tastier than the usual delivery fare, that tasted like they were home-cooked but wouldn't require much work from the folks buying them.
"Take the example of Grumman," Brochu said in a separate phone interview. "They offer kits so you can make your own tacos. So you get all of the toppings that you need to put in the tacos. You'll just have to reheat, say, the meat and the tortillas. But you don't have to for example cut vegetables or anything else that takes a lot of preparation. The chefs have already done all the work for you. So you just need to put it all together and heat it up at home."
And you can mix and match dishes from different restaurants.
"So you can create your own meal using several different restaurants," Brochu said. "You can take a side from one restaurant and the main dish, say a piece of meat, from another one."
They deliver using the refrigerated trucks of Les Marchands, a local company that delivers hand-cut fancy ice to local restaurants and bars. That connection came easy given that Les Marchands is run by GiguÃ¨re and Brochu's common-law partners!
Delivery takes place on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. If you order before Monday at 5, you'll receive your meal Thursday; order before Tuesday at 5 and get it Friday; and before Wednesday at 5 to get it Saturday.

COVID-19 spurs push to clean ventilation systems in Quebec schools and other buildings

Full text: As thousands of children and school employees in Quebec return to their classrooms, questions are being raised about what role the ventilation systems in their schools will play in preventing - or contributing to - the spread of COVID-19.
Concern about the airborne spread of COVID-19, especially in Quebec's aging school buildings, has turned public attention toward the quality of indoor air and spurred a provincewide push to clean ventilation systems.
Those who work in the duct maintenance industry say such cleanings are long overdue.
Managers of government buildings in particular, they say, have tended to postpone ventilation system maintenance, leading to the buildup of harmful residue and reduced air circulation, which could amplify the risk of the virus spreading indoors.
Alain Dubeau, the president of Air-Net, a ventilation-cleaning business, has seen all kinds of moulds and fungi inside Quebec's vents.
"What we find inside, it isn't always pretty," he said. "It's not just dust."
As Quebec society began to emerge from the coronavirus-imposed lockdown, Dubeau and his teams busied themselves cleaning government buildings such as CLSCs and schools.
Ventilation inspections should be performed annually, he said. North American standards suggest duct cleanings should happen every three to five years. But they rarely are.
Building managers delay such cleanings, sometimes for more than a decade, Dubeau said, often because of budgetary constraints. Meanwhile, dust and moisture accumulate in ducts, promoting the growth of moulds and fungi. Sometimes buildup can become so dense that air flow stops. People start getting sick or, in the winter, managers notice their building is cold because the heat is unable to flow through the ducts.
"Then they're going to act," Dubeau said, "and say, 'Oh, maybe we should clean it.' "
Dubeau described a case several years ago in which, upon arriving for an assessment at a hospital, he saw an outcropping of fungus growing near the air intakes that fed intensive-care units and operating rooms.
"That's an example of a building manager who isn't taking care of the maintenance of their ventilation system," he said. "That's just one example among many others."
Neglected or outdated ventilation systems pose health problems.
"If you don't have a proper ventilation system, then people can get really affected" by allergens, dust and other particles, said StÃ©phane Perron, a physician who specializes in public health and preventive medicine.
The air quality inside Quebec's schools has recently become a particular concern. Students are now sitting unmasked near their peers in groups as large as 30. Many classrooms have poor ventilation or windows that don't open.
"If the air is stagnant, that's where the COVID - we're talking about COVID, but it could be anything - it has more chance to proliferate inside," Dubeau said.
Air-Net president Alain Dubeau has seen all kinds of moulds and fungi inside Quebec's vents. "What we find inside, it isn't always pretty," he says. "It's not just dust."
Distancing remains the best way to stay infection-free, Perron said. But keeping apart is difficult inside crowded classrooms and school hallways.
"Ventilation should never replace distancing, which seems to be the most efficient way to prevent disease," he said. "But if you have a proper ventilation system, it's only going to help."
Some aging Quebec schools lack mechanical ventilation systems altogether. In those buildings, opening a window may help.
"If you open the windows, you'll have more air circulation, so that's good," Perron said. "It's not as good as a properly functioning ventilation system, but it's certainly better than keeping the windows closed."
Even schools that have mechanical ventilation systems may not be well equipped. More than half of Quebec's school buildings are in poor condition, according to the government's latest 10-year infrastructure plan. Some of their ventilation systems are outdated or inefficient, and probably very dirty - though that's beginning to change. The education ministry has not yet responded to a Montreal Gazette question asking how often school ventilation systems were cleaned before the pandemic. To prepare for the return to classes, schools have rushed to clean them.
But the role a functioning ventilation system plays in reducing the spread of the virus is not yet clear.
Perron said the scientific community is debating what role aerosolized transmission - the kind of transmission in which someone can contract COVID-19 just by coming into contact with tiny viral particles that linger in the air - plays in the virus's spread. The vast majority of coronavirus transmission happens through the expulsion of larger droplets at closer range, propelled when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes.
The World Health Organization has weighed in.
"Aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out," the organization states. "More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their significance for transmission of COVID-19."
In the meantime, the provincial workplace safety board, CNESST, recommends Quebec schools should "ensure the efficient operation and maintenance of the ventilation systems. Increase the fresh air intake provided by these systems, and in case of natural ventilation, encourage the opening of the windows, if possible."
Though the facts on its indoor spread are not yet entirely clear, the virus has fuelled anxiety over proper ventilation and promoted awareness of good air circulation.
Jacques Scott, president of Air Plus Montreal, an air duct-cleaning company, said he believes COVID-19 has played a role in the recent spike in business. In some cases, fear of the virus has prompted his clients to complete cleanings that were badly needed.
"I've seen businesses that were shut down during the quarantine, and when it's been shut down for a month and you reopen it, there's no danger of COVID being (in the vents) ... because everything would have died by now," he said. "But still, the fact remains that all the gunk that you have in there, it's absolutely necessary to clean that out."
Dubeau said he has noticed a shift in government priorities. Institutions are finally caring about the quality of their indoor air, especially in older buildings where it may have been poor and even unhealthy, with or without the coronavirus.
"I get the impression that COVID started to wake people up to the problem," Dubeau said. "The government is starting to become aware because the buildings are aging - the hospitals and the schools."

Full text: This week's return to school for thousands of young Quebecers is a disaster, QuÃ©bec solidaire charged on Wednesday, with one party MNA describing the operation as "a mess."
On Monday, about 150 scientists and health professionals called on the provincial government to demand that physical distancing and face masks be mandatory in classrooms. They also wanted school ventilation systems to be improved and families be given the option to distance learning for their children should they desire it.
On Wednesday, Quebec solidaire MNA Vincent Marissal, the father of four children, severely criticized Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge's performance, saying the government's indecision on its back-to-school operation is causing parents undue stress because of a lack of information on how it will unfold
Marissal said he received messages from his children's schools on Saturday "that told us they didn't know exactly how (the return) was supposed to work."
"Right now, it's parents - and by extension their children - who are stuck dealing with the government's indecision," he said. "It's very stressful. We had difficult months because of the lockdown ... and now I have two (children) who are to go back tomorrow and the situation is completely up in the air. I don't know what minister Roberge is working on."
Marissal also compared the government's recent recruitment drive for teachers to the last-minute installation of air conditioners in long-term care facilities
"It took a heat wave for somebody to finally wake up," he said. "Enough with the 'don't worry, be happy.' This return to school is a mess.
Marissal said Roberge, knowing full well about the shortage of teachers, should have acted sooner.
Liberal MNA AndrÃ© Fortin was equally blunt: "The government spent all of the summer saying there were issues, that everything would be fine ... We are now seeing a certain worry because it seems that everything was done at the last minute."
Fortin said many of the back-to-school details were "unclear," asking, for example, what medical conditions would allow a student or teacher to be kept from returning to a classroom.
"Today we don't know how many students and teachers will be in class, and that leads to all kinds of problems for the return," he said, adding that he would have liked to have seen an option for distance learning, if only on a temporary basis, for families unsure if they could be exempted from the return.
Fortin also criticized the disorganization of school bus transport in the Quebec City area, noting that such transportation is guaranteed by law.

Young children are less likely to spread virus, analysis shows

Full text: Primary schools and daycare centres have not been major sources of coronavirus transmission, according to an analysis of the international evidence released as two of Canada's largest provinces prepare to unveil their back-toschool plans.
A Canadian review of 33 studies across 16 countries found that young children - particularly those under the age of 10 - are less likely than teenagers and adults to spread coronavirus.
With children, "we don't see these superspreader events that we see in other congregate settings [involving] adults," said Sarah Neil-Sztramko, a researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton and one of the authors of the review. "Even in cases where a symptomatic child has gone into a setting and has had close contact with a number of children ... they don't seem to transmit it to the other kids. We see that fairly consistently across the reports that we found."
When cases of COVID-19 were identified in elementary schools and child-care centres, the virus was most often introduced by and spread among adults, she added.
The new review, released Tuesday, was compiled by the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT), one of six academic collaborating centres set up in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak and funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The NCCMT is the latest organization to try to make sense of the role children play in spreading the coronavirus, a crucial question as provincial governments and school boards refine their policies for September.
British Columbia is scheduled to release its back-to-school plan Wednesday. Ontario is expected to follow suit later in the week.
Even as reassuring reports have trickled in from European countries that reopened their schools in the spring, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, some experts have warned that child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission could be underestimated because many youngsters with COVID-19 have no symptoms and are less likely to be tested.
"Kids in outbreak settings may be the [first] case," said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.
"By definition, if a case is asymptomatic, you don't know what the onset date was."
As well, some school systems abroad might have been spared because there wasn't much COVID-19 circulating in their communities at the time, or because they took precautions such as regularly testing students and staff, and requiring masks and physical distancing.
When it comes to schools and the spread of COVID-19, "most people don't give clear answers because I don't think clear answers exist," said Srinivas Murthy, a pediatric critical care and infectious diseases specialist at BC Children's Hospital.
Dr. Murthy said even British Columbia's safe reopening of schools in June is no guarantee that schools will be safe in September, particularly if the province's case counts continue to tick up, as they have recently.
B.C. had mostly suppressed the virus when it welcomed 200,000 students back for a partial reopening that limited classes to half their usual head count in kindergarten through Grade 5, and 20 per cent of their usual size in Grades 6 through 12.
There were no outbreaks and only two positive cases, in a staff member at one school and in a teacher at another, according to a B.C. Ministry of Health spokesman.
In Quebec, primary schools outside the greater Montreal area opened May 11 and were available to about half of the province's 610,000 K-6 primary school students. Schools in Montreal remained closed.
At the peak on May 31, about 44 students and 34 staff members tested positive for COVID-19, according to data the Education Ministry describes as partial.
While most were individual cases scattered across the province, outbreaks of 12 and seven cases took place in two schools, forcing one school to shut down for several days and another class to be sent home for more than a week. By June 19, six confirmed cases remained among students and nine among staff members, tracking with the drop of cases in Quebec as summer started.
In compiling its evidence review, the NCCMT looked at 33 studies available as of July 20, of which 28 had been completed and five were still in progress. Eight were reports, 13 were peer-reviewed studies and seven were studies published on preprint servers, meaning they had not yet been peer reviewed.
Two of the studies were from Israel, which has recently seen a surge in new COVID-19 infections blamed, in part, on schools reopening.
One of the studies, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, described a major outbreak at a Jerusalem high school identified 10 days after schools fully reopened on May 18.
The outbreak at the Grade 7-to-12 school for nearly 1,200 students saw 153 students and 25 staff members infected.
The school's classes were overcrowded, with 35 to 38 students a room, the study found. Masking requirements had been temporarily dropped and the air-conditioning ran non-stop because of a heat wave.
"What can be taken from that, certainly, is that schools are not immune from these kinds of outbreaks," said Dr. Neil-Sztramko, who is also an assistant professor of health research methods, evidence and impact at McMaster.
"But some of the other public-health measures that we know work - like physical distancing, like hand hygiene, like mask-wearing - should really be considered in these settings, particularly for older kids."

With children, "we don't see these superspreader events that we see in other congregate settings [involving] adults," said Sarah Neil-Sztramko, a researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton and one of the authors of the review. "Even in cases where a symptomatic child has gone into a setting and has had close contact with a number of children â¦ they don't seem to transmit it to the other kids. We see that fairly consistently across the reports that we found."
When cases of COVID-19 were identified in elementary schools and child-care centres, the virus was most often introduced by and spread among adults, she added.
The new review, released Tuesday, was compiled by the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT), one of six academic collaborating centres set up in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak and funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The NCCMT is the latest organization to try to make sense of the role children play in spreading the coronavirus, a crucial question as provincial governments and school boards refine their policies for September.
British Columbia is scheduled to release its back-to-school plan Wednesday. Ontario is expected to follow suit later in the week.
Even as reassuring reports have trickled in from European countries that reopened their schools in the spring, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, some experts have warned that child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission could be underestimated because many youngsters with COVID-19 have no symptoms and are less likely to be tested.
"Kids in outbreak settings may be the [first] case," said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. "By definition, if a case is asymptomatic, you don't know what the onset date was."
As well, some school systems abroad might have been spared because there wasn't much COVID-19 circulating in their communities at the time, or because they took precautions such as regularly testing students and staff, and requiring masks and physical distancing.

When it comes to schools and the spread of COVID-19, "most people don't give clear answers because I don't think clear answers exist," said Srinivas Murthy, a pediatric critical care and infectious diseases specialist at BC Children's Hospital.
Dr. Murthy said even British Columbia's safe reopening of schools in June is no guarantee that schools will be safe in September, particularly if the province's case counts continue to tick up, as they have recently.
B.C. had mostly suppressed the virus when it welcomed 200,000 students back for a partial reopening that limited classes to half their usual head count in kindergarten through Grade 5, and 20 per cent of their usual size in Grades 6 through 12.
There were no outbreaks and only two positive cases, in a staff member at one school and in a teacher at another, according to a B.C. Ministry of Health spokesman.
In Quebec, primary schools outside the greater Montreal area opened May 11 and were available to about half of the province's 610,000 K-6 primary school students. Schools in Montreal remained closed.
At the peak on May 31, about 44 students and 34 staff members tested positive for COVID-19, according to data the Education Ministry describes as partial.
While most were individual cases scattered across the province, outbreaks of 12 and seven cases took place in two schools, forcing one school to shut down for several days and another class to be sent home for more than a week. By June 19, six confirmed cases remained among students and nine among staff members, tracking with the drop of cases in Quebec as summer started.
In compiling its evidence review, the NCCMT looked at 33 studies available as of July 20, of which 28 had been completed and five were still in progress. Eight were reports, 13 were peer-reviewed studies and seven were studies published on preprint servers, meaning they had not yet been peer reviewed.
Two of the studies were from Israel, which has recently seen a surge in new COVID-19 infections blamed, in part, on schools reopening.
One of thestudies, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, described a major outbreak at a Jerusalem high school identified 10 days after schools fully reopened on May 18.
The outbreak at the Grade 7-to-12 school for nearly 1,200 students saw 153 students and 25 staff members infected. The school's classes were overcrowded, with 35 to 38 students per room, the study found. Masking requirements had been temporarily dropped and the air-conditioning ran non-stop because of a heat wave.
"What can be taken from that, certainly, is that schools are not immune from these kinds of outbreaks," said Dr. Neil-Sztramko, who is also an assistant professor of health research methods, evidence and impact at McMaster. "But some of the other public-health measures that we know work - like physical distancing, like hand hygiene, like mask-wearing - should really be considered in these settings, particularly for older kids."

Full text: Roxane Paradis stood in line outside the old HÃ´tel Dieu Hospital for an hour Sunday as the weather shifted back and forth from sweltering heat to downpour.
She went to a pub last week and, after reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in several Montreal-area bars since they reopened earlier this month, Paradis wanted to err on the side of caution.
"My table was still wet from disinfectant and there were wooden dividers between booths, but I work with the public so I want to be safe," said Paradis, a grocery store cashier. "I don't have any symptoms but I want to be sure I don't have coronavirus and pass it on to someone vulnerable."
She was also following the advice of Montreal's public health officials, who recently called on anyone who's been to a bar since July 1 to get tested for COVID-19.
"There are at least five bars in Montreal which have reported cases of COVID-19 among patrons or staff, and we've identified eight people who have been infected," said Dr. David Kaiser, an official with the city's public health department.
"We know there are probably more cases ... and we want to get out in front of this before we find ourselves dealing with a second wave."
Montreal Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante reiterated Kaiser's advice Saturday, tweeting that everyone who has been to a bar since July 1 should get tested.
Though the number of daily cases is a far cry from what it was at the height of the pandemic in April and May, there are nearly 60,000 confirmed cases in Quebec and more than 5,600 deaths attributed to the coronavirus.
Last week, in the MontÃ©rÃ©gie region, a spike in coronavirus cases was attributed to two large house parties and a bar that allowed patrons to break social distancing rules. More than 20 of 60 attendees at a house party tested positive for COVID-19, according to Dr. Julie Loslier, the region's public health director.
Paradis, who wore a mask like just about everyone in line at the testing centre Sunday, said it's regrettable some people aren't respecting public health guidelines. Throughout most of the pandemic, her only contact with her parents was to drop off groceries for them and speak at a distance.
One bar employee who stood in line Sunday said she saw the public notices about testing and wanted to be safe. Her colleagues are doing the same.
"Bar workers are taking the guidelines seriously, it's encouraging," said the woman, who did not want to give her name for fear of drawing negative attention to her place of work. "But some customers would come in and say, 'This is the fourth bar we've been to tonight.'That's not the best idea in the middle of a pandemic."
It will take a few days to determine if a spike in Montreal cases can be linked to the reopening of bars, but Sunday at HÃ´tel Dieu, a queue stretched around the building and into the parking lot. Most of those in line appeared to be in their 20s and 30s.
Anyone who needs to be tested can call 514-644-4545.

We can't let down our virus guard, nor can we afford to remain divided; As we slowly exit from restrictions, drawing distinctions between 'us and them' is unhealthy

Full text: After a long spring of hunkering down at home, Montrealers are eager to deconfine and make the best of a summer like no other.
For many, this will mean staycationing or day-tripping. For others, it will mean venturing to destinations they can reach by car.
But even that limited array of activities is being further curtailed by a number of communities, towns and even provinces rolling up the welcome mat.
Westmount and CÃ´te-St-Luc are barring access to their outdoor municipal pools for outsiders.
The town of Rawdon has closed its popular beaches and waterfalls to all but residents after swarms of urbanites descended on the picturesque LanaudiÃ¨re community during the heat wave.
And Quebecers are still being stymied in their efforts to reach the Ãles de la Madeleine by restrictions on travelling through New Brunswick, forbidding out-of-province residents from sleeping over in motels or eating in restaurants.
The justification for these measures in the case of Westmount and CÃ´te-St-Luc is to give locals priority access to a reduced number of slots for swimming due to social distancing regulations. Still, it smacks of unfairness, given facilities are often paid for by multiple orders of government, and other municipalities - be it Montreal or in the West Island - aren't imposing similar controls.
In the case of Rawdon and New Brunswick, the idea is to keep visitors from transmitting COVID-19 in places where the virus was contained. Again, after everything we've been through in the last 3Â½ months to flatten the curve, this reflex is comprehensible. But it seems out of proportion to the current risk level.
While it's true that Quebec - and particularly Montreal - was the epicentre of the epidemic in Canada, the number of new diagnoses has dwindled even as many businesses and services have reopened. The fear of mass infections - if social distancing norms are followed - has greatly diminished.
When it comes to New Brunswick's rules for Quebecers passing through on the way to les Ãles, the regulations may be doing more harm than good. One Quebec couple were badly injured after hitting a moose as they drove long distances at night to try to reach the ferry leaving from Prince Edward Island in the morning. Others may also be putting their lives at risk spending hours on the roads without rest.
The Maritimes, especially, are giving off a strong "keep out" vibe. While Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador recently struck a deal to create a bubble allowing residents to circulate freely within those provinces, those who "come from away" are subject to varying limitations, such as 14-day quarantines. Even property-owning seasonal residents have had to seek permission to come to their summer homes.
People visiting small towns and more distant communities should be on their best behaviour. Overwhelming a place, crowding on beaches or in parks, leaving litter behind and failing to socially distance is boorish and rude, whether on Mount Royal or at les chutes de Rawdon. Everyone is skittish. Don't give the skeptics a reason to batten down the hatches.
But we have to resist the temptation to be suspicious of each other. COVID-19, in some ways, brought out the worst in us. The need to stay two metres away from others and don masks created anxiety and doubt. It stretched the bonds of social trust and pushed us to retreat from even friends and family. Emerging from that inward-looking mindset has been more difficult than expected.
At one point, Montrealers were pariahs, with authorities musing about shutting off access to the island and Quebecers in the regions worried about urbanites bringing the plague.
Lockdowns made us all insular to varying degrees. But drawing distinctions between us and them, those who belong and those who deserve to be excluded, is not healthy. Taken to its worst extreme, it can lead to more damaging types of antipathy, like xenophobia and scapegoating.
While we can't let our guard down against the virus, we can't let ourselves be divided, either. ahanes@postmedia.com

Death at Montreal Marathon: Coroner slams emergency response

Full text: The city, police and organizers of the Montreal Marathon must better co-ordinate emergency procedures, a Quebec coroner says in a report on the death of 24-year-old runner Patrick Neely.
The young engineer from Beaconsfield, who suffered from congenital heart disease, collapsed less than one kilometre from the finish line during the half-marathon on Sept. 22.
Paramedics arrived at 10:03 a.m., about nine minutes after the first call from a police officer who tended to Neely after he collapsed, coroner Ge?hane Kamel says.
In the seven-page report, Kamel faults organizers of the International Oasis Rock 'n' Roll MontrÃ©al Marathon for lack of communication with the City of Montreal. This resulted in "not having on site the necessary personnel for such a large deployment, nor clear instructions as to the deployment of aid to marathon runners," he wrote.
Urgences-santÃ© should have been able to reach its ambulance without delay, and the patient should have been taken to a hospital specialized in cardiac cases, he added.
Of the 200 employees who were supposed to be posted along the marathon's route, only 60 showed up, Kamel noted. As a result, Montreal police had to deploy more than 200 additional officers.
Neely died of multi-organ failure after suffering cardiac arrest, he reported.
To help prevent future tragedies, the coroner recommended:
Marathon organizers must ensure that the location of defibrillators be known by everyone on duty, including police officers;
Urgences-santÃ© personnel must know the position of its vehicles and paramedics and guarantee the provision of emergency services;
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training must be mandatory for all Montreal police officers;
The provincial health department must instruct ambulance crews to take cardiac patients to a hospital that offers hemodynamic monitoring rather than to the closest hospital;
During sports events, the City of Montreal must ensure that medical and organizational infrastructures comply with proper standards. It must refuse to authorize any event where those standards are not met.
Neely was physically fit, practised several sports and was followed annually at the Montreal Heart Institute, the report says. His medical condition was indicated on his bib, it says.
Kamel retraced the sequence of events, noting that several aspects of the emergency response "certainly compromised his chances of survival."
Police requested support at least three times between 9:52 and 9:56 a.m., he noted.
At 9:51 a.m., a Montreal police officer stationed at the intersection of Cherrier and St-Hubert Sts. saw Neely stagger and rushed to his side. Neely collapsed, had trouble speaking and then lost consciousness.
At 9:52, the officer called her lieutenant at police Station 7. Two minutes later, she requested assistance from Urgences-santÃ©, saying Neely had an irregular pulse. At 9:55, she spoke with Urgences-santÃ© again, saying the case was a priority.
While waiting for the ambulance, the officer performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the patient with a bystander who was a nurse, assisted by another officer and citizen.
At 9:57, Urgences-santÃ© told the officer it had not managed to reach the ambulance, because the paramedics had been assigned to a mobile medical clinic. It took two more minutes to reach them. The ambulance finally got on the road at 10 a.m. Firefighters, alerted by a police officer who ran to the fire station, arrived on the scene at 10:01, followed by the paramedics at 10:03.
The patient was taken by ambulance to Notre-Dame Hospital and later transferred to the Centre hospitalier de l'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al (CHUM), where he was declared dead at 8:11 p.m.
Kamel noted the police officer had CPR training because she had previously worked for another police force where the training was mandatory. He recommended it should be required for all Montreal police officers.
The marathon's director, Dominique PichÃ©, resigned after the race. In addition to being marred by the tragedy, it started almost an hour behind schedule because of a shortage of staff and volunteers to secure the course.

Full text: The city, police and organizers of the Montreal Marathon need to better coordinate emergency procedures, a Quebec coroner says in a report on the death of 24-year-old runner Patrick Neely on Sept. 22.
The engineer from Beaconsfield, who suffered from congenital heart disease, died after collapsing during the half-marathon in the International Oasis Rock 'N' Roll Montreal Marathon.
Paramedics arrived at 10:03 a.m., about nine minutes after a first call from a police officer who tended to Neely after he collapsed on the last kilometre from the finish line, coroner Ge?hane Kamel says.
"We believe that the lack of communication in the organization of the marathon had consequences in terms of concerted planning with the city of Montreal by not having on site the necessary personnel for such a large deployment, nor clear instructions as to the deployment of aid to marathon runners," Kamel wrote in the seven-page report.
Neely died of multi-organ failure after suffering cardiac arrest, he found.
To prevent such a situation from happening again, the coroner recommended that:
Marathon organizers ensure that the location of defibrillators be known to all, including police officers.
Urgences-santÃ© personnel ensure they know the position of its vehicles and paramedics and guarantees its services.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training be mandatory for all Montreal police officers.
The provincial health department issue instructions that cardiac patients be taken to a hospital centre that offers hemodynamic services rather to the closest hospital.
Montreal ensures, during sporting events, that the medical and organizational infrastructures comply with standards and not authorize the event if these standards are not met.

Full text: Coronavirus updates, June 22: For first time since March, Quebec reports no new deaths
Today's coronavirus updates all in one place.
Dining out: Montreal restaurants start carefully reopening
Restaurants in Montreal began opening on Monday, welcoming customers to sit and have a meal for the first time since March. Owners greeted the reopening with a mixture of excitement and fear. Sales have shrunk during the shutdown, buoyed only by takeout orders. Many owners who spoke to the Montreal Gazette on Monday were hopeful patrons would feel comfortable enough to sit in a restaurant despite sanitary measures.
Unbearably hot inside? Go outside - even if you have COVID-19: authorities
People who are quarantined at home with COVID-19 are supposed to stay there, say public health authorities - unless their place is unbearably hot, that is.
Analysis: Legault uses cabinet shuffle to address weakness in health system
In politics, it is known as changing the message by changing the messengers. As illogical as it seems to dump your seasoned health minister during a pandemic at the risk of disappointing the very devoted incumbent - which is exactly what has happened - Premier FranÃ§ois Legault on Monday showed how far he is willing to go to get his second wind for the difficult fall ahead.
Good Samaritans bringing cool comfort to Montreal seniors
Betty Esperanza took the first phone call at 8:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Over the next 12 hours, she processed 43 requests for air conditioners from vulnerable seniors who were sweltering during the second heat wave to hit Montreal in more than a month.
What's open and closed on the FÃªte Nationale on June 24
Here's a partial list of what will be open and closed in Montreal during the FÃªte Nationale on Wednesday, June 24.
Brownstein: Another city landmark, Tony Shoes, closes shop
No sooner did Tony Fargnoli open his shop Monday morning, he noticed his voice mail was overloaded. Upon checking his computer, he was stunned to learn a message he left on Facebook Sunday already had over 35,000 shares. The message was a brief mention that after 83 years, Tony Shoes on Greene Ave. was closing. The voicemails were from longtime customers, devastated by the news.
Montreal says it will review procedures on land repossessions
The administration of Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante says it's touched by the plight of elderly property owners who had their land taken by the city without their knowledge three years ago and is promising to review the city's procedures and the recourse available to citizens to prevent a repeat in the future.

4:10 p.m. Despite loosened rules, Montreal West says it won't open day camps
Montreal West is joining Kirkland in announcing it will not open day camps this summer, despite the provincial government's decision to loosen counsellor-camper ratios.
"While... ratios can help private camps economically, it does nothing to assuage our concerns about running a day camp during this pandemic," Elizabeth Ulin, the town councillor in charge of recreation, wrote in an email to residents today.
"In fact, increasing the ratios (i.e. allowing more campers per councillor) would likely make it less safe for the campers, their families, our staff, and the wider community.
"So many of the government's day camp directives run counter to providing a healthy and enjoyable experience that we could not see a way to offer any safe and sensible activities. For instance, campers would have to remain two metres apart at all times (negating nearly all traditional camp games).
"Our available indoor locations are not air-conditioned, yet on rainy days, campers would be required to remain at the same location for the entire day, regardless of the heat. All areas used by the camp (many of our parks and playgrounds) would have to be fenced off and made inaccessible to the general public. Most alarming, treatment of any injury would be delayed by the wait time for a properly protected individual to assist."
3:40 p.m. Uneven playing field for shut-out bar owners could lead to defiance
Ziggy Eichenbaum won't be silenced. Nor will there be any silence at his namesake Crescent St. pub if Quebec doesn't change its stance on bars reopening.
Eichenbaum will open Ziggy's on July 1, and face the legal consequences if necessary. He's not the only one.

"I've got to survive, too. I'm giving the government notice that I'm opening July 1. If I don't open then, I'll have to close for good," Ziggy Eichenbaum says of his namesake Crescent St. pub.
3 p.m. Unable to agree on Liberal aid bill, House of Commons adjourns until next week
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - Opposition parties have refused to give unanimous consent to speedily pass the Trudeau government's latest emergency legislation.
They have also rejected the government's bid to split the bill in two, to allow promised benefits for Canadians with disabilities to go ahead.
Those benefits are now in limbo, along with other measures in the bill.
The bill includes a proposed expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses, as well as proposed penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
It also proposes changes to the CERB in response to concerns that the benefit is discouraging people from returning to low-paying jobs.
Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the Liberals will attempt to find other ways to deliver on those promises.
That's just crazy. Bickering between government and opposition meant they can't even agree to debate a bill to help those with disabilities and crack down on coronavirus assistance cheats. So debate delayed until next week. Good grief.

2:35 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:40 p.m. Soldiers will remain at CHSLDs until September, Ottawa says
Canadian Armed Forces personnel will keep working at CHSLDs (long-term care homes) until September, federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said today.
"We have made a commitment to the province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as requested," Blair told the House of Commons.
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault has asked for the members of the Canadian military who are helping in CHSLDs to remain in the province until mid-September.
Last month, National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested the Canadian Armed Forces would not be able to deploy for that long.
At a press conference earlier, federal Treasury Board president Jean-Yves Duclos said the defence minister's statement referred to the pace - at the time, some soldiers were working 12-hour days, seven days a week.
"We never considered abandoning Quebec seniors," Duclos said. "The Canadian Armed Forces will continue to be present as long as they are needed in Quebec or elsewhere in the country."
Asked how many would remain in Quebec, he did not answer directly.
"The situation has much improved in recent weeks because of the (soldiers' work)," he said. "And the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to be there as long as their presence is necessary."
As of yesterday, there are 933 Armed Forces personnel supporting civilian authorities in 14 CHSLDs.
Last month, they numbered more than 1,000.
Some soldiers will soon arrive at the Donald Berman Maimonides Geriatric Centre in CÃ´te-St-Luc to help overwhelmed staff.
1:10 p.m. Quebecers want economic relaunch to be green: survey
Four out of five Quebecers want the province's economic recovery to be environmentally friendly, a new survey suggests.
The findings of the LÃ©ger Marketing poll commissioned by several environmental groups are being published just as debate rages in the National Assembly over Bill 61 - proposed legislation that would give the government extensive powers to accelerate economic activity, particularly in the area of infrastructure construction.

11:45 a.m. Extending CERB could double $60-billion budget: federal watchdog
The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) gives financial support to Canadians affected by COVID-19, providing $500 a week for up to 16 weeks. The program is scheduled to end in September.
The New Democratic Party and the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois are calling for it to be extended.
Today, Parliament's spending watchdog said extending the CERB to provide more weeks of payments, and letting people earn some extra income, would cost the federal treasury an additional $64 billion.

9:55 a.m. Let students have graduation ceremonies: Canadian pediatricians
Canadian pediatricians are calling on education ministers to allow "safe, in-person graduations."
"Transitions are frequently points of vulnerability," said Dr. Daphne Korczak, chair of the Canadian Paediatric Society's Mental Health Task Force.
"It will be challenging for kids to look forward to September if they aren't ready to make the move, if a part of them still feels they never really left their old school because of the abrupt end."
Quebec's education minister says graduation ceremonies are allowed but some of the province's schools have opted not to bring students together one last time.
As the school year ends, students transitioning into new schools or learning settings are being left behind with no closure and little support. We're calling on Education Ministries to allow safe, in-person graduations : #CanPoli #ChildHealth

9:35 a.m. Province cuts school tax to give Quebecers a break
To give Quebecers a financial break during the pandemic, the provincial government is cutting the school tax rate earlier than expected.
In its March budget, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault's government reduced the school tax rate, with another cut planned for 2021. The first reduction was to slash school taxes by $182 million, the second one by $173 million.
Now, both reductions will be implemented as of July 1, Finance Minister Eric Girard announced this morning.
Girard called the move "an effective way to give Quebecers financial flexibility when they need it the most."
"It should be noted that the reduction of the school tax rate has no impact on funding for the education network," he said.
School taxes are based on property valuations. The new rate will be $0.1054 per $100 of property assessment.
9:20 a.m. Quebec won't investigate possible price-gouging during pandemic

4:10 p.m. Despite loosened rules, Montreal West says it won't open day camps
Montreal West is joining Kirkland in announcing it will not open day camps this summer, despite the provincial government's decision to loosen counsellor-camper ratios.
"While... ratios can help private camps economically, it does nothing to assuage our concerns about running a day camp during this pandemic," Elizabeth Ulin, the town councillor in charge of recreation, wrote in an email to residents today.
"In fact, increasing the ratios (i.e. allowing more campers per councillor) would likely make it less safe for the campers, their families, our staff, and the wider community.
"So many of the government's day camp directives run counter to providing a healthy and enjoyable experience that we could not see a way to offer any safe and sensible activities. For instance, campers would have to remain two metres apart at all times (negating nearly all traditional camp games).
"Our available indoor locations are not air-conditioned, yet on rainy days, campers would be required to remain at the same location for the entire day, regardless of the heat. All areas used by the camp (many of our parks and playgrounds) would have to be fenced off and made inaccessible to the general public. Most alarming, treatment of any injury would be delayed by the wait time for a properly protected individual to assist."
3:40 p.m. Uneven playing field for shut-out bar owners could lead to defiance
Ziggy Eichenbaum won't be silenced. Nor will there be any silence at his namesake Crescent St. pub if Quebec doesn't change its stance on bars reopening.
Eichenbaum will open Ziggy's on July 1, and face the legal consequences if necessary. He's not the only one.

"I've got to survive, too. I'm giving the government notice that I'm opening July 1. If I don't open then, I'll have to close for good," Ziggy Eichenbaum says of his namesake Crescent St. pub.
3 p.m. Unable to agree on Liberal aid bill, House of Commons adjourns until next week
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - Opposition parties have refused to give unanimous consent to speedily pass the Trudeau government's latest emergency legislation.
They have also rejected the government's bid to split the bill in two, to allow promised benefits for Canadians with disabilities to go ahead.
Those benefits are now in limbo, along with other measures in the bill.
The bill includes a proposed expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses, as well as proposed penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.
It also proposes changes to the CERB in response to concerns that the benefit is discouraging people from returning to low-paying jobs.
Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the Liberals will attempt to find other ways to deliver on those promises.
That's just crazy. Bickering between government and opposition meant they can't even agree to debate a bill to help those with disabilities and crack down on coronavirus assistance cheats. So debate delayed until next week. Good grief.

2:35 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:40 p.m. Soldiers will remain at CHSLDs until September, Ottawa says
Canadian Armed Forces personnel will keep working at CHSLDs (long-term care homes) until the middle of September, federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said today.
"We have made a commitment to the province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as requested," Blair told the House of Commons.
Premier FranÃ§ois Legault has asked for the members of the Canadian military who are helping in CHSLDs to remain in the province until mid-September.
Last month, National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested the Canadian Armed Forces would not be able to deploy for that long.
At a press conference earlier, federal Treasury Board president Jean-Yves Duclos said the defence minister's statement referred to the pace - at the time, some soldiers were working 12-hour days, seven days a week.
"We never considered abandoning Quebec seniors," Duclos said. "The Canadian Armed Forces will continue to be present as long as they are needed in Quebec or elsewhere in the country."
Asked how many would remain in Quebec, he did not answer directly.
"The situation has much improved in recent weeks because of the (soldiers' work)," he said. "And the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to be there as long as their presence is necessary."
As of yesterday, there are 933 Armed Forces personnel supporting civilian authorities in 14 CHSLDs.
Last month, they numbered more than 1,000.
Some soldiers will soon arrive at the Donald Berman Maimonides Geriatric Centre in CÃ´te-St-Luc to help overwhelmed staff.
1:10 p.m. Quebecers want economic relaunch to be green: survey
Four out of five Quebecers want the province's economic recovery to be environmentally friendly, a new survey suggests.
The findings of the LÃ©ger Marketing poll commissioned by several environmental groups are being published just as debate rages in the National Assembly over Bill 61 - proposed legislation that would give the government extensive powers to accelerate economic activity, particularly in the area of infrastructure construction.

The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) gives financial support to Canadians affected by COVID-19, providing $500 a week for up to 16 weeks. The program is scheduled to end in September.
The New Democratic Party and the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois are calling for it to be extended.
Today, Parliament's spending watchdog said extending the CERB to provide more weeks of payments, and letting people earn some extra income, would cost the federal treasury an additional $64 billion.

9:55 a.m. Let students have graduation ceremonies: Canadian pediatricians
Canadian pediatricians are calling on education ministers to allow "safe, in-person graduations."
"Transitions are frequently points of vulnerability," said Dr. Daphne Korczak, chair of the Canadian Paediatric Society's Mental Health Task Force.
"It will be challenging for kids to look forward to September if they aren't ready to make the move, if a part of them still feels they never really left their old school because of the abrupt end."
Quebec's education minister says graduation ceremonies are allowed but some of the province's schools have opted not to bring students together one last time.
As the school year ends, students transitioning into new schools or learning settings are being left behind with no closure and little support. We're calling on Education Ministries to allow safe, in-person graduations : #CanPoli #ChildHealth

9:35 a.m. Province cuts school tax to give Quebecers a break
To give Quebecers a financial break during the pandemic, the provincial government is cutting the school tax rate earlier than expected.
In its March budget, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault's government reduced the school tax rate, with another cut planned for 2021. The first reduction was to slash school taxes by $182 million, the second one by $173 million.
Now, both reductions will be implemented as of July 1, Finance Minister Eric Girard announced this morning.
Girard called the move "an effective way to give Quebecers financial flexibility when they need it the most."
"It should be noted that the reduction of the school tax rate has no impact on funding for the education network," he said.
School taxes are based on property valuations. The new rate will be $0.1054 per $100 of property assessment.

Relax rules for children, doctors demand

Full text: More than 1,000 Quebec physicians have signed a petition demanding Quebec Premier FranÃ§ois Legault relax some of the more "preposterous" rules for COVID-19 prevention for children at schools, daycares and day camps, as they may do more harm than good.
Thirteen physicians from across the province specializing in children's health posted an open letter to the premier online on Saturday, and within 24 hours it garnered support from about 1,000 other physicians and 1,500 other professionals in health care, as well as teachers, daycare educators, and others who work with children and teens.
The letter notes that many recent studies have demonstrated that children are unlikely to catch the virus or to suffer serious health effects if they do, and transmission of the virus from children to adults is rare.
The physicians argue these findings demand an urgent reassessment of the extreme precautions that have been put in place for children at schools outside Montreal and as day camps and daycares are set to reopen in this region.
"The healthy development of children involves fostering relationships, playing with other children, bonding with educators, etc.
"We are very concerned these measures will have a negative impact on the physical and mental health of children and adolescents," Dr. Suzanne Vaillancourt, associate director of pediatric emergency medicine at the Montreal Children's Hospital, and one of the lead authors of the open letter, told the Montreal Gazette on Sunday.
The physicians acknowledge it was necessary to close schools and daycares and shut down sports activities at the beginning of the pandemic, but given more recent scientific findings, they say some of the more extreme measures should now be reassessed.
"The preventive measures that the MinistÃ¨re de la Famille and the MinistÃ¨re de l'Ãducation are requiring to be implemented seem preposterous to many experts, as well as parents, childcare providers, teachers and administrators," the letter says.
While the letter acknowledges there have been cases of COVID-19 among children in a daycare setting and in some schools outside Montreal since they reopened, they argue these outbreaks have been minor and manageable.
Among the measures the doctors consider unnecessary and harmful: - Schools drawing squares on asphalt in the school yards, where young children are expected to remain, alone, during recess, - Daycare providers spending time policing a two-metre separation between toddlers, while cloaked in a mask and visor, - Day-camp counsellors being instructed not to help children apply sunscreen or fill their water bottles, even during heat wave, - Daycares banning books, puzzles, crayons, dolls and balls over concerns these items cannot be easily disinfected.
The physicians are demanding:
the two-metre distancing rule not apply to children under 12, - children under 12 not be required to wear face coverings, - adults caring for or teaching children wear transparent masks and protective eyewear, rather than visors, so that children can see them smile and see their lips when they talk, - all individual and group sports activities for children and adolescents resume as soon as possible, - the use and sharing of educational materials and toys be permitted without the need for disinfection between each use.
Vaillancourt said she has seen an increase in the number of children and adolescents with depression and anxiety coming into her emergency ward since the isolation measures began, and that colleagues in psychiatry are confirming these issues. Many children do not have access to computers, so they have been completely cut off from their peers, she said. Sports activities are central to the mental and physical health of many children, and so day camps that promise kids will be kept two metres away from other children are simply not feasible or desirable, she said.
"We need to remember that the risk will never be zero," Vaillancourt said.
She said it is easy for public health authorities to show graphs of COVID cases, but it is much harder to graph the short-and long-term negative effects on the physical, mental and emotional development of children of some of these prevention measures. mlalonde@postmedia.com

City pushes back property tax deadline; Homeowners, businesses will have until September to pay instalment

Full text: Montrealers have an extra three months to pay the second instalment of their property taxes, the city announced Wednesday.
The deadline has been pushed back to September to allow homeowners and businesses time to deal with the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, executive-committee chairman BenoÃ®t Dorais said during the weekly executive committee meeting.
In March, the city had postponed the deadline for the second property tax payment to July 2. Now owners are getting an additional two months.
As recently as last week's council meeting, the city administration had rebuffed a motion by the municipal opposition demanding that the second instalment of property taxes be postponed till Sept. 1, saying it couldn't afford the measure.
"It's one of the quickest U-turns I've ever seen in my political life," said St-Laurent mayor Alan De-Sousa, who proposed the motion.
Dorais said Wednesday that the city was acting on a report on Montreal's economy by an expert panel, unveiled Tuesday by Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante, which recommended postponing the tax deadline.
"It's good news for owners but it's also good news for small businesses," he said.
"We really turned over every stone to ensure that we could make this additional effort," said Dorais, noting that the pandemic has hit Montreal's economy hard, with one in five Quebecers out of work.
The measure represents a $2-billion shortfall for the city for three months, he said.
The report also called on the Quebec government to allow Montreal to run a deficit in its operating budget this year, given the economic carnage caused by the pandemic.
Also during Wednesday's executive committee meeting, Plante announced that public pools would open this summer, with new, more stringent rules to prevent the virus's spread.
"The pools will open gradually.
This requires preparation and a whole new set of logistics and in due time we will be able to share with you what it will be like to use public swimming pools in Montreal during the pandemic," she said.
Playgrounds in parks have also reopened, said Plante, who urged Montrealers who use recreational facilities to be vigilant in respecting health guidelines like keeping a two-metre distance, handwashing, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitizer with them.
On Saturday, Quebec Health Minster Danielle McCann gave municipalities the go-ahead to open public pools during the summer, provided people maintain physical distancing of two metres and wash their hands before entering the facilities.
Last week, Montreal opened splash pads in parks to help deal with the heat wave and give families a chance to cool off while they cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Two weeks ago, the city announced the reopening of dog parks, tennis courts, Ãle Notre-Dame and Jean-Drapeau Park, although the parking lots at Jean-Drapeau, La Fontaine, Maisonneuve, Jarry, FrÃ©dÃ©ric-Back, and le Ãle-de-la-Visitation parks remained closed. mscott@postmedia.com

The report also called on the Quebec government to allow Montreal to run a deficit in its operating budget this year, given the economic carnage caused by the pandemic.
Also during Wednesday's executive committee meeting, Plante announced that public pools would open this summer, with new, more stringent rules to prevent the virus's spread.
"The pools will open gradually. This requires preparation and a whole new set of logistics and in due time we will be able to share with you what it will be like to use public swimming pools in Montreal during the pandemic," she said.
Playgrounds in parks have also reopened, said Plante, who urged Montrealers who use recreational facilities to be vigilant in respecting health guidelines like keeping a two-metre distance, hand-washing, wearing masks and carrying hand sanitizer with them.
On Saturday, Quebec Health Minster Danielle McCann gave municipalities the go-ahead to open public pools during the summer, provided people maintain physical distancing of two metres and wash their hands before entering the facilities.
Last week, Montreal opened splash pads in parks to help deal with the heat wave and give families a chance to cool off while they cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Two weeks ago, the city announced the reopening of dog parks, tennis courts, Ãle Notre-Dame and Jean-Drapeau Park, although the parking lots at Jean-Drapeau, La Fontaine, Maisonneuve, Jarry, FrÃ©dÃ©ric-Back and le Ãle-de-la-Visitation parks remained closed.

Full text: Montrealers have an extra three months to pay the second instalment of their property taxes, the city announced Wednesday.
The deadline has been pushed back to September to allow homeowners and businesses to deal with the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, executive-committee chairman BenoÃ®t Dorais said during the weekly executive committee meeting.
In March, the city had postponed the deadline for the second property tax payment to July 2 Now owners are getting an additional two months.
As recently as last week's council meeting, the city administration had rebuffed a motion by the municipal opposition demanding that the second instalment of property taxes be postponed till Sept. 1, saying it couldn't afford the measure.
"It's one of the quickest U-turns I've ever seen in my political life," said St-Laurent mayor Alan DeSousa, who proposed the motion.
Dorais said Wednesday that the city was acting on a report on Montreal's economy by an expert panel, unveiled Tuesday by Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante, which recommended postponing the tax deadline.
"It's good news for owners but it's also good news for small businesses," he said.
"We really turned over every stone to ensure that we could make this additional effort," said Dorais, noting that the pandemic has hit Montreal's economy hard, with one in five Quebecers out of work.
The measure represents a $2-billion shortfall for the city for three months, he said.

Applications to work in CHSLDs skyrocket after appeal by Premier Legault

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/applications-work-chslds-skyrocket-after-appeal/docview/2409107160/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: QUEBEC - One day up and running, and already 42,000 applications.
The Legault government's call for 10,000 Quebecers to sign up for paid training to become orderlies and assistants in CHSLDs took off like a rocket Tuesday.
With Quebec's 17 per cent unemployment rate, sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands pounced on a new government website simply tagged "Becoming a CHSLD orderly."
In fact, the website crashed almost immediately, before being rebooted so it could start receiving applications again. By about 7 p.m., thousands had visited the site and 42,000 filled out the application form.
"I need 10,000 people of goodwill to take on this noble task," Premier FranÃ§ois Legault said at his pandemic news conference Tuesday, kicking off the stampede.
"I'm asking all Quebecers from the bottom of my heart: If you're ready to mobilize your strength, your energy, your humanity, if you want to make a real difference in the lives of our elderly, please join us."
It's unclear how many applicants will actually get into the courses and eventually be hired, but a desperate government is taking the first step to prepare for a potential second wave of COVID-19 and the departure of hundreds of soldiers currently doing some of the heavy lifting in CHSLDs.
The three-month training course pays $760 a week. People who pass and get hired will be paid $49,000 a year plus benefits.
The courses lead to what is called an attestation d'Ã©tudes professionnelles (AEP), which means students will get all the basics in care, including training in preventing infections, proper hygiene and dealing with the particular needs of senior citizens.
Normally it takes 870 hours of training to get the certificate, but given the emergency the course is being condensed into 375 hours, which includes classroom time and time in the field.
On hand for Tuesday's announcement, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge said regional health authorities will co-ordinate the programs with regional professional training schools - francophone and anglophone, depending on the clients.
"So sign up," Roberge said. "We don't want 5,000, we don't want 8,000 - we will have places for 10,000 students."
Legault said he will be proud if he turns out to be the premier who solves the chronic labour problems in the network that his predecessors failed to correct.
To that end, the premier said he's ready to take the heat from unions that might complain Quebec is creating two categories of workers because in the long run orderlies will be paid more than other health-care workers.
"I am assuming my part of the responsibility (for the situation)," Legault said. "Today it's me who is premier, it's me who is looking for a solution once and for all.
"I am ready to accept the criticism from people who say we are paying our people in CHSLDs too well to take care of our most vulnerable seniors," he added. "If, by the end of my mandate, I had just settled the CHSLD situation, I would be happy."
The program is not designed specifically for the hundreds of asylum seekers already on Quebec soil. Legault said the program is for citizens here now.
Roberge said the course is not designed to include French-language training, but the government is willing to look into that if it means more anglophones can get jobs and help the network.
Legault made his appeal after health officials revealed Quebec has experienced 52 more deaths, for a total of 4,713. Another 239 cases were added Tuesday, for a total of 51,593. The total number of hospitalizations is 1,175, a drop of 10 from the day before.
Roberge downplayed news about an outbreak of 12 COVID-19 cases in two Trois-RiviÃ¨res schools in the Chemin-du-Roy school board.
He said some cases were bound to emerge, given that almost half of the province's elementary schools are now open. He added that Quebec health officials rapidly stepped in, limiting the cases to a small group. That means there is no need to shut down the entire school, which has now been disinfected.
"I think that it proves that we did follow the rules and we are able to contain these cases in one class, one group," Roberge said.

Legault made his appeal after health officials revealed Quebec has experienced 52 more deaths, for a total of 4,713. Another 239 cases were added Tuesday, for a total of 51,593. The total number of hospitalizations is 1,175, a drop of 10 from the day before.

He said some cases were bound to emerge, given that almost half of the province's elementary schools are now open.

Full text: QUEBEC - One day up and running and already 42,000 applications.
The Legault government's call for 10,000 Quebecers to sign up for paid training to become orderlies and assistants in CHSLDs took off like a rocket Tuesday.
With Quebec's 17 per cent unemployment rate sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands pounced on a new government website simply tagged "Becoming an orderly in a CHSLD."
In fact, the website crashed almost immediately before being rebooted so it could start receiving applications again. By about 7 p.m., thousands had visited the site and 42,000 filled out the application form.
"I need 10,000 people of good will to take on this noble task," Legault said at his pandemic news conference kicking off the stampede.
"I'm asking all Quebecers from the bottom of my heart if you're ready to mobilize your strength, your energy, your humanity, if you want to make a real difference in the lives of our elderly, please join us."
It's unclear how many applicants will actually get into the courses and eventually be hired, but a desperate government is taking a first step to prepare for a potential second wave of the coronavirus and the departure of hundreds of soldiers currently doing some of the heavy-lifting.
The three-month training course course pays $760 a week. People who pass and get hired will be paid $49,000 a year plus benefits.
The courses lead to what is called an attestation d'Ã©tudes professionnelles (AEP), which means students will get all the basics in care, including training in preventing infections, proper hygiene and in dealing with the particular needs of senior citizens.
Normally it takes 870 hours in training to get the certificate, but given the emergency the course is being condensed into 375 hours, which includes classroom time and time in the field.
On hand for the announcement, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge said regional health authorities will coordinate the programs with regional professional training schools, francophone and anglophone, depending on the clients.
"So sign up," Roberge said. "We don't want 5,000, we don't want 8,000, we will have place for 10,000 students."
Legault said he will be proud if he turns out to be the premier who solves the chronic labour problems in the network that his predecessors failed to correct.
To that end, the premier said he's ready to take the heat from unions that might complain Quebec is creating two categories of workers because in the long run orderlies will be paid more than other health-care workers.
"I am assuming my part of the responsibility (for the situation)," Legault said. "Today it's me who is premier, it's me who is looking for a solution once and for all.
"I am ready to accept the criticism from people who say we are paying our people in CHSLD too well to take care of our most vulnerable seniors," he added. "If, by the end of my mandate, I had just settled the CHSLD situation I would be happy."
The program, however, is not designed specifically for the hundreds of asylum seekers already on Quebec soil. Legault said the program is for citizens here now.
Roberge said the course is not currently designed to include French language training, but the government is willing to look into that if it means more anglophones can get jobs and help the network.
Legault made his appeal after health officials revealed Quebec has experienced 52 more deaths for a total of 4,713. Another 239 cases were added for a total of 51,593. The total number of persons hospitalized is 1,175, a drop of 10 from the day before.

Full text: QUEBEC - Describing the situation as embarrassing, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault Tuesday made a passionate plea for Quebecers to come forward and be trained as CHSLD orderlies before a potential second wave of COVID-19 hits.
"I need 10,000 people of good will to take on this noble task," Legault said at his pandemic news conference. "Our goal is to mobilize 10,000 people to take care of our most vulnerable.
"I am asking all Quebecers from the bottom of my heart."
Promised last week, Legault said Quebec will open training courses for workers, which will run from June 15 to Sept. 15.
They will soon be able to sign up on this website
"There's no guarantee we'll make it but we have to work, all together, to succeed."
Legault said he's also ready to take the heat from unions that might complain Quebec is creating two categories of workers. Under the program, workers will be paid $21 an hour during training. If they succeed they will make $26 an hour to earn about $49,000 a year.
He said while 2020 may be known for the tragic death of thousands of seniors he hopes it will also be known as the year Quebec finally fixed the problem in CHSLDs.
On hand for the announcement, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge said the program will include classroom training but also practical training in the worksite.

Montreal startup Vention raises $38-million in venture capital: The financing is believed to value Vention at more than US$150-million

Full text: Vention Inc., a rapidly growing Montreal startup that is helping industrial manufacturers speed up the pace of factory automation, has raised $38-million in venture capital led by Georgian Partners.
The four-year-old company, co-founded by chief executive Etienne Lacroix, a former General Electric Co. product manager and McKinsey consultant, is a unique vertically integrated company: a combination of a parts supplier, hardware designer, e-commerce firm and a provider of free 3D design software.
Its customers - engineers at more than 1,000 factories owned by companies including BMW, GE, Tesla, Siemens, Bombardier and Universal Robots - create, design and order custom equipment used in their production lines, including test benches, robot work stations, assembly lines and heat exchangers. They buy and receive the materials from Vention, complete with assembly instructions and within days, saving months off the typical process.
Vention has an inventory of about 600 unique parts as well as more than 1,100 ready-made product designs - many contributed by customers - that buyers can customize. It is also increasingly adding outside parts suppliers to its platform, providing a new sales channel while allowing Vention to offer increasingly complex products, Mr. Lacroix said.
"The fact that they've taken this process that can take months and turned it into something that is self-serve is truly disruptive," said Ajay Agarwal, a partner with Bain Capital, which led the company's previous, $17-million venture-capital round in early 2019 and is backing the latest financing, again alongside seed investor White Star Capital.
The financing is believed to value Vention at more than US$150-million, according a source that The Globe and Mail is not identifying because they were not authorized to disclose the information.
Vention has made quick strides, increasing revenue last year by nearly 400 per cent after expanding by 570 per cent in 2018, Mr. Lacroix said. The pandemic will slow the expansion of sales, believed to be running at a rate of more than US$10-million, this year, but they should at least double, Mr. Lacroix said.
"If we just become a unicorn [a venture capital-backed valued at US$1-billion] it would be a bit of a failure on our part," given the US$100-billion-plus size of the estimated market size and the company's potential, Mr. Lacroix said.
Investors describe Mr. Lacroix as a driven entrepreneur who has consistently delivered. "Etienne had an incredibly clear vision of what Vention was going to do," Georgian partner Emily Walsh said. "It has been executing on that vision since day one."
Mr. Agarwal said Vention's main challenge is to build awareness. "The reality is 99 per cent of the market has never heard of them."
Vention is one of a slew of Canadian startups that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars combined in outside capital in recent years to bring technological innovations to factory operations, including Waterloo's Clearpath Robotics Inc. and ATTAbotics Inc. of Calgary. They are helping to increasingly automate factories, reduce costs and increase operational agility so companies can more quickly adapt to market changes.
But they are also contributing to growing concerns about disappearing jobs as machines increasingly take over work done by humans. The pandemic's disruptive impact on the economy will likely hasten that, Ms. Walsh said. "The current climate will push even more factories to look for the least human labour involved in these processes," she said. Vention "fits into this next wave of how factories will operate, how parts suppliers are going to need to sell."
Sam Schmitz, a manufacturing engineer with 3D printer maker Formlabs Inc. near Boston, said the combination of materials costs and staff time savings make Vention a much cheaper alternative than the typical process of plant planners designing and building their own pieces from scratch or bringing in systems-integration providers - typically regional automation experts - to do the job.
"Vention is definitely disrupting this industry," Mr. Schmitz said, adding he had placed dozens of orders for custom pieces to help test and build printers, spending more than US$10,000 in total. "It's essentially challenging the model of the entire ecosystem."

Full text: When and how a cool dip in a public pool will be possible this summer remains to be seen.
Quebec has yet to announce when its ongoing relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions will allow for the opening of public pools and with what regulations in place.
Jewish General Hospital medical microbiologist Dr. Leighanne Parkes told the Montreal Gazette the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 while swimming in a pool is very low because infectious droplets would be immediately be diluted. However, distancing must be maintained to avoid ending up within someone's spit radius.
A number of municipalities are waiting for public health details and government directives before making a decision.
The city of Montreal said all swimming pools and wading pools are closed until it receives new government directives, although many of the city's splash pads opened in time for this week's heat wave.
In the West Island, Kirkland announced that "constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic" resulted in its decision to not open Ecclestone Pool this summer.
Senneville has gone in another direction. Mayor Julie Brisebois said that the pool is being prepared for an eventual opening. COVID-19 safety measures will include limiting the number of people in the pool so that distancing measures can be enforced and residents will reserve a time slot to use the pool. All aquatic classes are cancelled.
Earlier this month, the Association of Lakeshore Pools announced that all aquatic competitions will be cancelled because of the pandemic. ALPS has 22 member pools in the West Island, LaSalle, Hudson and Pincourt.
Pointe-Claire has not made a decision about opening either its splash pad or its pools.
Dollard-des-Ormeaux Mayor Alex Bottausci said the opening of its splash pads and pools remains under review.
Dorval's splash pad at Walters Park is open, but the city is waiting for word from the government and public health before moving forward with opening its pools and aquatic and sports facility.
Beaconsfield director general Patrice Boileau said the city had heard that pool capacity could be reduced up to 70 per cent, which would make it financially difficult for Beaconsfield's four community pools to operate. He said that once the rules are clear, the various pool boards would meet to discuss options and then meet with the city.
The CRLO-WLRC pool in Lachine is waiting for the government green light and a decision by borough council on financial aid before making a decision. Dixie Pool in western Lachine said it has not made a decision on whether to open the pool, but it would follow all COVID-19 restrictions.
Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa said the plan is to open the pool, but the town is still studying how it can be done safely.
The Baie-D'UrfÃ© Aquatic Club is waiting for the government announcement. Like other pools in the West Island, it has sent a survey to members asking about their concerns and whether they would use the pool if it opens this season.

Full text: Across the island of Montreal, the rate of new COVID-19 infection in the community - outside of closed facilities such as hospitals and seniors' homes - fell by 13 per cent over the past week, according to data released by Montreal public health Wednesday.
Once a week, Montreal's public health authority releases the numbers related to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past seven days and breaks them down, reporting statistics for each of the 25 communities on the island. But this is the first time public health has released numbers tracking new cases that exclude those in closed facilities, such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, private seniors' residences, rehabilitation centres, prisons and shelters.
Over the week of May 19 to 25, there were 1,505 new cases confirmed outside closed facilities across the island, a decline of 13 per cent in the detected rate of community infection over the previous week. That is an infection rate in the wider community of 72.86 per 100,000.
Including cases in closed facilities, the island of Montreal had 24,611 confirmed positive cases as of Wednesday, an increase of 223 overnight and of 2,294 since May 19.
A total of 2,624 people on the island have died of the disease since the beginning of the pandemic.
Eight of the island's 25 boroughs or municipalities saw their community infection rate increase, while the rest decreased. The following boroughs or municipalities saw an increase outside of closed facilities:
Villeray-St-Michel-Parc-Extension: 185 new cases, a 20 per cent increase over the previous week, resulting in a community infection rate of 128.6 cases per 100,000 population.
Ahuntsic-Cartierville: 128 new cases, four per cent increase, rate of 95.35
St-Laurent: 93 new cases, eight per cent increase, rate of 94.1
LaSalle: 50 new cases, four per cent increase, rate of 65.06
Lachine: 28 new cases, four per cent increase, rate of 62.94
Dollard-des-Ormeaux: 22 new cases, 29 per cent increase, rate of 44.99
Pointe-Claire: 19 new cases, 19 per cent increase, rate of 60.55
CÃ´te-St-Luc: 15 new cases, 67 per cent increase, rate of 46.23
The cases and deaths continue to be concentrated in long-term care facilities and private seniors' homes. As of Wednesday, 170 such facilities on the island were reporting at least one confirmed case of COVID-19.
The eastern and northern regions of the island are the hardest hit, home to more than half of the island's confirmed COVID-19 cases combined. The health centre that serves the eastern part of the island reported 7,618 cases as of Tuesday, and the centre serving the northern sector reported 6,144.
Across the island, the average rate of infection per 100,000 people was 1,180.6. Twenty-one per cent of those infected were health-care workers.
The communities with rates of infection above the overall average for the island are: Ahuntsic-Cartierville (1,512.9 cases per 100,000 population), Anjou (1,416), CÃ´te-St-Luc (1,482.4), LaSalle (1,371.4), Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (1,499), Montreal-Nord (2,686.6), Town of Mount Royal (1,208.1), RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles (1,811.8), St-LÃ©onard (1,264.3), Verdun (1,265.4), Villeray-St-Michel-Parc-Extension (1,238.1) and Lachine (1,184.6).
Some of the communities with the worst overall rates of infection actually saw their rates of community infection - outside closed facilities - decline substantially over the previous week. For example, Montreal-Nord, which has the highest overall infection rate on the island, had a community infection rate of 176.89 per 100,000 - down 26 per cent. RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles had a community infection rate of 100.24 per 100,000, down 34 per cent.

Allison Hanes: DÃ©jÃ  vu for ombudsman investigating seniors' residences

Full text: Horror stories about starving seniors in overflowing diapers suffering from neglect as understaffed nursing homes struggled to cope with a global pandemic have profoundly shocked the Quebec public and shaken faith in our health system.
Marie Rinfret, Quebec's ombudsman, is as disturbed by these grim revelations as everyone else - although perhaps less surprised.
For years she has been reporting on personnel shortages in old-age homes depriving residents of basic services like feeding, dressing or bathing. The arrival of COVID-19 exacerbated every one of these weaknesses - and created worse problems, too.
"The situation for us is dramatic," Rinfret said in an interview Tuesday. "There are deficiencies that have been seen many times in certain residences, but with this pandemic things have become really alarming."
Since COVID-19 hit Quebec in March, Rinfret's office has been inundated with complaints about deplorable conditions in CHSLDs.
"We have the power to act right away," she said. "So we go to the residences where the patients mentioned in the complaint live, and we saw in many, many situations that the people were suffering prejudice and we asked that the situation be corrected so that the individual's right to security, to be treated with dignity, to receive basic care and hygiene could be upheld."
When reports emerged in the media - like dehydrated residents found on the ground at Dorval's RÃ©sidence Herron after it was put under trusteeship, or homes like Vigi Mont-Royal, where 100 per cent of patients were infected with COVID-19 at one point - Rinfret also follows up.
"I ask my investigators to go knock at the door of these establishments to see what is happening," she said.
What they have uncovered so far in dealing with specific cases is grave enough for the ombudsman to take broader action. Rinfret announced Tuesday that she islaunching an examination of how the ministry of health and social services handled the outbreak in the province's nursing homes.
"This systemic investigation is going to target residences for the elderly as a whole in Quebec, not just one residence, but all residences," Rinfret said, while noting her mandate is limited to public CHSLDs or private ones where local health authorities contract beds for patients. "The recommendations will be formulated for the health and social services network, so for the minister, the government, or parliamentarians, depending on the conclusions we reach."
The health ministry has already ordered up its own audit of what went wrong in long-term care homes and some have called for an inquiry. But Rinfret's probe promises to be wide in scope, independent and impartial (ie: more credible). It will also eventually be made public.
However, her recommendations are not binding. Perhaps if they were, the disaster that struck Quebec nursing homes due to COVID-19 might have been less severe.
In her 2017-18 annual report, Rinfret found that the personnel in CHSLDs struggled to keep up with their workload due to high levels of absenteeism, staff turnover, recruitment challenges and a staff-to-patient ratio that didn't take into account the heavy needs of some residents.
"It happens that services like weekly baths, dental hygiene, shaving and hair brushing are postponed," the ombudsman's report stated, adding that this frequent occurrence bordered on "mistreatment."
That same report flagged a CHSLD where residents were sometimes left in their beds for up to 36 hours.
It underscored the laxness of local health authorities failing to carry out the necessary inspections to certify the quality of care in private homes where it was sending frail elderly patients.
Rinfret's 2018-19 report again warned of these "recurrent problems" in CHSLDs.
Sound familiar?
These are among the factors that crippled Quebec's pandemic response in long-term care homes, leaving them woefully unprepared to deal with outbreaks and struggling to provide dignified care. Failures to distribute proper personal protective equipment and employees working in multiple facilities caused infections of patients and staff to skyrocket. At one point, 10,000 personnel were missing in action, forcing Premier FranÃ§ois Legault to beg medical specialists, the army and later students to help change diapers and feed hungry seniors.
So far, 80 per cent of Quebec's 4,139 COVID-19 casualties have been in CHSLDs. And there is a risk a bad situation will get worse this week when a heat wave suffocates nursing homes, where just a third of residents have air-conditioned rooms - another well-known problem that has been largely ignored.
The investigations into the havoc wrought by the pandemic are yet to unfold, but many of the causes have been clearly foretold.
If only someone had acted on the early warning signs.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of COVID-19 deaths in Quebec. There were 4,139 deaths in Quebec and 6,639 in Canada. The Gazette regrets the error.

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is urging anyone who was among a large crowd of people at Trinity Bellwoods Park in Toronto or other big gatherings over the weekend to get tested for COVID-19.
He says he was disappointed to see so many "obviously smart, young people" flouting physical distancing rules.
Ford's comments come as the province attempts to boost low testing numbers - reported today as 8,170, despite a capacity of more than 21,000.
Health Minister Christine Elliott says health officials have decided to delay implementing a family bubble-type rule or loosening a restriction on gatherings of over five people in part because of what happened at Trinity Bellwoods.
She says they have been discussing household bubbles, but there is reluctance to move ahead with that right now because of some large gatherings and discouraging new case numbers.
Elliott says rising numbers of new COVID-19 cases in Ontario likely relate to people gathering for Mother's Day contrary to official guidelines.

Quebec surpasses 4,000 COVID-19 death milestone, plans to ratchet up testing
Quebec is reporting 85 additional deaths linked to COVID-19 today, bringing the total number to 4,069 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Premier Francois Legault says 42 of the newly reported deaths occurred more than seven days ago in Laval, a hard-hit city north of Montreal.
The province now has 47,984 confirmed cases of COVID-19 - an increase of 573 cases compared to Sunday.
With a heat wave forecast for Montreal this week, the province says it's trying to come up with a plan to keep seniors in long-term care homes cool while avoiding more outbreaks.
Legault says he's happy the province managed reach its goal of conducting 14,000 tests daily last Thursday and Friday and would like to see those numbers increase in the coming weeks.
Provincial health authorities report that 14,654 people have recovered from the virus.

Ontario asks hospitals to take over management of two nursing home
Ontario says it has appointed hospitals to take over the management of two long-term care homes that have been unable to contain COVID-19.
The province says Humber River Hospital will manage Downsview Long Term Care Centre, which has reported 52 deaths, up from 40 just a week ago.
Southlake Regional Health Centre will manage River Glen Haven Nursing Home in Sutton, a 119-bed facility where there have been 20 deaths and 54 confirmed cases.
The orders last for 90 days, but the government says they can be extended, if necessary.
The government says that the homes have been receiving supports from the hospitals for weeks, but have still been unable to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The Ministry of Long-Term Care reports more than 1,500 resident deaths and six staff deaths from facilities across the province, and there are currently 159 active outbreaks, down from 189 a week ago.

Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers in bid for NDP support
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he'll push the provinces to give workers 10 days of paid sick leave a year as the country deals with the COVID-19 pandemic.
That appears to meet a key demand from NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, in exchange for the New Democrats' support for a motion to limit sittings and votes in the House of Commons through the summer.
Singh laid out the demands on Monday morning, shortly before a small number of members of Parliament returned to the House of Commons to begin debate over the future of parliamentary sittings for as long as several months.
The debate will revolve around a Liberal proposal to waive "normal" House of Commons sittings in favour of expanding the special COVID-19 committee that has acted as a sort of stand-in for the past month.
Because they hold only a minority of seats, the Liberals need the support of at least one of the main opposition parties to pass this motion.
The Conservatives are expected to oppose the motion as they push for an end to the COVID-19 committee and the resumption of Commons sittings, albeit with no more than 50 MPs in the chamber at any time.

Ontario reports 404 new cases, 29 more deaths
Ontario is reporting 404 new cases of COVID-19 today, and 29 more deaths.
That brings the total in the province to 25,904, including 2,102 deaths and 19,698 resolved cases.
The new cases represent an increase of 1.6 per cent over Sunday's total.
Just 8,170 tests were completed in the previous day - the eighth straight day Ontario has fallen short of its goal of doing 16,000 a day, and far short of its capacity of over 21,000.
Premier Doug Ford announced Sunday that anyone concerned they may have been exposed to COVID-19 can now get tested, whether or not they have symptoms.
Ontario has struggled to boost its testing numbers after completing a blitz of testing nearly every resident and staff member of long-term care.

Two workers of Toronto Loblaws test positive
Two workers at a Loblaws grocery store at the old Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto have tested positive for COVID-19.
Loblaw says it closed the store briefly to allow for additional cleaning and has since reopened.
The company says neither employee had symptoms at the time and have not worked in the store during the past week.
Loblaw says the employees and those who worked closely with them are now at home in self isolation.
The company says it is now enforcing physical distancing rules inside the store.
Toronto Public Health says there have been more than 10,000 cases of COVID-19 and 759 deaths as of Saturday.

Montreal-area retailers reopening to public, with distancing measures in place
Many retail stores in Montreal area are opening their doors today, with customers being asked to remain spaced apart and follow hygiene protocols.
Mask-wearing, Plexiglas barriers, frequent disinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers as Quebec eases measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Premier Francois Legault is allowing retail stores in the hard-hit region to reopen, as long as they can be accessed directly from outside and customers can keep a distance from one another.
The province has repeatedly urged customers to wear non-medical face masks when out in public but has stopped short of making the measure mandatory.
Some store owners say they're adapting to the new reality by limiting customers, offering appointments and offering contactless pay and options to collect orders made online.
Shopping malls remain closed for now, while hairdressers, estheticians and tattoo artists will be allowed to open on June 1, but only those outside Montreal.

Manitobans warned about visiting International Peace Garden
The Canada Border Services Agency is reminding Manitobans that if they visit the International Peace Garden, they must comply with the mandatory 14-day requirement to quarantine or isolate when they return.
The agency says that's because visiting the garden, located on the border between Manitoba and North Dakota, is international travel and constitutes exiting Canada.
To gain re-entry, it says travellers must report to the CBSA at the Boissevain port of entry.
Every traveller will need to provide their contact information and confirm that they have a suitable place to isolate or quarantine.

Boeing to lay off 400 in Winnipeg
Boeing says it plans to cut 400 positions at its Winnipeg facilities due to the impact of COVID-19.
Boeing employs approximately 16-hundred people in two locations in the city, where they produce components mainly for its commercial airplanes.
A statement from the company says the reductions will come from voluntary and involuntary layoffs and normal attrition.
Earlier this month, Boeing said it failed to sell a single commercial airplane in April.

Manitoba Hydro reaches agreement with First Nations over blockade
A deal has been struck to remove blockades that were erected at a Manitoba Hydro construction site over COVID-19 concerns.
Four northern First Nations stopped entry at three points around the Keeyask site after Manitoba Hydro said it would rotate out and replace hundreds of employees and contractors.
Hydro spokesman Bruce Owen says the utility is pleased to reach an understanding with its First Nations partners that he says "will see construction on Keeyask resume safely."
The deal includes lifting a court injunction issued last week against Tataskweyak Cree Nation, one of the communities that was part of the protest.

Chen says his son was shaken but got away without apparent injuries.
Police say no charges had been laid "at this preliminary stage."

MPs to meet today to decide on resuming Parliament during pandemic
Federal New Democrats say they want to see real action from the Liberal government on permanent paid sick leave and support for people with disabilities before they will support a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings.
The Liberals over the weekend proposed to waive "normal" House of Commons sittings in favour of expanding the special COVID-19 committee that has acted as a sort of stand-in for the past month.
Because they hold only a minority of seats, the Liberals need the support of at least one of the main opposition parties to pass this motion.
The Conservatives are pushing for an end to the COVID-19 committee and the resumption of normal House of Commons sittings, albeit with no more than 50 MPs in the chamber at any time.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says his party is willing to support Liberals' motion.
However, he says that support is contingent on the Liberals' expanding the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to provide paid sick leave to all Canadians in the short term and a commitment to work with the provinces to provide permanent benefits even after the pandemic.

New COVID-19 outbreak identified at frozen fruit plant in Abbotsford, B.C.
A new COVID-19 outbreak has been identified at a frozen fruit processing plant in Abbotsford, British Columbia.
Fraser Health announced late Friday that five employees at Nature's Touch have tested positive for the virus and case and contact management is ongoing.
The news came after B.C. announced 18 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 2,507.
Officials say three more people have died, bringing the provincial death toll to 155.
About four out of five people infected since the novel coronavirus was first identified in the province have recovered and B.C. officials say there are 310 active cases.
Fraser Health says it has inspected the fruit processing plant and is working to ensure the safety of all employees.
"All close contacts of the employees who tested positive are being followed and Nature's Touch has voluntarily closed the facility until Monday," the regional health authority says in a statement.
B.C. officials say an outbreak at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver that has been ongoing for a month has been declared over and no new health-care outbreaks have been identified.

However, the death toll continues to rise and three more people have succumbed to the illness for a total of 155.
An outbreak at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver that has been ongoing for a month has been declared over and no new health-care outbreaks have been identified.
British Columbia recently entered a new phase of its pandemic response with several businesses resuming or preparing to restart operations.
Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry say this phase is about moving slowly, with patience and care.

Quebec launches investigations into COVID-19 death of Montreal inmate
Quebec's Public Security Department says two investigations have been launched into the death this week of a Montreal inmate from COVID-19.
Marie-Josee Montminy, a department spokeswoman, says the department's internal investigations division is probing the death of the man who had been detained at the Bordeaux provincial jail.
Montminy says the Quebec coroner's office is also investigating.
Rights groups said the detainee, Robert Langevin, died on Tuesday after contracting COVID-19 in jail.
The 72-year-old had filed a complaint with the Quebec ombudsman's office in late March pleading for his release amid fears he would contract the virus.
His death spurred calls from rights groups and other detainees' families for Quebec to release more inmates to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Leaving hand sanitizer in hot vehicles a fire risk: Alberta doctors
Doctors at Alberta Health Services say people using hand sanitizer when they are out shouldn't leave it in their cars for too longbecause it could lead to a fire.
The advice comes in a daily COVID-19 newsletter distributed to physicians, volunteers and staff by AHS president Dr. Verna Yui and senior medical health officer Dr. Laura McDougall.
They said handwashing with soap and warm water is still the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they noted that's not always practical when outside the home or in a workplace.
With hand sanitizer being in short supply, many breweries, distilleries and community-based companies have started making their own with high alcohol content, which they said should be between 60 and 90 per cent.
Yui and McDougall said not to store any hand sanitizer in your car for long periods of time.
"With extended exposure to high temperatures, the alcohol in the hand sanitizer will eventually evaporate, causing it to lose its efficacy," they wrote in Thursday's newsletter. "Additionally, there is a potential fire risk to storing hand sanitizer in your car.
"In extreme heat, it can ignite due to its high alcohol content."
A spokesman with AHS said he doesn't know of any injuries due to hand sanitizer fires in Alberta, noting it's just a general warning from the doctors.

Essential workers in Yukon get a wage increase over 16 weeks
Low-income essential workers in Yukon are getting a temporary $4 per hour wage increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The territorial government says eligible workers for the program can't make more than $20 per hour and will receive the benefit for up to 16 weeks.
Essential workers are those in the health-care sector or people who work in the supply of food, medicine, energy, water, transportation and government.
Economic Development Minister Ranj Pillai says in a news release that essential workers have delivered goods and kept shelves stocked.
All 11 people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and there have been no new cases since April 20.
The territory announced last week that it would allow restaurants and some businesses to reopen by the end of the month as long as they've developed a COVID-19 operation plan to keep staff and customers safe.

Manitoba announces new COVID-19 cases for the first time in four days
Manitoba health officials are reporting two new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total of probable and confirmed infections in the province to 292.
The two new cases involve a boy under 10 and a woman in her 30s in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's area.
They are the first new cases in four days and, as more people recover, the number of active cases in the province stands at 18.
Previously announced increases in crowd limits are also in effect.
Public gatherings that were limited to 10 people now allow for up to 25 people at indoor events and 50 people outside.
Professional sports athletes, coaches and trainers can also attend team facilities for practices, as long as no members of the public are allowed.

Newfoundland and Labrador reports no new COVID cases; will reopen pet grooming
Newfoundland and Labrador is permitting outdoor games of tennis to resume immediately and will allow pet grooming services to begin operating again on Monday.
Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, chief medical officer of health, said today the province continues to record no new cases of COVID-19.
It has been more than two weeks since Newfoundland and Labrador recorded any new cases of the disease from the novel coronavirus.
Fitzgerald says tennis players will have to bring their own equipment to the court, and not share it.
She adds that pet grooming companies will have to ensure their employees have personal protective equipment.
Fitzgerald says overnight camping will be permitted when the province moves from the current alert level of four, to level three, but she didn't say when that will occur.

N.S. reports two new cases of COVID-19, as care home still has 16 sick residents
Nova Scotia has identified two new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of confirmed cases to 1,048.
In the daily report, the province said the Northwood long-term care facility in Halifax - where 52 of the province's 58 deaths have occurred - currently has 16 residents and four staff with active cases.
Northwood, the largest long-term care home east of Montreal, has been the site of Nova Scotia's worst outbreak.
The premier said on Thursday that the virus entered the facility through asymptomatic people and spread among the more than 400 residents.
He has said that there will be a "conversation" about how to prevent a similar outbreak in the future.
Eight people in Nova Scotia are in hospital with COVID-19, and there are four people in intensive care being treated for the illness.

Ontario is reporting 441 new cases of COVID-19 cases today, and 28 more deaths.
That brings the provincial total to 24,628, which is a 1.8 per cent increase over the previous day's total.
Ontario's growth rate in cases has steadily hovered between 1.5 and 1.9 per cent for 12 of the past 13 days.
Chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams has said the numbers are in a plateau, and called it disappointing.
Ontario's total includes 2,021 deaths and 18,767 cases that have been resolved.
The number of completed tests rose a bit to 11,276, which is still well short of the province's capacity of over 21,000 per day.

N.B. to move to next phase of recovery plan today
New Brunswick is set to move to the next phase of its COVID-19 recovery plan today.
The so-called "yellow phase" means barbers and hair stylists can reopen, as well as churches and fitness facilities.
Dental care, massage therapists, chiropractors and other "close contact" businesses and services will also be allowed to open.
The new phase will also allow family and friends to form social "bubbles," and up to 50 people to gather with physical distancing.
The move comes a day after the province reported its first new case of COVID-19 in almost two weeks.
But the provincial total is just 121, and 120 of them have recovered.

Testing wastewater could give early warning of second COVID-19 wave
Researchers in Canada say the best early warning system for a second wave of COVID-19 could be right beneath our feet - in the sewers.
Several other countries have taken to testing wastewater for signs of the novel coronavirus as an indication of flare-ups in their communities.
Now researchers are beginning to look at the option in Canada.
Given that some people can pass the virus on without even knowing they have it, health officials say testing large portions of the population will be key for detecting and quashing any new community spread of COVID-19.
Canada has struggled to keep up with the volume of tests needed to do that.
Mike McKay with the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research says scientists across the country are now testing wastewater to see if it could be a viable way to alert public health officials to new outbreaks.

Full text: Dr. Horacio Arruda offered a stern warning to Quebecers Friday as the province continued to loosen social distancing restrictions: respect the rules or we'll all spend the summer in lockup.
Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, said things are trending in the right direction: there were 65 new COVID-19 deaths Friday, 646 additional cases and hospitalizations are slightly down. As the death toll creeps toward 4,000 in Quebec, he said the situation is "stabilizing."
But, he said, Quebecers cannot afford to get complacent.
"If we go back to the way things were before, all those people who died, it will have been for nothing," said Arruda. "Because it will be as though we didn't learn from their deaths."
Quebecers are now allowed to gather outside in groups of up to 10 people from up to three households. Starting next week, about 300 museums and cultural centres across the province, as well as drive-in movie theatres, can begin to reopen. Meanwhile, other non-essential businesses are starting back up in Montreal, and with a summer heat wave descending upon us, it stands to reason there will be crowds at parks and public places.
"There will be more cases (of coronavirus)," Arruda said. "We're under no illusion. ... But we'll be monitoring hospitalizations, the number of people being admitted to an intensive care unit and deaths, if that rises to an unacceptable level again, we'll be forced to lock ourselves inside.
"We won't wait for things to get too bad before making that call. If we see a trend, we'll take action."
Even as the daily death toll drops, the number of cases could continue to rise as Quebec works its way toward the goal of testing 14,000 people a day for coronavirus. Right now about 11,000 are tested daily, and as of Thursday evening there are 46,141 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province, including 3,865 deaths.
The provincial government is also working with Ottawa to set up contact tracing in Quebec. As many as 50 per cent of those with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, but by tracing who these people were exposed too the government can better predict and prevent outbreaks.
"We'll accept any help we can get ... we'll co-operate with Ottawa to integrate them into our testing strategy," said GeneviÃ¨ve Guilbault, Quebec's deputy premier.
Montreal's public health director, Dr. MylÃ¨ne Drouin, said the city should be able to contact at least 500 people a day within the next 48 hours as part of a contact tracing strategy. There have been delays in securing federal aid because the province needs French-speaking workers to work the phones.
Though other provinces, like Alberta, had developed an app that uses the GPS location tracking on a person's phone to determine where they've been and how they may have spread the virus, Quebec's technology has lagged behind. An early contract tracing system would have used chain emails to trace the pandemic's exposure in a community.
That plan has since been scrapped.
This week, Premier FranÃ§ois Legault said he's open to working with a Montreal-based artificial intelligence firm to develop a mobile app for contact tracing. The app would have to track people's movements without violating privacy rights, he said.
As summer comes within reach, Quebecers have been inundating the government with questions about camping sites and sleepaway camps, according to Guilbault. She said they are studying whether it will be possible to open camp grounds and summer camps.
"The risk of transmission at a summer camp where people sleep and eat in close quarters would be higher than if we reopened schools," Arruda said.
Day camps will be open as of June 22 across the island, the government announced earlier this week. And libraries across the province will be able to start lending out books on May 29, but access to the facility itself will be restricted.
As some social distancing measures loosen, the city and province are handing out hundreds of thousands of free masks to Quebecers and urging them to wear the face covering whenever they leave their home. But even with protective equipment, Guilbault said people will have to "adapt to new social norms" and keep their distance.
"We know it's hard," she said.
"But the temptation to take short cuts now could cost us big later."
As for gatherings in backyards, Arruda said Quebecers will have to discipline themselves to act against their own impulses.
"I know how it is, you're next to the barbecue with your brother, drinking a beer," said Arruda. "But you can't hug him, you can't touch him. I know it's against our nature but it's what we have to do. ... If you see someone coming too close, tell them to back off. They won't get mad. Tell them Dr. Arruda told you to say that." ccurtis@postmedia.com

Full text: Dr. Horacio Arruda offered a stern warning to Quebecers on Friday as the province continued to loosen social distancing restrictions: respect the rules or we'll all spend the summer in lockup.
Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, said things are trending in the right direction: there were 65 new COVID-19 deaths Friday, 646 additional cases and hospitalizations are slightly down. As the death toll creeps toward 4,000 in Quebec, he said the situation is "stabilizing."
But, he said, Quebecers cannot afford to get complacent.
"If we go back to the way things were before, all those people who died, it will have been for nothing," said Arruda. "Because it will be as though we didn't learn from their deaths."
As of Friday, Quebecers are allowed to gather outside in groups of up to 10 people from up to three households. Starting next week, about 300 museums and cultural centres across the province as well as drive-in movie theatres can begin to reopen. Meanwhile, other non-essential businesses are starting back up in Montreal and with a summer heat wave descending upon us, it stands to reason there will be crowds at parks and public places.
"There will be more cases (of COVID-19)," Arruda said. "We're under no illusion. ... But we'll be monitoring hospitalizations, the number of people being admitted to an intensive-care unit and deaths, if that rises to an unacceptable level again, we'll be forced to lock ourselves inside.

Mayor urges Montrealers to start wearing face masks; As reopening the economy approaches, Plante says it's safer if people cover faces

Full text: Face masks will become an indispensable summer accessory under new public health guidelines outlined Tuesday by Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante and the regional public health department.
"Whether you're going for a walk or a bike ride, or you're going to the grocery (store) or to the pharmacy or taking public transport, I definitely invite you to wear a face covering as one of the ways to protect yourself and also protect others," Plante said during a press conference held via Facebook and telephone conference call.
It won't be mandatory to wear a mask, whether homemade or purchased, and you won't be stopped by police for not doing so, the mayor added.
But given that it is difficult in a densely populated city to keep two metres away from others at all times, it's safer for everyone if people cover their faces, she said, showing off a fabric mask that she keeps on hand at all times.
"A face covering must become the social norm," regional public health director MylÃ¨ne Drouin said.
The Montreal transit authority is providing reusable cloth masks to all employees who request them.
Plante said the city has ordered 50,000 reusable masks that will be supplied to community organizations to distribute to vulnerable people, like the homeless.
The new health advice is not a substitute for washing hands, using sanitizer or coughing into your elbow, nor does it mean you can start disregarding rules on social distancing, Plante said. But it's one more tool to help prevent COVID-19 cases from escalating when elementary schools and businesses reopen in the coming weeks.
People are urged to make or purchase their own reusable fabric mask, but not to use medical-grade masks needed in the health-care sector.
Plante took back her earlier criticism of the Quebec government for pressing the restart button on the Montreal economy later than it's doing in the rest of the province. On Friday, she objected when Premier FranÃ§ois Legault said businesses in greater Montreal might not reopen at the same time as those in other regions of Quebec.
But on Tuesday, Plante said she had come around to Legault's way of thinking, given that the island of Montreal is still the epicentre of the pandemic with 12,487 cases and 1,039 deaths to date.
Legault announced that stores with outside entrances will reopen on May 11 in the Montreal region, compared to May 4 in the rest of Quebec.
"I think it was the right thing to do," Plante said.
The mayor said she was not yet ready to announce if and when playgrounds, playing fields, day camps, libraries and pools will open this summer, saying those decisions will depend on provincial health policy and the evolution of the pandemic.
Helping Montrealers in densely populated neighbourhoods stay cool if pools, wading pools, libraries and air-conditioned malls remain closed could be "a big challenge," Plante added.
The city will need to find innovative ways to keep residents safe if summer temperatures soar to deadly levels, she said. In 2018, 66 Montrealers - many of them seniors, people with chronic conditions and residents of densely populated, low-income neighbourhoods - died in a heat wave.
"We'll have to think outside the box," Plante said.
Plante has promised to unveil a plan to help relaunch the city's economy in May.
With festivals cancelled, restaurants closed and theatres shuttered, Plante said she would be calling on higher levels of government to throw a lifeline to the city's tourism and hospitality industries.
"They have more substantial sources of revenue to support those sectors that really need help," she said. mscott@postmedia.com

Full text: There's no denying it: this is a rough time of year. In the sobering wake of the holidays, we're up against at least another month and a half (if we're lucky) of big coats, salt stains, snow shovelling, ice scraping and sub-zero temperatures.
Year after year, it doesn't get easier - probably because we block it out - but there are ways to deal with it. The most obvious is to embrace winter, get outside and enjoy it. Another option? Take flight. If you can afford to, head down south, sit on a beach and drink margaritas until it's time to face the cold again (with a tan).
Lastly - and one of the easiest solutions - you can travel to a warm, sunny place via your meal. Which is exactly why I decided to take a short but invigorating trip to Agrikol, the Haitian restaurant co-owned by Arcade Fire's Win Butler and RÃ©gine Chassagne, and headed by chef Paul Toussaint.
It was a wintry evening when I ventured out to Agrikol in the Village, a pink light illuminating the front door like a beacon of warmth. Although we were among the first to arrive (there are no reservations here), the compact dining room and bar quickly filled up with others ready to forget the cold.
Peach-coloured wallpaper with a green palm print, fresh white wainscotting, patio lights, lively music, plenty of rum - I could instantly feel this restaurant's undeniable energy washing over me in gentle waves.
Agrikol opened in early 2016, co-owned by Butler, Chassagne, Toronto restaurateur Jen Agg and her husband, Roland Jean. They soon expanded with a bar next door, Ti-Agrikol. Haitian-born chef Toussaint took over the kitchen as executive chef in 2017, and in 2018 Agg and Jean amicably decided to leave the business.
Toussaint, who recently opened his own place in Eaton Centre's Time Out Market, moved to Ottawa from Haiti at a young age, eventually making his way to Montreal to forge his culinary career (including time spent at ToquÃ©!). He returned home after Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake, until an opportunity brought him and his young family back to Montreal: Agrikol.
I had dined at this restaurant before, but this was my first time with Toussaint at the helm. What struck me most was the complexity of flavour and depth in all the dishes I sampled. Agrikol has always been a fun place to eat, but it seems to have grown up and become more serious about its food.
Drinks, on the other hand, have always been a strong suit, with an exciting selection of rums and rum-based cocktails to spark that warm, sunny feeling. (Pours are generous, so it won't take long.) I thoroughly enjoyed the Dark and Stormy, with rum, lime and a pleasantly biting ginger beer. The Florita - a specialty from Toussaint's hometown of Jacmel, named after a famous hotel there - was made in the style of a sour using three-star Barbancourt Haitian rum, lime, bitters and cane sugar. This refreshing drink had toasted biscuit undertones and a requisite sugared rim.
The menu is succinct and staff are friendly and generous, taking the time to explain each item. Our waiter was an extremely helpful guide, even talking us out of over-ordering. (He was right.) With so many traditional, intriguing options - including dishes with conch, goat and beef tail - it's hard to choose, so we went with our waiter's recommendations: griot (braised pork) to start, followed by a whole red snapper and Toussaint's Haitian jerk chicken.
The griot was excellent: a hearty piece of braised pork shoulder with the best of both those melting tender pieces and the crunchy outer ones lingering in a shallow dark pool - an aromatic mixture of bitter orange, parsley, scotch bonnet, green onion and mustard - and topped with sautÃ©ed onions and peppers.
Served alongside thick-sliced fried plantain best used to soak up the sauce and scoop up the pork, the appetizer was complemented by the pikliz, an addictively spicy, vinegar-soaked coleslaw condiment placed on each table, which many Haitians use in lieu of hot sauce. It helped cut through the richness of the pork with a delightful smack of sharpness and heat, and I could not get enough.
Mains were also generous.
The red snapper was bathed in a lively mix of onions, peppers, garlic, parsley, cumin, bitter orange, scotch bonnet, lime and the fish's cooking juices, served with fried plantain and a side of faintly sweet and sticky coconut rice. Meaty and flaky, the fish got most of its tang after a good soak in the fragrant sauce. I only wish they'd given us another plate for the bones, as they kept slipping into the darkness of that sauce.
Toussaint's jerk chicken was a half bird brined for 24 hours, then rubbed in a spice mixture and marinated for six more hours before being roasted to moist perfection.
More savoury than spicy, this pared-down version had lovely notes of tamari, bitter orange, thyme and mustard, and was served with more fried plantain and a subtle but highly enjoyable mound of rice and beans. The secret to the latter's gentle complexity was the addition of some of the starchy cooking water from the beans, as well as coconut milk, onion, garlic, herbs and spices.
If you want to turn up the volume, add a little scoop of pikliz to the mix.
For dessert - if it's not rum - I highly suggest trying the coconut crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Creamy but light and not overly sweet, this palate-cleansing dessert was garnished with coconut shavings and gave me one last taste of the Caribbean before I headed back out into the cold.
Not only did Agrikol make me forget about the winter blues, the entire experience put some pep back in my step.
From the sunny atmosphere to the friendly staff, silky smooth rum and the distinct flavours of Toussaint's comforting cuisine, along with plenty of plantain to go around, I can't wait for my next Haitian staycation.

Agrikol spotlights complex flavours from chef Paul Toussaint, left, with manager Ralph DestinÃ©.

Horse-drawn carriage tours in Montreal banned on Jan. 1, but industry vows to fight on

Full text: Itâs the end of the line for King and Maximus, Marilyn and Maya, and the rest of the gentle draft horses that live in an aging stable in Montrealâs Griffintown neighbourhood.
On Dec. 31, they will wheel their carriages out for the last time past the construction sites and new condo towers that have popped up, making their way to the cobblestoned streets of Old Montreal. Their hoofbeats hark back to a bygone era, and soon they will be heard no more.
As of Jan. 1, a city ban will be in effect, putting an end to horse-drawn carriage tours. The new rule was prompted by heightened concern over animal welfare and a series of highprofile incidents involving the horses that spawned a wave of outrage and concern from citizens.
Depending on whom you ask, itâs a victory for the rights of the long-suffering horses or a tragic loss of a piece of the cityâs heritage.
For Nathalie Matte, who has worked as a driver for 11 years, itâs the latter. The horses âare what makes Old Montreal magic; itâs not the lights,â the 52-year-old said during a recent open house at the stables in Griffintown, as she finished the final harness adjustments on K.O., a chestnut gelding. âIt will be the first time you wonât have the sound of horses there.â
Ms. Matte, who became captivated by the horses while working another job in Old Montreal, denies the animals in the industry are mistreated. âHe weighs 2,000 pounds; I weigh 90,â the 52-year-old said as she patted K.O., who wore a dapper top hat perched atop his bridle. âIf he didnât want to go out, I couldnât make him.â
But for opponents of the industry, including the current city administration, the horsedrawn carriages, known as calÃ¨ches, belong in the cityâs past.
âWith heat waves in summer, climate change, extreme cold in the winter, construction and the number of vehicles on the road, we have a serious question on the animalsâ safety,â Councillor Sterling Downey told reporters recently. He pointed to a number of incidents involving the horses in the past few years, including one video of a collision between a horse and a car, and another that showed a horse down on the ground after slipping on a metal grate. In 2018, a horse fell and died in the middle of a guided tour.
Mr. Downey insists the administration has done everything it can to ease the transition, including giving a full yearâs notice. The city has worked with the provincial labour department to help calÃ¨che drivers find other work and have offered to pay the owners $1,000 a horse to retire the animals.
âWeâre confident in the position weâve taken and the actions weâve taken,â he told reporters. âWeâve been more than respectful. Weâve tried to do everything, taking into consideration this has an impact on peopleâs lives and livelihoods.â
But many calÃ¨che drivers and owners, some of whom have invested heavily in their businesses, say they risk losing everything and donât know how to move on from an industry in which many have worked for decades.
Luc Desparois, who runs the cityâs largest calÃ¨che operation, said heâs not done fighting. On Dec. 16, he and a group of owners filed a court injunction in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the ban, arguing the drivers have the right to make a living. In court filings, they argued the drivers would suffer serious financial harm owing to loss of income and would have to go into debt to support themselves and their animals.
Quebec Superior Court Justice Michel Pinsonnault rejected the request, ruling that drivers didnât demonstrate that an emergency injunction is needed, and the request was brought far too late in the game.

Full text: Were you among the estimated half-million people who took part in the historic climate march in downtown Montreal on Sept. 27? Whether you were there or not, chances are, the choice was yours. However, many people with disabilities who wanted to be there that day did not have the freedom to make that choice. Essentially, the message they got - again - was: stay home.
There are many reasons why people with disabilities (PWD) would want to participate in the march, some of which might not be obvious to others. People with disabilities are generally poorer because they are excluded from the labour market and are more likely to live in dilapidated dwellings, often in polluted neighbourhoods. Their health is more fragile than that of the average population, making them more vulnerable to heat waves and smog. Sidewalks covered with snow banks and ice too often force them to stay home, sometimes for days on end.
In the absence of a fully accessible public transit system, many PWD called on the SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al paratransit service to get to the climate march and back. They needed to provide the starting address - easy, since it was posted weeks in advance. But the address of where the driver would pick them up at the end was also needed. This proved more difficult. Community organizations tried for two weeks to get answers from groups involved with the protest, to no avail.
Some march organizers mentioned a specific departure point for their activists with reduced mobility, away from the main gathering in front of the mountain. Eventually they disclosed the location where to wait for return transportation, not too far from where the march was expected to end. But it was impossible to find out if the procession would interfere with paratransit minibus, taxi and minivan trajectories. (This also prevented many from going to work or school.)
Still, many PWD wanted to take to the streets to express their concern for the future of the planet and their desire to be part of the change. Armed with addresses to give to the paratransit services, 24 hours in advance, they booked online or by phone. And yet, a little later, PWD were informed their ride was cancelled precisely because of the difficult logistics related to the march.
Undaunted, some then chose an address farther away from the hypothetical perimeter of the march, or they rescheduled their arrival earlier and their departure later. Few succeeded with their bookings. Many paratransit users - activists, students, workers - were forced to stay home.
Who's to blame? The groups that organized the event without taking the realities of paratransit users into consideration? The Montreal police who demanded that the itinerary remain secret? The STM paratransit service that cancelled all trips within a huge perimeter and during an overly long period at the last minute? The City of Montreal, which is committed to becoming universally accessible, but that oversaw the whole thing as if PWD did not exist? The agglomeration council? The disastrous co-ordination and inadequate communications by all the stakeholders from whom we should expect much better? More than a month later, despite more efforts to reach out, we still don't have answers.
We expect explanations and commitments to implement effective solutions going forward. And we expect to be consulted. Because there will be other climate marches, and we want to have the choice to participate in them. Like everyone else. It is a question of exercising one's civic and democratic right.

There are many reasons why people with disabilities (PWD) would want to participate in the march, some of which might not be obvious to others. People with disabilities are generally poorer because they are excluded from the labour market and are more likely to live in dilapidated dwellings, often in polluted neighbourhoods. Their health is more fragile than that of the average population, making them more vulnerable to heat waves and smog. Sidewalks covered with snow banks and ice too often force them to stay home, sometimes for days on end.
In the absence of a fully accessible public transit system, many PWD called on the SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al paratransit service to get to the climate march and back. They needed to provide the starting address - easy, since it was posted weeks in advance. But the address of where the driver would pick them up at the end was also needed. This proved more difficult. Community organizations tried for two weeks to get answers from groups involved with the protest, to no avail.
Some march organizers mentioned a specific departure point for their activists with reduced mobility, away from the main gathering in front of the mountain. Eventually they disclosed the location where to wait for return transportation, not too far from where the march was expected to end. But it was impossible to find out if the procession would interfere with paratransit minibus, taxi and minivan trajectories. (This also prevented many from going to work or school.)
Still, many PWD wanted to take to the streets to express their concern for the future of the planet and their desire to be part of the change. Armed with addresses to give to the paratransit services, 24 hours in advance, they booked online or by phone. And yet, a little later, PWD were informed their ride was cancelled precisely because of the difficult logistics related to the march.
Undaunted, some then chose an address farther away from the hypothetical perimeter of the march, or they rescheduled their arrival earlier and their departure later. Few succeeded with their bookings. Many paratransit users - activists, students, workers - were forced to stay home.
Who's to blame? The groups that organized the event without taking the realities of paratransit users into consideration? The Montreal police who demanded that the itinerary remain secret? The STM paratransit service that cancelled all trips within a huge perimeter and during an overly long period at the last minute? The City of Montreal, which is committed to becoming universally accessible, but that oversaw the whole thing as if PWD did not exist? The agglomeration council? The disastrous co-ordination and inadequate communications by all the stakeholders from whom we should expect much better?
More than a month later, despite more efforts to reach out, we still don't have answers.
We expect explanations and commitments to implement effective solutions going forward. And we expect to be consulted. Because there will be other climate marches, and we want to have the choice to participate in them. Like everyone else. It is a question of exercising one's civic and democratic right.

Full text: Margaret Munro is a Vancouver-based journalist who writes about science and the environment.
Guilt over my environmental hypocrisy rose with the temperature this summer, and hit a record high on a sunny terrace in Old Montreal after flying in from Vancouver.
Air Canada, which carries close to 51 millionof the world's 4.3 billionpassengers each year, had transported us from the West Coast, over the Rockies and across the Prairies in fewer than five hours. So convenient, except for all that carbon dioxide the jet engines blew into the atmosphere. How could I profess to care about the planet, yet still fly off on holiday as if I am not part of a very big problem?
As we sat there on the terrace having cocktails, my husband was captivated by the Uber app and his five-star rating from well-tipped drivers. And I got to thinking that what we need is a little green leaf, like the tip option on ride-hailing apps, that pops up on our phones to atone for our environmental sins.
It would go "bing" and suggest tips for the environment as we go about our busy, and often privileged, lives. Bing, $1 for the environment when we pay the Uber driver. Bing, $5 when you pull into the gas station to fill up. Bing, $100 for every $1,000 you spend on luxury toys, clothes or home furnishings. And bing, $90 as you step off the plane in Beijing.
In Montreal, in the midst of a heat wave, I would have gladly paid up if a little green leaf had waved and suggested $49 each to compensate for 1,445 kilograms of carbon dioxide, every passengers' share of the greenhouse gases generated by our economy flights, according to one carbon offset calculator. Scientists have calculatedthat 1.4 tonnes is enough CO2 to shrink the Arctic summer sea ice cover by more than four square metres (43 square feet). No wonder Alaska's forests were blazingand sweaty tourists were jumping into fountains as the temperature in Paris soared to a historic record of 42.6 C.
Carbon offset and environmental apps already exist. But they don't do the trick. Their fees vary, the effectiveness of the offsets is questionable, and you have to care enough to seek them out.
What the beleaguered planet needs is a little green leaf on every phone, that automatically nudges us like a cheerful sprite from the corner of our screens. It could empower and embolden our environmental consciences, be as engaging as Instagram and as profitable for the environment as Apple, Facebook and Amazon have been for their owners.
It may sound like a naive idea to try greenwashing away guilt while doing little for the planet. But put your cynicism aside, and consider the possibilities.
A stark United Nations reportissued this spring detailed how humans are altering the natural world and speeding up species extinction at an unprecedented pace, a consequence of hunting, poaching, habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. The report called for "transformative change" in every aspect of how humans interact with nature.
Would adding a green conscience to every phone solve the world's mounting environmental crisis? No. Could it help? Yes.
It could trigger tangible changes in both our individual and our collective behaviour, pressure businesses and politicians to act, and help alleviate the feelings of despair and "ecogrief," which has some millennials asking if they should bring children into the troubled world.
The creative geniuses at Apple, Samsung and Huawei, who arguably have as much influence and power as the governments that gathered for the UN climate summitlast month, could design their ubiquitous devices to work to the planet's advantage. They could install apps that calculate our environmental footprints in real time, and make reducing the footprint as rewarding and addictive as a streakon Snapchat. Heck, they could probably design phones to glow green with every good deed.
Our phones already know when and where we are flying, driving and walking. It would not be much of a leap to calculate the fuel efficiency (and the CO2 production per kilometre per person) of the planes, buses and cars we travel in. They also know where we shop so, while they're at it, why not track how many hamburgers we eat and plastic containers we use? They could also squeal when we are about to purchase something made by a business, in a province or in a country that's in violation of environmental laws and climate agreements.
The settings on the green leaf could be controlled and customized by users (and their parents). Deniers could just turn the leaf off and watch it shrivel to a dark stain. Enthusiasts could embrace it as part of their everyday electronic lives.
It would enable us to compare environmental footprints and see how they vary over days, weeks and months the way we can now track calories, heartbeats and footsteps. We could go on carbon diets after bingeing on extravagant travel. And we could earn credits for biking or busing to school, driving an electric car (the phone would know if coal was burned to power its battery), eating vegetarian meals and vacationing close to home. Credits could be cashed in for rewards or virtual trips - perhaps to slosh around with grizzly bears catching salmon in B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest, soar with the birds over Venezuela's Salto Angel, the world's tallest waterfall, or electronically connect with fishers hauling plastic debris from the sea.
Along with helping change our behaviour - or, at least increase awareness of our impact - the little green leaf could generate big money.
Tipping the environment could become as easy, impulsive and rewarding as gifting an Uber driver or shopping on Amazon. Daily micro-tips - for using disposable cups, plastic water bottles or ordering a steak dinner - wouldn't cost more than a coffee or two at Starbucks. But they would add up. And macro-tips for driving and flying would underscore the huge environmental cost of travel and encourage us - and our friends and employers - to do more online conferencing, visiting and work.
The tech giants would not make money directly for including the green feature in every phone, but they would profit by enhancing their environmental reputations (I am in the market for a new phone). And it is in their self-interest to help reduce the impact of climate change and environmental degradation, which threaten to disrupt supply chains, displace employees and derail economies.
To work - and prevent greenwashing - there would need to be complete transparency and strict accountability, with 100 per cent of our tips funnelled through a reputable non-profit or a trusted government organization to fund real change.
Users would be able to control where their tips go, the green app offering up lists of worthy projects nearby. Who knows, you might follow your money and join a plastic cleanup crew, or plant some of the one trillion trees that one recent study suggests as the most effective way to fight climate change.
Or, when friends ask about your trip away, you could answer: "Great, my green tip helped save a 500-year-old cedaron Vancouver Island."
You could also let the non-profit decide how to spend your tips. Perhaps to secure habitat for critically endangered rhinoceroses, support bird friendly coffee operations in the Amazon, fund promising clean technology, or assist a remote community switch from diesel generators to solar power.
In China, 13 million trees have been planted for people using an app made by Alipaythat lets them fund new forests and see the seedlings grow via satellites and drone technology. At the rate surveillance tools are moving, it might soon be possible to zoom in on old-growth forest you helped protect ("Hey, goshawks are nesting in my tree!"), the wetlands you help restore, or the fish habitat you helped rebuild.
Another tip option would be to direct your money to politicians fighting for environmental protection, as lack of political will has long stymied effortsto slash greenhouse gas emissions and protect wildlife and wild lands. The UN and international agreements have for decades called on governments to legislate, regulate and orchestrate systemic change to avoid the worst effects of climate change and degradation of the natural world. But politicians refuse to act, or act quickly enough. And they continue to fight over carbon pricing, which is widely acceptedas an essential and effective way to reduce greenhouse gases.
Why not decide for ourselves and use our tips to show how much we are willing to pay for our greenhouse gas emissions. The green app would be clever enough to adjust tips in jurisdictions that already have carbon and environmental taxes and could help shame laggards to at least match our green leaf tips.
It is easy to be cynical and feel hopeless, but we need to fight with every tool we have. The technology is there. And one tiny leaf at a time, the most powerful consumer gadget ever created could become a potent weapon in the battle to protect the natural world and biosphere that life depends on for survival.

Legault's first year had pride and pragmatism; Premier remains popular after ambitious agenda of change

Full text: When Premier FranÃ§ois Legault talks about his accomplishments in office, one word inevitably pops up: pride.
He's proud to be premier and thinks he's been able to instil the same feeling in Quebecers - ending a period of sullenness.
"The most important thing for me is having respected our promises, especially when it comes to the pocketbooks of Quebecers," Legault told The Montreal Gazette last week as he arrived for question period. "We started to reduce school taxes, we started to increase family allowances for children. We will continue down this path.
"I also think Quebecers believe we understand their concerns, they are satisfied with Bill 21 and that we respect their values, such as secularism. So Quebecers are experiencing a certain pride and I am proud of that."
As the government marks one year since the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec made history by breaking the Liberal and Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois stranglehold on power for 40 years and winning the Oct. 1, 2018, election, the mood is calm and confident.
The party has scheduled a general council meeting Nov. 2, where the anniversary will be celebrated by the rank and file, but so far nothing special is on the calendar to mark the event. "It's business as usual," said Legault's press aide Ewan Sauves.
The comment reflects Legault's pragmatic, businesslike approach to governing; where what's important is boosting the economy, improving health and education and above all ticking election promises off his list. In some cases, the promises are "adjusted" versions of the original, but Legault nevertheless says he's sticking to his plan. Take Legault's line Thursday that a government can't go wrong by consulting the people in a referendum on the issue of electoral reform. It was not in the original CAQ playbook.
"It's a big political pirouette," veteran Le Soleil columnist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote Thursday.
Indeed, critics say the CAQ's biggest weakness is that it appears to be making it up as it goes along, improvising on the details behind ideas when the heat is on.
Last week, Legault made headlines when he declared the plan to build a $4-billion tunnel between Quebec City and LÃ©vis to ease traffic congestion is a green solution.
"I want Quebec to be the place in the world that has the most electric cars," he told the National Assembly. "But for those electric cars to circulate, we need roads, we need connectors."
Legault, nevertheless, has a big advantage. With the opposition parties in disarray and the economy booming, he is still surfing on his enormous popularity, confirmed most recently in a Forum Research poll for the Montreal Gazette. It showed Legault in the driver's seat - particularly with francophone voters - with four out of 10 Quebecers supporting his government.
On Friday, the Angus Reid Institute again put Legault at the top of the list among premiers in Canada as far as his approval rating goes.
It's true Legault and his government have made mistakes, but - at least on the big things - Legault admits them and moves on. For now, anyway, Quebecers seem to accept his style of operating because unlike some of his predecessors he does not dither.
A LÃ©ger poll published Saturday indicated 64 per cent of Quebecers are satisfied with the work of the CAQ government. "It's hard to do better," said LÃ©ger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.
CAQ insiders said it has profited from the fact Quebecers are than more than happy to dump their old federalist-sovereignist labels after so many years. The result is the party has cornered the market on the francophone nationalist vote.
"We forget this is the first time a brand-new political party governs Quebec since 1976," said Eric Montigny, a political science professor at the UniversitÃ© Laval.
"What strikes me is that it has arrived in office and is governing in an orderly fashion. It's a government that was hyperactive in its first year. And its honeymoon is continuing."
Highlights of the CAQ's first year:
1 A hyperactive government One of the biggest achievements of the CAQ government has been its ability to implement change, which amounts to a mountain of cabinet and government decisions coupled with an avalanche of new legislation.
When the legislature adjourned in June, the government had presented 30 separate pieces of legislation, adopting 14. The strategy was to dispense with its two most controversial ideas - Bill 9 reforming the immigration system and Bill 21 on state secularism - early in the mandate.
Several remain to be adopted, including Bill 2, increasing the legal age to consume pot from 18 to 21.
In the two weeks the legislature has been sitting, the CAQ tabled another half-dozen pieces of legislation, including Bill 39 reforming the electoral system. It includes plans for a referendum at the same time as the 2022 election.
The government also has respected promises to ease the finances of Quebec's taxpayers, lowering school taxes and increasing family allowance payments for children. There will be more goodies in November when Finance Minister Eric Girard - sitting on a surplus of $4.3 billion - tables his second economic update.
Legault has already made it clear he wants to give any extra money to taxpayers and not to the province's unions seeking wage increases.
2 Tough times for minorities Legault often tells the National Assembly's small band of English media reporters that he hopes the English-speaking community one day will start feeling good about the CAQ after snubbing it in 2018.
Relations with minorities and the leadership of the community in particular have been a CAQ blind spot throughout the first year - creating the widespread impression the government lacks empathy.
Despite naming Christopher Skeete parliamentary assistant to the premier for relations with English-speaking Quebecers, many anglophones can't get past Legault's Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois past. Things like the forced transfer of anglophone schools to the francophone network last June and bills 9 and 21 have not helped.
A LÃ©ger poll published in September indicated the majority of English-speaking Quebecers feel the CAQ does not understand their concerns and two-thirds have little trust in the government.
"There have been a series of government initiatives that are very worrying to the community," said Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network.
It's not over. On Tuesday, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge will table legislation to transform Quebec's 72 school boards - including the nine anglophone boards - into service centres despite the staunch opposition of the community.
As a concession to try to patch up relations, Roberge's bill - as reported by The Montreal Gazette in September - will include a compromise and allow the English boards to continue to hold elections of school board administrators, something the francophone system will lose.
"We are aware there is a perception we don't care as much about the minority," a top government official said Friday. "I think on school boards we have taken into account the historic place of the anglophone community.
"We are not insensitive to the community's demands. They have not fallen on deaf ears. We care."
3 Troubled waters One of the government's early gaffes was fumbling after the death of a seven-year-old girl in Granby, when the province's youth protection system failed to protect her.
Legault was obliged to personally step in when it became clear his junior health minister Lionel Carmant, a man with no political experience, was in over his head.
That incident sparked the government's decision in May to create a roaming commission to probe the system. Carmant has been assigned some veteran political handlers to help him.
In January, Legault also replaced his first choice as environment minister, MarieChantal ChassÃ©, who he conceded was not ready to handle the high-profile cabinet post. She was replaced by CAQ veteran BenoÃ®t Charette.
And true to his habit of rewarding his performing ministers with yet more work, Legault in August stripped struggling Culture and Communications Minister Nathalie Roy of the language file and handed it to Simon Jolin-Barrette, who piloted bills 9 and 21.
Nothing quite tops the antics of Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne, who in January boasted he had personally fired whistleblower Louis Robert, a ministry agronomist who warned of a potential conflict of interest between pesticide manufacturers and the Centre de recherche sur les grains. Again, Legault had to step in and apologize. Robert was rehired.
4 Place in Canada For a former sovereignist, Legault has thrived surprisingly well in his role representing Quebec in the federation even though he still will not say out loud that he is a proud Canadian. He did not attend any Canada Day events this year.
With the exception of the incident in December where he referred to Alberta oil as dirty energy, he has avoided dust-ups. He also made a number of forays into the United States and Ontario in his role as Hydro-QuÃ©bec's diplomatic export salesman.
It took the federal election to draw out how Legault really sees Quebec's future in the federation. In presenting his list of demands to the federal candidates, Legault spelled out his nationalist agenda and desire to recoup more powers from the federal government.
"They accept the same (federal) regime as the Liberal party," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said in reaction. "The only difference is they wave the flag more often."
5 Pulling on the green jeans For a party that campaigned in 2018 with virtually no environmental or climate-change platform, the first year has been a catch-up operation, starting with Legault's inaugural address, where he said he got the message on the issue. A year later, his tone is different.
"I think we have to salute young people like (teen activist) Greta Thunberg, who tells the citizens of the world we cannot do nothing," Legault told reporters last week. "The situation is alarming, it's worrisome. If we do nothing, the survival of the planet is at stake and that's not a small matter."
What will come of it? The opposition remains skeptical the government will take concrete actions, but the CAQ is promising an action plan for early in the new year. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier

Full text: QUEBEC - When Premier FranÃ§ois Legault talks about his accomplishments in office, one word inevitably pops up: pride.
He's proud to be premier and thinks he's been able to instil the same feeling in Quebecers - ending a period of sullenness.
"The most important thing for me is having respected our promises, especially when it comes to the pocketbooks of Quebecers," Legault told The Montreal Gazette last week as he arrived for question period.
"We started to reduce school taxes, we started to increase family allowances for children. We will continue down this path.
"I also think Quebecers believe we understand their concerns, they are satisfied with Bill 21 and that we respect their values, such as secularism. So Quebecers are experiencing a certain pride and I am proud of that."
As the government marks one year since the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec made history by breaking the Liberal and Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois stranglehold on power for 40 years and winning the Oct. 1, 2018, election, the mood is calm and confident.
The party has scheduled a general council meeting Nov. 2, where the anniversary will certainly be celebrated by the rank-and-file, but so far nothing special is on the calendar to mark the event.
"It's business as usual," said Legault's press aide, Ewan Sauves.
The comment reflects Legault's pragmatic, business-like approach to governing; where what's important is boosting the economy, improving health and education and above all ticking election promises off his list.
In some cases, the promises are "adjusted" versions of the original, but Legault nevertheless says he's sticking to his plan.
Take Legault's line last Thursday that a government can't go wrong by consulting the people in a referendum on the issue of electoral reform. It was not in the original CAQ playbook.
"It's a big political pirouette," veteran Le Soleil columnist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote Thursday( https://www.lesoleil.com/chroniques/jean-marc-salvet/pilule-doree-et-pirouette-politique-a-la-caq-6e00578be17c14ee6ebfb5625cf1aa1c ).
Indeed, critics say the CAQ government's biggest weakness is that it appears to be making it up as it goes along, improvising on the details behind ideas when the heat is on.
Last week, Legault made headlines when he declared the plan to build a $4-billion tunnel between Quebec City and LÃ©vis to ease traffic congestion is a green solution.
"I want Quebec to be the place in the world that has the most electric cars," he told the National Assembly. "But for those electric cars to circulate, we need roads, we need connectors."
Legault, nevertheless, has a big advantage. With the opposition parties in disarray and the economy booming, he is still surfing on his enormous popularity, confirmed most recently in a Forum Research poll( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-premier-francois-legault-is-in-the-political-drivers-seat-poll ) for the Montreal Gazette.
It showed Legault in the political driver's seat( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ) - particularly with francophone voters - with four out of 10 Quebecers supporting his government.
On Friday, the Angus Reid Institute( https://mailchi.mp/angusreid/premiers-performance-legault-moe-enjoy-highest-job-approval-ford-mcneil-round-out-bottom-ranks-5sr4dl53lp?e=84c5555b13 ) again put Legault at the top of the list among premiers in Canada as far as his approval rating goes.
It's true Legault and his government have made mistakes, but - at least on the big things - Legault admits them and moves on. For now, anyway, Quebecers seem to accept his style of operating because unlike some of his predecessors he does not dither.
A LÃ©ger poll published Saturday( https://www.journaldequebec.com/2019/09/28/un-score-assez-exceptionnel ) indicated 64 per cent of Quebecers are satisfied with the work of the CAQ government.
"It's hard to do better," said LÃ©ger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.
CAQ insiders say it has profited from the fact Quebecers are than more than happy to dump their old federalist-sovereignist labels after so many years. The result is that the party has cornered the market on the francophone nationalist vote.
"We forget this is the first time a brand new political party governs Quebec since 1976," said Eric Montigny, a political science professor at the UniversitÃ© Laval.
"What strikes me is that it has arrived in office and is governing in an orderly fashion. It's a government that was hyperactive in its first year. And its honeymoon is continuing."
Highlights of the CAQ government's first year A hyperactive government
One of the biggest achievements of the CAQ government has been its ability to implement change, which amounts to a mountain of cabinet and government decisions coupled with an avalanche of new legislation.
When the legislature adjourned in June, the government had presented 30 separate pieces of legislation, adopting 14. The strategy was to dispense with its two most controversial ideas - Bill 9 reforming the immigration system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/immigration-reform-bill-voted-into-law-by-caq-government-despite-opposition ) and Bill 21 on state secularism( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-passes-secularism-law-after-marathon-session ) - early in the mandate.
Several remain to be adopted, including Bill 2, increasing the legal age to consume cannabis from 18 to 21.
In the two weeks that the legislature has been sitting this fall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ), the CAQ tabled another half-dozen pieces of legislation, including Bill 39 reforming the electoral system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebecers-will-vote-on-electoral-reform-in-a-referendum-in-2022 ). It includes plans for a referendum at the same time as the 2022 election.
The government also has respected promises to ease the finances of Quebec's taxpayers, lowering school taxes and increasing family allowance payments for children. There will be more goodies in November when Finance Minister Eric Girard - sitting on a surplus of $4.3 billion - tables his second economic update.
Legault has already made it clear he wants to give any extra money back to taxpayers and not to the province's unions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-legault-warns-unions-they-wont-get-quebecs-surplus-cash ) seeking wage increases.
Tough times for minorities
Legault often tells the National Assembly's small band of English media reporters that he hopes the English-speaking community one day will start feeling good about the CAQ after the snubbing it in 2018.
Relations with minorities and the leadership of the community( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/majority-rules-mentality-a-cause-for-anglophone-fears-qcgn-says ) in particular have been a CAQ blind spot throughout the first year - creating the widespread impression the government lacks empathy.
Despite naming Christopher Skeete( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/caq-pledges-to-protect-rights-of-quebecs-english-speaking-communities ) parliamentary assistant to the premier for relations with English-speaking Quebecers, many anglophones can't get past Legault's Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois past. Things like the forced transfer of anglophone schools to the francophone network( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-orders-the-transfer-of-two-anglo-schools-to-cspi ) last June and bills 9 and 21 have not helped.
A LÃ©ger poll published in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anglophones-have-little-trust-in-caq-government-poll-suggests ) indicated the majority of English-speaking Quebecers feel the CAQ does not understand their concerns, and two-thirds have little trust in the government.
"There have been a series of government initiatives that are very worrying to the community," said Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network.

As a concession to try to patch up relations, Roberge's bill - as reported by The Montreal Gazette in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-offers-compromise-anglos-can-still-hold-school-elections ) - will include a compromise and allow the English boards to continue to hold elections of school board administrators, something the francophone system will lose.
"We are aware there is a perception we don't care as much about the minority," a top government official said Friday. "I think on school boards we have taken into account the historic place of the anglophone community.

She was replaced by CAQ party veteran BenoÃ®t Charette.
And true to his habit of rewarding his performing ministers with yet more work, Legault in August stripped struggling Culture and Communications Minister Nathalie Roy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/francois-legault-transfers-language-file-to-jolin-barrette-in-cabinet-shuffle ) of the language file to hand it to Simon Jolin-Barrette, who piloted Bills 9 and 21.
Nothing quite tops the antics of Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne, who, in January, boasted he had personally fired whistleblower Louis Robert, a ministry agronomist who warned of a potential conflict of interest between pesticide manufacturers and the Centre de recherche sur les grains.

He did not attend any Canada Day events this year.
With the exception of the incident in December where he referred to Alberta oil as dirty energy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-dismisses-alberta-backlash-over-dirty-energy-comment ), he has avoided dustups. He also made a number of forays into the United States and Ontario in his role as Hydro-QuÃ©bec's diplomatic export salesman.
It took the federal election to draw out how Legault really sees Quebec's future in the federation. In presenting his grocery list of demands to the federal candidates, Legault spelled out his nationalist agenda( https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/election-2019/premier-legault-says-he-wants-quebec-respected-in-federation ) and desire to recoup more powers from the federal government.
"They accept the same (federal) regime as the Liberal Party," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said in reaction. "The only difference is they wave the flag more often."

For a party that campaigned in 2018 with virtually no environmental or climate-change platform, the first year has been a catchup operation, starting with Legault's inaugural address, where he said he got the message on the issue.

"The situation is alarming, its worrisome. If we do nothing, the survival of the planet is at stake and that's not a small matter."
What will come of it? The opposition remains skeptical that the government will take concrete actions, but the CAQ is promising an action plan( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) for early in the new year.

And true to his habit of rewarding his performing ministers with yet more work, Legault in August stripped struggling Culture and Communications Minister Nathalie Roy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/francois-legault-transfers-language-file-to-jolin-barrette-in-cabinet-shuffle ) of the language file to hand it to Simon Jolin-Barrette, who piloted Bills 9 and 21.
Nothing quite tops the antics of Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne, who, in January, boasted he had personally fired whistleblower Louis Robert, a ministry agronomist who warned of a potential conflict of interest between pesticide manufacturers and the Centre de recherche sur les grains.
Again, Legault had to step in and apologize( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-offers-formal-apology-to-fired-whistleblower ). Robert has been rehired.
Place in Canada
For a former sovereignist, Legault has thrived surprisingly well in his role representing Quebec in the federation even though he still will not say out loud that he is a proud Canadian( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-roasted-for-refusing-to-say-he-is-a-proud-canadian-during-debate ). He did not attend any Canada Day events this year.
With the exception of the incident in December where he referred to Alberta oil as dirty energy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-dismisses-alberta-backlash-over-dirty-energy-comment ), he has avoided dustups. He also made a number of forays into the United States and Ontario in his role as Hydro-QuÃ©bec's diplomatic export salesman.
It took the federal election to draw out how Legault really sees Quebec's future in the federation. In presenting his grocery list of demands to the federal candidates, Legault spelled out his nationalist agenda( https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/election-2019/premier-legault-says-he-wants-quebec-respected-in-federation ) and desire to recoup more powers from the federal government.
"They accept the same (federal) regime as the Liberal Party," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said in reaction. "The only difference is they wave the flag more often."
Pulling on the green jeans
For a party that campaigned in 2018 with virtually no environmental or climate-change platform, the first year has been a catchup operation, starting with Legault's inaugural address, where he said he got the message on the issue.
A year later, his tone is completely different.
"I think we have to salute young people like (ecologist) Greta Thunberg( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-climate-march-we-are-the-change-greta-thunberg-tells-throng ), who tells the citizens of the world we cannot do nothing," Legault told reporters last week. "The situation is alarming, its worrisome. If we do nothing, the survival of the planet is at stake and that's not a small matter."
What will come of it? The opposition remains skeptical that the government will take concrete actions, but the CAQ is promising an action plan( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) for early in the new year.

Full text: QUEBEC - When Premier FranÃ§ois Legault talks about his accomplishments in office, one word inevitably pops up: pride.
He's proud to be premier and thinks he's been able to instil the same feeling in Quebecers - ending a period of sullenness.
"The most important thing for me is having respected our promises, especially when it comes to the pocketbooks of Quebecers," Legault told The Montreal Gazette last week as he arrived for question period.
"We started to reduce school taxes, we started to increase family allowances for children. We will continue down this path.
"I also think Quebecers believe we understand their concerns, they are satisfied with Bill 21 and that we respect their values, such as secularism. So Quebecers are experiencing a certain pride and I am proud of that."
As the government marks its first year in office Tuesday - the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec made history by breaking the Liberal and Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois stranglehold on power for 40 years and winning the Oct. 1, 2018, election - the mood is calm and confident.
The party has scheduled a general council meeting Nov. 2, where the anniversary will certainly be celebrated by the rank-and-file, but so far nothing special is on the calendar to mark the event.
"It's business as usual," said Legault's press aide, Ewan Sauves.
The comment reflects Legault's pragmatic, business-like approach to governing; where what's important is boosting the economy, improving health and education and above all ticking election promises off his list.
In some cases, the promises are "adjusted" versions of the original, but Legault nevertheless says he's sticking to his plan.
Take Legault's line last Thursday that a government can't go wrong by consulting the people in a referendum on the issue of electoral reform. It was not in the original CAQ playbook.
"It's a big political pirouette," veteran Le Soleil columnist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote Thursday( https://www.lesoleil.com/chroniques/jean-marc-salvet/pilule-doree-et-pirouette-politique-a-la-caq-6e00578be17c14ee6ebfb5625cf1aa1c ).
Indeed, critics say the CAQ government's biggest weakness is that it appears to be making it up as it goes along, improvising on the details behind ideas when the heat is on.
Last week, Legault made headlines when he declared the plan to build a $4-billion tunnel between Quebec City and LÃ©vis to ease traffic congestion is a green solution.
"I want Quebec to be the place in the world that has the most electric cars," he told the National Assembly. "But for those electric cars to circulate, we need roads, we need connectors."
Legault, nevertheless, has a big advantage. With the opposition parties in disarray and the economy booming, he is still surfing on his enormous popularity, confirmed most recently in a Forum Research poll( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-premier-francois-legault-is-in-the-political-drivers-seat-poll ) for the Montreal Gazette.
It showed Legault in the political driver's seat( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ) - particularly with francophone voters - with four out of 10 Quebecers supporting his government.
On Friday, the Angus Reid Institute( https://mailchi.mp/angusreid/premiers-performance-legault-moe-enjoy-highest-job-approval-ford-mcneil-round-out-bottom-ranks-5sr4dl53lp?e=84c5555b13 ) again put Legault at the top of the list among premiers in Canada as far as his approval rating goes.
It's true Legault and his government have made mistakes, but - at least on the big things - Legault admits them and moves on. For now, anyway, Quebecers seem to accept his style of operating because unlike some of his predecessors he does not dither.
A LÃ©ger poll published Saturday( https://www.journaldequebec.com/2019/09/28/un-score-assez-exceptionnel ) indicated 64 per cent of Quebecers are satisfied with the work of the CAQ government.
"It's hard to do better," said LÃ©ger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.
CAQ insiders say it has profited from the fact Quebecers are than more than happy to dump their old federalist-sovereignist labels after so many years. The result is that the party has cornered the market on the francophone nationalist vote.
"We forget this is the first time a brand new political party governs Quebec since 1976," said Eric Montigny, a political science professor at the UniversitÃ© Laval.
"What strikes me is that it has arrived in office and is governing in an orderly fashion. It's a government that was hyperactive in its first year. And its honeymoon is continuing."
Highlights of the CAQ government's first year A hyperactive government
One of the biggest achievements of the CAQ government has been its ability to implement change, which amounts to a mountain of cabinet and government decisions coupled with an avalanche of new legislation.
When the legislature adjourned in June, the government had presented 30 separate pieces of legislation, adopting 14. The strategy was to dispense with its two most controversial ideas - Bill 9 reforming the immigration system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/immigration-reform-bill-voted-into-law-by-caq-government-despite-opposition ) and Bill 21 on state secularism( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-passes-secularism-law-after-marathon-session ) - early in the mandate.
Several remain to be adopted, including Bill 2, increasing the legal age to consume cannabis from 18 to 21.
In the two weeks that the legislature has been sitting this fall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ), the CAQ tabled another half-dozen pieces of legislation, including Bill 39 reforming the electoral system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebecers-will-vote-on-electoral-reform-in-a-referendum-in-2022 ). It includes plans for a referendum at the same time as the 2022 election.
The government also has respected promises to ease the finances of Quebec's taxpayers, lowering school taxes and increasing family allowance payments for children. There will be more goodies in November when Finance Minister Eric Girard - sitting on a surplus of $4.3 billion - tables his second economic update.
Legault has already made it clear he wants to give any extra money back to taxpayers and not to the province's unions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-legault-warns-unions-they-wont-get-quebecs-surplus-cash ) seeking wage increases.
Tough times for minorities
Legault often tells the National Assembly's small band of English media reporters that he hopes the English-speaking community one day will start feeling good about the CAQ after the snubbing it in 2018.
Relations with minorities and the leadership of the community( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/majority-rules-mentality-a-cause-for-anglophone-fears-qcgn-says ) in particular have been a CAQ blind spot throughout the first year - creating the widespread impression the government lacks empathy.
Despite naming Christopher Skeete( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/caq-pledges-to-protect-rights-of-quebecs-english-speaking-communities ) parliamentary assistant to the premier for relations with English-speaking Quebecers, many anglophones can't get past Legault's Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois past. Things like the forced transfer of anglophone schools to the francophone network( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-orders-the-transfer-of-two-anglo-schools-to-cspi ) last June and bills 9 and 21 have not helped.
A LÃ©ger poll published in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anglophones-have-little-trust-in-caq-government-poll-suggests ) indicated the majority of English-speaking Quebecers feel the CAQ does not understand their concerns, and two-thirds have little trust in the government.
"There have been a series of government initiatives that are very worrying to the community," said Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network.
It's not over. On Tuesday, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge will table legislation to transform Quebec's 72 school boards - including the nine anglophone boards - into service centres despite the staunch opposition of the community.
As a concession to try to patch up relations, Roberge's bill - as reported by The Montreal Gazette in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-offers-compromise-anglos-can-still-hold-school-elections ) - will include a compromise and allow the English boards to continue to hold elections of school board administrators, something the francophone system will lose.
"We are aware there is a perception we don't care as much about the minority," a top government official said Friday. "I think on school boards we have taken into account the historic place of the anglophone community.
"We are not insensitive to the community's demands. They have not fallen on deaf ears. We care."
Troubled waters
One of the government's early gaffes was fumbling after the tragic death of a seven-year-old girl in Granby( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lionel-carmant-outraged-by-seven-year-old-girls-death-in-granby ), when the province's youth protection system failed to protect her.
Legault was obliged to personally step in when it became clear his junior health minister, Lionel Carmant, a man with no political experience, was in over his head.
That incident sparked the government's decision in May to create a roaming commission to probe the system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-announces-laurent-commission-in-wake-of-granby-childs-death ). Carmant has been assigned some veteran political handlers to help him.
It's a long way back in January, but Legault also replaced his first choice as environment minister, MarieChantal ChassÃ©( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/francois-legault-turfs-controversial-environment-minister ), who he conceded was not ready to handle the high-profile cabinet post. She was replaced by CAQ party veteran BenoÃ®t Charette.
And true to his habit of rewarding his performing ministers with yet more work, Legault in August stripped struggling Culture and Communications Minister Nathalie Roy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/francois-legault-transfers-language-file-to-jolin-barrette-in-cabinet-shuffle ) of the language file to hand it to Simon Jolin-Barrette, who piloted Bills 9 and 21.

Again, Legault had to step in and apologize( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-offers-formal-apology-to-fired-whistleblower ). Robert has been rehired.
Place in Canada
For a former sovereignist, Legault has thrived surprisingly well in his role representing Quebec in the federation even though he still will not say out loud that he is a proud Canadian( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-roasted-for-refusing-to-say-he-is-a-proud-canadian-during-debate ). He did not attend any Canada Day events this year.
With the exception of the incident in December where he referred to Alberta oil as dirty energy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-dismisses-alberta-backlash-over-dirty-energy-comment ), he has avoided dustups. He also made a number of forays into the United States and Ontario in his role as Hydro-QuÃ©bec's diplomatic export salesman.
It took the federal election to draw out how Legault really sees Quebec's future in the federation. In presenting his grocery list of demands to the federal candidates, Legault spelled out his nationalist agenda( https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/election-2019/premier-legault-says-he-wants-quebec-respected-in-federation ) and desire to recoup more powers from the federal government.
"They accept the same (federal) regime as the Liberal Party," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said in reaction. "The only difference is they wave the flag more often."
Pulling on the green jeans
For a party that campaigned in 2018 with virtually no environmental or climate-change platform, the first year has been a catchup operation starting with Legault's inaugural address, where he said he got the message on the issue.
A year later, his tone is completely different.
"I think we have to salute young people like (ecologist) Greta Thunberg( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-climate-march-we-are-the-change-greta-thunberg-tells-throng ) who tells the citizens of the world we cannot do nothing," Legault told reporters last week. "The situation is alarming, its worrisome. If we do nothing, the survival of the planet is at stake and that's not a small matter."
What will come of it? The opposition remains skeptical that the government will take concrete actions, but the CAQ is promising an action plan( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) for early in the new year.

Full text: QUEBEC - When Premier FranÃ§ois Legault talks about his accomplishments in office, one word inevitably pops up: pride.
He's proud to be premier and thinks he's been able to instil the same feeling in Quebecers - ending a period of sullenness.
"The most important thing for me is having respected our promises, especially when it comes to the pocketbooks of Quebecers," Legault told The Montreal Gazette this week as he arrived for question period.
"We started to reduce school taxes, we started to increase family allowances for children. We will continue down this path.
"I also think Quebecers believe we understand their concerns, they are satisfied with Bill 21 and that we respect their values, such as secularism. So Quebecers are experiencing a certain pride and I am proud of that."
As the government marks its first year in office Tuesday - the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec made history by breaking the Liberal and Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois stranglehold on power for 40 years and winning the Oct. 1, 2018, election - the mood is calm and confident.
The party has scheduled a general council meeting Nov. 2 where the anniversary will certainly be celebrated by the rank-and-file, but so far nothing special is on the calendar to mark the event.
"It's business as usual," said Legault's press aide, Ewan Sauves.
The comment reflect's Legault's pragmatic, business-like approach to governing; where what's important is boosting the economy, improving health and education and above all ticking election promises off his list.
In some cases, the promises are "adjusted" versions of the original, but Legault nevertheless says he's sticking to his plan.
Take Legault's line last Thursday that a government can't go wrong by consulting the people in a referendum on the issue of electoral reform. It was not in the original CAQ playbook.
"It's a big political pirouette," veteran Le Soleil columnist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote Thursday.
Indeed, critics say the CAQ government's biggest weakness is that it appears to be making it up as it goes along, improvising on the details behind ideas when the heat is on.
Last week, Legault made headlines when he declared the plan to build a $4-billion tunnel between Quebec City and LÃ©vis to ease traffic congestion is a green solution.
"I want Quebec to be the place in the world that has the most electric cars," he told the National Assembly. "But for those electric cars to circulate, we need roads, we need connectors."
Legault, nevertheless, has a big advantage. With the opposition parties in disarray and the economy booming, he is still surfing on his on his enormous popularity, confirmed most recently in a Forum Research poll( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-premier-francois-legault-is-in-the-political-drivers-seat-poll ) for the Montreal Gazette.
It showed Legault in the political driver's seat( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ) - particularly with francophone voters - with four out of 10 Quebecers supporting his government.
On Friday, the Angus Reid Institute( https://mailchi.mp/angusreid/premiers-performance-legault-moe-enjoy-highest-job-approval-ford-mcneil-round-out-bottom-ranks-5sr4dl53lp?e=84c5555b13 ) again put Legault at the top of the list among premiers in Canada as far as his approval rating goes.
It's true Legault and his government have made mistakes, but - at least on the big things - Legault admits them and moves on. For now, anyway, Quebecers seem to accept his style of operating because unlike some of his predecessors he does not dither.
A LÃ©ger poll published Saturday( https://www.journaldequebec.com/2019/09/28/un-score-assez-exceptionnel ) indicated 64 per cent of Quebecers are satisfied with the work of the CAQ government.
"It's hard to do better," said LÃ©ger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.
CAQ insiders say it has profited from the fact Quebecers are than more than happy to dump their old federalist-sovereignist labels after so many years. The result is that the party has cornered the market on the francophone nationalist vote.
"We forget this is the first time a brand new political party governs Quebec since 1976," said Eric Montigny, a political science professor at the UniversitÃ© Laval.
"What strikes me is that it has arrived in office and is governing in an orderly fashion. It's a government which was hyperactive in its first year. And it's honeymoon is continuing."
Highlights of the CAQ government's first year A hyperactive government
One of the biggest achievements of the CAQ government has been its ability to implement change, which amounts to a mountain of cabinet and government decisions coupled with an avalanche of new legislation.
When the legislature adjourned in June, the government had presented 30 separate pieces of legislation, adopting 14. The strategy was to dispense with its two most controversial ideas - Bill 9 reforming the immigration system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/immigration-reform-bill-voted-into-law-by-caq-government-despite-opposition ) and Bill 21 on state secularism( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-passes-secularism-law-after-marathon-session ) - early in the mandate.
Several remain to be adopted, including Bill 2, increasing the legal age to consume cannabis from 18 to 21.
In the two weeks that the legislature has been sitting this fall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-in-the-drivers-seat-legault-tells-quebecers-to-brace-for-change ), the CAQ tabled another half-dozen pieces of legislation, including Bill 39 reforming the electoral system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebecers-will-vote-on-electoral-reform-in-a-referendum-in-2022 ). It includes plans for a referendum at the same time as the 2022 election.
The government also has respected promises to ease the finances of Quebec's taxpayers, lowering school taxes and increasing family allowance payments for children. There will be more goodies in November when Finance Minister Eric Girard - sitting on a surplus of $4.3 billion - tables his second economic update.
Legault has already made it clear he wants to give any extra money back to taxpayers and not to the province's unions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-legault-warns-unions-they-wont-get-quebecs-surplus-cash ) seeking wage increases.
Tough times for minorities
Legault often tells the National Assembly's small band of English media reporters that he hopes the English-speaking community one day will start feeling good about the CAQ after the snubbing it in 2018.
Relations with minorities and the leadership of the community( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/majority-rules-mentality-a-cause-for-anglophone-fears-qcgn-says ) in particular have been a CAQ blind spot throughout the first year - creating the widespread impression the government lacks empathy.
Despite naming Christopher Skeete( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/caq-pledges-to-protect-rights-of-quebecs-english-speaking-communities ) parliamentary assistant to the premier for relations with English-speaking Quebecers, many anglophones can't get past Legault's Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois past. Things like the forced transfer of anglophone schools to the francophone network( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-orders-the-transfer-of-two-anglo-schools-to-cspi ) last June and bills 9 and 21 have not helped.
A LÃ©ger poll published in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anglophones-have-little-trust-in-caq-government-poll-suggests ) indicated the majority of English-speaking Quebecers feel the CAQ does not understand their concerns, and two-thirds have little trust in the government.
"There have been a series of government initiatives that are very worrying to the community," said Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network.
It's not over. On Tuesday, Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge will table legislation to transform Quebec's 72 school boards - including the nine anglophone boards - into service centres despite the staunch opposition of the community.
As a concession to try to patch up relations, Roberge's bill - as reported by The Montreal Gazette in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-offers-compromise-anglos-can-still-hold-school-elections ) - will include a compromise and allow the English boards to continue to hold elections of school board administrators, something the francophone system will lose.
"We are aware there is a perception we don't care as much about the minority," a top government official said Friday. "I think on school boards we have taken into account the historic place of the anglophone community.
"We are not insensitive to the community's demands. They have not fallen on deaf ears. We care."
Troubled waters
One of the government's early gaffes was fumbling after the tragic death of a seven year old girl in Granby( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lionel-carmant-outraged-by-seven-year-old-girls-death-in-granby ), when the province's youth protection system failed to protect her.
Legault was obliged to personally step in when it became clear his junior health minister, Lionel Carmant, a man with no political experience, was in over his head.
That incident sparked the government's decision in May to create a roaming commission to probe the system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-announces-laurent-commission-in-wake-of-granby-childs-death ). Carmant has been assigned some veteran political handlers to help him.
It's a long way back in January, but Legault also replaced his first choice as environment minister, MarieChantal ChassÃ©( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/francois-legault-turfs-controversial-environment-minister ) who, he conceded, was not ready to handle the high-profile cabinet post. She was replaced by CAQ party veteran BenoÃ®t Charette.
And true to his habit of rewarding his performing ministers with yet more work, Legault in August stripped struggling Culture and Communications Minister Nathalie Roy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/francois-legault-transfers-language-file-to-jolin-barrette-in-cabinet-shuffle ) of the language file to hand it to Simon Jolin-Barrette, who piloted Bills 9 and 21.
Nothing quite tops the antics of Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne, who, in January, boasted he had personally fired whistle-blower Louis Robert, a ministry agronomist who warned of a potential conflict of interest between pesticide manufacturers and the Centre de recherche sur les grains.
Again, Legault had to step in and apologize( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-offers-formal-apology-to-fired-whistleblower ). Robert has been rehired.

Climate crisis as election catalyst: Will it change votes in Quebec?

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/climate-crisis-as-election-catalyst-will-change/docview/2299266928/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Climate change has surged to the top of voter concern lists across the country during this federal campaign, nowhere more so than here in Quebec, where politicians are scrambling to respond to an unprecedented public call to action on the climate crisis.
On Friday, Montreal was the backdrop to a massive climate rally, and dozens of other marches, protests and strikes demanding climate action took place all across Quebec and around the world this week. A number of federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's event, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre. Some businesses closed for the day on Friday, and many schools, CÃGEPs and universities cancelled classes or closed for the day to encourage participation by students, teachers and employees.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. "Whether or not that translates into what party they vote for come election day, that remains to be seen, but it's probably one of the first elections in which the environment, which is rarely an election issue, might actually be one."
Lachapelle is one of the lead researchers on the Canadian Climate Opinion Maps( https://www.umontreal.ca/climat/engl/index.html ) project, an interactive map that allows voters and politicians to take the pulse of climate change awareness at the riding level. Using national surveys of more than 9,000 respondents from 2011-2018, the latest version of the project suggests 83 per cent of Canadians, and 89 per cent of Quebecers, believe that the planet is getting warmer. According to the map, a majority in every single riding in the country now believe the climate is changing and 79 per cent of Quebecers say this province is already experiencing the impacts of climate change.
Federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's climate march Friday, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre.
The map offers up some interesting surprises. For example, more than half of those surveyed in the riding of Beauce - where People's Party of Canada Leader and climate change denier Maxime Bernier is seeking re-election - agreed with the scientific consensus that "Earth is getting warmer partly or mostly because of human activity."
And support for the idea of putting a price on carbon pollution is quite popular in the 12 Quebec ridings that voted Conservative in the 2015 election. In those ridings, support for a cap and trade system, which Quebec already has in place, hovers around 60 per cent, while support for the idea of increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are campaigning on a promise to scrap the carbon tax.
Lachapelle flagged the spike in Quebecers' concern about climate change in the fall of 2018. He suggests awareness began to rise with the springtime flood waters in 2017 and surged again when QuÃ©bec Solidaire put climate change firmly onto the political agenda during the 2018 provincial election. That October, the International Panel on Climate Change warned the world had little more than a decade to reduce CO2 emissions by 45 per cent in order to avoid the large-scale drought, famine, species loss, heat wave deaths, poverty and other dire consequences of warming beyond 1.5 degrees C. Record flooding in Quebec again last spring has only heightened awareness.
A recent Ipsos poll( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) suggests that 34 per cent of Quebecers say climate change will be the most important issue in determining how they will vote, almost on par with health care, which 35 per cent said was their number one concern. In Canada as a whole, 25 per cent said climate change was their key issue, after health care (35 per cent) and affordability and cost of living (27 per cent).
This week on the campaign trail, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer made a stop in Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding, where he raised the issue of the SNC-Lavalin scandal( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/elections-pmn/canadas-conservative-leader-pledges-judicial-inquiry-into-trudeau-ethics-breach/wcm/2bd89d04-eea2-4d38-9f1c-729fcd513158 ). He might want to take note of another recent poll( http://forumpoll.com/post/3033/environment-or-ethics-qc-2019/ ) that suggested 63 per cent of Quebecers say the environment is more important to their voting choice than issues of ethics.
Environmentalist Steven Guilbeault, the Liberal Party's star candidate in Quebec, says: "I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it."
Trudeau, meanwhile, has been touting his Liberal Party( https://www.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf ) as the only one that can really deliver on climate protection. The party's star candidate in Quebec is Steven Guilbeault, a lifelong environmental activist who campaigned for Greenpeace for many years before he co-founded the environmental group Ãquiterre in 1998. He is running in Laurier-Saint-Marie riding. Guilbeault admits he took some flack from friends and fellow environmentalists when he joined the Liberals, considering the party approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/poll-most-quebecers-dont-want-to-see-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-expand )in its first mandate and then bought the project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion.
In a recent interview, Guilbeault said he disagrees with his party's decisions on Trans Mountain, but he nonetheless chose to run with the Liberals because of their performance on climate issues.
In its first mandate, he notes, the Liberal government managed to put a price on carbon pollution across the country, committed to eliminating coal plants by 2030, and is investing significantly in renewable energy. This week, Guilbeault announced the Liberals, if re-elected will commit Canada to attaining zero net emissions of carbon pollution by 2050.
"Concretely, that means we would not produce more emissions than we eliminate. To be honest, it is an ambitious target." He said the party would enshrine that target in a new law.
"This doesn't mean changing our lifestyles or eliminating our industries in a drastic way. It requires a transition. We would compensate for emissions produced with measures and technologies that capture carbon pollution, like planting trees, for example."
Guilbeault acknowledges that the Green Party and the New Democratic Party also have strong programs on climate change.
"Fundamentally, if you look beyond some of the nuances, we all want to put a price on carbon, we want more transit, we want more green technologies, more electrification, we want less money to go to fossil fuel companies," he said.
But Guilbeault said he joined the Liberals because he didn't believe the NDP or the Greens have a chance of forming the government any time soon.
"I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it. I don't think, unfortunately, that my NDP or Green friends can say the same thing, with all the respect I have for them."
In the last federal election, the Liberals took 35.7 per cent of the vote in Quebec, the NDP took 25.4, the Bloc 19.3, the Conservatives 16.7, and the Greens 2.3.
Daniel Green, a well-known whistle-blower on environmental issues and the Green Party's deputy leader, says: "We will not save the environment by investing in oil."
The Green Party( https://www.greenparty.ca/sites/default/files/platform_2019_en_web_-_update_sep17.pdf ), led by Elizabeth May, has its own star environmental candidate in Quebec. The party's deputy leader, Daniel Green, a well-known toxicologist and whistle-blower on environmental issues, is running in Outremont riding.
Green held a news conference this week in Montreal to denounce the other parties for supporting, or at least not denouncing loudly enough, a proposed natural gas pipeline project that he says is a "symbol of what is wrong with energy development in Canada."
The scheme would bring natural gas along a 750-kilometre pipeline from B.C. and Alberta through northern Ontario into Quebec, across Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue to a proposed liquefaction plant in La Baie in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. From there, the liquified natural gas would be transported via tankers down the Saguenay River to the St. Lawrence, through a protected feeding area for the endangered beluga whale. The goal is to export 11 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year to overseas markets.
The Quebec government seems favourable to the project, despite the fact that about 50,000 Quebecers so far have signed a petition against it. GNL QuÃ©bec, the company developing the liquefaction plant part of the project (Ãnergie Saguenay), is expected to submit its project to the independent Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE), which will advise the Quebec government. The provincial and federal governments will also assess the environmental impact of the project, possibly in three separate parts: the pipeline, liquefaction plant and maritime transportation, which Green says will make it difficult to assess its overall impact on emissions.
Green estimates the project will generate 7.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, and says all the other parties have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward it, waiting for studies by the BAPE and others. The Green Party platform calls for cancelling all new fossil fuel pipeline projects, including Trans Mountain and GNL QuÃ©bec's project. The Greens would allow existing oil and gas operations to continue but on a declining basis, with bitumen production phased out by 2035.
Green said there is simply no way Trudeau can reach his zero net emissions target by 2050 if his government keeps approving pipelines to transport fossil fuels.
"Justin Trudeau has to stop being schizophrenic. We will not save the environment by investing in oil," Green said.
For his part, Guilbeault acknowledged he has concerns about increased tanker traffic in the Saguenay River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and suggested the entire project could be subjected to a joint federal-provincial environmental assessment. He said a Liberal government would not approve such a project unless it could compensate for its carbon emissions.
"Our very ambitious target for 2050 will need to be taken into account when evaluating the impacts of projects. If your project is going to emit a lot of greenhouse gases, you will have to show how you will compensate for those over time," he said.
While NDP( https://www.ndp.ca ) Leader Jagmeet Singh has not taken a position on the GNL QuÃ©bec project, his deputy leader in Quebec, Alexandre Boulerice, made his own position clear in a recent interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"The question of GNL shouldn't even be asked ... It's just not realistic if we are serious and coherent about the climate emergency," said Boulerice, who is the NDP incumbent in the riding of Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie.
The floods of 2017 and 2019 sensitized Montrealers and the rest of Quebec to the scope of the climate crisis.
Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois( https://www.blocquebecois.org/ ) Leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who declared recently on Quebec's most popular talk show, Tout le monde en parle, that the Bloc "has the most green and ecological program of all the federal parties," has said he will wait for the BAPE's advice on GNL QuÃ©bec's project.
Blanchet took over as leader of the teetering party in January, and said he sees this election campaign as "an opportunity to really attach the idea of the environment to the idea of (Quebec's) independence." On the campaign trail, Blanchet is taking every opportunity to tell Quebecers how much greener Quebec is than the rest of Canada and how the federal government is using Quebec taxpayers' money to expand pipeline projects and invest in fossil fuel projects.
"For more than 100 years, Quebec has been operating on clean energy, but Ottawa, even as recently as this past mandate, sunk $19 billion into new investments in fossil fuel energy," Blanchet said earlier this month in Mont-Laurier.
Blanchet is proposing a new scheme to replace equalization payments, through which the federal government helps so-called "have-not" provinces, with a program that would reward provinces with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and penalize those with higher emissions. He said Quebec would be entitled to "at least as big a cheque" as it gets now, if not more.
But the NDP's Boulerice said the Bloc's credibility on environmental issues is "a bit stained" by decisions Blanchet made when he was environment minister of Quebec.
"Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet clearly opened the door to the exploitation of oil on Anticosti Island. So when he accuses Canada of being a petrol state," he is being hypocritical, Boulerice suggested. He noted that as environment minister, Blanchet also green-lighted a heavily polluting cement factory in the GaspÃ© and approved the inversion of Enbridge's 9B pipeline.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. The climate rally on Friday demonstrates that.
As for the Greens, Boulerice said: "The biggest difference between the NDP and the Greens is that our program is based on environmental justice but also social and economic justice. We can't fight climate change if we don't fight social inequalities at the same time ... notably by taxing the super rich and helping people in need."
"And what distinguishes us from the Liberals is that we don't buy pipelines," Boulerice said. He described the Liberal Party's promise of net zero emissions by 2050 as a "bedtime story for children ... completely ridiculous."
"The Conservatives are at least consistent," Boulerice said. "They say they will exploit all the gas and oil imaginable and hope for a kind of miracle solution (to climate change), the magic wand of technology will solve everything."
Scheer has indeed made it clear the Conservatives favour natural gas projects like GNL QuÃ©bec. Richard Martel, the Conservative incumbent in the riding of Chicoutimi-Le Fjord where the liquefaction plant would be built, touts the jobs it would bring. Conservatives say Canada's natural gas could replace dirtier fuels in foreign markets.
When Scheer annouced his party's climate plan( https://arealplan.ca ) in Gatineau in June, he called it "the most comprehensive environmental platform ever put forward by a political party in Canada." A Conservative government would impose emissions limits on heavy industrial emitters and require companies that exceed those limits to make investments in research into emissions-reduction technology. The plan also includes tax credits for homeowners to encourage energy-saving retrofits. Scheer hasn't committed to a specific emissions reduction target, but says only that his plan "gives Canada the best possible chance of achieving" the Paris Agreement target of 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.
The Conservatives would scrap the carbon tax that the Trudeau government has imposed on provinces that refused to put a price on carbon pollution and his campaign is mainly focused on warning Canadians that the carbon tax will shoot up if the Liberals get back into power.
That kind of talk may not go over well in Quebec, a province that introduced its own carbon tax in 2007, without major opposition. That tax was replaced by a cap and trade program in 2012 when Quebec joined the Western Climate Initiative. The program puts limits on industrial sites and on businesses that import or distribute oil or fuels sold in Quebec for use in the transportation or building sectors. Those who exceed their cap must buy credits, while those who emit less than their limits can sell credits. The money raised from the carbon market goes into a provincial green fund, to be used for environmental protection projects.
This has meant slightly higher gas prices in Quebec, but the populace has not revolted, notes Chris Ragan, an economist at McGill University and director of the Max Bell School of Public Policy. "Nobody debates this in Quebec. It is not debated at the lunch table, in the streets or by political parties."
So he doesn't think Conservatives will improve their fortunes in Quebec by fear-mongering about a carbon tax that doesn't even apply here or by threatening to cut the clean fuel standard, which Scheer has called a hidden carbon price.
"If the logic is that any policy that has a cost is a hidden carbon price, then you are going to do nothing on climate," Ragan said. "They say they will promote technological advancement and that's great but it's aspirational. It's not really a policy designed to reduce emissions."
Then there is the People's Party of Canada( https://www.peoplespartyofcanada.ca/global_warming_and_environment_rejecting_alarmism_and_focusing_on_concrete_improvements ), the only one of the six parties with a chance of winning a seat in parliament that actually denies scientists' assertions that climate change is caused by human activity or that fighting it is an urgent issue.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/environment-groups-warned-saying-climate-is-real-could-be-seen-as-partisan/wcm/fb839786-afc9-4b41-8364-2535a71c880f )
"The main reason for climate change, it is not human activity," Bernier said at his party's first convention in August. In its platform, the party promises to pull Canada out of the Paris Accord, abolish the carbon tax and "leave it to provincial governments to adopt programs to reduce emissions if they want to," abolish subsidies for green technologies and invest in adaptation strategies "if problems arise as a result of any natural climate change."
In the end, observers agree the parties that are taking the climate crisis seriously have the best chance of winning over voters in Quebec.
In Ragan's opinion, the Liberals are on solid ground with their climate plan, but they need to do a better job explaining to Quebecers how pipelines fit into it. The NDP and the Greens will appeal to what he called "hardcore environmentalists" for their calls for stronger emissions targets, although he said many voters, including himself, worry Canada's economy would suffer if heavy industrial emitters aren't cut some slack. The Conservatives, he said, might win some votes by emphasizing other kinds of environmental action, but if they avoid explaining how their plan will reduce emissions, "they are probably the most vulnerable" of the mainstream parties in Quebec.
But with three weeks to go before the vote, Ragan says it's too soon to say whether the climate change issue will truly decide the election, even in Quebec.
"Federal elections are like the Grey Cup. You don't leave the stadium in the last five minutes, because stuff can change."

Full text: Climate change has surged to the top of voter concern lists across the country during this federal campaign, nowhere more so than here in Quebec, where politicians are scrambling to respond to an unprecedented public call to action on the climate crisis.
On Friday, Montreal was the backdrop to a massive climate rally, and dozens of other marches, protests and strikes demanding climate action took place all across Quebec and around the world this week. A number of federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's event, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre. Some businesses closed for the day on Friday, and many schools, CÃGEPs and universities cancelled classes or closed for the day to encourage participation by students, teachers and employees.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. "Whether or not that translates into what party they vote for come election day, that remains to be seen, but it's probably one of the first elections in which the environment, which is rarely an election issue, might actually be one."
Lachapelle is one of the lead researchers on the Canadian Climate Opinion Maps( https://www.umontreal.ca/climat/engl/index.html ) project, an interactive map that allows voters and politicians to take the pulse of climate change awareness at the riding level. Using national surveys of more than 9,000 respondents from 2011-2018, the latest version of the project suggests 83 per cent of Canadians, and 89 per cent of Quebecers, believe that the planet is getting warmer. According to the map, a majority in every single riding in the country now believe the climate is changing and 79 per cent of Quebecers say this province is already experiencing the impacts of climate change.
Federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's climate march Friday, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre.
The map offers up some interesting surprises. For example, more than half of those surveyed in the riding of Beauce - where People's Party of Canada Leader and climate change denier Maxime Bernier is seeking re-election - agreed with the scientific consensus that "Earth is getting warmer partly or mostly because of human activity."
And support for the idea of putting a price on carbon pollution is quite popular in the 12 Quebec ridings that voted Conservative in the 2015 election. In those ridings, support for a cap and trade system, which Quebec already has in place, hovers around 60 per cent, while support for the idea of increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are campaigning on a promise to scrap the carbon tax.
Lachapelle flagged the spike in Quebecers' concern about climate change in the fall of 2018. He suggests awareness began to rise with the springtime flood waters in 2017 and surged again when QuÃ©bec Solidaire put climate change firmly onto the political agenda during the 2018 provincial election. That October, the International Panel on Climate Change warned the world had little more than a decade to reduce CO2 emissions by 45 per cent in order to avoid the large-scale drought, famine, species loss, heat wave deaths, poverty and other dire consequences of warming beyond 1.5 degrees C. Record flooding in Quebec again last spring has only heightened awareness.
A recent Ipsos poll( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) suggests that 34 per cent of Quebecers say climate change will be the most important issue in determining how they will vote, almost on par with health care, which 35 per cent said was their number one concern. In Canada as a whole, 25 per cent said climate change was their key issue, after health care (35 per cent) and affordability and cost of living (27 per cent).
This week on the campaign trail, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer made a stop in Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding, where he raised the issue of the SNC-Lavalin scandal( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/elections-pmn/canadas-conservative-leader-pledges-judicial-inquiry-into-trudeau-ethics-breach/wcm/2bd89d04-eea2-4d38-9f1c-729fcd513158 ). He might want to take note of another recent poll( http://forumpoll.com/post/3033/environment-or-ethics-qc-2019/ ) that suggested 63 per cent of Quebecers say the environment is more important to their voting choice than issues of ethics.
Environmentalist Steven Guilbeault, the Liberal Party's star candidate in Quebec, says: "I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it."
Trudeau, meanwhile, has been touting his Liberal Party( https://www.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf ) as the only one that can really deliver on climate protection. The party's star candidate in Quebec is Steven Guilbeault, a lifelong environmental activist who campaigned for Greenpeace for many years before he co-founded the environmental group Ãquiterre in 1998. He is running in Laurier-Saint-Marie riding. Guilbeault admits he took some flack from friends and fellow environmentalists when he joined the Liberals, considering the party approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/poll-most-quebecers-dont-want-to-see-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-expand )in its first mandate and then bought the project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion.
In a recent interview, Guilbeault said he disagrees with his party's decisions on Trans Mountain, but he nonetheless chose to run with the Liberals because of their performance on climate issues.
In its first mandate, he notes, the Liberal government managed to put a price on carbon pollution across the country, committed to eliminating coal plants by 2030, and is investing significantly in renewable energy. This week, Guilbeault announced the Liberals, if re-elected will commit Canada to attaining zero net emissions of carbon pollution by 2050.
"Concretely, that means we would not produce more emissions than we eliminate. To be honest, it is an ambitious target." He said the party would enshrine that target in a new law.
"This doesn't mean changing our lifestyles or eliminating our industries in a drastic way. It requires a transition. We would compensate for emissions produced with measures and technologies that capture carbon pollution, like planting trees, for example."
Guilbeault acknowledges that the Green Party and the New Democratic Party also have strong programs on climate change.
"Fundamentally, if you look beyond some of the nuances, we all want to put a price on carbon, we want more transit, we want more green technologies, more electrification, we want less money to go to fossil fuel companies," he said.
But Guilbeault said he joined the Liberals because he didn't believe the NDP or the Greens have a chance of forming the government any time soon.
"I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it. I don't think, unfortunately, that my NDP or Green friends can say the same thing, with all the respect I have for them."
In the last federal election, the Liberals took 35.7 per cent of the vote in Quebec, the NDP took 25.4, the Bloc 19.3, the Conservatives 16.7, and the Greens 2.3.
Daniel Green, a well-known whistle-blower on environmental issues and the Green Party's deputy leader, says: "We will not save the environment by investing in oil."
The Green Party( https://www.greenparty.ca/sites/default/files/platform_2019_en_web_-_update_sep17.pdf ), led by Elizabeth May, has its own star environmental candidate in Quebec. The party's deputy leader, Daniel Green, a well-known toxicologist and whistle-blower on environmental issues, is running in Outremont riding.
Green held a news conference this week in Montreal to denounce the other parties for supporting, or at least not denouncing loudly enough, a proposed natural gas pipeline project that he says is a "symbol of what is wrong with energy development in Canada."
The scheme would bring natural gas along a 750-kilometre pipeline from B.C. and Alberta through northern Ontario into Quebec, across Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue to a proposed liquefaction plant in La Baie in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. From there, the liquified natural gas would be transported via tankers down the Saguenay River to the St. Lawrence, through a protected feeding area for the endangered beluga whale. The goal is to export 11 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year to overseas markets.
The Quebec government seems favourable to the project, despite the fact that about 50,000 Quebecers so far have signed a petition against it. GNL QuÃ©bec, the company developing the liquefaction plant part of the project (Ãnergie Saguenay), is expected to submit its project to the independent Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE), which will advise the Quebec government. The provincial and federal governments will also assess the environmental impact of the project, possibly in three separate parts: the pipeline, liquefaction plant and maritime transportation, which Green says will make it difficult to assess its overall impact on emissions.
Green estimates the project will generate 7.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, and says all the other parties have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward it, waiting for studies by the BAPE and others. The Green Party platform calls for cancelling all new fossil fuel pipeline projects, including Trans Mountain and GNL QuÃ©bec's project. The Greens would allow existing oil and gas operations to continue but on a declining basis, with bitumen production phased out by 2035.
Green said there is simply no way Trudeau can reach his zero net emissions target by 2050 if his government keeps approving pipelines to transport fossil fuels.
"Justin Trudeau has to stop being schizophrenic. We will not save the environment by investing in oil," Green said.
For his part, Guilbeault acknowledged he has concerns about increased tanker traffic in the Saguenay River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and suggested the entire project could be subjected to a joint federal-provincial environmental assessment. He said a Liberal government would not approve such a project unless it could compensate for its carbon emissions.
"Our very ambitious target for 2050 will need to be taken into account when evaluating the impacts of projects. If your project is going to emit a lot of greenhouse gases, you will have to show how you will compensate for those over time," he said.
While NDP( https://www.ndp.ca ) Leader Jagmeet Singh has not taken a position on the GNL QuÃ©bec project, his deputy leader in Quebec, Alexandre Boulerice, made his own position clear in a recent interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"The question of GNL shouldn't even be asked ... It's just not realistic if we are serious and coherent about the climate emergency," said Boulerice, who is the NDP incumbent in the riding of Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie.
The floods of 2017 and 2019 sensitized Montrealers and the rest of Quebec to the scope of the climate crisis.
Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois( https://www.blocquebecois.org/ ) Leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who declared recently on Quebec's most popular talk show, Tout le monde en parle, that the Bloc "has the most green and ecological program of all the federal parties," has said he will wait for the BAPE's advice on GNL QuÃ©bec's project.

According to the map, a majority in every single riding in the country now believe the climate is changing and 79 per cent of Quebecers say this province is already experiencing the impacts of climate change.
Federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's climate march Friday, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre.
The map offers up some interesting surprises. For example, more than half of those surveyed in the riding of Beauce - where People's Party of Canada Leader and climate change denier Maxime Bernier is seeking re-election - agreed with the scientific consensus that "Earth is getting warmer partly or mostly because of human activity."
And support for the idea of putting a price on carbon pollution is quite popular in the 12 Quebec ridings that voted Conservative in the 2015 election. In those ridings, support for a cap and trade system, which Quebec already has in place, hovers around 60 per cent, while support for the idea of increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are campaigning on a promise to scrap the carbon tax.
Lachapelle flagged the spike in Quebecers' concern about climate change in the fall of 2018. He suggests awareness began to rise with the springtime flood waters in 2017 and surged again when QuÃ©bec Solidaire put climate change firmly onto the political agenda during the 2018 provincial election. That October, the International Panel on Climate Change warned the world had little more than a decade to reduce CO2 emissions by 45 per cent in order to avoid the large-scale drought, famine, species loss, heat wave deaths, poverty and other dire consequences of warming beyond 1.5 degrees C. Record flooding in Quebec again last spring has only heightened awareness.
A recent Ipsos poll( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) suggests that 34 per cent of Quebecers say climate change will be the most important issue in determining how they will vote, almost on par with health care, which 35 per cent said was their number one concern. In Canada as a whole, 25 per cent said climate change was their key issue, after health care (35 per cent) and affordability and cost of living (27 per cent).
This week on the campaign trail, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer made a stop in Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding, where he raised the issue of the SNC-Lavalin scandal( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/elections-pmn/canadas-conservative-leader-pledges-judicial-inquiry-into-trudeau-ethics-breach/wcm/2bd89d04-eea2-4d38-9f1c-729fcd513158 ). He might want to take note of another recent poll( http://forumpoll.com/post/3033/environment-or-ethics-qc-2019/ ) that suggested 63 per cent of Quebecers say the environment is more important to their voting choice than issues of ethics.
Environmentalist Steven Guilbeault, the Liberal Party's star candidate in Quebec, says: "I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it."
Trudeau, meanwhile, has been touting his Liberal Party( https://www.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf ) as the only one that can really deliver on climate protection. The party's star candidate in Quebec is Steven Guilbeault, a lifelong environmental activist who campaigned for Greenpeace for many years before he co-founded the environmental group Ãquiterre in 1998. He is running in Laurier-Saint-Marie riding. Guilbeault admits he took some flack from friends and fellow environmentalists when he joined the Liberals, considering the party approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/poll-most-quebecers-dont-want-to-see-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-expand )in its first mandate and then bought the project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion.
In a recent interview, Guilbeault said he disagrees with his party's decisions on Trans Mountain, but he nonetheless chose to run with the Liberals because of their performance on climate issues.
In its first mandate, he notes, the Liberal government managed to put a price on carbon pollution across the country, committed to eliminating coal plants by 2030, and is investing significantly in renewable energy. This week, Guilbeault announced the Liberals, if re-elected will commit Canada to attaining zero net emissions of carbon pollution by 2050.
"Concretely, that means we would not produce more emissions than we eliminate. To be honest, it is an ambitious target." He said the party would enshrine that target in a new law.
"This doesn't mean changing our lifestyles or eliminating our industries in a drastic way. It requires a transition. We would compensate for emissions produced with measures and technologies that capture carbon pollution, like planting trees, for example."
Guilbeault acknowledges that the Green Party and the New Democratic Party also have strong programs on climate change.
"Fundamentally, if you look beyond some of the nuances, we all want to put a price on carbon, we want more transit, we want more green technologies, more electrification, we want less money to go to fossil fuel companies," he said.
But Guilbeault said he joined the Liberals because he didn't believe the NDP or the Greens have a chance of forming the government any time soon.
"I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it. I don't think, unfortunately, that my NDP or Green friends can say the same thing, with all the respect I have for them."
In the last federal election, the Liberals took 35.7 per cent of the vote in Quebec, the NDP took 25.4, the Bloc 19.3, the Conservatives 16.7, and the Greens 2.3.
Daniel Green, a well-known whistle-blower on environmental issues and the Green Party's deputy leader, says: "We will not save the environment by investing in oil."
The Green Party( https://www.greenparty.ca/sites/default/files/platform_2019_en_web_-_update_sep17.pdf ), led by Elizabeth May, has its own star environmental candidate in Quebec. The party's deputy leader, Daniel Green, a well-known toxicologist and whistle-blower on environmental issues, is running in Outremont riding.
Green held a news conference this week in Montreal to denounce the other parties for supporting, or at least not denouncing loudly enough, a proposed natural gas pipeline project that he says is a "symbol of what is wrong with energy development in Canada."
The scheme would bring natural gas along a 750-kilometre pipeline from B.C. and Alberta through northern Ontario into Quebec, across Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue to a proposed liquefaction plant in La Baie in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. From there, the liquified natural gas would be transported via tankers down the Saguenay River to the St. Lawrence, through a protected feeding area for the endangered beluga whale. The goal is to export 11 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year to overseas markets.
The Quebec government seems favourable to the project, despite the fact that about 50,000 Quebecers so far have signed a petition against it. GNL QuÃ©bec, the company developing the liquefaction plant part of the project (Ãnergie Saguenay), is expected to submit its project to the independent Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE), which will advise the Quebec government. The provincial and federal governments will also assess the environmental impact of the project, possibly in three separate parts: the pipeline, liquefaction plant and maritime transportation, which Green says will make it difficult to assess its overall impact on emissions.
Green estimates the project will generate 7.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, and says all the other parties have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward it, waiting for studies by the BAPE and others. The Green Party platform calls for cancelling all new fossil fuel pipeline projects, including Trans Mountain and GNL QuÃ©bec's project. The Greens would allow existing oil and gas operations to continue but on a declining basis, with bitumen production phased out by 2035.
Green said there is simply no way Trudeau can reach his zero net emissions target by 2050 if his government keeps approving pipelines to transport fossil fuels.
"Justin Trudeau has to stop being schizophrenic. We will not save the environment by investing in oil," Green said.
For his part, Guilbeault acknowledged he has concerns about increased tanker traffic in the Saguenay River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and suggested the entire project could be subjected to a joint federal-provincial environmental assessment. He said a Liberal government would not approve such a project unless it could compensate for its carbon emissions.
"Our very ambitious target for 2050 will need to be taken into account when evaluating the impacts of projects. If your project is going to emit a lot of greenhouse gases, you will have to show how you will compensate for those over time," he said.
While NDP( https://www.ndp.ca ) Leader Jagmeet Singh has not taken a position on the GNL QuÃ©bec project, his deputy leader in Quebec, Alexandre Boulerice, made his own position clear in a recent interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"The question of GNL shouldn't even be asked ... It's just not realistic if we are serious and coherent about the climate emergency," said Boulerice, who is the NDP incumbent in the riding of Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie.
The floods of 2017 and 2019 sensitized Montrealers and the rest of Quebec to the scope of the climate crisis.
Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois( https://www.blocquebecois.org/ ) Leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who declared recently on Quebec's most popular talk show, Tout le monde en parle, that the Bloc "has the most green and ecological program of all the federal parties," has said he will wait for the BAPE's advice on GNL QuÃ©bec's project.
Blanchet took over as leader of the teetering party in January, and said he sees this election campaign as "an opportunity to really attach the idea of the environment to the idea of (Quebec's) independence." On the campaign trail, Blanchet is taking every opportunity to tell Quebecers how much greener Quebec is than the rest of Canada and how the federal government is using Quebec taxpayers' money to expand pipeline projects and invest in fossil fuel projects.
"For more than 100 years, Quebec has been operating on clean energy, but Ottawa, even as recently as this past mandate, sunk $19 billion into new investments in fossil fuel energy," Blanchet said earlier this month in Mont-Laurier.
Blanchet is proposing a new scheme to replace equalization payments, through which the federal government helps so-called "have-not" provinces, with a program that would reward provinces with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and penalize those with higher emissions. He said Quebec would be entitled to "at least as big a cheque" as it gets now, if not more.
But the NDP's Boulerice said the Bloc's credibility on environmental issues is "a bit stained" by decisions Blanchet made when he was environment minister of Quebec.
"Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet clearly opened the door to the exploitation of oil on Anticosti Island. So when he accuses Canada of being a petrol state," he is being hypocritical, Boulerice suggested. He noted that as environment minister, Blanchet also green-lighted a heavily polluting cement factory in the GaspÃ© and approved the inversion of Enbridge's 9B pipeline.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. The climate rally on Friday demonstrates that.
As for the Greens, Boulerice said: "The biggest difference between the NDP and the Greens is that our program is based on environmental justice but also social and economic justice. We can't fight climate change if we don't fight social inequalities at the same time ... notably by taxing the super rich and helping people in need."
"And what distinguishes us from the Liberals is that we don't buy pipelines," Boulerice said. He described the Liberal Party's promise of net zero emissions by 2050 as a "bedtime story for children ... completely ridiculous."
"The Conservatives are at least consistent," Boulerice said. "They say they will exploit all the gas and oil imaginable and hope for a kind of miracle solution (to climate change), the magic wand of technology will solve everything."
Scheer has indeed made it clear the Conservatives favour natural gas projects like GNL QuÃ©bec. Richard Martel, the Conservative incumbent in the riding of Chicoutimi-Le Fjord where the liquefaction plant would be built, touts the jobs it would bring. Conservatives say Canada's natural gas could replace dirtier fuels in foreign markets.
When Scheer annouced his party's climate plan( https://arealplan.ca ) in Gatineau in June, he called it "the most comprehensive environmental platform ever put forward by a political party in Canada." A Conservative government would impose emissions limits on heavy industrial emitters and require companies that exceed those limits to make investments in research into emissions-reduction technology. The plan also includes tax credits for homeowners to encourage energy-saving retrofits. Scheer hasn't committed to a specific emissions reduction target, but says only that his plan "gives Canada the best possible chance of achieving" the Paris Agreement target of 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.
The Conservatives would scrap the carbon tax that the Trudeau government has imposed on provinces that refused to put a price on carbon pollution and his campaign is mainly focused on warning Canadians that the carbon tax will shoot up if the Liberals get back into power.
That kind of talk may not go over well in Quebec, a province that introduced its own carbon tax in 2007, without major opposition. That tax was replaced by a cap and trade program in 2012 when Quebec joined the Western Climate Initiative. The program puts limits on industrial sites and on businesses that import or distribute oil or fuels sold in Quebec for use in the transportation or building sectors. Those who exceed their cap must buy credits, while those who emit less than their limits can sell credits. The money raised from the carbon market goes into a provincial green fund, to be used for environmental protection projects.
This has meant slightly higher gas prices in Quebec, but the populace has not revolted, notes Chris Ragan, an economist at McGill University and director of the Max Bell School of Public Policy. "Nobody debates this in Quebec. It is not debated at the lunch table, in the streets or by political parties."
So he doesn't think Conservatives will improve their fortunes in Quebec by fear-mongering about a carbon tax that doesn't even apply here or by threatening to cut the clean fuel standard, which Scheer has called a hidden carbon price.
"If the logic is that any policy that has a cost is a hidden carbon price, then you are going to do nothing on climate," Ragan said. "They say they will promote technological advancement and that's great but it's aspirational. It's not really a policy designed to reduce emissions."
Then there is the People's Party of Canada( https://www.peoplespartyofcanada.ca/global_warming_and_environment_rejecting_alarmism_and_focusing_on_concrete_improvements ), the only one of the six parties with a chance of winning a seat in parliament that actually denies scientists' assertions that climate change is caused by human activity or that fighting it is an urgent issue.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/environment-groups-warned-saying-climate-is-real-could-be-seen-as-partisan/wcm/fb839786-afc9-4b41-8364-2535a71c880f )
"The main reason for climate change, it is not human activity," Bernier said at his party's first convention in August. In its platform, the party promises to pull Canada out of the Paris Accord, abolish the carbon tax and "leave it to provincial governments to adopt programs to reduce emissions if they want to," abolish subsidies for green technologies and invest in adaptation strategies "if problems arise as a result of any natural climate change."
In the end, observers agree the parties that are taking the climate crisis seriously have the best chance of winning over voters in Quebec.
In Ragan's opinion, the Liberals are on solid ground with their climate plan, but they need to do a better job explaining to Quebecers how pipelines fit into it. The NDP and the Greens will appeal to what he called "hardcore environmentalists" for their calls for stronger emissions targets, although he said many voters, including himself, worry Canada's economy would suffer if heavy industrial emitters aren't cut some slack. The Conservatives, he said, might win some votes by emphasizing other kinds of environmental action, but if they avoid explaining how their plan will reduce emissions, "they are probably the most vulnerable" of the mainstream parties in Quebec.
But with three weeks to go before the vote, Ragan says it's too soon to say whether the climate change issue will truly decide the election, even in Quebec.
"Federal elections are like the Grey Cup. You don't leave the stadium in the last five minutes, because stuff can change."

Full text: Climate change has surged to the top of voter concern lists across the country during this federal campaign, nowhere more so than here in Quebec, where politicians are scrambling to respond to an unprecedented public call to action on the climate crisis.
On Friday, Montreal was the backdrop to a massive climate rally, and dozens of other marches, protests and strikes demanding climate action took place all across Quebec and around the world this week. A number of federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's event, including marquee guest 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg who stood front and centre. Some businesses closed for the day on Friday, and many schools, CÃGEPs and universities cancelled classes or closed for the day to encourage participation by students, teachers and employees.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. "Whether or not that translates into what party they vote for come election day, that remains to be seen, but it's probably one of the first elections in which the environment, which is rarely an election issue, might actually be one."
Lachapelle is one of the lead researchers on the Canadian Climate Opinion Maps( https://www.umontreal.ca/climat/engl/index.html ) project, an interactive map that allows voters and politicians to take the pulse of climate change awareness at the riding level.

"And what distinguishes us from the Liberals is that we don't buy pipelines," Boulerice said. He described the Liberal Party's promise of net zero emissions by 2050 as a "bedtime story for children ... completely ridiculous."
"The Conservatives are at least consistent," Boulerice said. "They say they will exploit all the gas and oil imaginable and hope for a kind of miracle solution (to climate change), the magic wand of technology will solve everything."
Scheer has indeed made it clear the Conservatives favour natural gas projects like GNL QuÃ©bec. Richard Martel, the Conservative incumbent in the riding of Chicoutimi-Le Fjord where the liquefaction plant would be built, touts the jobs it would bring. Conservatives say Canada's natural gas could replace dirtier fuels in foreign markets.
When Scheer annouced his party's climate plan( https://arealplan.ca ) in Gatineau in June, he called it "the most comprehensive environmental platform ever put forward by a political party in Canada." A Conservative government would impose emissions limits on heavy industrial emitters and require companies that exceed those limits to make investments in research into emissions-reduction technology. The plan also includes tax credits for homeowners to encourage energy-saving retrofits. Scheer hasn't committed to a specific emissions reduction target, but says only that his plan "gives Canada the best possible chance of achieving" the Paris Agreement target of 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.
The Conservatives would scrap the carbon tax that the Trudeau government has imposed on provinces that refused to put a price on carbon pollution and his campaign is mainly focused on warning Canadians that the carbon tax will shoot up if the Liberals get back into power.
That kind of talk may not go over well in Quebec, a province that introduced its own carbon tax in 2007, without major opposition. That tax was replaced by a cap and trade program in 2012 when Quebec joined the Western Climate Initiative. The program puts limits on industrial sites and on businesses that import or distribute oil or fuels sold in Quebec for use in the transportation or building sectors. Those who exceed their cap must buy credits, while those who emit less than their limits can sell credits. The money raised from the carbon market goes into a provincial green fund, to be used for environmental protection projects.
This has meant slightly higher gas prices in Quebec, but the populace has not revolted, notes Chris Ragan, an economist at McGill University and director of the Max Bell School of Public Policy. "Nobody debates this in Quebec. It is not debated at the lunch table, in the streets or by political parties."
So he doesn't think Conservatives will improve their fortunes in Quebec by fear-mongering about a carbon tax that doesn't even apply here or by threatening to cut the clean fuel standard, which Scheer has called a hidden carbon price.
"If the logic is that any policy that has a cost is a hidden carbon price, then you are going to do nothing on climate," Ragan said. "They say they will promote technological advancement and that's great but it's aspirational. It's not really a policy designed to reduce emissions."
Then there is the People's Party of Canada( https://www.peoplespartyofcanada.ca/global_warming_and_environment_rejecting_alarmism_and_focusing_on_concrete_improvements ), the only one of the six parties with a chance of winning a seat in parliament that actually denies scientists' assertions that climate change is caused by human activity or that fighting it is an urgent issue.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/environment-groups-warned-saying-climate-is-real-could-be-seen-as-partisan/wcm/fb839786-afc9-4b41-8364-2535a71c880f )
"The main reason for climate change, it is not human activity," Bernier said at his party's first convention in August. In its platform, the party promises to pull Canada out of the Paris Accord, abolish the carbon tax and "leave it to provincial governments to adopt programs to reduce emissions if they want to," abolish subsidies for green technologies and invest in adaptation strategies "if problems arise as a result of any natural climate change."
In the end, observers agree the parties that are taking the climate crisis seriously have the best chance of winning over voters in Quebec.
In Ragan's opinion, the Liberals are on solid ground with their climate plan, but they need to do a better job explaining to Quebecers how pipelines fit into it. The NDP and the Greens will appeal to what he called "hardcore environmentalists" for their calls for stronger emissions targets, although he said many voters, including himself, worry Canada's economy would suffer if heavy industrial emitters aren't cut some slack. The Conservatives, he said, might win some votes by emphasizing other kinds of environmental action, but if they avoid explaining how their plan will reduce emissions, "they are probably the most vulnerable" of the mainstream parties in Quebec.
But with three weeks to go before the vote, Ragan says it's too soon to say whether the climate change issue will truly decide the election, even in Quebec.
"Federal elections are like the Grey Cup. You don't leave the stadium in the last five minutes, because stuff can change."

Full text: Climate change has surged to the top of the list of voter concerns across the country during this federal campaign, nowhere more so than here in Quebec, where politicians are scrambling to respond to an unprecedented public call to action on the climate crisis.
On Friday, Montreal was the backdrop to a massive climate rally and dozens of other marches, protests and strikes demanding climate action took place all across Quebec and around the world this week. A number of federal, political and environmental leaders attended Montreal's event, including the marquee guest: 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who stood front and centre. Some businesses closed for the day on Friday and many schools, CÃGEPs and universities cancelled classes or closed for the day to encourage participation by students, teachers and employees.
"We are beginning to see a real shift in people's attitudes," said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. "Whether or not that translates into what party they vote for come election day, that remains to be seen, but it's probably one of the first elections in which the environment, which is rarely an election issue, might actually be one."
Lachapelle is one of the lead researchers on the Canadian Climate Opinion Maps project, an interactive map that allows voters and politicians to take the pulse of climate change awareness at the riding level. Using national surveys of more than 9,000 respondents from 2011-18, the latest version of the project suggests 83 per cent of Canadians and 89 per cent of Quebecers believe that the planet is getting warmer. According to the map, a majority in every single riding in the country now believes the climate is changing and 79 per cent of Quebecers say this province is already experiencing the impacts of climate change.
The map offers up some interesting surprises. For example, more than half of those surveyed in the riding of Beauce - where People's Party of Canada Leader and climate change denier Maxime Bernier is seeking re-election - agreed with the scientific consensus that "Earth is getting warmer partly or mostly because of human activity."
And support for the idea of putting a price on carbon pollution is quite popular in the 12 Quebec ridings that voted Conservative in the 2015 election. In those ridings, support for a cap-and-trade system, which Quebec already has in place, hovers around 60 per cent, while support for the idea of increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are campaigning on a promise to scrap the carbon tax.
Lachapelle flagged the spike in Quebecers'concern about climate change in the fall of 2018. He suggests awareness began to rise with the springtime flood waters in 2017 and surged again when QuÃ©bec Solidaire put climate change firmly onto the political agenda during the 2018 provincial election. That October, the International Panel on Climate Change warned the world had little more than a decade to reduce CO2 emissions by 45 per cent in order to avoid the large-scale drought, famine, species loss, heat wave deaths, poverty and other dire consequences of global warming beyond an average of 1.5 C. Record flooding in Quebec again last spring has only heightened awareness.
A recent Ipsos poll suggests that 34 per cent of Quebecers say climate change will be the most important issue in determining how they will vote, almost on par with health care, which 35 per cent said was their No. 1 concern. In Canada as a whole, 25 per cent said climate change was their key issue after health care (35 per cent) and affordability and cost of living (27 per cent).
This week on the campaign trail, Conservative party Leader Andrew Scheer made a stop in Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding, where he raised the issue of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. He might want to take note of another recent poll that suggested 63 per cent of Quebecers say the environment is more important to their voting choice than issues of ethics.
Trudeau, meanwhile, has been touting his Liberal party as the only one that can really deliver on climate protection. The party's star candidate in Quebec is Steven Guilbeault, a lifelong environmental activist who campaigned for Greenpeace for many years before he co-founded the environmental group Ãquiterre in 1998. He is running in the Laurier-Saint-Marie riding. Guilbeault admitted he took some flack from friends and fellow environmentalists when he joined the Liberals, considering the party approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in its first mandate and then bought the project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion.
In a recent interview, Guilbeault said he disagrees with his party's decisions on Trans Mountain, but he nonetheless chose to run with the Liberals because of their performance on climate issues.
In its first mandate, he noted, the Liberal government managed to put a price on carbon pollution across the country, committed to eliminating coal plants by 2030 and is investing significantly in renewable energy. This week, Guilbeault announced the Liberals, if re-elected, will commit Canada to attaining zero net emissions of carbon pollution by 2050.
"Concretely, that means we would not produce more emissions than we eliminate. To be honest, it is an ambitious target." He said the party would enshrine that target in a new law.
"This doesn't mean changing our lifestyles or eliminating our industries in a drastic way. It requires a transition. We would compensate for emissions produced with measures and technologies that capture carbon pollution, like planting trees, for example."
Guilbeault acknowledged that the Green party and the New Democratic Party also have strong programs on climate change.
"Fundamentally, if you look beyond some of the nuances, we all want to put a price on carbon, we want more transit, we want more green technologies, more electrification, we want less money to go to fossil fuel companies," he said.
But Guilbeault said he joined the Liberals because he didn't believe the NDP or the Greens have a chance of forming the government any time soon.
"I think we have a very good platform and I think we have a very good chance of being able to implement large chunks of it. I don't think, unfortunately, that my NDP or Green friends can say the same thing, with all the respect I have for them."
In the last federal election, the Liberals took 35.7 per cent of the vote in Quebec, the NDP took 25.4, the Bloc 19.3, the Conservatives 16.7 and the Greens 2.3.
The Green party, led by Elizabeth May, has its own star environmental candidate in Quebec. The party's deputy leader Daniel Green, a well-known toxicologist and whistleblower on environmental issues, is running in the Outremont riding.
Green held a news conference this week in Montreal to denounce the other parties for supporting, or at least not denouncing loudly enough, a proposed natural gas pipeline project that he says is a "symbol of what is wrong with energy development in Canada."
The scheme would bring natural gas along a 750-kilometre pipeline from B.C. and Alberta through northern Ontario and into Quebec, across Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue to a proposed liquefaction plant in La Baie in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.
From there, the liquefied natural gas would be transported via tankers down the Saguenay River to the St. Lawrence, through a protected feeding area for the endangered beluga whale. The goal is to export 11 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year to overseas markets.
The Quebec government seems favourable to the project, despite the fact that about 50,000 Quebecers so far have signed a petition against it.
GNL QuÃ©bec, the company developing the liquefaction plant part of the project (Ãnergie Saguenay), is expected to submit its project to the independent Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE), which will advise the Quebec government.
The provincial and federal governments will also assess the environmental impact of the project, possibly in three separate parts: the pipeline, liquefaction plant and maritime transportation, which Green said will make it difficult to assess its overall impact on emissions.
Green estimated the project will generate 7.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and said all the other parties have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward it, waiting for studies by the BAPE and others.
The Green party platform calls for cancelling all new fossil fuel pipeline projects, including Trans Mountain and GNL QuÃ©bec's project. The Greens would allow existing oil and gas operations to continue, but on a declining basis with bitumen production phased out by 2035.
Green said there is simply no way Trudeau can reach his zero net emissions target by 2050 if his government keeps approving pipelines to transport fossil fuels.
"Justin Trudeau has to stop being schizophrenic. We will not save the environment by investing in oil," Green said.
For his part, Guilbeault acknowledged he has concerns about increased tanker traffic in the Saguenay River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and suggested the entire project could be subjected to a joint federal-provincial environmental assessment. He said a Liberal government would not approve such a project unless it could compensate for its carbon emissions.
"Our very ambitious target for 2050 will need to be taken into account when evaluating the impacts of projects. If your project is going to emit a lot of greenhouse gases, you will have to show how you will compensate for those over time," he said.
While NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has not taken a position on the GNL QuÃ©bec project, his deputy leader in Quebec, Alexandre Boulerice, made his own position clear in a recent interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"The question of GNL shouldn't even be asked ... It's just not realistic if we are serious and coherent about the climate emergency," said Boulerice, who is seeking re-election in the riding of Rosemont- La-Petite-Patrie.
Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois Leader Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet, who declared recently on Quebec's most popular talk show Tout le monde en parle that the Bloc "has the most green and ecological program of all the federal parties," has said he will wait for the BAPE's advice on GNL QuÃ©bec's project.
Blanchet took over as leader of the teetering party in January and said he sees this election campaign as "an opportunity to really attach the idea of the environment to the idea of (Quebec's) independence." On the campaign trail, Blanchet is taking every opportunity to tell Quebecers how much greener Quebec is than the rest of Canada and how the federal government is using Quebec taxpayers'money to expand pipeline projects and invest in fossil fuel projects.
"For more than 100 years, Quebec has been operating on clean energy, but Ottawa, even as recently as this past mandate, sunk $19 billion into new investments in fossil fuel energy," Blanchet said earlier this month in Mont-Laurier.
Blanchet is proposing a new scheme to replace equalization payments, through which the federal government helps so-called "have-not" provinces, with a program that would reward provinces with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and penalize those with higher emissions. He said Quebec would be entitled to "at least as big a cheque" as it gets now, if not more.
But the NDP's Boulerice said the Bloc's credibility on environmental issues is "a bit stained" by decisions Blanchet made when he was environment minister of Quebec.
"Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet clearly opened the door to the exploitation of oil on Anticosti Island. So when he accuses Canada of being a petrol state," he is being hypocritical, Boulerice suggested.
He noted that as environment minister Blanchet also green-lit a heavily polluting cement factory in the GaspÃ© and approved the inversion of Enbridge's 9B pipeline.
As for the Greens, Boulerice said: "The biggest difference between the NDP and the Greens is that our program is based on environmental justice, but also social and economic justice. We can't fight climate change if we don't fight social inequalities at the same time ... notably by taxing the super rich and helping people in need."
"And what distinguishes us from the Liberals is that we don't buy pipelines," Boulerice said. He described the Liberal party's promise of net-zero emissions by 2050 as a "bedtime story for children ... completely ridiculous.
"The Conservatives are at least consistent," Boulerice said. "They say they will exploit all the gas and oil imaginable and hope for a kind of miracle solution (to climate change), the magic wand of technology will solve everything."

Pension funds, insurers pledge climate action

Full text: Insurers and pension funds managing US$2.3 trillion pledged on Monday to shift their portfolios away from carbon-heavy industries in the hope of triggering snowballing climate commitments from other big investors.
Montreal-based Caisse de dÃ©pÃ´t et placement du QuÃ©bec, German insurer Allianz, the California Public Employees'Retirement System (CalPERS), and Swedish pension fund Alecta were among the founders of the new "Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance" launched at a United Nations climate summit.
"Mitigating climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. Politics, business and societies across the globe need to act as one to rapidly reduce climate emissions," Oliver Baete, chief executive officer of Allianz, said in a statement.
As accelerating climate impacts become increasingly apparent via heat waves, wildfires and receding coastlines, the financial sector is under growing pressure from activists, shareholders and regulators to respond.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organized Monday's summit to try to boost stalling international efforts to control emissions, sees insurers and pensions funds as a crucial lever to transition the global economy off fossil fuels.
These types of companies - called "asset owners" because they are the principal holders of retirement savings, or are investing customers'insurance premiums - represent some of the world's largest pools of capital.
Michael Sabia, the chief executive of the Caisse, one of Canada's biggest pension funds, said there could be huge opportunities for investors willing to finance a fast transition to clean energy.
"There's a lot of people who don't get it, but I do think it's moving - the issue is whether it's moving fast enough," Sabia told Reuters.
"It's speed that matters here." Members of the new grouping pledged to align their portfolios with a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming to limit the increase in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The importance of this target was underscored late last year when a report by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the catastrophic consequences for people and nature if the world is allowed to get much hotter.
Under current emissions pledges by governments, the Earth is on track for well over 3 C of warming by the end of the century - an outcome that scientists say could put the survival of modern industrial societies at risk.
"CalPERS recognizes that climate change poses urgent and systemic risk given our responsibility to protect our members'financial assets and provide the long-term returns that can pay pensions for this and coming generations," said Marcie Frost, chief executive of CalPERS.
The pension funds and insurers said they would rebalance their portfolios to ensure their investments were carbon neutral by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2025, 2030 and 2040.
They also pledged to make regular public progress reports.
The nucleus of founding members hope they will influence an ever-growing proportion of the world's other big pension funds and insurers to push high-carbon companies toward more sustainable economic activities.
But members of the new grouping said they might also have to divest from heavily-polluting industries as a last resort if they proved unwilling to change their business models so they no longer pose a danger to the stability of the climate.
The new coalition was organized by groups including the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative and Mission2020, a network to spur faster climate action led by Christiana Figueres, a former UN climate chief.
Among the other founding members are PensionDanmark, Swedish pension manager AMF, Nordea Life & Pension, Norwegian insurer Storebrand, and Swiss RE.

Where the four main parties stand on climate policy: Heading into the election campaign, the major parties aren't disputing that human beings are responsible for climate change, or that the consequences of a warming planet pose dramatic threats to the global population and other species. They do differ widely, however, on how deeply Canada needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions, how those emissions should be cut and at what cost

Full text: The large-scale global release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere because of industrialization has caused Earth's average temperature to rise over the past century.
In a 2018 report, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading advisory body on the issue - emphasized that climate change is already happening and warned about its serious health and economic consequences.
Nearly every country in the world is a party to the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, in which the global community agreed to prevent temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius higher than preindustrial levels, with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.
The IPCC report concluded that even that 0.5-degree difference in warming could result in 420 million fewer people being exposed to severe heat waves and cut in half the number of animals and plants that would lose habitats and risk extinction.
The report, authored by 90 scientists, shows that at the current rate, the world would see between 2.7 and 3.4 degrees of warming, which would result in catastrophic effects on human society and the broader environment.
For Canada's targets, the report's findings suggest the country would have to cut emissions by about 40 per cent less than 2005 levels by 2030 in order to do its part to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, said Andrew Leach, an environmental economist at the University of Alberta.
In advance of the Paris agreement, then-prime-minister Stephen Harper pledged that Canada would reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 per cent less than 2005 levels by 2030. Justin Trudeau's Liberal government reaffirmed those targets when it took office.
The political debate in Canada is heightened by the regional nature of the resource economy. Alberta and Saskatchewan are heavily dependent on coal for their electricity and on oil and gas production as their economic engines.
Parties that promise aggressive actions to rein in emissions are often accused of threatening economic prosperity, while they counter that a sound economy depends on sustainable environmental practices.
THE PLAN The Liberals go into this election campaign with four years of climate policy behind them, and will release a platform during the campaign laying out how they will build on that action if re-elected.
Immediately after winning the 2015 election, Mr. Trudeau sought to differentiate his government from Mr. Harper's on climate-change policy.
In December, 2016, Mr. Trudeau concluded a sweeping agreement with provinces and territories (minus Saskatchewan) that laid down a road map for achieving the Paris targets and promised joint action. The federal government has started to enact some 50 measures - from the carbon tax, to support for electric vehicles, to regulations on the carbon content in fuels, to investments in public transit and clean technology. The government has also set a target that by 2030, 30 per cent of light-duty vehicles sold will be zero-emission vehicles.
The carbon tax is at the centre of the Liberal plan, and is a lightning rod for federal and provincial conservatives. It kicked in at $20 a tonne - roughly 4.3 cents a litre at the gas pump - on April 1, and rises $10 each year to $50 a tonne in 2022. The federal tax is imposed on provinces that do not have their own levy or do not meet federal standards. Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick are currently covered by the federal levy, and are soon to be joined by Alberta.
It applies to consumers - who get rebates through the tax system to offset the cost impact - as well as to businesses. Large industries pay the levy on only a small percentage of their emissions - from 5 per cent to 20 per cent depending on the sector - in order to protect business competitiveness.
The carbon-tax system put in place by the Liberals has a carrot-and-stick approach. On the one hand, the price on carbon acts as an incentive for companies and individuals to find a way to reduce their carbon footprint in order to avoid the higher costs associated with a carbon tax. On the other, the rebate that is given to consumers acts both to cover the costs for people who have no other option but to drive their car and has the added benefit of rewarding consumers who reduce their footprint because they get the same rebate no matter how much pollution they create.
If the Liberals are re-elected to government, they say they will consult with provinces, territories and other interest groups to determine the trajectory of the tax after 2022.
A new Liberal government would also have to finalize the proposed Clean Fuel Standard, which would require energy companies to reduce the overall GHG content of the fuels they sell by mixing in biofuels and other renewable sources, making their processing operations more energy efficient and gaining credits by financing other emission-reduction projects.
THE GAPS The Liberals maintain that they are on track to reach Canada's 2030 targets, but the government's own numbers show their plan will fall short. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, there is a 79-megatonne shortfall that remains unaddressed. The Liberals counter that the gap will be covered by "unmodelled measures and future reductions," including current investments in public transit and new technology and "future federal, provincial and territorial measures."
However, UBC professor Kathryn Harrison said "the gaps, or the missing parts, of the Liberal plan are how to fill the shortfall," and she noted that the hole has "almost doubled" since the Liberal's climate-change plan was announced in 2016.
The Liberals say they will unveil more ambitious policies during the campaign. An advisory group - co-chaired by Montreal environmentalist and now Liberal candidate Stephen Guilbeault - recommended the government adopt regulatory mandates on zero-emission vehicles to ensure Canada meets its target.
It's unclear whether those ambitious plans will include ramping up Canada's targets to bring them in line with what the UN's advisory committee now says is needed for emissions cuts. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna has acknowledged that urgency, but has been vague on how a re-elected Liberal government would respond to it.
The Liberals will also have to outline how they will manage the balance between cutting emissions on the one hand and resource development on the other. Ms. McKenna says the economy and environment go together, but partisans on the left in the highly polarized national debate often see the Liberals as leaning too heavily toward the other side. Detractors point to the government's decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion for $4.5-billion as proof of the imbalance. The pipeline will allow for much more oil sands development - a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions - even as Canada touts the need to cut emissions.
THE PLAN In June, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer released his party's environmental platform that outlines the party's plan for measures to address climate change. Mr. Scheer vows to repeal the federal carbon tax as well as the planned Clean Fuel Standard, which would force fuel providers to lower the GHG emissions associated with their products.
The Conservative Leader noted that it was his predecessor, Mr. Harper, who first set Canada's current emissions targets. His plan would give the country the "best chance" to meet those targets, he said, while stopping short of actually committing to that goal.
Rather than taxes and regulations, the Conservative Party's climate platform relies on tax incentives and spending to support the development of technology that would allow consumers and industry to improve their energy efficiency and reduce the carbon content of the fuels industry produces. It promotes carbon capture and storage - which has been adopted by two oil refineries in Alberta and a coal-fired generating station in Saskatchewan - as the kind of technology that Canada can not only deploy at home but sell to the rest of the world.
While the Conservatives pledge to eliminate the federal carbon tax as it applies to both consumers and large industrial polluters, they would replace it with "emission standards" for major industries that would require them to reduce GHGs to a prescribed limit. The platform gives no indication where those limits would be set, how they will be enforced or how much of a penalty companies would face if they exceed them. Instead, it says companies would be required to invest a set amount per tonne into technology that would help them lower their emissions.
The Tories also propose a two-year program of tax incentives for homeowners to undertake energy retrofits in order to cut their energy consumption and related GHG emissions. A household could save up to $3,800 annually if it spends $20,000 on energy-saving renovations.
The party is also promising to negotiate agreements that would allow Canada to claim credit for the sale of lower-carbon fuels to countries that would otherwise be relying on coal or other high-emitting sources. The Paris climate accord contains a provision - Article VI - that facilitates international co-operation by allowing the transfer of credits for emission reductions between countries. The Conservatives say the international sale of liquefied natural gas would more than offset the increased emissions in Canada by, for example, lowering the reliance on coal in China.
THE GAPS The Conservative Party approaches climate-change policy with two baselines that separate it from the other parties: it staunchly supports the expansion of the oil and gas sector, and says that it does not believe that policies tackling climate change should impact household pocket books. The policy options left to the Tories then are limited, and several experts have concluded that they will fall far short of Canada's commitment.
Simon Fraser University's Mark Jaccard, who sits on the UN's advisory panel on climate change, modelled the impact of the plan and said it would lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030.
The Conservatives' plan to cap emissions for large emitters and charge those who blow past their limits is in effect a carbon tax, but because there is no explanation of what the cap is or what the tab would be for companies that break it, Prof. Jaccard said its impossible to know the effect it will have.
The plan focuses on international efforts to cut emissions and suggests that the global problem requires a global solution. However, there is no global enforcement for emissions reductions.
The Conservatives would rely on the Paris accord's Article VI to claim credit for the sale of lower-carbon energy sources, such as LNG, to replace coal in the global electricity sector. The article might also be applied to the sale of technology needed to reduce emissions overseas, they say.
However, international negotiators have been unable to agree on the rules for how Article VI would operate. At the very least, two countries would have to agree on the transfer of credits, and it remains unclear how those credits would be generated.
However, tackling climate change outside of Canada's borders has some merit, according to Jennifer Winter, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary. Ms. Winter said paying to cut emissions in countries where it is cheaper to do so is a "reasonable" approach, although it would send money out of the country.
MOCRATS THE PLAN The NDP says it would ramp up Canada's plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions - bringing them 38 per cent lower than 2005 levels by 2030. The party says that's what is required for Canada to do its part to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees higher than preindustrial levels.
To get there, the NDP says it would continue with Canada's carbon-pricing regime, including maintaining the pricing set by the Liberals from 2019 to 2022.
However, New Democrats do plan to tweak the carbon tax. According to the party, the rebates that are currently sent to all households will no longer be sent to millionaires, and the extra exemptions that the Liberals gave to trade-exposed industries through the output-based pricing system will be removed.
This means all industrial heavy emitters will have to pay a carbon tax on emissions once their emissions exceed 70 per cent of the industry average. Under the Liberal government's policies, the benchmark is 80 per cent, and some sectors were given higher exemptions. The party is also setting a target of 2040 to only sell zero-emission cars in Canada.
To reach the new targets, Leader Jagmeet Singh said New Democrats would spend $15-billion on their climate plan over the course of their first mandate.
The NDP is committing to a suite of aggressive timelines to remove fossil fuels from the electricity grid, transportation and building sectors. It would offer low-interest loans in order to finance energy-saving retrofits of all of Canada's housing stock by 2050, with half of them completed by 2030.
The party also wants to spur innovation by establishing a Canadian Climate Bank with a $3-billion fund for investments in the low-carbon economy. It would also eliminate fossil-fuel subsidies. To measure its progress, the NDP is promising to create an independent Climate Accountability Office to track the progress of emissions cuts.
THE GAPS Experts who spoke with The Globe and Mail said the key questions around the NDP's plan come down to timing, details and a failure to address jurisdictional barriers.
"They haven't got the detail of how they would get there," Prof. Harrison said, pointing out that it's not clear how much emissions reduction would occur from electrification of transportation, or from home retrofits.
The same questions apply to the carbon tax, which under the NDP plan appears to have roughly the same trajectory as the Liberal levy.
Prof. Jaccard said that to be able to assess the party's plan, he would need to see a carbon price that is progressively more stringent, but he said that option isn't detailed in the plan. Similarly, he notes that none of the party's goals around retrofits, the electrical grid or zero-emission vehicles are accompanied by enforcement mechanisms. Without those mechanisms, he said, the uncertainty around their impact increases.
Finally, Prof. Leach, of the University of Alberta, says that the plan set out by Mr. Singh would spark even more jurisdictional fights between Ottawa and the provinces. For example, building codes are adopted and enforced at the provincial level, rather than the federal level as suggested by the NDP's plan.
GREEN PARTY THE PLAN Green Party Leader Elizabeth May compares the response Canada needs to bring to climate change to Winston Churchill's campaign to defeat fascism in the Second World War.
To respond to climate change, the Greens say Canada needs a "war cabinet" made up of members from all parties.
The party is pledging to double Canada's GHG-reduction targets, bringing Canada's goal to cut emissions to 60 per cent lower than 2005 levels by 2030.
The Greens say they would hike the carbon tax annually by $10 until 2030, which would raise it to $130 a tonne in that year.
The party also says it will eliminate all fossil-fuel subsidies and ban hydraulic fracking, which is used by non-oil-sands oil and gas producers throughout Western Canada.
The Greens would also stop all pipeline expansion, including the Trans Mountain pipeline project.
Similar to the NDP, the Green Party is proposing dramatic changes to the building, electricity and transportation sectors, but on even tighter timelines.
The Greens have not yet listed a price tag for these policies or explained whether it would be done through incentives, such as tax breaks or regulations.
They would require all new cars sold in Canada to be electric by 2030, and phase out all traditional cars by 2040. They pledge to require energy-saving retrofits of all buildings - residential, commercial and industrial - by 2030. And they propose to eliminate coal and natural gas from Canada's electricity generation by 2030.
The party says it will release more details for its plan during the election campaign.
THE GAPS The concerns expressed by experts over the timing, costs and lack of detail about the NDP's plan are amplified when they turn to the Green Party. A question echoed by professors Jaccard, Harrison and Leach was "how" the party would meet the goals.
A regional dimension that is not addressed in the Green Party's plan is what happens to refineries in Montreal and New Brunswick when the Green Party bans fossil-fuel imports. At the national level, Mr. Leach said the plan could look doable because we are a net exporter of crude, but he notes that since no pipeline connects Eastern Canada to the Prairies, those refineries could be cut off. "There's something that has to give," Mr. Leach said: Either those refineries are shut down or the party has to expand rail and tanker capacity.
Its proposal to phase out all fossil-fuel electricity hits up against regional and timeline challenges, which Mr. Leach said "[makes] it nearly impossible." Electricity is a provincially regulated business and, in some cases, provincially owned.
Alberta is currently in the midst of replacing coal with renewable sources and natural gas. That cuts related emissions in half, but it's still a fossil fuel.
The mammoth task of retrofitting all housing stock also raises timeline questions, according to several experts who spoke with The Globe. Put in perspective, it would require 10 per cent of people to be moved out of their houses each year for a decade in order to complete the retrofits in the time prescribed by the party.
"It's more of a signalling device than a credible plan," Ms. Winter said.

Title: Where the four main parties stand on climate policy: Â  Heading into the election campaign, the major parties aren't disputing that human beings are responsible for climate change, or that th e consequences of a warming planet pose dramatic threats to the global population and other species. They do differ widely, however, on how deeply Canada needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions, how those emissions should be cut and at what cost

Full text: When as many as 150,000 students skipped school to take to the streets of Montreal on March 15, their key demand was urgent government and societal action to fight climate change.
But local youth had a second demand that has been somewhat overshadowed by the magnitude of the climate emergency and the fast-closing window of time left to save the planet.
Over a summer in which the stakes seemed to get even higher, and as students from kindergarten to university head back to school in the coming weeks, momentum is building behind this important parallel issue: environmental education.
"We thought we had 10 to 12 years, now they say we have maybe 18 months to act. That's why young people are so mobilized," said LÃ©a Ilardo, one of the founders of La planÃ¨te s'invite Ã  l'universitÃ©, a coalition of campus-based activist groups that organized the demonstration in Montreal in solidarity with students around the world. "For us, education is indispensable to the cause."
Many young people are acutely aware their future hangs in the balance, as increasingly dire reports emerge about the speed at which the planet is warming. Stifling heat waves made July the hottest month ever recorded on Earth. The melting of permafrost and ice is accelerating in the polar regions. The pace of deforestation is nearing a tipping point in the Amazon.
The damaging effects of land-use policy and agricultural practices are contributing to the planet's demise. Yet resistance to weaning humanity off fossil fuels continues in many quarters.
There is a broad sense among youth that humanity wouldn't be in this mess if people were more educated about the environment, the principles of ecology and the impact of various practices and actions, said Ilardo, a student at UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al.
When preparations for the protest began last winter, she said calling on the Quebec government to green the education system was immediately endorsed as a key issue. Soon after, though, the student organizers became aware of an ongoing effort by educators, pedagogical experts and non-governmental organizations to bring more environmental education into the classroom. The students and the Coalition Ã©ducation environnement Ã©cocitoyennetÃ© have now teamed up. They are supporting each other's efforts and pushing the Quebec government to act.
"It's something very concrete," Ilardo said, speaking in advance of a planned meeting with Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge.
"It's not just a course in CEGEP where you learn how climate change works. ... All the schools should have a garden and the students should learn about gardening and food cultivation, for example."
Hugues Asselin, the coordinator at UQAM's Centre de recherche en Ã©ducation et formation relative Ã  l'environnement et l'Ã©cocitoyennetÃ©, said the endeavour had been in the works for years, leveraging the experience and knowledge of grassroots groups and NGOs. It crystallized last May with the unveiling of the strategy at the National Assembly.
"Institutionalizing" environmental education isn't so much about adding a course or two to the already jam-packed curriculum. Rather, Asselin said it's more about ensuring a green ethos infuses the school system at every level to build the next generation of ecologically responsible citizens.
Many countries including Belgium and Colombia have such policies, said Asselin. And the ironic thing is that Quebec used to as well. Various programs were in place from the late 1970s on, after the creation of the environment ministry, and an interdepartmental committee with an educational mandate existed until the early 1990s. But it fell out of favour.
The new strategy has the backing of all Quebec's opposition parties, civil society and some unions. But the power of the student movement has helped open doors with the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec, as it attempts to make a belated green shift.
"I think the young people who took to the streets last spring feel that education is not fulfilling its potential ... as much for training people to meet the challenges of the emergency we are facing as constructing a vision for the world that is global. It's a very important missing element," said Asselin. "We have to change things as soon as possible. And we need to give students the tools to do that."
As young Quebecers call for a greener school system as well as action on the climate crisis, they are also playing a fundamental role in educating their parents, grandparents and the rest of society. Another march is scheduled for Sept. 27 in Montreal to coincide with a crucial United Nations meeting in New York on member states'emissions reduction targets.
"On Sept. 27, we want our parents and all of society to join us," said Ilardo. "Younger generations know we cannot continue at the same level of consumption, the same rhythm we're going at now. ... Our parents who grew up with a different paradigm, with different rhetoric, we want to bring them with us. We are ready." ahanes@postmedia.com

Chinatown gets taste of rebirth; New generation of restaurateurs attracting more food lovers to area

Full text: Where do you go for Chinese food in Montreal? Some, ruefully, say Toronto, while others say Shaughnessy Village, Verdun or the South Shore.
The answer used to be Chinatown, the area around St-Laurent Blvd. and de la GauchetiÃ¨re St., but the community has slowly faded as a destination for Chinese restaurants.
Chinatown has seen a few new restaurants in recent years, most notably an outlet of the Taiwanese international bubble tea franchise Presotea in 2018 and the upscale pan-Asian restaurant Orange Rouge.
But most of the area's more recent openings are non-Asian businesses, including La Capital Tacos, the cocktail bar Le Mal NÃ©cessaire and the market-based small plates spot Cantine PoincarÃ©, with its low-intervention wines and microbrews.
Meanwhile, the hipster-friendly Golden Dragon opened last spring in Brossard, joining the second outlet of Chinatown dim sum spot Kam Fung. A couple more Taiwanese bubble tea and dessert shops recently opened near Concordia University.
And in terms of savoury Asian options, Chinatown's long-standing Chez Chili (with its glass casseroles of mouth-numbing Sichuan fish in chili oil) and Mon Nan (with its moo shu pork) don't have the same foodie buzz as the reborn AuntDai on St-Mathieu St.
A new generation of Chinatown restaurateurs want to see the area restored to its former glory. At Antonio Park's recent menu launch event for Air Canada's direct flights to Tokyo-Narita, the chef and owner of Park restaurant and Lavanderia in Westmount said he has made investments in Chinatown real estate.
He has also become an ambassador for the area, along with a handful of local businesses including Dobe & Andy, where staff still cut juicy slices of crispy-skinned roast ducks and pork belly hanging in a counter display to top heaping plates of rice, bok choy and nose-tingling ginger-scallion sauce.
Open since 1982 and originally called Fung Lam, Dobe & Andy was initially located on St-Laurent Blvd.
Dobe & Andy moved in 1994 to its current diner-style setup and barbecue take-away counter at 1111 St-Urbain St., in the Ãdifice Place du Quartier (beneath the original Kam Fung, now called Kim Fung).
Andy and Shirley Ku's restaurant was the first to serve Hong Kong-style barbecue pork on rice, starting in 1988. Their sons Eric and Edmund Ku grew up in the restaurant, came back on board in 2011. They recently partnered with former Satay Brother Web Galman and high school friend Raymond Woo to take over after their dad and his brother Charles retired.
Andy Ku was part of a wave of immigrants in the 1970s that moved into the predominantly Cantonese-speaking area before the exodus of Chinatown's initial occupants to the suburbs. He bought a custom roaster from Toronto and started making char siu barbecue pork shoulder, crispy roast pork belly and Hong Kongstyle duck.
The trick to the duck's crispy skin is a labour-intensive process of sewing the cavities, using an air compressor to force the skin from the meat ("If ever your bike broke down, you could just bring it here and we'd pump it up for you," jokes Eric), seasoning it in five-spice, hoisin and ground bean sauce, hanging the meat overnight to dry, then roasting it. Eric and Edmund have been doing it for so long that they know the right heat by the height of the flames, rather than by temperature.
Eric, 37, and Edmund, 39, say they noticed the neighbourhood had changed when they came back to the restaurant. Now, Chinatown restaurants and other businesses are a mixture of Cantonese and Mandarin with as much Vietnamese, and a bit of Korean, Japanese and Mongolian mixed in.
"A lot of the older restaurants, the kids didn't take over," Edmund explains. "They didn't continue their legacy."
Eric adds: "I think the parents in that first generation worked for their kids to not be doing this. We kind of just fell for it - like your first love, I guess."
If Chinatown is going to thrive once again, the brothers feel it needs revitalization. They'd like to see more effort from residents and the city to make Chinatown more of an attraction, not just for summer tourists.
One step in the right direction is the third annual Asian Night Market, from Aug. 30 to Sept. 1. This year, the free festival will take place in Chinatown for the first time, as a partnership between Foodfest MTL and the ComitÃ© du Quartier Chinois de MontrÃ©al. More than 30 Chinatown vendors will participate.
Change, however, needs to start from within, Eric and Edmund acknowledge. Dobe & Andy's menu has expanded over the years, but hasn't been dramatically updated. It still ranges from $5 Hong Kong breakfasts of buttered toast with egg, ham, macaroni and coffee to ramen, stir-fries and $7.25 lunch specials, including beef stew soup with fresh noodles made at Tuck Hing on the South Shore.
They've been experimenting with lunchtime specials, though, and after throwing a few successful evening pop-up events, they're hoping to attract a younger crowd - one that likes international interpretations of Chinese food.
For example, there's sisig, made in the Philippines with a mix of pig ears and innards poached in vinegar and soy sauce, then grilled or fried and topped with calamansi lime juice, chili and onion. Dobe & Andy made a version with its Hong Kong roast pork.
"We're also looking into evening delivery and bringing in alcohol and a different vibe," says Edmund.
First, though, they'll update the dÃ©cor - think old-school-meetsretro-cool diner, with the same tables, chairs and Chinese sign above the drinks fridge that says they sell Chinese buns (which they stopped selling in 2011).
"Not to scare off the regulars," Eric says. "Authenticity - I think it's a cool look."
They would also be open to a second location, probably around Guy-Concordia mÃ©tro because of the student population.
"I think our price point is right for that," Eric says.
His ideal space wouldn't be a large banquet-style place like Kenny Wong, the former Greenfield Park destination where his dad worked his way up to head chef before opening Dobe & Andy.
"I don't think big works anymore," he says. "Those days are done for all cuisines. Everybody's doing little 50-, 60-seaters. It looks so much better when there's a lineup."
They'd also consider other areas of Montreal and other concepts, they add, but would stick with their bestselling roasted meats. "Keep it 'Dobe,'" Eric says.
For now, get that roast duck before the foodies descend and the guys realize they can raise their prices to more than $7.25 a plate.
CHINATOWN BEFORE THE NOODLE BOOM
Known as Little Dublin at the beginning of the 1800s, Chinatown only became Chinatown after the Irish moved to the southwest for work on the Lachine Canal and Victoria Bridge, and once the first wave of Chinese migrants came after working on the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The first Chinese restaurant opened around 1900 on de la GauchetiÃ¨re St.; many more followed suit, since they were less competitive than hand laundries, which were the most popular businesses for Chinese immigrants to open at the time.
Over the years, more buildings came to serve the Chinese community; a Scottish Presbyterian church next to where Wing's Noodles Ltd. stands today became a Chinese Catholic church, and a synagogue became the Chinese hospital until 1962.
From the beginning of the 20th century to the end of the Second World War, Chinatown was known more for debauchery than for noodles. The former red light district was home to jazz clubs, strip clubs, cigar lounges and opium dens (drugs weren't regulated until the early 1900s, and it cost about $1 for a pipe), as well as tea houses and tons of restaurants. The city shut down between 300 and 500 brothels in the red light district after the war.

Full text: Where do you go for Chinese food in Montreal? Some, ruefully, say Toronto, while others say Shaughnessy Village, Verdun or the South Shore. The answer used to be Chinatown, the area around St-Laurent Blvd. and de la GauchetiÃ¨re St., but the community has slowly faded as a destination for Chinese restaurants.
Chinatown has seen a few new restaurants in recent years, most notably an outlet of the Taiwanese international bubble tea franchise Presotea in 2018 and the upscale pan-Asian restaurant Orange Rouge. But most of the area's more recent openings are non-Asian businesses, including La Capital Tacos, the cocktail bar Le Mal NÃ©cessaire and the market-based small plates spot Cantine PoincarÃ©, with its low-intervention wines and microbrews.
Meanwhile, the hipster-friendly Golden Dragon opened last spring in Brossard, joining the second outlet of Chinatown dim sum spot Kam Fung. A couple more Taiwanese bubble tea and dessert shops( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/bubble-tea-and-beyond-4-montreal-spots-for-asian-sweets ) recently opened near Concordia University. And in terms of savoury Asian options, Chinatown's long-standing Chez Chili (with its glass casseroles of mouth-numbing Sichuan fish in chili oil) and Mon Nan (with its moo shu pork) don't have the same foodie buzz as the reborn AuntDai on St-Mathieu St.
A new generation of Chinatown restaurateurs wants to see the area restored to its former glory. At Antonio Park's recent menu launch event for Air Canada's direct flights( https://montrealgazette.com/news/antonio-park-designing-menus-for-air-canadas-international-flights ) to Tokyo-Narita, the chef and owner of Park restaurant and Lavanderia( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-with-antonio-park-multicultural-in-life-and-in-food ) in Westmount said he has made investments in Chinatown real estate. He has also become an ambassador for the area, along with a handful of local businesses including Dobe & Andy, where staff still cut juicy slices of crispy-skinned roast ducks and pork belly hanging in a counter display to top heaping plates of rice, bok choy and nose-tingling ginger-scallion sauce.
Open since 1982 and originally called Fung Lam, Dobe & Andy was initially located on St-Laurent Blvd. It moved in 1994 to its current diner-style setup and barbecue takeaway counter at 1111 St-Urbain St., in the Ãdifice Place du Quartier (beneath the original Kam Fung, now called Kim Fung). Andy and Shirley Ku's restaurant was the first to serve Hong Kong-style barbecue pork on rice, starting in 1988. Their sons Eric and Edmund Ku grew up in the restaurant, came back on board in 2011 and recently partnered with former Satay Brother Web Galman and high school friend Raymond Woo to take over after their dad and his brother Charles retired.
Andy Ku was part of a wave of immigrants in the 1970s that moved into the predominantly Cantonese-speaking area before the exodus of Chinatown's initial occupants to the suburbs. He bought a custom roaster from Toronto and started making char siu barbecue pork shoulder, crispy roast pork belly and Hong Kong-style duck. The trick to the duck's crispy skin is a labour-intensive process of sewing the cavities, using an air compressor to force the skin from the meat ("If ever your bike broke down, you could just bring it here and we'd pump it up for you," jokes Eric), seasoning it in five-spice, hoisin and ground bean sauce, hanging the meat overnight to dry, then roasting it. Eric and Edmund have been doing it for so long that they know the right heat by the height of the flames, rather than by temperature.
Dobe & Andy's team uses a labour-intensive process for the restaurant's signature Hong Kong-style duck.
Eric, 37, and Edmund, 39, say they noticed the neighbourhood had changed when they came back to the restaurant. Now, Chinatown restaurants and other businesses are a mixture of Cantonese and Mandarin with as much Vietnamese, and a bit of Korean, Japanese and Mongolian mixed in.
"A lot of the older restaurants, the kids didn't take over," explains Edmund. "They didn't continue their legacy."
"I think the parents in that first generation worked for their kids to not be doing this," adds Eric. "We kind of just fell for it - like your first love, I guess."
If Chinatown is going to thrive once again, the brothers feel it needs revitalization. They'd like to see more effort from residents and the city to make Chinatown more of an attraction, not just for summer tourists. One step in the right direction is the third annual Asian Night Market, from Aug. 30 to Sept. 1. This year the free festival will take place in Chinatown for the first time, as a partnership between Foodfest MTL and the ComitÃ© du Quartier Chinois de MontrÃ©al. More than 30 Chinatown vendors will participate.
Dobe & Andy serves up Brome duck on rice with bok choy.
Change, however, needs to start from within, Eric and Edmund acknowledge. Dobe & Andy's menu has expanded over the years, but hasn't been dramatically updated. It still ranges from $5 Hong Kong breakfasts of buttered toast with egg, ham, macaroni and coffee to ramen, stir-fries and $7.25 lunch specials, including beef stew soup with fresh noodles made at Tuck Hing on the South Shore.
They've been experimenting with lunchtime specials, though, and after throwing a few successful evening pop-up events, they're hoping to attract a younger crowd - one that likes international interpretations of Chinese food. For example, there's sisig, made in the Philippines with a mix of pig ears and innards poached in vinegar and soy sauce, then grilled or fried and topped with calamansi lime juice, chili and onion; Dobe & Andy made a version with its Hong Kong roast pork.
"We're also looking into evening delivery and bringing in alcohol and a different vibe," says Edmund. First, though, they'll update the dÃ©cor - think old-school-meets-retro-cool diner, with the same tables, chairs and Chinese sign above the drinks fridge that says they sell Chinese buns (which they stopped selling in 2011).
"Not to scare off the regulars," adds Eric. "Authenticity - I think it's a cool look."
They would also be open to a second location, probably around Guy-Concordia mÃ©tro because of the student population. "I think our price point is right for that," says Eric. His ideal space wouldn't be a large banquet-style place like Kenny Wong, the former Greenfield Park destination where his dad worked his way up to head chef before opening Dobe & Andy. "I don't think big works anymore," he says. "Those days are done for all cuisines. Everybody's doing little 50-, 60-seaters. It looks so much better when there's a lineup."
They'd also consider other areas of Montreal and other concepts, they add, but would stick with their bestselling roasted meats. "Keep it 'Dobe,' " says Eric.
For now, get that roast duck before the foodies descend and the guys realize they can raise their prices to more than $7.25 a plate.

Tackling ageism: Cities need to do more for seniors, Concordia prof says

Full text: Meghan Joy decided to research the role cities play to meet the needs of senior citizens while she was living in Toronto, after witnessing some of the struggles her senior neighbour faced.
"We were helping her bring her garbage out to the curb, we were helping her get groceries - doing a lot of informal work," Joy said, adding that the elderly woman eventually died by falling down the stairs. "It was kind of this moment where I was like, you know what, how many people are living in these difficult situations?"
Joy, an assistant professor in the political science department at Concordia University who has a PhD in policy studies, wanted to understand the ins and outs of how cities support senior citizens in practice. She did interviews with more than 80 people, including different actors in local government, the transit commission, the social housing commission, non-profit organizations and senior citizen activists in Toronto.
Through her research, Joy said she realized people tend to view seniors as a "throwaway" population.
"It's coming from this subtle undertone of you have to prove your human worth," she said. "I think we really need to think about ageism."
After finding out about the World Health Organization's movement on age-friendly cities( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-the-age-friendly-city-is-everyones-responsibility ), Joy realized a lot of the research related to seniors doesn't come from an urban politics and policy perspective.
Seniors need more time to cross streets, they need park benches in shady spots, public restrooms and clearly marked street names, Joy said.
"Our cities are built for a working-age population. They move and operate according to the working-age population.
"All things really lead to urban planning, with respect to making sure that neighbourhoods are complete, that people can walk to get their groceries, to go to the community centre, to go to the library, that that's more amenable," Joy said. "When we shut down sidewalks for construction or when we move a bus stop, are we thinking about the needs of the people that are living around there?"
Montreal in particular has some interesting challenges and opportunities in terms of increasing accessibility because of its borough system, Joy said.
"There's kind of that fragmentation that happens in Montreal. But also, the boroughs do offer more opportunities for really local policy-making."
Though both Montreal and Toronto are investing in making public transit more accessible, Joy said more could be done, like looking into methods of transportation such as pickup services for people with certain needs.
Joy also said support is needed for people who, like the neighbour who inspired her research, can use help with day-to-day things like changing light bulbs and taking out the trash. Library programs, computer literacy programs and checkups on seniors during heat waves and ice storms are needed, she added.
It's very important that every community or every borough has their own plan."
"It's very important that every community or every borough has their own plan, because every community is different and every community has its own reality," said RaphaÃ«l MassÃ©, coordinator at the Table de concertation des aÃ®nÃ©s de MontrÃ©al, an organization created by the provincial government to enhance the link between senior citizen non-profit organizations in the city.
Joy also noted a need for programs for LGBTQI+ seniors and seniors from different ethnic groups.
"There might be some really great programs in different places, you don't want to discount that, but overall we are clearly not taking an intersectional aging lens to things," she said, noting that consultations are necessary to determine the needs of different seniors.

"If there's one big mistake that should not be made, it's to take seniors as one big homogeneous group," MassÃ© said. "Sometimes that's what we feel (is happening) in public policies. Especially in Montreal where there's a diversity of seniors ... You need to always take that into consideration."
The next phase of Joy's research is to explore accessibility more in depth in Montreal. Recently, she has been working with Montreal West, which she said is in the process of developing a seniors strategy.
"I think part of the problem is it's not happening quickly enough, and especially in big cities like Toronto and Montreal, we think about cities like service providers and not necessarily policy actors," Joy said.
"How do we co-ordinate all of these people together, to really change our thinking around serving seniors?"

8 spots to refuel near Jarry Park during the Rogers Cup

Full text: Okay, so we lost Federer - but we haven't lost our appetites! Rogers Cup is bringing tennis greats including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev to Jarry Park from August 2 to 11, 2019( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/tennis/felix-auger-aliassime-gives-fans-a-hometown-favourite-in-rogers-cup ). And when you get hungry between matches, here are eight park-adjacent spots sure to win you over.
Fameux Gyros Elatos
Still one of the city's best-kept secrets, this Greek hole-in-the-wall awaits on the other side of the underpass west of Jarry Park. The chicken souvlaki brochettes are succulent and oreganoed to perfection. But the gyro, oh my, the gyro. Made from scratch with a mix of pork and lamb, it's juicy but not oily, complex, tender and just charred enough. It's great served loose or enveloped in puffy pita and thick, homemade tzatziki. I get it "Elatos style," with yellow mustard and fries IN the sandwich.
550 Jarry St. W.
A close-up look at the pita gyros Elatos plate (with french fries inside the sandwich as served at restaurant Fameux Gyros Elatos.
Sana
The prices at this unassuming Pakistani eatery( http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Casual+Dining+Sana/6381341/story.html ) are hard to believe, especially when it comes to the grill plates. The "small" - shareable for two - combines a tikka chicken thigh, a minced-lamb brochette, a big piece of fish and a cubed beef kebab, all topped with fresh red onion and cilantro, and all for under $20. Vegetarians will find bliss in the many veggie curries, including the scrumptious mix of spinach, broccoli and mustard greens (different from the saag) - and don't forget a side of puffy coriander naan.
655 Jarry St. W.
CafÃ© Oui Mais Non
This fun and eclectic coffee shop just off Jarry Park's northeastern corner will refresh you with one of the most caramelly, mellow cold brew coffees in town - delicious just like that, black on ice. The charming interior is full of mismatched furniture, quirky dÃ©cor (don't mind the Christmas tree) and neighbourhood digital nomads. It is an antidote to the bon chic bon genre tennis vibe, the perfect spot to enjoy a sultry grilled cheese with bacon or the vegan sandwich du jour.
72 Jarry St. E.
Miss Villeray
No-nonsense bar food (like a very satisfying nachos plate) comes with a smile at this brasserie that's been serving locals since 1960, as attested by the beautiful vintage sign. You can bet the Rogers Cup will be onscreen if you're having a moment of crowd-itis, though the covered street-side patio might beckon instead. Pair your potato skins, loaded high with St-Guillaume cheddar, homemade sour cream and chives, with a pint or a Long Island iced tea to get back into the match mood.
220 Villeray St.
Basterd
A brand new spot in the condo village that's sprouted just south of the IGA Stadium, this handsome all-day spot - from brunch to nightlife - is within spitting distance of the action. The food has yet to impress, but I haven't tried the popular tacos. The cocktails and the L-shaped terrace make a visit worthwhile. Settle in for a shaded lunch and order a pitcher of sangria.
260 Gary-Carter St.
CafÃ© Saint-Henri
Cutting-edge style and third-wave treats mingle in this neighbourhood favourite, the HQ and main "coffee lab" of Montreal's Saint-Henri chain, set within the still-industrial section of Mile Ex a couple of blocks south of the park. The cool (literally) poured concrete furniture and patch-painted walls make this the best-looking place to take a breather for a splendid iced latte and either a flaky croissant or a veg-packed lunch bowl.
7335 Mile End St.
Brasserie Harricana
The crunchy, huge Fatoushie de Steph fattoush salad draws me here on a regular basis - or maybe it's the fact that this Jean-Talon brew pub( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/local-food-reviews/restaurant-review-brasserie-harricana ) serves its inventive home concoctions in a variety of formats, including a five-ounce glass so you can build your own flight. The woodsy Saison ForestiÃ¨re is a current fave, and perfectly paired with the sharing platter, which features fun, party-mood appetizers like devilled eggs, toothsome yam dumplings and cruditÃ©s with blue-cheese dressing.
95 Jean-Talon St. W.
Jiep Jiep
Last stop has got to be this Korean kitchen two blocks south of Jarry Park, where the ever-changing menu keeps locals coming back. Grab one of the few seats at the spot or order your daily special - from bibimbaps to spicy noodle soups to crunchy fried savoury crepes - from the counter and eat it in the park. The flavours here are homemade, a mix of traditional and experimental, always from the heart - a little messy sometimes, and that's the way we like it.
149 Jean-Talon St. W.

Full text: Okay, so we lost Federer - but we haven't lost our appetites! Rogers Cup is bringing tennis greats including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev to Jarry Park from August 2 to 11, 2019( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/tennis/felix-auger-aliassime-gives-fans-a-hometown-favourite-in-rogers-cup ). And when you get hungry between matches, here are eight park-adjacent spots sure to win you over.
Fameux Gyros Elatos
Still one of the city's best-kept secrets, this Greek hole-in-the-wall awaits on the other side of the underpass west of Jarry Park. The chicken souvlaki brochettes are succulent and oreganoed to perfection. But the gyro, oh my, the gyro. Made from scratch with a mix of pork and lamb, it's juicy but not oily, complex, tender and just charred enough. It's great served loose or enveloped in puffy pita and thick, homemade tzatziki. I get it "Elatos style," with yellow mustard and fries IN the sandwich.
550 Jarry St. W.
A close-up look at the pita gyros Elatos plate (with french fries inside the sandwich as served at restaurant Fameux Gyros Elatos.
Sana
The prices at this unassuming Pakistani eatery( http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Casual+Dining+Sana/6381341/story.html ) are hard to believe, especially when it comes to the grill plates. The "small" - shareable for two - combines a tikka chicken thigh, a minced-lamb brochette, a big piece of fish and a cubed beef kebab, all topped with fresh red onion and cilantro, and all for under $20. Vegetarians will find bliss in the many veggie curries, including the scrumptious mix of spinach, broccoli and mustard greens (different from the saag) - and don't forget a side of puffy coriander naan.
655 Jarry St. W.
CafÃ© Oui Mais Non
This fun and eclectic coffee shop just off Jarry Park's northeastern corner will refresh you with one of the most caramelly, mellow cold brew coffees in town - delicious just like that, black on ice. The charming interior is full of mismatched furniture, quirky dÃ©cor (don't mind the Christmas tree) and neighbourhood digital nomads. It is an antidote to the bon chic bon genre tennis vibe, the perfect spot to enjoy a sultry grilled cheese with bacon or the vegan sandwich du jour.
72 Jarry St. E.
Miss Villeray
No-nonsense bar food (like a very satisfying nachos plate) comes with a smile at this brasserie that's been serving locals since 1960, as attested by the beautiful vintage sign. You can bet the Rogers Cup will be onscreen if you're having a moment of crowd-itis, though the covered street-side patio might beckon instead. Pair your potato skins, loaded high with St-Guillaume cheddar, homemade sour cream and chives, with a pint or a Long Island iced tea to get back into the match mood.
220 Villeray St.
Basterd
A brand new spot in the condo village that's sprouted just south of the IGA Stadium, this handsome all-day spot - from brunch to nightlife - is within spitting distance of the action. The food has yet to impress, but I haven't tried the popular tacos. The cocktails and the L-shaped terrace make a visit worthwhile. Settle in for a shaded lunch and order a pitcher of sangria.
260 Gary-Carter St.
CafÃ© Saint-Henri
Cutting-edge style and third-wave treats mingle in this neighbourhood favourite, the HQ and main "coffee lab" of Montreal's Saint-Henri chain, set within the still-industrial section of Mile Ex a couple of blocks south of the park. The cool (literally) poured concrete furniture and patch-painted walls make this the best-looking place to take a breather for a splendid iced latte and either a flaky croissant or a veg-packed lunch bowl.
7335 Mile End St.
Brasserie Harricana
The crunchy, huge Fatoushie de Steph fattoush salad draws me here on a regular basis - or maybe it's the fact that this Jean-Talon brew pub( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/local-food-reviews/restaurant-review-brasserie-harricana ) serves its inventive home concoctions in a variety of formats, including a five-ounce glass so you can build your own flight. The woodsy Saison ForestiÃ¨re is a current fave, and perfectly paired with the sharing platter, which features fun, party-mood appetizers like devilled eggs, toothsome yam dumplings and cruditÃ©s with blue-cheese dressing.
95 Jean-Talon St. W.
Jiep Jiep
Last stop has got to be this Korean kitchen two blocks south of Jarry Park, where the ever-changing menu keeps locals coming back. Grab one of the few seats at the spot or order your daily special - from bibimbaps to spicy noodle soups to crunchy fried savoury crepes - from the counter and eat it in the park. The flavours here are homemade, a mix of traditional and experimental, always from the heart - a little messy sometimes, and that's the way we like it.
149 Jean-Talon St. W.

Montreal-born Magic forward hosts youth basketball camp; Birch comes home to raise funds for kids and encourage young players to aim high

Author: McKenzie, Julian

Full text: Khem Birch's turning point came as midnight brought in the year 2016.
The Montreal-born basketball player was suiting up to play with Turkish team Usak Sportif and was pondering his career moments before an away game in Gaziantep - a war-torn city less than an hour away from the Syrian border, 8,500 kilometres away from his hometown.
"Is this going to be my whole life?" he wondered to himself. "Ever since then, I just took it seriously. I've been 100 per cent in."
Three years later, Birch says he's reaping the rewards. And he hopes young basketball players can take after him.
The Orlando Magic forward spent the past weekend in his hometown hosting the Khem Birch Elite Basketball Camp at the Ãmile-Legault high school gym in St-Laurent. Nearly 40 children, ranging in age from seven to 16, took part in basketball drills with the coaches, as Birch played alongside.
The camp was previously held in Ottawa and will be in Dartmouth, N.S., later in July.
The proceeds from the camp go toward providing local basketball associations funding to support children who can't afford to play. The camp raised nearly $6,000 last year, said Birch's mother, Wendy Sparks.
"It's definitely an experience," teenager Willensly Polynice said. "We've done dribbling drills, we've done shooting drills. Obviously, we've done some cardio while we're doing it. I realize my cardio's low, so definitely need to work on that.
"If there was more of (these camps), I feel like more kids would be recognized (as legitimate basketball talents) out of Canada, period," Polynice added.
That's what Birch is hoping. "When I was growing up there wasn't a lot of basketball camps," the 6-foot-9, 233-pound Birch said. "When I was a young, young kid, there were no NBA players coming back to give back to the community. I want to be that guy so kids can look back and say, 'Khem did it, so I can do it in the future.'" Birch worried about having basketball gear to wear for his games. His parents spent more than $3,000 buying him clothes and shoes online - or travelling to the United States to get them - because they couldn't find stores in Montreal that could outfit him properly, especially his Size 14 feet.
Sparks said they would go out of the way "just so he could have that basketball look. It was really important to him."
Birch encountered more struggles following his collegiate career at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He played in cities like Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Piraeus in Greece and Usak in Turkey - the latter of which he had to worry about games being cancelled because of bombs being dropped.
"I'd be calling him saying, 'Hold on a second, what happened to your game?'" Sparks said. "And he'd be like, 'Oh, it got bombed.'" Once Birch took the game of basketball more seriously, he got a contract with the Orlando Magic in 2017. Now, he's using his newfound opportunity to give back to his local community and take after another fellow Montrealer and NBA player who has held basketball camps in his home city, former Miami Heat star Joel Anthony.
"Very big inspiration," Birch said of Anthony. "He's my idol and I still look up to him."
The camp is just one part of a great off-season for the Montrealer. He re-signed with the Magic this month on a two-year deal worth US$6 million.
He was also named to Team Canada's training camp roster for the upcoming International Basketball Federation World Cup in China later this summer.
"I put all my apples into a basket and I've been successful so far," Birch said.
With basketball's surge in popularity in Canada already in full swing following the Toronto Raptors winning this year's NBA title, Birch is happy to be a part of the wave. He is focusing his attention on qualifying for the Olympics and seeking revenge on the Raptors, who eliminated the Magic in the opening round of the playoffs.
"I like it for the country," Birch said of Toronto's win. "But the fact that they beat us, I still am envious of that. I really want to beat them next year."

Full text: AT A GLANCE British Grand Prix live coverage.
Qualifying: Saturday at 8 a.m. on TSN3, TSN5; 8:45 a.m. on RDS. Race: Sunday at 7:30 a.m. on TSN3, TSN5; 8:30 a.m. on RDS.
Formula One employs a lot of smart people but, in the end, it was not the big brains at Red Bull or Ferrari that brought Mercedes to its knees.
It was the force of Mother Nature.
Call it an allegory for the age of climate change, if you like. Or just dumb luck. Or bad luck, depending on your point of view. Whatever. The point is, going into this weekend's British Grand Prix, the mighty Silver Arrows are no longer undefeated.
Their perfect start to the campaign came to an unexpected end at stop No. 9 in Austria on June 30, after 10 straight wins going back to last season.
Max Verstappen took the widely popular win for the home team at the Red Bull Ring with an aggressive move on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with three laps to go in front of grandstands packed with orange-clad supporters of the young Dutchman.
It was heart-stopping stuff, the kind of wheel-to-wheel battle everyone in F1 wants to see.
Except for the stewards, of course. Not for the first time this season, they tried to steal the spotlight with an investigation into the clash that, in this case, lasted a mind-numbing threeplus hours before they rendered a verdict.
At least they got the decision right this time and upheld the victory for the guy who actually crossed the finish line first - unlike the travesty in Montreal, where second-place Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner thanks to a five-second penalty given to Sebastian Vettel.
Really, these guys need to get out of the way.
Anyway, in Austria, championship leader Hamilton could do no better than fifth, just behind Ferrari's Vettel and Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas in third.
Leading up to the Grand Prix, I suggested in this space that no team was capable of beating the silver cars on merit, that only extraordinary circumstances would deny Hamilton or Bottas the victory.
That's certainly how it played out, with Mercedes revealing both drivers were forced to "lift and coast" for significant portions of the race to avoid having their cars overheat as the ambient temperature climbed to an unexpected 35 C in the Styrian mountains.
The cooling issues were not new, apparently; team boss Toto Wolff said "we were carrying the problem since the beginning of the season" and efforts had begun to find a fix before the onset of intense summer temperatures.
Trouble is, these days, you never know what Mother Nature will throw at you and when, and Mercedes was caught out in Austria.
If what Wolff says is true, the good news for rivals is there is no easy remedy for an overheating F1 car. It's not as simple as bolting on a bigger radiator. For one thing, there's no room. And not just the engine needs to be cooled, but sensitive high-tech components front to back.
Of course, F1 cars are designed to account for varying weather conditions across a calendar that spans nine months and 21 venues around the world, from the Ardennes forest in Belgium to the desert in Bahrain. Bodywork "exits" can be peeled back to allow more air flow when necessary.
But these did not do the job for Mercedes in Austria, evidently. You can always punch more holes in the bodywork, but then you risk compromising aerodynamic performance. Turn down the engine and, well, you're going to be slower. Lift and coast? Duh.
So it's tricky. Lucky for Mercedes, temperatures should not be an issue this weekend at the Silverstone Circuit in central England. The forecast for race day calls for a high of 21 C, light cloud and a gentle breeze.
But next comes Hockenheim, in Germany, followed by Hungary, and who knows what's in store at those places and beyond. Remember, France hit its highest recorded temperature - 45.9 C - amid the recent heat wave in Europe.
The good news for Mercedes and its fans is no team seems better at troubleshooting in a hurry. If there's a problem, you sense a fix is never far behind, whereas others with similar resources can spend months or years spinning their wheels (ciao, Ferrari).
As for this weekend, the silver squad seems to be back on the right track, with Bottas topping the time sheets just ahead of Hamilton during Friday afternoon practice.
Several drivers veered off track as they struggled with reduced grip on a newly paved circuit and unpredictable gusts of wind that, as Williams driver George Russell put it, could "make you look like an idiot."
Yes, Mother Nature can do that. walterb@postmedia.com twitter.com/walterbF1

Full text: Formula One employs a lot of smart people but, in the end, it was not the big brains at Red Bull or Ferrari that brought Mercedes to its knees.
It was the force of Mother Nature.
Call it an allegory for the age of climate change, if you like. Or just dumb luck. Or bad luck, depending on your point of view.
Whatever. The point is, going into this weekend's British Grand Prix, the mighty Silver Arrows are no longer undefeated.
Their perfect start to the campaign came to an unexpected end at stop No. 9 in Austria on June 30, after 10 straight wins going back to last season.
Max Verstappen took the widely popular win for the home team at the Red Bull Ring with an aggressive move on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with three laps to go in front of grandstands packed with orange-clad supporters of the young Dutchman.
It was heart-stopping stuff, the kind of wheel-to-wheel battle everyone in F1 wants to see.
Except for the stewards, of course. Not for the first time this season, they tried to steal the spotlight with an investigation into the clash that, in this case, lasted a mind-numbing three-plus hours before they rendered a verdict.
At least they got the decision right this time and upheld the victory for the guy who actually crossed the finish line first - unlike the travesty in Montreal, where second-place Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner thanks to a five-second penalty given to Sebastian Vettel.
Really, these guys need to get out of the way.

That's certainly how it played out, with Mercedes revealing both drivers were forced to "lift and coast" for significant portions of the race to avoid having their cars overheat as the ambient temperature climbed to an unexpected 35 degrees Celsius in the Styrian mountains.
Montreal native Lance Stroll prepares to take to the Silverstone Circuit during Friday practice at the British Grand Prix.
The cooling issues were not new, apparently; team boss Toto Wolff said "we were carrying the problem since the beginning of the season" and efforts had begun to find a fix before the onset of intense summer temperatures.
Trouble is, these days, you never know what Mother Nature will throw at you and when, and Mercedes was caught out in Austria.

23rd Fantasia International Film Festival feeds off of reality

Full text: If you think the world's current political climate is scary, wait till you see the latest batch of genre movies that have emerged from it.
The 23rd Fantasia International Film Festival opens Thursday and presents 130 features and over 200 shorts, through Aug. 1. As usual, it's a mad grab bag of horror, action, thrillers and offbeat comedy, combined with an in-depth survey of the year in Asian cinema.
Pondering the mayhem, Fantasia co-director and director of international programming Mitch Davis noted that this year's crop boasts a particularly twisted batch of movies, even for a festival as wild as Fantasia.
"The last time we saw genre films that were so anguished goes back to Bush-era 9/11," he said. "The world is going to more frightening places, and genre films express that worry, anger and devastation, which leads to commentary, discussion and confrontation. That's when genre is at its most interesting. It's the only silver lining in horrible times."
Davis pointed to Lorcan Finnegan's Vivarium (Friday, 9:30 p.m., Concordia's Alumni Auditorium), starring Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots as a young couple trapped in a mysterious suburban development project, which screened as part of Cannes Critics' Week.
"It's a black comedy, sci-fi horror film that feels like something out of The Twilight Zone," he said. "They're trapped in a new real estate development. Then a child appears and they have to take care of it. It's an interesting allegory of what home ownership does to young parents, and of the suburbs as a place where people are isolated to be breeders and consumers."
Finnegan will be in town for the screening, as will many filmmakers at Fantasia. Eisenberg and Poots also star in Riley Stearns's opening-night offering The Art of Self-Defense (Thursday, 9:30 p.m., Alumni Auditorium), which posits the former as a mild-mannered accountant who joins a karate school.
There are other big names in Fantasia's lineup. Liam Hemsworth stars in Malik Bader's Killerman (July 20, 9:45 p.m., Alumni Auditorium), in which a guy wakes up with millions of dollars in cash and drugs, and no memory of how he acquired it.
"Danish crime-film fans, take note," Davis said. "It's in the vein of '70s Don Siegel films (Dirty Harry, Escape From Alcatraz). It's an intense, fun film, which should be wild with our audience."
Fantasia is noted for its highly informed, enthusiastic fan base, known to cheer, gasp and groan in all the right places, to the delight of visiting film teams.
Lupita Nyong'o stars in Australian actor-director Abe Forsythe's zombie comedy Little Monsters (Friday, July 12, 7 p.m., Alumni Auditorium), which was a hit at Sundance this year.
Matthew Pope's Blood on Her Name (July 17 at 9:40 p.m., July 19 at 4:15 p.m., Concordia's J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) stars Bethany Anne Lind (Ozark) as a woman who panics following an accidental killing.
"It's a southern gothic neo-noir," Davis said of the world premiÃ¨re, calling it "one of the best films of the year, and one of the most powerful, sophisticated films."
Fantasia is not all blood and gore. Sometimes it's even emotionally poignant, but always with a twist.
Veteran American actor Richard Dreyfuss is back in British Columbia actress Shelagh McLeod's directorial debut, Astronaut (July 14, 7 p.m., Alumni Auditorium), about a man who always wanted to see the stars up close.
"It's a sentimental drama with elements of realist fantasy," Davis said. "It's super sweet and touching, hearkening back to Dreyfuss's character Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
Onur Tukel's Black Magic for White Boys (July 19 at 6:45 p.m., July 23 at 2:40 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) tells the story of an aging magician who goes to great lengths to save his New York neighbourhood.
"It's a very funny black comedy about gentrification," Davis said.
As ever, it's all about balance. Though Fantasia may have once been pigeonholed for its gore or scare quotient, the festival has come to be recognized as one of our city's most exciting film events, offering something for anyone willing to take a step out of the mainstream.
"Some years we lean more toward social satire, some years it's more grind horror," Davis said. "It depends what the current crop offers."
Fantasia's director of Asian programming Nicolas Archambault points to a wave of maturity in this year's programming, notably in a handful of coming-of-age films.
"It's funny to talk about maturity and coming of age," he acknowledged.
Among them is Kim Bora's first film, House of Hummingbird (July 24, 6:30 p.m., Alumni Auditorium), from South Korea, which has racked up prizes on the festival circuit.
"It's a film I adore," Archambault said, "about a young girl, in the first year of democracy in South Korea, 1993-94, and her experiments in that context, dealing with patriarchy and oppression. It's my favourite film this year."
Also from South Korea is actor Kim Yoon-seok's directorial debut, Another Child (July 14 at 4:45 p.m., July 20 at 12:50 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema), about two teenage girls united by an affair between their parents.
"He's one of the biggest actors in South Korea," Archambault said, adding that although Kim is known for action roles, he reveals a soft touch behind the camera, while giving himself the thankless role of the cheating father.
"Ironically, this is a very delicate, sensitive film," Archambault said, "with a lot of hope for the future in the characters of these young girls."
Japanese director Hideki Takeuchi's Fly Me to the Saitama (July 22, 6:45 p.m., Alumni Auditorium) is a zany adaptation of a 1982 manga about a student from Tokyo and a visiting student from the U.S. living outside the city centre, whose tense rivalry turns into something else entirely.
"The famous actress Fumi Nikaido plays a boy who has a crush on this boy from Saitama, so they develop a subtle homosexual relationship," Archambault said. "Imagine if Monty Python grew up in Japanese pop culture. It's very funny."
This year marks a renaissance in Asian horror, according to Archambault, who highlighted Thursday's opening film Sadako (6:30 p.m., Alumni Auditorium; repeats July 18, 12:30 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema), the latest instalment of the storied Ring franchise, by original director Hideo Nakata.
If that's not out-there enough for you, Ariel Esteban Cayer has a few suggestions. As director of Fantasia's Camera Lucida section, Cayer's mission is to seek out movies that push the limits of even Fantasia's boundary-bending fare.
"This year, I took some risks in terms of what people might think of as Fantasia films," he said.
Among them is a mini-retrospective of Japanese filmmaker Nao Yoshigai, whose short Grand Bouquet (July 16, 7 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) screened this year as part of the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes.
"Her stuff is more in the vein of experimental cinema, but has strong fantastical elements," Cayer said. "She's a dancer and choreographer, so she brings a lot of that physicality to her films."
Saida Benzal and Armand Rovira's Letters to Paul Morrissey (July 16 at 5 p.m., July 26 at 1 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) consists of a series of imaginary letters to the American film director, best known for his association with Andy Warhol.
"(Morrissey's) fictional collaborators write to him from different places in the world," Cayer said. "The vignettes are very evocative and challenging. You have Udo Kier or Andy Warhol - it's a trip through the history of avant-garde cinema."
Adilkhan Yerzhanov's Night God (July 26 at 3 p.m., Aug. 1 at 5:30 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) is a rare film from Kazakhstan, about a world descending into chaos.
"It's comprised of tableaux vivants," Cayer said, "like a Peter Greenaway film, with a floating camera that brings you to this very desolate landscape with people in a small town in Kazakhstan, waiting out the end of the world."
Though Camera Lucida explores the outer limits of genre, Cayer isn't averse to movies that go for the jugular.
"Genre film is often associated with popular modes of filmmaking, which is part of what we champion," he said. "What I love most about our festival is getting to see blockbusters from Japan, Korea and China on the big screen. These are films that (in their countries) go head to head with Aladdin and Avengers."
Ultimately, he explained, there's room for everything.
"Fantasia is still very much about showcasing all kinds of genre, and imaginative cinema from all over the world."

"(Morrissey's) fictional collaborators write to him from different places in the world," Cayer said. "The vignettes are very evocative and challenging. You have Udo Kier or Andy Warhol - it's a trip through the history of avant-garde cinema."
Adilkhan Yerzhanov's Night God (July 26 at 3 p.m., Aug. 1 at 5:30 p.m., J.A. de SÃ¨ve Cinema) is a rare film from Kazakhstan, about a world descending into chaos.
"It's comprised of tableaux vivants," Cayer said, "like a Peter Greenaway film, with a floating camera that brings you to this very desolate landscape with people in a small town in Kazakhstan, waiting out the end of the world."
Though Camera Lucida explores the outer limits of genre, Cayer isn't averse to movies that go for the jugular.
"Genre film is often associated with popular modes of filmmaking, which is part of what we champion," he said. "What I love most about our festival is getting to see blockbusters from Japan, Korea and China on the big screen. These are films that (in their countries) go head to head with Aladdin and Avengers."
Ultimately, he explained, there's room for everything.
"Fantasia is still very much about showcasing all kinds of genre, and imaginative cinema from all over the world."

We need to come clean with millennials on big-city home ownership

Full text: The good news on housing as we head into the second half of 2019 is that roughly three-quarters of Canadians live in communities where home ownership is affordable.
But that other 25 per cent? In the words of the Royal Bank of Canada economists who produced their bank's most recent housing affordability study, the situation is "dreadful."
Three urban areas make up that terrible 25 per cent of the housing market: the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas and Victoria. A rule of lending is that the borrower shouldn't spend more than 35 per cent of their gross income on mortgage payments, property taxes and utilities - mainly heat.
RBC's data show these housing costs would eat up 82 per cent of the median pretax household income in Vancouver, 66 per cent in the Toronto area, 58.6 per cent in Victoria and 51.4 per cent for Canada as a whole.
The second-half outlook for housing is worth considering for a couple of reasons, one being that affordability for first-time buyers is bound to be an issue in the fall federal election campaign. We are also approaching a tipping point of unaffordability in the three most expensive markets. It's starting to look like they may never again be in reach of families who don't have income way above the median level.
Here's how hopeless home ownership is getting in these cities, according to RBC.
Twenty-one per cent of families in Victoria have the income to afford an averagepriced home, compared with 20 per cent in Toronto and 12 per cent in Vancouver. Saint John was the most accessible for home ownership of the cities tracked by RBC, with 56 per cent of families able to afford the average-priced home.
Vancouver remains deadly to aspiring homeowners despite a decline that saw the average resale price in May almost 9 per cent lower than a year earlier. Toronto's market has slumped as well, but May results suggested a possible turnaround. And Victoria is riding some kind of la-la land wave that keeps prices moving higher.
Trends driving house prices over the past year include an increase in mortgage rates and stress tests for borrowers that ensure they can survive higher rates. These trends did depress prices in many cities, but affordability in Toronto, Vancouver and Victoria remains dreadful.
Mortgage rates have backed off a bit lately, and that could help affordability in the second half in Vancouver, Victoria and Toronto. Bigger mortgage rate declines would help even more, but we're not likely to see those unless the economy tanks. If that happens, people are going to be thinking more about their job security than opportunities to buy homes in Toronto and Vancouver.
Beyond Saint John, other cities where affordability in the first quarter was solid include St. John's, Regina, Quebec City, Halifax, Saskatoon and Winnipeg. All have been right around their average level of affordability since 1985, RBC's numbers show. These locales are a useful reminder not to generalize about housing affordability in Canada using numbers that reflect the terrible trio of Toronto, Victoria and Vancouver.
Cities with borderline affordability include Calgary, Ottawa and Montreal. It took between 40 per cent and 44 per cent of median pre-tax income to afford the averagepriced home in these cities.
Millennials are a big voting bloc now, so expect to hear politicians on the campaign trail this fall acknowledging how hard it is for them to buy homes in expensive cities.
Their comments will serve as a gauge of their credibility on economic issues.
Governments can help clear the way for more home building, and there's arguably room to offer modest assistance along the lines of the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, announced in the 2019 federal budget.
But we're not being honest with young adults if we fail to acknowledge that the near universal home ownership of the baby boomer generation is unsustainable in cities that house one in four Canadians.

Cool temperatures, higher wages cited in Quebec's late strawberry crop

Full text: For many, summer has not officially started in Quebec until the province's famously juicy strawberries make their way to grocery stores, kiosks and public markets. But this year, producers and consumers had to wait a little longer for their precious berries to arrive.
"Nature sure is taking her sweet time," said Phil Quinn, owner of Ãle-Perrot's Quinn Farm.
Strawberry season is arriving two weeks late at Quinn Farm, as is the case for the majority of harvesters throughout the province. According to Quinn, many of his crops are experiencing the reverberations of a cool, wet spring.
In addition to his strawberries, Quinn expects that his apples, sweet corn and vegetables will also be late. However, he is confident that his first strawberries will be hitting the counters next week and that self-service or u-pick cultivation( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/table-talk-you-can-take-your-pick-of-quebec-strawberries ) will begin on Canada Day weekend. For consumers like Lea Del Bosco, this news comes after much anticipation.
"I'm glad to hear they're finally here," said Del Bosco, who purchases the strawberries from the kiosk at the corner of her street and uses them to make strawberry jam and smoothies. "The Quebec strawberries are so much tastier and fresher than the ones coming in from other countries."
Last summer, Quinn Farm suffered from one of its worst strawberry seasons on record( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-summer-gave-quebec-farmers-one-of-the-worst-seasons-on-record ) as a result of hot, dry weather. He said the prolonged heat wave affected the harvest and the turnout for u-pick operations. Overall, Quinn estimated he lost $100,000 in by mid-July.
But according to Quinn, the weather has not been the sole factor behind this year's delay. He said he believes the recent increase in minimum wage( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-minimum-hourly-wage-to-increase-to-12-50-on-may-1 ) to $12.50 an hour has hampered production. With more than 50 per cent of production costs allocated to labour, he said picking strawberries has become too expensive for some harvesters. In an effort to support harvesters and their crops, the Association des producteurs de fraises et framboises du QuÃ©bec requested financial assistance( https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9105769/canada-strawberry-and-raspberry-producers-hampered-by-rising-minimum-wage/ ) from the government, much to Quinn's discontent.
"I am a firm believer that the market should be able to take care of itself without government assistance," said Quinn. "We should be in a situation where we can take care of ourselves."
For Quinn, this change means charging a little more for the fruits of his labour. For other strawberry producers, it means worrying that consumers will opt for cheaper alternatives over pricier Quebec strawberries. And for consumers like Del Bosco, it means making a choice between affordability and shopping locally.
"I want to support our local farmers," said Del Bosco. "Yes, the strawberries from California are cheaper. But, when you buy the Quebec strawberries, at least you know that you're getting a product that hasn't been in a fridge for days at a time."

Politics Briefing: Trans Mountain decision expected today: Also: Court challenge already launched against Quebec religious-symbols law

Full text: Good morning,
Last night the House of Commonsadopteda motion by Environment Minister Catherine McKenna that Canada is facing a "national climate emergency," one that is being felt today "from flooding, wildfires, heat waves and other extreme weather events which are projected to intensify in the future," and that "action to support clean growth and meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all parts of the economy are necessary to ensure a safer, healthier, cleaner and more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren."
And today, true to the Liberals' word that the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, Ms. McKenna and her cabinet colleagues are likely to approve a pipeline.
The Liberal government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project from Kinder Morgan for $4.5-billion last year. Ottawa has spent the last 10 months following a court order to revisit its analyses of the environmental impacts of the project that would carry more Alberta crude to the B.C. coast for export, and to revisit consultations with Indigenous communities along the route.
Trans Mountain is popular with Canadians. According to aNanos pollconducted for the Globe last month, a majority of respondents in every region of the country supported the project, even over the concerns of the B.C. government. (Those who took the survey were less enamoured with government money flowing into the pipeline.)
But even if it is approved today, it's not clear when it will actually get built. "The time to build Trans Mountain is now," the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said in a statement. But "if they are smart, they will not build this summer given the upcoming election," one environmentalist said.

TODAY'S HEADLINES
Ichrak Nourel Hak, an aspiring teacher in Quebec, haslaunched a court challengeagainst the province's new law that bans wearing ofreligious symbolsfor some public servants. Ms. Nourel Hak, who wears a hijab, is backed by the National Council of Canadian Muslims, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and Montreal lawyer Catherine McKenzie. "The law is stealing my dream and sending a clear message I am not a valued part of Quebec society," she said in a statement. The federal government said it hasn't decided if it will intervene.
The Conservatives saythey are againsta Liberal plan to ban certain types of assault weapons. "It's not by removing firearms from the hands of honest citizens that we will solve the problem" ofgun violence, Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said politicians shouldn't calljournaliststhe "enemy of the people" - a phrase often used by a certain leader to the south.
The Liberal government has announced the details of its First-Time Home Buyer incentive, but those in themortgageindustry saythey are skepticalthat the program will do much to encourage new buying.
The Senate committee planning to look into the failed prosecution against Vice-AdmiralMark Normanisseeking an extensionto get their work done during July - an extension they may have trouble getting approval for, as the Senate is supposed to rise for the summer next week.
And a pro-conservative group called Canada Proudis paying people to wear banana costumesin Ottawa and Toronto and hand out anti-Trudeau campaign material.
Leah George Wilson, Chief of Tsleil-Waututh Nation, (The Globe and Mail)onthe case against Trans Mountain: "Tsleil-Waututh is not anti-development. Indeed, we support sustainable and responsible economic activity, and have our own real estate, ecotourism, and commercial fishing and forestry businesses. All of these are at put at risk by the Trans Mountain Project."
Barrie McKenna (The Globe and Mail)onthe Alberta ad campaign for Trans Mountain: "The 'yes to TMX' message is also for consumption in Alberta. Canada is increasingly a country of two solitudes - Alberta, and the rest. And many Albertans have bought into the ridiculous conspiracy that Ottawa only bought Trans Mountain pipeline to make sure the expansion never gets built. If true, it would be a very expensive and convoluted scheme to kill the project. The federal government spent $4.5-billion to buy the pipeline, and is poised to commit at least another $9-billion to nearly triple its existing capacity."
Doug Cuthand (Saskatoon StarPhoenix)on the stalling of an Indigenous rights bill in the Senate: "This action on the part of the Conservative senators is a clear indication that the Conservative Party has written off the Indigenous vote in the next election and rather will adopt a strategy that First Nations and Indigenous groups are the reason for stalled pipelines and other resource projects. ... Our rights are not subject to partisan politics and should be respected by all parties. No other group in this country is subject to the government of the day defining and implementing their basic rights."
Allison Hanes (Montreal Gazette)onthe damage inflicted by Quebec's new laws: "Humanity's worst impulses are being legitimized, which threatens, rather than secures social cohesion. And Quebec's standing as an open, inclusive, welcoming society will suffer irreparable damage as a result."
John Ibbitson (The Globe and Mail)onwhat the NDP would do in a hung Parliament: "Polls suggest that if an election were held today, Andrew Scheer's Conservatives would win the most seats in the House of Commons. But even so, he might not become prime minister. The reason is Jagmeet Singh. In any hung Parliament, the NDP Leader will be under enormous pressure from his caucus and his base to prevent the Conservatives from coming to power."

Climate change lawsuit has merit

Full text: Re: "Young Quebecers present case for climate change class-action suit" (Montreal Gazette, June 7) Government attorney Ginette Gobeil, in trying to stop a class action accusing Ottawa of climate-change inaction, asks: "How could one demonstrate that measures already adopted by the federal government will not achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets?" In fact, Environment and Climate Change Canada itself admits that current government measures will reduce emissions by only four per cent by 2030, against Canada's target of 30 per cent.
And even if one includes government measures under development but not yet fully implemented, this reduction figure rises to only 19 per cent.
Besides, a 30-per-cent reduction in emissions by 2030, even if achieved by all countries, will not, according to climate scientists, limit global warming to the 2 degrees C target, let alone the less damaging 1.5 C.
The youth bringing this class-action suit are right to argue that excessive warming can endanger their rights to life and security if, as predicted, it will result in potentially deadly heat waves, floods, forest fires, drought, sea level rise and sea acidification, and diminishing world food supply.
The court should take seriously this suit and hopefully find in favour of it, so that the government is moved to increase and accelerate its efforts to reduce emissions and limit climate change.

Full text: The city of Toronto unveiled a broad set of recommendations on Tuesday to counter and manage the effects of climate change as part of its "resilience" strategy, a set of principles meant to guide decision-making in city hall.
The strategy includes other lofty goals: eliminating poverty, building green infrastructure and increasing government transparency.
Climate change will affect weather over Toronto and the city will need to invest in ways to adapt to significant meteorological changes, said the city's chief resilience officer, Elliott Cappell, who was in charge of writing the 157-page document.
"Toronto is getting hotter, wetter and wilder, and of course that's a result of climate change," he said.
In the coming years, the city's climate is expected to become more violent and less predictable. Extreme weather events, like heat waves and violent rainstorms, are projected to become more common. On Sunday, Lake Ontario water levels hit their highest point ever recorded and parts of the Toronto Islands were flooded. It's the second time in three years that the city has seen such severe flooding.
The announcement of the resilience strategy did not come with any dollar amounts attached and it is unclear what specific effects it will have in countering the effects of climate change or in addressing the strategy's other goals.
In the coming decades, the population of Toronto is projected to grow, hitting 3.4 million people by the 2040s. Growing social inequality means that some populations will be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than others. To deal with these changes, Mr. Cappell said it will become more important to invest in ways to adapt to climate change.
"In Canada, pretty much everywhere, a large portion of our leadership and our effort is spent on climate change mitigation - that is, decreasing our impact on the environment," he said. "On the adaptation side, we don't have the same investment. We haven't necessarily had to, but that is changing."
Tuesday's announcement cemented Toronto as a "resilient city" - one of 97 around the world. It joined the ranks of cities such as Milan, Honolulu, Rio de Janeiro and Paris - all part of the 100 Resilient Cities network, an organization set up and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation.
In Canada, other cities in the network include Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver, all of which have also committed to becoming more resilient - a broad term loosely defined as a city's ability to respond to shocks like climate change but including anything from terrorist attacks to blizzards.
"It's a term that comes from ecology. A resilient ecosystem is one that can survive through time. Often that comes from the biodiversity of the system," Mr. Cappell said.
Alex Versluis, senior vice-president of property development and management at the YMCA of Greater Toronto, who was present at the announcement Tuesday, said his organization is applying the principles in the resilience strategy on the ground. Generators are being installed in YMCAs across the city, allowing them to act as shelters in the event of a power outage.
Mr. Versluis said he saw the effects of climate change while in New York in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy where YMCA locations opened their doors to people who didn't have power.
"It's just a piece of the puzzle in that response fabric," he said.
Ray Park, communications adviser at the City of Toronto, said Tuesday in an e-mail that the city's Resilience Office and various city divisions will take the lead in implementing the resilience strategy.
He said the city will develop guidelines for "applying a climate lens" in the city's capital planning process. Toronto will also develop more localized plans to prepare for extreme weather.
Toronto Mayor John Tory told reporters at a separate presentation on Tuesday that the city has hundreds of millions of dollars set aside to invest in climate change mitigation measures over the next 10 years.
"This strategy adds some additional ideas to things we had already taken on board as to the need for us to prepare ourselves better for different kinds of flooding that happen across the city caused by unusual weather patterns and by the growth in the city," the mayor said.
But there's more to resilient cities than just vision statements, according to Kevin Manaugh, an academic who studies urban transportation and the environment at McGill University in Montreal.
"It's easy to call yourself a resilient city. It's easy to use a buzzword and say we're going to be resilient or aim towards resiliency, but it has to be backed up by actual investments in sustainable infrastructure and changes in things like energy use and things like emissions," he said.

Full text: As Montreal emerges from piles of snow and ice, citizens venture outdoors to re-engage with city life. For many older adults, winter means being "housebound" due to frigid temperatures, icy sidewalks and treacherous roads. Summers bring warmth, but also new perils. The July 2018 heat wave left 66 Montrealers dead, many of them older single men.
Age-friendly city policies - such as the 2018-20 document "Montreal, a city reflective of seniors'needs" - outlines an ambitious and broad mandate to provide co-ordinated leadership. This municipal project is inspired by the World Health Organization's 2007 Age-Friendly City initiative, an agenda that implicates all levels of government with conscious co-ordination and, most importantly, input from older people.
Four areas of action are identified: making Montreal a city of neighbourhoods on a human scale; fostering greater social cohesion; engaging citizens in their communities; and placing seniors at the heart of partnerships. Within each of these areas lurk the specific issues that touch the lives of older adults who live here, from concerns about safety to the need for affordable housing. However, there are often gaps between policy documents and the lived realities of older adults.
The challenges facing aging populations in Montreal are year-round, ongoing and should concern us all. With a view to making meaningful progress, we are proud to be hosting B/OLD: Aging in our city, a two-day trilingual, (English, French, and Quebec Sign Language) public symposium Thursday and Friday, accompanied by a two-week exhibition in Concordia University's 4TH SPACE (on view until May 24) that will inspire intergenerational exchanges on what it means to age in Montreal.
Implementing an Age-Friendly City agenda here is hampered by the fragmentation of power and responsibility between the City of Montreal and its boroughs. This fragmentation allows boroughs to develop programming specific to their constituents. Wonderful programs and age-friendly strategies such as the borough of St-LÃ©onard's Age-Friendly Action Plan, which was informed through neighbourhood walks with local older adults, may be launched in one part of the island and not another.
These strategies - their successes and their failures - would benefit from being shared. The question in the current context is how? One possibility is to establish an "aging office" within the municipal administration that is funded, properly staffed and sufficiently influential to ensure that all city departments integrate age-friendly considerations in their workflows. An older adult advisory board - a parallel to the existing youth advisory board - is another possibility.
The Age-Friendly City approach and plans are intended to enhance the visibility of our aging population and their concerns. What is needed, in addition to ongoing consultation with older citizens, are resources devoted to tangible and timely actions, such as making transit in Montreal fully accessible - again a part of the 2018-20 plan.
Successfully implementing the Age-Friendly City agenda also demands greater support for those agencies and organizations - many staffed by local volunteers - who are in constant contact with the local population. Many of these groups have been hit by funding cutbacks for many years, yet still provide invaluable support that often goes unrecognized.
We live in a world of good intentions when it comes to dealing with aging, but these alone are insufficient. Implementing an Age-Friendly City agenda requires deliberate co-ordination and collaboration between federal, provincial and municipal government, across boroughs and through different sectors of our society.
As we become old - and we all do - visionary, inclusive, bold thinking is required of us all. The Age-Friendly City agenda begins at home, wherever that place may be.
B/OLD: Aging in our city takes place Thursday and Friday at Concordia University, 1400 de Maisonneuve W. Admission to all programming is free. For more information, call Sasha Lipskaia at 438-824-5081 or consult www.b-old.ca.

Full text: As Montreal emerges from piles of snow and ice, citizens venture out-of-doors to re-engage with city life. For many older adults winter means "house-bound": frigid temperatures, icy sidewalks and treacherous roads. Summers bring warmth, but also new perils. The July 2018 heat wave left 68 Montrealers dead, the majority of them older single men.
Age-friendly city policies - such as the 2018-2020 document "Montreal, a city reflective of seniors' needs" - outlines an ambitious and broad mandate to provide co-ordinated leadership. This municipal project is inspired by the World Health Organization's 2007 Age-Friendly City( https://www.who.int/ageing/publications/Global_age_friendly_cities_Guide_English.pdf ) initiative, an agenda that implicates all levels of government with conscious co-ordination and, most importantly, input from older people.
Four areas of action are identified: making Montreal a city of neighbourhoods on a human scale; fostering greater social cohesion; engaging citizens in their communities; and placing seniors at the heart of partnerships. Within each of these areas lurk the specific issues that touch the lives of older adults who live here, from concerns about safety to the need for affordable housing. However, there are often gaps between policy documents and the lived realities of older adults.
The challenges facing aging populations in Montreal are year-round, on-going and should concern us all. With a view to making meaningful progress, we are proud to be hosting B/OLD: Aging in our city( http://www.b-old.ca ), a two-day trilingual, (English, French, and Quebec Sign Language) public symposium May 16 and 17, accompanied by a two-week exhibition in Concordia University's 4( http://www.concordia.ca/4thspace )(th) Space (on view until May 24) that will inspire intergenerational exchanges on what it means to age in Montreal.
Implementing an Age-Friendly City agenda here is hampered by the fragmentation of power and responsibility between the City of Montreal and its boroughs. This fragmentation allows boroughs to develop programming specific to their constituents. Wonderful programs and age-friendly strategies such as the borough of St-LÃ©onard's Age-Friendly Action Plan, which was informed through neighbourhood walks with local older adults, may be launched in one part of the island and not another.
These strategies - their successes and their failures - would benefit from being shared. The question, in the current context, is how.
One possibility is to establish an "aging office" within the municipal administration that is funded, properly staffed and sufficiently influential to ensure that all city departments integrate age-friendly considerations in their workflows. An older-adult advisory board - a parallel to the existing youth advisory board - is another possibility.
The Age-Friendly City approach and plans are intended to enhance the visibility of our aging population and their concerns. What is needed, in addition to on-going consultation with older citizens, are resources devoted to tangible and timely actions, such as making transit in Montreal fully accessible - again a part of the 2018-2020 plan.
Successfully implementing the Age-Friendly City agenda also demands greater support for those agencies and organizations - many staffed by local volunteers - who are in constant contact with the local population. Many of these groups have been hit by funding cutbacks, for many years, yet still provide invaluable support that often goes unrecognized.
We live in a world of good intentions when it comes to dealing with aging, but these alone are insufficient. Implementing an Age-Friendly City agenda requires deliberate co-ordination and collaboration between federal, provincial and municipal government, across boroughs and through different sectors of our society.
As we become old - and we all do - visionary, inclusive, bold thinking is required of us all. The Age-Friendly City agenda begins at home, wherever that place may be.
B/OLD: Aging in our city takes place May 16 and 17 at Concordia University, 1400 de Maisonneuve W. Admission to all programming is free. For more information, call Sasha Lipskaia at (438) 824-5081 or consult www.b-old.ca.( http://www.b-old.ca )

New city executive post faces climate transition head on; Councillor expects backlash but believes Montrealers understand need for action

Full text: It has only been a few weeks since Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante shook up the city executive committee and created a brand new post.
Laurence Lavigne Lalonde, a councillor from the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough, was put in charge of "ecological transition and resilience."
It's a somewhat vague job description and a title heavy with the latest environmental jargon. But what might, in the past, have been called sustainable development, is now freighted with the gravity of the threat posed by climate change.
What Lavigne Lalonde will be doing is aiming for the best while preparing for the worst. She'll be in charge of marshalling every tool within the city's reach to reduce emissions and transition to a low-carbon future while ensuring the city is ready to deal with the dire consequences of climate change, from floods and heat waves to extreme weather and food scarcity. (Urban agriculture is also her purview.)
Lavigne Lalonde was preparing to roll out a series of announcements related to her new gig during Earth Week. But on the eve of the big occasion, she took time to discuss her new job - the creation of which was designed to send a message.
"It's saying this is an issue of importance and urgency. We can't just leave it in the shadows of other portfolios. So we're bringing it out into the light to really create the possibility of acting," she said.
"It's saying to citizens, to our partners: 'This is important to us and we want to give it all necessary attention.'" Montreal already set a goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, but there's a long way to go to hit that target. One of Lavigne Lalonde's first tasks is evaluating each service and department to gauge their greenhouse-gas emissions, then looking for ways to slash their output.
"Those are our objectives, and from there our actions must flow," she said.
Lavigne Lalonde will help define what ecological transition ultimately means for Montreal, but already she likens her role to that of an "orchestra conductor," co-ordinating the work of many departments.
Her mandate will include parts of environment, which remains a stand-alone portfolio on the executive committee, but also aspects of urban planning, civil security, waste management, transportation and economic development related to climate change. She may consider measures to take aim at single-use plastics, beyond Montreal's ban on plastic bags. She will certainly look at what cities elsewhere in the world are doing, harnessing that knowledge, sifting through data and instituting best practices in Montreal.
Even if countries are the signatories of major climate accords, it's often cities taking bold action to curb climate change.
Paris is widely seen as leading the revolution. The adaptation measures it has undertaken are both large in scope and small in scale. From barring cars from certain areas, to instituting bans on certain types of cars to monthly car-free days, Paris is putting a dent in emissions. It is also transforming concrete schoolyards to green space and planning to plant a forest larger than Central Park.
Meanwhile, New York City on Thursday unveiled an aggressive emissions reduction plan. Touted as a Green New Deal for the city, it will require the retrofitting of residential and office buildings and will institute new standards for carbon-neutral construction. The Big Apple also recently became the first city in North America to introduce congestion pricing. Soon, vehicles entering some of the busiest parts of Manhattan will have to pay.
These are bold moves, radical even. Are Montrealers ready? Lavigne Lalonde acknowledged a big part of her job will be building awareness, educating the public and winning hearts and minds for the adaptation that must take place. Explaining and consulting on new measures will certainly come with the territory.
"But sometimes the proof comes from the result. If people see a reserved lane installed on their street, at first they're against it," she said. "When they can see how a measure works or how it improves their lives, they get on board."
Although she expects to face a backlash somewhere along the way, Lavigne Lalonde is convinced Montrealers are actually singing from the same songbook on the need to mitigate climate change.
"I think there's a consensus in Montreal that there's something happening and we have to do something about it. But the solutions might not be the same in every part of the city."
Her most important task may well end up being finding harmony amid the noise. ahanes@postmedia.com

Hope is on the horizon for Canadiens fans

Full text: The mind is a wonderful thing.
Had the Montreal Canadiens squeaked into the playoffs and been swatted aside in four or five games by the powerful Tampa Bay Lightning, it would have made for a grumpy summer. Fans would grumble, reporters would grouse, the cesspool that is social media would stink like a garbage strike in a heat wave.
Instead, one magical night, one shootout triumph over the hated Toronto Maple Leafs and one scintillating game for 20-yearold Minnesota native Ryan Poehling, and the chilly spring air smells of roses and Stanley Cup dreams.
All this because of Poehling 3.5, the night the rookie centreman's debut dovetailed in beguiling fashion with legendary broadcaster Bob Cole's swansong, the kid scoring three goals in regulation (including the tying goal) and another to win it in the shootout (hence the .5, since the NHL has never quite figured out what to do with The Gimmick in statistical terms).
Just like that, the mood shifted.
It might be a frigid spring, with the forecast calling for freezing rain, light snow and temperatures around one degree as we approach mid-April, but the mood is decidedly sunny. Rather than spending the next six months taking potshots at GM Marc Bergevin and agonizing over Jonathan Drouin's scoring drought, backup goaltender Antti Niemi's failures and the dysfunctional power play, fans will now spend the summer in a state of high anticipation, awaiting October and the season when young master Poehling is unleashed on the NHL for a full campaign.
It's like that when you're on pace for a 246-goal season. Never mind the game against the Leafs was meaningless in terms of the standings and the playoffs. The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career.
It won't always be like this for Poehling, but he's big, strong, involved and he has a scoring touch. In one game, he spent more time in close proximity to the goaltender than Max Pacioretty will spend in his entire NHL career.
All in all, a dazzling debut.
It was the perfect way to end a season that saw the Canadiens restore some lost pride, deliver more entertainment value than they have at any time since the 2014 playoffs and improve in the standings by 25 points.
All that is well and good. If they want the smiles to remain, Bergevin and owner Geoff Molson are going to need to try a little harder. As Global's Brian Wilde pointed out this weekend, enough with pocketing nearly $10 million a year in unused salary-cap space. That's fine when you aren't overpaying for free agents who can't get you to the promised land anyway - but when you get close, it's time to put that cash to work.
Despite the warm, fuzzy feeling left by that final game, the bottom line is that the Canadiens have missed the playoffs three of the past four seasons while resolutely refusing to go for broke. Enough. Now is the time. It will be a good summer for free agents, restricted and unrestricted. Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Erik Karlsson can shift the needle considerably, even if you have to overpay to acquire their services.
There is a solid argument for targeting either Panarin, an unrestricted free agent with the Blue Jackets, or restricted free agent Mitch Marner with the Leafs. The Canadiens have the cap money to make an offer for Marner that free-spending Leafs GM Kyle Dubas simply can't match - thus hamstringing the Leafs and acquiring one of the league's most exciting and dangerous young players in a single stroke.
Panarin, on the other hand, would make it possible for the Canadiens to jettison Drouin by whatever means possible. There are times when you simply have to acknowledge you made a bad deal and move on and this is one of them. Perhaps Bergevin can persuade some other organization that they can turn Drouin's game around but even if he can't, losing Drouin is addition by subtraction.
Then we come to the powerless power play. There were some indications the man-advantage was beginning to function late in the season, but it was far too little, too late. The Canadiens finished with the second-worst power play in the league - and if you think it's because they traded P.K. Subban, his Nashville Predators was the only team that was worse.
No matter what players are brought in, power-play repair has to be the first item of business for the coaching staff because with even a mediocre power play, the Habs would have had a 100-point season and a secure spot in the playoffs.
So fix the power play. Go for broke in free agency. And remember with a smile the night the raw rookie lit up the Leafs. jacktodd46@yahoo.com

Full text: Montreal Canadiens' Ryan Poehling celebrates after scoring against the Toronto Maple Leafs during first period NHL hockey action in Montreal, Saturday, April 6, 2019.
The mind is a wonderful thing.
Had the Montreal Canadiens squeaked into the playoffs and been swatted aside in four or five games by the powerful Tampa Bay Lightning, it would have made for a grumpy summer. Fans would grumble, reporters would grouse, the cesspool that is social media would stink like a garbage strike in a heat wave.
Instead, one magical night, one shootout triumph over the hated Toronto Maple Leafs( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-no-playoffs-but-canadiens-kept-fighting-to-the-very-end ) and one scintillating game for 20-year-old Minnesota native Ryan Poehling( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/ryan-poehling-makes-a-spectacular-debut-with-canadiens-in-6-5-so-win-over-leafs ) and the chilly spring air smells of roses and Stanley Cup dreams.
All this because of Poehling 3.5, the night the rookie centreman's debut dovetailed in beguiling fashion with legendary broadcaster Bob Cole's swansong( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/sports-pmn/hockey-sports-pmn/its-been-a-pleasure-legendary-play-by-play-man-bob-cole-makes-final-call/wcm/a15b118d-5590-4d68-8c43-e4901148a11a ), the kid scoring three goals in regulation (including the tying goal) and another to win it in the shootout (hence the .5, since the NHL has never quite figured out what to do with The Gimmick in statistical terms).
Canadiens' Ryan Poehling scores the winning goal against the Maple Leafs on Saturday, April 6, 2019.
Just like that, the mood shifted. It might be a frigid spring, with the forecast calling for freezing rain, light snow and temperatures around one degree as we approach mid-April, but the mood is decidedly sunny.

It's like that when you're on pace for a 246-goal season. Never mind the game against the Leafs was meaningless in terms of the standings and the playoffs. The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career despite a bit of churlish poor sportsmanship from Leafs coach Mike Babcock, who called for a replay review with nothing on the line.
Hockey Night in Canada broadcaster Bob Cole was given a Habs jersey by club president Geoff Molson for calling his last game at the Bell Centre against the Leafs before hanging up the mike.
The review from the Toronto War Room, predictably, took forever. Memories of Babcock's sour attempt to spoil the moment will last even longer.
It won't always be like this for Poehling, but he's big, strong, involved and he has a scoring touch. In one game, he spent more time in close proximity to the goaltender than Max Pacioretty will spend in his entire NHL career.

Canadiens' Ryan Poehling scores the winning goal against the Maple Leafs on Saturday, April 6, 2019.
Just like that, the mood shifted. It might be a frigid spring, with the forecast calling for freezing rain, light snow and temperatures around one degree as we approach mid-April, but the mood is decidedly sunny. Rather than spending the next six months taking potshots at GM Marc Bergevin and agonizing over Jonathan Drouin's scoring drought, backup goaltender Antti Niemi's failures and the dysfunctional power play, fans will now spend the summer in a state of high anticipation, awaiting October and the season when young master Poehling is unleashed on the NHL for a full campaign.
It's like that when you're on pace for a 246-goal season. Never mind the game against the Leafs was meaningless in terms of the standings and the playoffs. The Canadiens still missed the post-season despite a solid 96-point season, but what we will take into the off-season is Poehling getting the first goal of his career despite a bit of churlish poor sportsmanship from Leafs coach Mike Babcock, who called for a replay review with nothing on the line.
Hockey Night in Canada broadcaster Bob Cole was given a Habs jersey by club president Geoff Molson for calling his last game at the Bell Centre against the Leafs before hanging up the mike.
The review from the Toronto War Room, predictably, took forever. Memories of Babcock's sour attempt to spoil the moment will last even longer.
It won't always be like this for Poehling, but he's big, strong, involved and he has a scoring touch. In one game, he spent more time in close proximity to the goaltender than Max Pacioretty will spend in his entire NHL career.
All in all, a dazzling debut. It was the perfect way to end a season that saw the Canadiens restore some lost pride, deliver more entertainment value than they have at any time since the 2014 playoffs and improve in the standings by 25 points.
All that is well and good. If they want the smiles to remain, Bergevin and owner Geoff Molson are going to need to try a little harder. As Global's Brian Wilde pointed out this weekend( https://globalnews.ca/news/5137028/call-of-the-wilde-state-of-the-union/?utm_medium=Twitter&utm_source=%40Global_Montreal ), enough with pocketing nearly $10 million a year in unused salary-cap space. That's fine when you aren't overpaying for free agents who can't get you to the promised land anyway - but when you get close, it's time to put that cash to work.
Artemi Panarin of the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Despite the warm, fuzzy feeling left by that final game, the bottom line is that the Canadiens have missed the playoffs three of the past four seasons while resolutely refusing to go for broke. Enough. Now is the time. It will be a good summer for free agents, restricted and unrestricted. Artemi Panarin, Matt Duchene and Erik Karlsson can shift the needle considerably, even if you have to overpay to acquire their services.
There is a solid argument for targeting either Panarin, an unrestricted free agent with the Blue Jackets, or restricted free agent Mitch Marner with the Leafs. The Canadiens have the cap money to make an offer for Marner that free-spending Leafs GM Kyle Dubas simply can't match - thus hamstringing the Leafs and acquiring one of the league's most exciting and dangerous young players in a single stroke.
Panarin, on the other hand, would make it possible for the Canadiens to jettison Drouin by whatever means possible. There are times when you simply have to acknowledge you made a bad deal and move on and this is one of them. Perhaps Bergevin can persuade some other organization that they can turn Drouin's game around but even if he can't, losing Drouin is addition by subtraction.
Then we come to the powerless power play. There were some indications the man-advantage was beginning to function late in the season, but it was far too little, too late. The Canadiens finished with the second-worst power play in the league - and if you think it's because they traded P.K. Subban, his Nashville Predators was the only team that was worse.
No matter what players are brought in, power-play repair has to be the first item of business for the coaching staff because with even a mediocre power play, the Habs would have had a 100-point season and a secure spot in the playoffs.
So fix the power play. Go for broke in free agency. And remember with a smile the night the raw rookie lit up the Leafs.

Full text: The mind is a wonderful thing.
Had the Montreal Canadiens squeaked into the playoffs and been swatted aside in four or five games by the powerful Tampa Bay Lightning, it would have made for a grumpy summer. Fans would grumble, reporters would grouse, the cesspool that is social media would stink like a garbage strike in a heat wave.
Instead, one magical night, one shootout triumph over the hated Toronto Maple Leafs( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-no-playoffs-but-canadiens-kept-fighting-to-the-very-end ) and one scintillating game for 20-year-old Minnesota native Ryan Poehling( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/ryan-poehling-makes-a-spectacular-debut-with-canadiens-in-6-5-so-win-over-leafs ) and the chilly spring air smells of roses and Stanley Cup dreams.
All this because of Poehling 3.5, the night the rookie centreman's debut dovetailed in beguiling fashion with legendary broadcaster Bob Cole's swansong( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/sports-pmn/hockey-sports-pmn/its-been-a-pleasure-legendary-play-by-play-man-bob-cole-makes-final-call/wcm/a15b118d-5590-4d68-8c43-e4901148a11a ), the kid scoring three goals in regulation (including the tying goal) and another to win it in the shootout (hence the .5, since the NHL has never quite figured out what to do with The Gimmick in statistical terms).

Raising the bar: More room is being made on drink menus for mocktails that are just as sophisticated as their alcoholic versions, writes Julie Van Rosendaal. The result? A happy hour without the resulting hangover

Author: Van Rosendaal, Julie

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/raising-bar/docview/2201505965/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A cocktail is, by definition, an alcoholic beverage, built on a base spirit or spirits, with sodas and other ingredients added to enhance them. Anything non-boozy has historically fallen into an entirely different category. The term "mocktail" evokes images of Shirley Temples and virgin pina coladas, enthusiastically ordered by the under 12 set. At parties and restaurants, non-drinkers and designated drivers often resort to nursing fancy lemonades and pop.
But bartenders are rethinking their drinks; as the bar scene evolves, both with more interesting, multifaceted cocktails and a shifting attitude toward non-drinkers, people are choosing to pass on alcohol more often. "I think the more bartenders take the creation of nonalcoholic drinks as seriously as they do cocktails, the more folks will be interested in ordering them," says writer Talia Kleinplatz, founder of the cocktail-focused website Two for the Bar. "People go out to have a quality experience, whether that involves alcohol or not."
The new wave of booze-free cocktails are more sophisticated than the virgin varieties of yore, with more inspired ingredients and complex flavour profiles. And then there's Seedlip: The purveyors of the world's first non-alcoholic distilled spirits, made in Britain with fruits, herbs and botanicals (including citrus, cardamom, oak, lemongrass and hay), created their product to address the dilemma of what to drink when you're not drinking. With so many ingredients behind the bar, there's no reason the happy hour experience has to include getting buzzed.
Hojo Masako This bright, citrusy, sweet and salty cocktail tastes mildly of the ocean thanks to sheets of nori, and comes from bar chef Julien Duval at Hanzo Montreal. Calamansi is a citrus hybrid that resembles a lime, but is orange inside - the fruit and juice can be found at Filipino grocery stores.
Himalayan salt (optional) 2 oz (60 mL) nori syrup 1Â½ oz (45 mL) lime juice Â¾ oz calamansi juice or purÃ©e 2 oz (60 mL) tonic Sheets of nori, for garnish If you're using a highball glass, rim it by running half a lime around the edge and dipping it in a shallow dish of Himalayan salt. Shake the nori syrup, lime and calamansi juice or purÃ©e in a shaker with ice and strain into a glass, with or without ice. Garnish with nori.
FOR A BOOZY VERSION Shake 1Â½ oz gin, Â½ oz dry sakÃ©, 1Â½ oz nori syrup, Â¾ oz lime juice and Â½ oz calamansi juice or puree.
Robbie Hart Every cocktail at Crowbar in Vancouver is inspired by 1990s movie characters. Proprietor William Johnson created and named this one after the main character of The Wedding Singer. Butterfly pea flowers can be found at herbalists, bartending supply stores and online at DavidsTea - add a few flowers to a bottle or container of vodka or simple syrup to turn it brilliant blue. It will change colour to pink when it comes into contact with an acid, such as citrus juice.
1 oz (30 mL) grapefruit juice Â½ oz (15 mL) lime juice Â½ oz (15 mL) butterfly pea flower or honey syrup 3 dashes lavender bitters 3 dashes strawberry bitters 2 oz (60 mL) soda water Dried or fresh strawberries, for garnish Shake all the grapefruit and lime juice, butterfly pea flower syrup and bitters and pour into a Collins glass, over ice. Top with soda and garnish with dried or fresh strawberries.
FOR A BOOZY VERSION Add 2 oz (60 mL) butterfly pea flower-infused vodka (or regular vodka).
Spring Paloma Typically made with tequila, a paloma is bright and springy, and a favourite of cocktail writer Kleinplatz. Feel free to adjust ingredients to suit your taste (more syrup for sweetness, or lime juice for acidity). For the grapefruit soda, Kleinplatz says she's partial to San Pellegrino Pompelmo.
Juice of half a lime Salt Â½ oz (15 mL) grapefruit juice Â½ oz (15 mL) simple syrup Grapefruit soda Rim a highball glass with salt by rubbing a lime half around the rim and dipping it in a shallow dish of salt.
Combine the lime juice, grapefruit juice and simple syrup in a shaker and shake over ice. Strain into your highball glass, over fresh ice. Top with grapefruit soda and gently stir to combine. Garnish with a lime wheel or wedge.
FOR A BOOZY VERSION Add 2 oz tequila to the shaker.
Little Oasis in a Desert This cocktail is a favourite at the Deane House in Calgary, which was built in 1906 as the home of Captain Deane, Fort Calgary's last serving North West Mounted Police superintendent. Its name was inspired by a journal entry written by Captain Deane about his stay in Lethbridge, one of the first places he visited in Alberta, which he referred to as "a little oasis in a desert." 1Â½ oz (45 mL) Seedlip garden 1Â½ oz Turkish sherbet Â¼oz Porter's grapefruit tonic (or other craft tonic concentrate) Sparkling soda of choice (elderflower, ginger, lemon lime) Turkish delight, for garnish Shake the Seedlip, sherbet and tonic concentrate with ice and strain into a chilled coupe glass, top with soda and garnish with a piece of Turkish delight.
FOR A BOOZY VERSION Swap gin for the Seedlip (the Deane House uses Dillon's Rose Gin) and a bubbly brut for the soda.
Simple Syrup Simple syrup is a bar staple, but true to its name, it's simple to make. Start with an equal quantity of sugar (or honey, for honey syrup) and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar completely. Remove from the heat and let cool, then store in the fridge.
If you like, infuse the syrup as it simmers with aromatics such as fresh herbs (rosemary, mint), spices (cinnamon, coriander, star anise), fresh ginger, citrus zest, fresh or dried flowers (butterfly pea flowers, lavender) or sheets of dry nori. Once it cools, pour your syrup through a strainer into a bottle or jar to store in the fridge.

Full text: A carrot is usually better than a stick when it comes to enticing people out of their cars and onto public transit.
If buses could maintain their schedules within reason and allow people to arrive in comfort, I am convinced that many more would use the service.
However, with Montreal's ever increasing construction madness, how can bus drivers maintain their schedule? Plus there are other problems at play, as has been widely reported, such as buses running out of fuel or being stuck in garages awaiting repairs.
When the temperature dips to -20 C or worse, with a howling wind, I can choose to freeze while waiting for the bus or sit in my heated car. Even if I don't save time, I am warm.
In the summer, when the temperature can reach above 30 C and the humidity can be oppressive, again I can choose the comfort of my air-conditioned car or take the bus and arrive a total sweaty mess. (Note, I am aware the STM does have some air-conditioned buses, but not enough.)
Surely there must be a way of organizing road construction so that it does not create total gridlock.
Also, having all buses with air conditioning would be a big draw during the summer heat waves.

Opinion: Why we're skipping class to march against climate change

Full text: We have precious little time left to act on climate change, if any. Even if we were to garner a radical transformation of the world economy today, we'd still witness displacement, starvation and destruction on a scale unimaginable to the human mind. This is the last moment left to take action to secure a survivable future, yet we are told that we need to be reasonable and stay in class.
We are walking out of school Friday because we fear there will be little use for our education. We are being taught skills and roles for a world that is already dead. The jobs we are told to prepare for will not exist, and much sooner than we care to believe. The future we see, that scientists have been warning us about for more than 40 years, is far from bright.
We are angry. We are angry that the future that we were supposed to design, engineer and build has been stolen from us. The future is now something to be salvaged, if we are lucky.
It is a future of starvation, of mass migration and unending heat waves that kill the elderly and children. It is a future of less prosperity for everyone; the global economy seems certain to shrink by the end of the century. It is a future of permanent scarcity in the shadow of the irresponsible now.
The time for small changes and the tightening of belts has passed. The 1997 Kyoto accord, signed before we were born, was a failure. So was Copenhagen after it. The time we have had to address the greatest threat humanity has ever faced was squandered by the generation before us. Every country on the planet, including Canada, has failed to meet its Paris goals. We are on track for a future that is unimaginably bleak, and by the time we feel the full weight of our choices it will be too late.

We are told by the generation before us that what we need to do is stick to the ideas that created the nightmare we will have to live in, because they are the only ideas. We are told that there is no alternative.
It is clear that our present economic system is driving us toward ruin and will continue to bring more emissions, causing more warming. Our farmland is being dried out and our water polluted. The victims of our actions are being treated as invaders, stopped at border checkpoints and held in detention camps for migrants. There must be an alternative.
Every child on Earth is being robbed of what the generation before us took for granted. The commons have been raided and left in ruin, and we are being asked to pay the price. That is why we walk out of class: because we know enough of what the generation before us has done and what needs to be repaid.
The youth of the world represent half of the global population. We will live in the ravaged wasteland left to us, and yet we have no say in the political process and there is no accountability in this system. That is why we are walking out of class and why we will continue. This is just the beginning and we will not stop until we do what is necessary.
We hope it will not be too late, if it already isn't.

Full text: We have precious little time left to act on climate change, if any. Even if we were to garner a radical transformation of the world economy today, we'd still witness displacement, starvation and destruction on a scale unimaginable to the human mind. This is the last moment left to take action to secure a survivable future, yet we are told that we need to be reasonable and stay in class.
We are walking out of school Friday because we fear there will be little use for our education. We are being taught skills and roles for a world that is already dead. The jobs we are told to prepare for will not exist, and much sooner than we care to believe. The future we see, that scientists have been warning us about for more than 40 years, is far from bright.
We are angry. We are angry that the future that we were supposed to design, engineer and build has been stolen from us. The future is now something to be salvaged, if we are lucky.
It is a future of starvation, of mass migration and unending heat waves that kill the elderly and children. It is a future of less prosperity for everyone; the global economy seems certain to shrink by the end of the century. It is a future of permanent scarcity in the shadow of the irresponsible now.
The time for small changes and the tightening of belts has passed. The 1997 Kyoto accord, signed before we were born, was a failure. So was Copenhagen after it. The time we have had to address the greatest threat humanity has ever faced was squandered by the generation before us. Every country on the planet, including Canada, has failed to meet its Paris goals. We are on track for a future that is unimaginably bleak, and by the time we feel the full weight of our choices it will be too late.

When does spring start?

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."
The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ); the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).
"I don't want to sound alarmist, but because of the snow levels we're following things pretty closely."
In summary: hope is on the horizon, but don't let your guard down.

The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ); the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).
"I don't want to sound alarmist, but because of the snow levels we're following things pretty closely."
In summary: hope is on the horizon, but don't let your guard down.

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."
The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.

Analysis: Legault government faces big choices as National Assembly resumes sitting

Full text: QUEBEC - They are telling words for a government sitting on a huge majority.
"We have to stay humble," Premier FranÃ§ois Legault told the other 74 members of his caucus when it met last week in Gatineau. "We are allowed to look at the polls but not comment on them.
"It won't always be like this. There will be highs and there are lows. I don't want to see arrogance anywhere in the ranks."
The temptation is real. Four months into its mandate and the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec is still basking in a political honeymoon with most voters.
As the National Assembly resumes sitting Tuesday for the CAQ government's first real year in power since winning the October election, a LÃ©ger public opinion poll( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/trudeaus-liberals-legaults-caq-lead-the-pack-with-quebecers-poll ) published by the QuÃ©becor media group last weekend shows the government has a 63 per cent satisfaction rate, a number not seen since the first election of Jean Charest in 2003.
Had an election been held last week, the CAQ would have bagged 42 per cent of the vote, five percentage points more than it earned in the election (37 per cent).
But a strong mandate - even if it lingers - can be a mixed blessing too; hence Legault's warning.
The CAQ arrived in office promising to be different, decisive, taking decisions quickly, but that style of governing, which Radio-Canada political analyst SÃ©bastien Bovet has tagged the "bing-bang" way of doing things, has its perils.
Take Legault's snap response last Thursday where he said there is no Islamophobia problem in Quebec. Legault spent most of his day Friday walking that back( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muslim-group-demands-retraction-from-legault-over-islamophobia-comment ) after a chorus of people begged to differ.
On Monday, his Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne also sounded the retreat, admitting he made an error when - in another hasty act - he took responsibility for the firing of whistleblower Louis Robert( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-agriculture-minister-admits-mistake-in-firing-of-whistleblower ) on his shoulders.
In the heat of the action I poorly expressed myself."
"In the heat of the action I poorly expressed myself," Lamontage said in Montreal.
So how does this bode for the really tricky stuff ahead, including the CAQ government's secularism bill, which would ban authority figures such as judges, police officers, correctional officers and elementary and high school teachers from wearing religious symbols( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-crucifix-in-quebecs-national-assembly-why-its-symbolism-matters )?
Legault's impatience to settle this question is clear. He repeats daily that Quebec has debated this question for years and it's time to move on to other issues.
He feels the election gave him a clear mandate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-defends-plans-to-ban-religious-symbols-replace-school-boards ) to act after years of Liberal stalling.
"There is public support for this, which is important, (even if) there are small groups that will try to attack it," Legault said Sunday in an interview on the LCN news channel political show La Joute. "But my intention is to have this settled by the summer so we can turn the page and start talking about real issues."
But the government's intentions on this question remain vague and are still catching people by surprise. Last week Legault revealed private school teachers would not be subject to the ban on hijabs, kippahs and turbans, but those in the public system would.
And the government's recentprobe of school boards( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/we-had-to-act-fast-on-riverdale-high-unapologetic-legault-says ), the police and judiciary, to find out how many people could be potentially affected by the ban, shows it is trying to beef up its arguments for wanting to act.
Legault has said he expects pockets of resistance( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/ill-make-final-call-on-acquired-rights-for-religious-symbols-legault-says ) to the bill, but nothing like the resistance the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois experienced with its ill-fated charter of values, which would have banned symbols for all public servants.
But history shows disgruntlement about the PQ's plan emerged slowly after the bill enacting the charter was tabled and then became a tidal wave.
Could that happen again? The Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois opposition Monday again urged Legault to heed its advice and include a grandfather clause recognizing acquired rights for existing employees.
While the PQ supports the ban for authority figures, it does not want to see people fired or shuffled into other non-visible roles as the government has suggested.
"It might seem simple to apply a policy wall-to-wall, but there are many technicalities that are more than technicalities; they are called human factors," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said at a news conference Monday setting the tone for the session.
I think we have to show some humanity while staying firm on the principles."
"I don't think we want to create martyrs. I think we have to show some humanity while staying firm on the principles."
And opposition exists.
On Monday the FÃ©dÃ©ration autonome de l'enseignement, the union representing 43,000 elementary and high school teachers, told reporters they fear the government will launch a "hijab hunt" in the public sector.
The government is attacking "a problem that does not exist" instead of dealing with the real needs of students, FAE president Sylvain Mallette told reporters in Quebec City.
Simmering in the background is another key figure with the LÃ©ger poll. While the government is sitting pretty with francophone voters, it is stuck in the dungeon at 19 per cent among non-francophones. Liberals have 64 per cent support in that group.
There have been complaints that recent decisions, closing Riverdale High School( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-to-close-riverdale-high-school-building-will-go-to-francophone-system ) plus ignoring appeals of tolerance for bilingual signage at the Lachute( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-wont-protect-bilingual-signs-in-lachute-hospital-legault ) hospital, show a certain tone deafness to minority interests and sensitivities.
Watching from his new post as interim leader of the Quebec Liberals, Pierre Arcand said the CAQ "are going to have to be prudent. We don't manage Quebec like a business. A government is not a business."
Will the government be more cautious following its series of rookie errors on the ice?
Dead ahead are other political files fraught with potential trouble: reducing the level of immigration, presenting legislation to transform school boards into service centres, prying more powers out of the hands of the federal government.

Perhaps an indicator of what lies ahead rests in a Radio-Canada interview granted by Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge on Monday. Despite all the election hoopla, Roberge said the big education reforms he promised are going to take longer than he imagined because the government machine can't move any faster.

Full text: They are telling words for a government sitting on a huge majority.
"We have to stay humble," Premier FranÃ§ois Legault told the other 74 members of his caucus when it met last week in Gatineau. "We are allowed to look at the polls but not comment on them.
"I won't always be like this.
There will be highs and there are lows. I don't want to see arrogance anywhere in the ranks."
The temptation is real. Four months into its mandate and the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec is still basking in a political honeymoon with most voters.
As the National Assembly resumes sitting Tuesday for the CAQ government's first real year in power since winning the October election, a LÃ©ger public opinion poll published by the QuÃ©becor media group last weekend shows the government has a 63 per cent satisfaction rate, a number not seen since the first election of Jean Charest in 2003.
Had an election been held last week, the CAQ would have bagged 42 per cent of the vote, five percentage points more than it earned in the election (37 per cent).
But a strong mandate - even if it lingers - can be a mixed blessing too; hence Legault's warning.
The CAQ arrived in office promising to be different, decisive, taking decisions quickly, but that style of governing, which Radio-Canada political analyst SÃ©bastien Bovet has tagged the "bing-bang" way of doing things, has its perils.
Take Legault's snap response last Thursday where he said there is no Islamophobia problem in Quebec.
Legault spent most of his day Friday walking that back after a chorus of people begged to differ.
On Monday, Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne also sounded the retreat, admitting he made an error when - in another hasty act - he took responsibility for the firing of whistleblower Louis Robert on his shoulders.
"In the heat of the action I poorly expressed myself," Lamontage said in Montreal.
So how does this bode for the really tricky stuff ahead, including the CAQ government's secularism bill, which would ban authority figures such as judges, police officers, correctional officers and elementary and high school teachers from wearing religious symbols? Legault's impatience to settle this question is clear. He repeats daily that Quebec has debated this question for years and it's time to move on to other issues.
He feels the election gave him a clear mandate to act after years of Liberal stalling.
"There is public support for this, which is important, (even if) there are small groups that will try to attack it," Legault said Sunday in an interview on the LCN news channel political show Le Joute. "But my intention is to have this settled by the summer so we can turn the page and start talking about real issues."
But the government's intentions on this question remain vague and are still catching people by surprise. Last week, Legault revealed private school teachers would not be subject to the ban on hijabs, kippahs and turbans, but those in the public system would.
And the government's recent probe of school boards, the police and judiciary, to find out how many people could be potentially affected by the ban, shows it is trying to beef up its arguments for wanting to act.
Legault has said he expects pockets of resistance to the bill, but nothing like the resistance the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois experienced with its ill-fated charter of values, which would have banned symbols for all public servants.
But history shows disgruntlement about the PQ's plan emerged slowly after the bill enacting the charter was tabled and then became a tidal wave.
Could that happen again? The Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois opposition Monday again urged Legault to heed its advice and include a grandfather clause recognizing acquired rights for existing employees.
While the PQ supports the ban for authority figures, it does not want to see people fired or shuffled into other non-visible roles as the government has suggested.
"It might seem simple to apply a policy wall-to-wall, but there are many technicalities that are more than technicalities; they are called human factors," interim PQ Leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said at a news conference Monday, setting the tone for the session.
"I don't think we want to create martyrs. I think we have to show some humanity while staying firm on the principles."
And opposition exists. On Monday the FÃ©dÃ©ration autonome de l'enseignement, the union representing 43,000 elementary and high school teachers, told reporters they fear the government will launch a "hijab hunt" in the public sector.
The government is attacking "a problem that does not exist" instead of dealing with the real needs of students, FAE president Sylvain Mallette told reporters in Quebec City.
Simmering in the background is another key figure with the LÃ©ger poll. While the government is sitting pretty with francophone voters, it is stuck in the dungeon at 19 per cent among non-francophones. Liberals have 64-per-cent support in that group.
There have been complaints that recent decisions, closing Riverdale High School plus ignoring appeals of tolerance for bilingual signage at the Lachute hospital, show a certain tone deafness to minority interests and sensitivities.
Watching from his new post as interim leader of the Quebec Liberals, Pierre Arcand said the CAQ "are going to have to be prudent. We don't manage Quebec like a business. A government is not a business."
Will the government be more cautious following its series of rookie errors on the ice? Dead ahead are other political files fraught with potential trouble: reducing the level of immigration, presenting legislation to transform school boards into service centres, prying more powers out of the hands of the federal government.
Perhaps an indicator of what lies ahead rests in a Radio-Canada interview granted by Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge on Monday. Despite all the election hoopla, Roberge said the big education reforms he promised are going to take longer than he imagined because the government machine can't move any faster.
Immigration, Diversity and Inclusiveness Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette got a similar "reality check" two weeks ago.
Charged with reforming the immigration system and reducing the total number of new arrivals from 50,000 a year to 40,000, Jolin-Barrette said he discovered there are 18,000 unprocessed immigration files - some dating back to 2005 - sitting on the desks of his bureaucrats. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier

Full text: QUEBEC - They are telling words for a government sitting on a huge majority.
"We have to stay humble," Premier FranÃ§ois Legault told the other 74 members of his caucus when it met last week in Gatineau. "We are allowed to look at the polls but not comment on them.
"I won't always be like this. There will be highs and there are lows. I don't want to see arrogance anywhere in the ranks."
The temptation is real. Four months into its mandate and the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec is still basking in a political honeymoon with most voters.
As the National Assembly resumes sitting Tuesday for the CAQ government's first real year in power since winning the October election, a LÃ©ger public opinion poll( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/trudeaus-liberals-legaults-caq-lead-the-pack-with-quebecers-poll ) published by the QuÃ©becor media group last weekend shows the government has a 63 per cent satisfaction rate, a number not seen since the first election of Jean Charest in 2003.
Had an election been held last week, the CAQ would have bagged 42 per cent of the vote, five percentage points more than it earned in the election (37 per cent).
But a strong mandate - even if it lingers - can be a mixed blessing too; hence Legault's warning.
The CAQ arrived in office promising to be different, decisive, taking decisions quickly, but that style of governing, which Radio-Canada political analyst SÃ©bastien Bovet has tagged the "bing-bang" way of doing things, has its perils.
Take Legault's snap response last Thursday where he said there is no Islamophobia problem in Quebec. Legault spent most of his day Friday walking that back( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muslim-group-demands-retraction-from-legault-over-islamophobia-comment ) after a chorus of people begged to differ.
On Monday, his Agriculture Minister AndrÃ© Lamontagne also sounded the retreat, admitting he made an error when - in another hasty act - he took responsibility for the firing of whistleblower Louis Robert( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-agriculture-minister-admits-mistake-in-firing-of-whistleblower ) on his shoulders.
In the heat of the action I poorly expressed myself."
"In the heat of the action I poorly expressed myself," Lamontage said in Montreal.
So how does this bode for the really tricky stuff ahead, including the CAQ government's secularism bill, which would ban authority figures such as judges, police officers, correctional officers and elementary and high school teachers from wearing religious symbols( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-crucifix-in-quebecs-national-assembly-why-its-symbolism-matters )?
Legault's impatience to settle this question is clear. He repeats daily that Quebec has debated this question for years and it's time to move on to other issues.
He feels the election gave him a clear mandate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-defends-plans-to-ban-religious-symbols-replace-school-boards ) to act after years of Liberal stalling.
"There is public support for this, which is important, (even if) there are small groups that will try to attack it," Legault said Sunday in an interview on the LCN news channel political show Le Joute( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-wants-to-settle-religious-symbols-issue-by-summer ). "But my intention is to have this settled by the summer so we can turn the page and start talking about real issues."
But the government's intentions on this question remain vague and are still catching people by surprise. Last week Legault revealed private school teachers would not be subject to the ban on hijabs, kippahs and turbans, but those in the public system would.
And the government's recentprobe of school boards( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/we-had-to-act-fast-on-riverdale-high-unapologetic-legault-says ), the police and judiciary, to find out how many people could be potentially affected by the ban, shows it is trying to beef up its arguments for wanting to act.
Legault has said he expects pockets of resistance( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/ill-make-final-call-on-acquired-rights-for-religious-symbols-legault-says ) to the bill, but nothing like the resistance the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois experienced with its ill-fated charter of values, which would have banned symbols for all public servants.
But history shows disgruntlement about the PQ's plan emerged slowly after the bill enacting the charter was tabled and then became a tidal wave.
Could that happen again? The Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois opposition Monday again urged Legault to heed its advice and include a grandfather clause recognizing acquired rights for existing employees.
While the PQ supports the ban for authority figures, it does not want to see people fired or shuffled into other non-visible roles as the government has suggested.
"It might seem simple to apply a policy wall-to-wall, but there are many technicalities that are more than technicalities; they are called human factors," interim PQ leader Pascal BÃ©rubÃ© said at a news conference Monday setting the tone for the session.
I think we have to show some humanity while staying firm on the principles."
"I don't think we want to create martyrs. I think we have to show some humanity while staying firm on the principles."
And opposition exists.
On Monday the FÃ©dÃ©ration autonome de l'enseignement, the union representing 43,000 elementary and high school teachers, told reporters they fear the government will launch a "hijab hunt" in the public sector.
The government is attacking "a problem that does not exist" instead of dealing with the real needs of students, FAE president Sylvain Mallette told reporters in Quebec City.
Simmering in the background is another key figure with the LÃ©ger poll. While the government is sitting pretty with francophone voters, it is stuck in the dungeon at 19 per cent among non-francophones. Liberals have 64 per cent support in that group.
There have been complaints that recent decisions, closing Riverdale High School( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-to-close-riverdale-high-school-building-will-go-to-francophone-system ) plus ignoring appeals of tolerance for bilingual signage at the Lachute( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-wont-protect-bilingual-signs-in-lachute-hospital-legault ) hospital, show a certain tone deafness to minority interests and sensitivities.
Watching from his new post as interim leader of the Quebec Liberals, Pierre Arcand said the CAQ "are going to have to be prudent. We don't manage Quebec like a business. A government is not a business."
Will the government be more cautious following its series of rookie errors on the ice?
Dead ahead are other political files fraught with potential trouble: reducing the level of immigration, presenting legislation to transform school boards into service centres, prying more powers out of the hands of the federal government.

Perhaps an indicator of what lies ahead rests in a Radio-Canada interview granted by Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge on Monday. Despite all the election hoopla, Roberge said the big education reforms he promised are going to take longer than he imagined because the government machine can't move any faster.

Review: Tweaked SLAV is a tad less problematic, still far from profound

Full text: There were protests, Wednesday, as Robert Lepage prepared to unveil his reworked version of SLAV in Sherbrooke. But the uproar was of a different type than that which greeted the production back in June, when it was unveiled as part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival and cancelled after just three performances( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepages-controversial-play-about-indigenous-people-kanata-has-been-cancelled ).
It turns out Wednesday's protests weren't directed at Lepage, singer Betty Bonifassi, or their "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs;" but rather at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in town on official business.
After a long, hot summer during which the outcry surrounding SLAV engulfed the entire province, and following which Lepage and Bonifassi did their best to make it all fade away, there was little desire on any side to dust off the old cultural appropriation debate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/dunlevy-post-slav-and-kanata-lets-talk-about-cultural-appropriation ).
So launching the show anew in the dead of winter, a couple hours drive from Montreal, must have seemed like a safe bet. Lepage laid the groundwork in late December, releasing a statement( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-admits-to-clumsiness-ahead-of-slav-relaunch ) announcing that he had met with members of the black community, admitting that he had made mistakes, and stating that he had revised his controversial production with their input.
In SLAV, two women trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.
The rejigged SLAV was performed at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke's Centre Culturel Wednesday night, the first of a handful of dates around the province this winter. The major differences: no more white women picking cotton, for one; and a clearer and more conscientious distribution of actors along racial lines.
Bonifassi was again joined by six female backup singers. Last time only two of them were women of colour; that number increased to three with the welcome addition of Tracy Marcelin, who enlivened the show with her singing and guitar playing, alongside the returning Sharon James and Kattia Thony. (The cast was filled out by Estelle Richard, Ãlisabeth Sirois and AudrÃ©e SouthiÃ¨re.)
A weary and wary-looking Bonifassi emerged to start things off. "Bonsoir," she said, dressed in black and leaning on a cane - possibly a lingering consequence of the fall in which she broke her ankle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says ) last summer, forcing the show's cancellation.
She repeated the story of her Italian-Serbian-French background, leading into the Slavic roots of the word slave. She then professed her longstanding "obsession" with slave songs, and declared the evening an homage to the music that emerged from this "long, painful chapter in history."
SLAV's loose narrative revolves around Kattia and her blond friend Estelle (Richard), who go on a journey from Quebec to the deep south.
Bonifassi has released two solo albums of these songs: funky updates of field recordings made by ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax in the early 1900s, that are the basis for this show.
The Baltic hymn that opened the original production has been nixed, and so the night began with James singing the bruised blues number Early in the Morning, joined by Thony and Marcelin against a projected backdrop of cotton fields. Two white actresses emerged to help them process the day's yield, but this time they were dressed in blue with white bonnets, to set them apart from the slaves. Other problematic details have been cleaned up in similar ways.
The show's loose narrative again revolves around Kattia and her blond friend Estelle (Richard), who go on a journey from Quebec to the deep south, as they trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.
Though she doesn't participate in as many of the dramatic interludes, Bonifassi still sings around half the songs, including Black Betty, early on. The lyrics, about a black woman who has a baby with blue eyes, acquire another layer of meaning when sung by a white woman named Betty in a show about black slavery; but it's unclear how much of the irony is intended.
A rejigged SLAV was performed at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke's Centre Culturel, with a more conscientious distribution of actors along racial lines.
And that's where SLAV still falters. It is telling that one of the evening's more powerful moments comes in a scene in which Kattia ends up in jail, performing the work song I Don't Do Nobody, behind bars with James and Marcelin.
There is visual and musical poignancy to these three black women, singing how they "don't do nobody nothin', Jesus, but they hates me just the same."
That poignancy simply isn't there when Bonifassi sings these songs. Hint: it has nothing to do with her voice.
All of which leads one to wonder what a full black cast and black writer/director could do with this material.
As is, SLAV is not the offensive, shambolic mess it was last summer; but it is far from the profound piece of musical theatre it aspires to be.
It's neither here nor there.
In SLAV, two women trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.

A weary and wary-looking Bonifassi emerged to start things off. "Bonsoir," she said, dressed in black and leaning on a cane - possibly a lingering consequence of the fall in which she broke her ankle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says ) last summer, forcing the show's cancellation.
She repeated the story of her Italian-Serbian-French background, leading into the Slavic roots of the word slave. She then professed her longstanding "obsession" with slave songs, and declared the evening an homage to the music that emerged from this "long, painful chapter in history."
SLAV's loose narrative revolves around Kattia and her blond friend Estelle (Richard), who go on a journey from Quebec to the deep south.
Bonifassi has released two solo albums of these songs: funky updates of field recordings made by ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax in the early 1900s, that are the basis for this show.
The Baltic hymn that opened the original production has been nixed, and so the night began with James singing the bruised blues number Early in the Morning, joined by Thony and Marcelin against a projected backdrop of cotton fields. Two white actresses emerged to help them process the day's yield, but this time they were dressed in blue with white bonnets, to set them apart from the slaves. Other problematic details have been cleaned up in similar ways.
The show's loose narrative again revolves around Kattia and her blond friend Estelle (Richard), who go on a journey from Quebec to the deep south, as they trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.
Though she doesn't participate in as many of the dramatic interludes, Bonifassi still sings around half the songs, including Black Betty, early on. The lyrics, about a black woman who has a baby with blue eyes, acquire another layer of meaning when sung by a white woman named Betty in a show about black slavery; but it's unclear how much of the irony is intended.
A rejigged SLAV was performed at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke's Centre Culturel, with a more conscientious distribution of actors along racial lines.
And that's where SLAV still falters. It is telling that one of the evening's more powerful moments comes in a scene in which Kattia ends up in jail, performing the work song I Don't Do Nobody, behind bars with James and Marcelin.
There is visual and musical poignancy to these three black women, singing how they "don't do nobody nothin', Jesus, but they hates me just the same."
That poignancy simply isn't there when Bonifassi sings these songs. Hint: it has nothing to do with her voice.
All of which leads one to wonder what a full black cast and black writer/director could do with this material.
As is, SLAV is not the offensive, shambolic mess it was last summer; but it is far from the profound piece of musical theatre it aspires to be.
It's neither here nor there.
In SLAV, two women trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.

Full text: There were protests, Wednesday, as Robert Lepage prepared to unveil his reworked version of SLAV in Sherbrooke. But the uproar was of a different type than that which greeted the production back in June, when it was unveiled as part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival and cancelled after just three performances( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepages-controversial-play-about-indigenous-people-kanata-has-been-cancelled ).
It turns out Wednesday's protests weren't directed at Lepage, singer Betty Bonifassi, or their "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs;" but rather at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in town on official business.
After a long, hot summer during which the outcry surrounding SLAV engulfed the entire province, and following which Lepage and Bonifassi did their best to make it all fade away, there was little desire on any side to dust off the old cultural appropriation debate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/dunlevy-post-slav-and-kanata-lets-talk-about-cultural-appropriation ).
So launching the show anew in the dead of winter, a couple hours drive from Montreal, must have seemed like a safe bet. Lepage laid the groundwork in late December, releasing a statement( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-admits-to-clumsiness-ahead-of-slav-relaunch ) announcing that he had met with members of the black community, admitting that he had made mistakes, and stating that he had revised his controversial production with their input.
In SLAV, two women trace Estelle's lineage on her mom's side back to a black slave who fled captivity.
The rejigged SLAV was performed at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke's Centre Culturel Wednesday night, the first of a handful of dates around the province this winter. The major differences: no more white women picking cotton, for one; and a clearer and more conscientious distribution of actors along racial lines.
Bonifassi was again joined by six female backup singers. Last time only two of them were women of colour; that number increased to three with the welcome addition of Tracy Marcelin, who enlivened the show with her singing and guitar playing, alongside the returning Sharon James and Kattia Thony. (The cast was filled out by Estelle Richard, Ãlisabeth Sirois and AudrÃ©e SouthiÃ¨re.)
A weary and wary-looking Bonifassi emerged to start things off. "Bonsoir," she said, dressed in black and leaning on a cane - possibly a lingering consequence of the fall in which she broke her ankle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says ) last summer, forcing the show's cancellation.

Allison Hanes: Kids, cars and cold - the three go together in winter

Full text: No matter how much we may want to, giving up our cars is easier said than done in Montreal - especially for families with children.
And perhaps no time of year underscores the dearth of better alternatives more than the dark depths of January.
Getting around with kids in winter is a slog. We wake before sunrise and return home after sundown. When the sun does shine, the temperature usually plunges. Taking children outside requires bundling them up until they resemble the Michelin Man. But taking them inside again means either sweating it out or stripping them down - and then carrying around armloads of parkas, pants, hats and mitts.
You can imagine the fun, then, of taking a toddler in a snowsuit on public transit. Even if you've got a stroller in which to stow all the extra layers, there's no guarantee you'll be able to get it up and down the stairs to the mÃ©tro, since so few stations have elevators. It also may be tough to squeeze it aboard a crowded bus.
Car shares? A few have child seats in the trunk, but is it a bucket seat or a booster? Is it rear-facing or front-facing? What's required by law changes according to the age of your child. If you bring your own, you have to tote it with you, plus add time for installation to your outing. The same goes for taxis.
More and more families are choosing cycling as an option when there's no snow on the ground. Some pedal along with multiple kids loaded on rear carriers, the active transport version of the station wagon, while wheelbarrow-like bakfiets( https://www.bakfiets.com/ ), ubiquitous in Amsterdam, are increasingly appearing on Montreal streets. But winter cycling is for the hardy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-cycling-in-montreal-is-an-exercise-in-snowy-frustration ) as it is. The iffy status of snow-clearing on bike paths makes biking with kids in winter for the truly intrepid.
That leaves walking. Rain or shine, heat wave or blizzard, that's my preferred method of getting to and from work/school/daycare. Dress for the elements, swap the stroller for the sled if there's snow accumulation, and it's quite manageable if you're lucky enough to live within striking distance. It might even be faster than the bus if you factor in time lost waiting and potential delays. But sidewalks that are icier than many skating rinks( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-montrealers-are-slip-slidin-away-on-icy-sidewalks ) can make being a pedestrian with kids perilous indeed. You certainly have to tread more carefully if you have an infant strapped to you in a carrier, or if you have a small hand to hold.
And all bets are off once the weekend rolls around. A packed itinerary of children's activities in disparate and far-flung locations across the city makes a car trip unavoidable in the face of the reduced Sunday transit schedule.
Is it any wonder, then, that Quebecers are buying more cars, driving bigger vehicles and logging more kilometres on the road?
That was one big takeaway from the latest inventory of the province's greenhouse gas emissions,( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-the-war-on-the-car-is-the-war-on-climate-change-in-quebec ) published in December. It certainly explains why Quebec is behind in reaching its reduction targets and underscores the urgency of action to curb our dependence on vehicles. The role of urban sprawl aside, these statistics also expose some inescapable sociological truths about the harried pace of modern life.
Even in Montreal, where it's arguably easiest to forgo the family vehicle, going car-free is not without obstacles.
Oh, sure, it's certainly possible. Le Devoir published a feature on Monday( https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/transports-urbanisme/545431/quand-les-familles-moderent-leur-transport ) talking to Montreal families who ditched their personal automobiles. However, those profiled all noted that it took careful planning and concerted effort to stick to their decision. We should all applaud their determination - and listen carefully to their experiences.
Since transportation is a significant and rising source of emissions in Quebec, tackling traffic is primordial. And if we want to keep families in the city and stop the exodus to the 'burbs, making it easier to navigate Montreal year-round is equally essential.
Many couples who don't have vehicles get one when baby makes three, for dashing to the doctor with a sick infant or to make the most of those narrow windows between naps. Of course, cars have their downsides in winter, too, since children in car seats cannot be safely buckled in wearing their snowsuits. Repeatedly dressing and undressing a kid to get to and from the car, then into and out of the child seat, is a chore in itself - and one that becomes especially onerous on frigid days.
But for far too many, it's still the least worst option.

Full text: It was a very good year for Quebec books. Newcomers crashed the scene, trusted names were in top form, and translations bridged the language gap with a frequency and speed seldom seen. Here, in no special order, is a genre-spanning selection of 2018 highlights.
In Rawi Hage's fourth novel, Beirut Hellfire Society (Knopf Canada), a second-generation undertaker makes his jaded but clear-eyed way through a war-ravaged city, serving the loose-knit titular community whose unconventional lives require an equally unconventional handling in death. Rarely has a novel of ideas worn its philosophical enquiry so lightly: Hage somehow keeps things moving at an airport-thriller pace. You'll be reminded of predecessors ranging from Dante to Cormac McCarthy to Roberto Bolao, but mostly you'll be left thinking that there are no apparent limits to what Hage can do.
Dimitri Nasrallah's novel The Bleeds (Esplanade/VÃ©hicule) is set in an unnamed Central Asian republic where the visionary founder's son is a despot whose heir-apparent son, in turn, is a playboy wastrel. It's the latter's story Nasrallah tells, and he nails his protagonist's infuriating cocktail of arrogance, fecklessness and unchecked privilege, deftly balancing the horrifying and the hilarious. Best of all, he doesn't overplay the topicality hand: readers are left to draw their own contemporary real-life parallels, and there won't be any shortage to choose from.
Kim ThÃºy's three novels comprise an ongoing, impressionistic, non-linear account of one woman's journey from wartime Vietnam to contemporary Quebec. Packed with finely observed sensory detail, flawless thumbnail character studies and exquisite set pieces, they're not a word longer than they need to be. The newest instalment, Vi (Vintage Canada), continues ThÃºy's fruitful matchup with translator Sheila Fischman. Readers will be forgiven for hoping this project runs indefinitely.
The opening pages of Antigone Undone: Juliette Binoche, Anne Carson, Ivo van Hove and the Art of Resistance (University of Regina Press) find Will Aitken in professional doldrums and personal depression, out of sorts in wintertime Amsterdam. A way out is presented with the offer to observe van Hove's theatrical mounting of Carson's Sophocles translation. A behind-the-scenes, making-of-the-play account told with a novelist's instinct for drama, Antigone Undone is also an eloquent testimony to the difference art can make in a person's life. If you happen to be a big Binoche fan - and what sensible person isn't? - all the better.
With the publication last summer of Eric Dupont's Songs for the Cold of Heart (Baraka), English readers were finally able to get up to speed with the popular phenomenon of the huge-selling 2012 novel La fiancÃ©e AmÃ©ricaine. Shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize in its Peter McCambridge translation, Songs is an old-school, multigeneration, globe-spanning epic, its formal ambitions grounded by its sure-handed storytelling instincts and its deep roots in rural Quebec. Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March is a high bar, but Dupont earns the comparison.
Eliza Robertson's Demi-Gods (Penguin Canada) pulled off a surprise QWF Best Fiction win this year with its grippingly noir telling of how a sibling childhood conflict leaves a trail across the ensuing decades. David Lynch might be a partial reference point here, but really Robertson's voice is her own, and she sustains it from start to finish. Bonus points for the "No spoilers, please" ending of the year.
In the last stages of a battle with cancer, cartoonist GeneviÃ¨ve CastrÃ©e was determined to make a book for her young daughter; A Bubble (Drawn & Quarterly) is the result. Told from the child's perspective, and employing the form of a book for young readers even though it will appeal equally to adults, it's a touching portrayal of the primal mother-child bond and an abject lesson in how to get the maximum emotional impact from minimal materials.
Russian-born Mikhail Iossel, a teacher at Concordia who divides his time between Montreal and the United States, is old enough to have sharp first-hand memories of the pre-glasnost USSR; he has also kept in close touch with what Vladimir Putin has wrought. Notes from Cyberground: Trumpland and My Old Soviet Feeling (New Europe) finds him righteously grappling, in diary form, with the ongoing aftermath of the 2016 American presidential election, the result of which is bringing back all the wrong kinds of memories for someone who has seen authoritarianism close up before. "Let's give Trump credit for keeping the flames of our indignation with him alive and burning bright," Iossel writes, and in a very different way his cathartic book does the same.
Claire Holden Rothman's Lear's Shadow (Penguin Canada), inspired by her experience as a stagehand in a Shakespeare-in-the-park production, is a finely layered novel with a father-daughter relationship at its core, an underpinning of up-to-date climate anxiety thanks to its setting in a Montreal heat wave, and an indelible character in an aging rouÃ©, problem-drinking stage ham who steals every scene he's in.
Paige Cooper's Zolitude (Biblioasis) separated itself from the pack of debut story collections by dint of the author's razor-sharp prose and unerring portraits of alienation and displacement both literal and symbolic. The approach is one of hyper-realism, but with sci-fi elements lurking around the edges and occasionally creeping centre stage. A typical Cooper story starts in one place and, by stages so subtle you hardly notice, ends up somewhere else completely. Which might be another way of saying there's no such thing as a typical Cooper story.
Louise Penny's Insp. Gamache series, a melding of old-style whodunit and police procedural, is now 14 instalments to the good, and showing no fatigue thanks to the author's unerring knack for combining familiarity and surprise. Kingdom of the Blind (Minotaur) continues a plot thread begun two books back in which Gamache runs into serious career trouble thanks to his unorthodox handling of the growing opioid crisis. Enticingly, Penny is allowing her chief Inspector to show signs of late-middle-age wear and tear, inviting speculation as to how much longer he can handle the demands of his work. Stay tuned.
Catherine Leroux's Madame Victoria (Biblioasis) addresses one of modern-day Montreal's great unsolved mysteries. In 2001, the skeletal remains of a woman were found in the trees behind the now-closed Royal Victoria Hospital. Her identity has still not been determined. Speculating on the fundamental questions - who was she, and how did she get there? - Leroux imagines a series of possible lives and tells them via a series of stories told in a variety of genres. Each component can stand alone, but cumulatively they play off each other with ever-increasing resonance, adding up to something original and haunting.
Non-drivers among us have found our champion in Stanley PÃ©an. The popular Montreal writer and broadcaster makes his English-language debut, translated by David Homel, with Taximan: Stories and Anecdotes from the Backseat (Linda Leith Publishing). A set of encounters rendered in unassuming miniature comprise a kaleidoscopic urban portrait that captures the essence of the Haitian-born author's adopted city.
Even with five and a half years'distance, the scale of what happened at Lac-MÃ©gantic on July 6, 2013 can still be hard to comprehend. With The Lac-MÃ©gantic Rail Disaster: Public Betrayal, Justice Denied (Lorimer), Bruce Campbell performs a service by getting it all between two covers. Itemizing the confluence of avoidable conditions that caused the catastrophe, and not afraid to assign blame, the book pays tribute to a resilient community even as it leaves us with the uneasy feeling that, if fundamental changes aren't made, something similar might happen again somewhere.
Norths: Two Suitcases and a Stroller Around the Circumpolar World (Conundrum) is an account by Chicoutimi-born Alison McCreesh of an epic trip made with her partner and their two-year-old son around the world above the 60th parallel north. Structured as a daily series of drawn postcards and pithy written messages, the book vividly evokes places most of us will never visit, with insights into communities and ecosystems at the coalface of climate change.
The curatorial impulse was well represented in 2018, and in a variety of ways. Dirty Plotte: The Complete Julie Doucet (Drawn & Quarterly) gives Montreal's groundbreaking underground cartoonist the star treatment she deserves. The Flame: Poems and Selections from Notebooks (McClelland & Stewart) gathers Leonard Cohen's final poems along with a selection of late-period lyrics and drawings for a valedictory portrait of a giant; The Good Lands: Canada Through the Eyes of Artists (Figure 1) is an unprecedentedly comprehensive and inclusive gathering of landscape works that has the power to make us look at the country in new ways. ianmcgillis2@gmail.com

Full text: Hello,
After this edition, Morning Update is taking a two-day break and will be back on Dec. 27. Thanks for being a subscriber, and happy holidays.
Every year, on Dec. 24, The Globe publishes its annual Christmas painting on the front page of the paper. This time around it's Ice Cutting, Quebec Cityby Maurice Cullen, from 1906.
The ice harvest would have been a familiar sight for the Montreal landscape painter. Before mechanical refrigeration, blocks of ice were hacked from frozen rivers and ponds, and preserved in straw, providing all-season deliveries to the zinc-lined kitchen icebox where perishables were kept fresh - or the tavern storeroom where beer was cooled. The practice provided a rich subject Cullen returned to several times in the early 20th century. In this version,Ice Cutting, Quebec City, he shows workers framed by the high banks of the St. Lawrence at Quebec City; in another, in the collection of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the city of Montreal shimmers in the distance.
Cullen, who once said that the most common subject would look beautiful at some hour of the day, was impressed by the plein-air painting of the French Impressionists during a six-year stint in Paris. You can see their influence here in the artist's attention to the sky, magnificently detailed with billowing banks of light grey clouds counterbalancing the bluish forms of the ice below. At the centre, a worker's long spear draws the eye down into the black depths of the St. Lawrence.
On the eve of the holidays, this landscape feels appropriately wintry, but it also offers the promise of the changing seasons: In spring, the whole river will open and the iceman's delivery will soon become a necessity.? - Kate Taylor

Why were these legendary pot brownies so much harder to make than we thought? A half-baked holiday mystery
Ian Brown's plan was to team up with a top pastry chef to recreate the famous 'Haschich Fudge' popularized by Gertrude Stein's lover. Then it turned out it wasn't a recipe for brownies at all. Sothey got creative. (for subscribers)
28 shows to binge watch on Netflix and Amazon over the holidays
Maniacis humane, surreal and highly recommended;Sacred Gamesis a brilliant thriller series from India; Michelle Wolf's new comedy show is low-key, absurdist - and wickedly entertaining;Salt, Fat, Acid, Heatis lovely, pure, unfussy nourishment. Those are just a handful of criticJohn Doyle's suggestionsas you kick back and relax this holiday season. (for subscribers)
Your last-minute guide to getting through the holidays unscathed
The most wonderful time of the year? We get it. The holidays are stressful. The bickering relatives, endless to-do lists and lineups galore. Not to mention toys that are sold out, tape that has run out and nowhere to hide (the presents). We're here to helpwith solutions to common holiday problems, so as the too-short days of December fly by, you can keep your sanity - and sense of humour - intact. (for subscribers)
LONG READS
Smartphone refuseniks are a rare but happy breed
In a country where most of us own smartphones but are ambivalent about digital dependence, a few aredeliberately logging off- and they say it's done wonders for their imaginations and peace of mind.
I wanted an abortion in Nova Scotia, but all around, barriers still remained
At 36 and a married mother of two, The Globe's Atlantic bureau chief Jessica Leederneeded to end a pregnancy- which is still a battle in some pockets of the country. Trying to get an abortion left her brimming with feelings of powerlessness, shame and disbelief.
Inside China's campaign against the Uyghurs
Thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims have been detained in a growing network of indoctrination centres as Beijing pushes to erase centuries of religious tradition.Nathan VanderKlippe reportsfrom China's Xinjiang region.
TODAY'S TOP STORIES
Canada is mounting a global campaign to free Canadians detained in China
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada's ambassadors around the world are now talkingwith their host countries about the "worrying precedent" China has set with its "arbitrary detention" of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said people around the globe are "extremely disturbed" by the detentions, which are being viewed as a tit-for-tat response to the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver earlier this month. Freeland's call for the "immediate release" of Kovrig and Spavor is the kind of blunt diplomatic language reserved for when one country believes another state has absolutely no grounds to arrest its citizens.
The U.S. is in the midst of a partial government shutdown
The Senatewasn't able to reach an agreementover the weekend to fund the public service as U.S. President Donald Trump demands more funds for a border wall with Mexico - a condition Democrats aren't willing to accept. More than 400,000 employees will be forced to work without pay until the dispute is resolved.
David Shribmanwrites thatthere will be blowback for the shutdown: "It's the Democrats' fault. No, it's the Republicans'. It's the President and his fanatical right-wing base who caused this. No, it's the liberals and their leftist zealots who are to blame. These imprecations are all correct, and they are all incorrect. But there's something - a very big thing - that's not right in the country's politics, and it's the American political class that has foisted a great wrong on the American people." (for subscribers)
A tsunami set off by volcanic eruption has killed at least 281 in Indonesia
Hundreds were also injured, with homes and other buildings suffering major damage on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. Residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs, such as receding water or an earthquake, before waves of 2 to 3 metres washed ashore. Residents and tourists forced to evacuate are being told to remain away from beaches as high-tide warnings remain in place.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Trudeau surprised Canadian peacekeepers in Mali, thanking the troops over a Christmas dinner
Upon landing at the remote Camp Castor, the Prime Minister was greetedby the 30 C-plus heat the 250 Canadian peacekeepers work in on a daily basis. Canada is providing state-of-the-art medical-evacuation capability, transportation and logistical support to the United Nations mission, though the troops rarely interact with the local Malian population in what's seen as a risk-averse operation.
The one-year mission is part of the Trudeau government's vow to restore Canada's commitment to UN peace operations (Canada's last major peacekeeping foray in Africa came in the 1990s). Ottawa is hoping it will result in a strong show of support from African nations as Canada vies for a UN Security Council seat in 2021-22.
MORNING MARKETS
World stocks extend losses into seventh day
World stocks were set for their seventh straight day of losseson Monday, as investors nervy about the possibility of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown and a worsening global economy opted for the safety of bonds and gold. MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.15 per cent lower on the day and down almost 7 per cent in the past seven sessions. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.49 per cent just after 6 a.m. (ET). France's CAC 40 was off 1.12 per cent. In Asia, markets were mostly mixed ahead of the Christmas holiday. On Wall Street, futures pointed to modest gains at the open. Markets in New York and Toronto will close early on Monday. The Canadian dollar was trading at 73.71 US cents.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
A holly, jolly Christmas - while the planet burns
"Christmas is a complicated time of year. There's the Yuletide carol and gay apparel, the peace on earth and goodwill toward man. There are wonderful acts of charity and more acts of shopping. There's food, music, and for some, religion. And then there's the end-of-year, off-the-treadmill downtime for reflection. And the fact that the planet is going to hell in a handbag." - Naomi Buck, Toronto-based freelance writer
I'm Muslim, and the Christmas spirit moves me
"Beyond the merriment of families and the happiness of children - good enough reasons for any celebration - what Christmas represents for me is a spiritual renewal, a reawakening of my class consciousness, which has been eroded through the labours of the year and the focus on the self that these labours entail. Because at the heart of Christmas as I see it is a concern for those less fortunate - not as a political project, but as a moral one, caring for 'the least of these brothers and sisters of mine,' as the Bible puts it. This is the Christian idea embodied, as it is the Islamic one - as it is the idea of what it means to be a thinking, feeling human being." - Omer Aziz, writer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic and elsewhere
Cold comfort: In defence of winter, the most widely reviled season
"As an introvert, it's with this gratifying lethargy that I still embrace the cold and dark, perhaps more than ever. It's never just a bitter season to endure. I do less in winter. I go out less. I devote more time to solitude. I don't feel remorse for sitting inside, for (essentially) hiding. Winter has become my annual antidote to abundance and revelry. Expectations are adjusted to value long, substantial dinners and early bed times. A walk on a cold night becomes suitable exercise." - Iain Reid, author ofFoeandI'm Thinking of Ending Things
MOMENT IN TIME
The 200th anniversary of Silent Night
Dec. 24, 1818: One of the world's most beloved carols had its humble premiere on Christmas Eve, 1818, in tiny St. Nicholas Church in Oberndorf, about 31 kilometres from Salzburg, Austria. A collaboration between a young parish priest named Joseph Mohr (who wrote the lyrics) and organist Franz Gruber (the music), the duo sang Stille Nachtto a small group of parishioners who braved the winter weather for midnight mass. Legend has it that the church organ was broken that Christmas Eve, so Mohr asked his friend to quickly write a melody to go along with a religious poem he'd written many months before. Gruber grabbed a guitar, and the two sang the healing message of Stille Nacht, orSilent Night. Over the ensuing years, the song was shared among small parishes in Austria, but it didn't break beyond its borders until 1831, when the Duke of Leipzig heard a rendition at a local fair. The Christmas carol soon reached the ears of the Prussian king and Silent Night, well, has not been silent since. It's a favourite soundtrack of the holidays, sung by the likes of Luciano Pavarotti, Bing Crosby and even Jimi Hendrix. - Gayle MacDonald

City joins forces with environmental groups to reach climate goals

Full text: Montreal is partnering with three environmental organizations to achieve its goal of making the city carbon neutral by 2050, Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante announced Monday.
Flanked by representatives of the David Suzuki Foundation, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and the Trottier Family Foundation, Plante signed a twoyear agreement to work together to help reach the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting increases in greenhouse-gas emissions to 1.5 per cent.
In addition to lending their expertise, the foundations will contribute at least $250,000 to help the city achieve its climate goals over the next two years, with the possibility of spending up to $400,000, depending on how needs evolve, she said.
"This is unique," said David Miller, regional director for North America of C40, an international network of major cities committed to addressing climate change.
"It's the first one of its kind where private philanthropy is funding a partnership like this to create a plan for real action against climate change to produce carbon neutrality by 2050," he said.
"This partnership I hope will be a model to other cities globally," Miller added.
Karel Mayrand, director of the David Suzuki Foundation for eastern Canada, said the 90 deaths during last summer's heat wave and the floods during the spring of 2017 demonstrate the urgency of taking action.
By pooling resources and sharing expertise, the partnership will make Montreal "a model for ecological transition and resilience," he said. The problem with many action plans adopted by governments around the world is the lack of a road map to ensure the goal of carbon neutrality becomes a reality, Mayrand said.
"There are measures but the measures don't necessarily determine the achievement of targets," he said.
The partnership will help chart a path for change by analyzing sectors responsible for the majority of emissions, starting with transportation, which produces 43 per cent of Quebec's GHG emissions - of which 80 per cent is from road traffic - according to a government report released last week.
The report showed Quebec is unlikely to meet its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) by 20 per cent from 1990 to 2020.
Transportation emissions grew by 21.9 per cent between 1990 and 2016, it said, while total emissions decreased by only 9.1 per cent during that period.
Residents of Greater Montreal owned 968,466 vehicles in 2017, a number that's grown by 115,000 since 2004, with 8,800 additional vehicles using the roads every year on average, according to statistics released by the city last month.
The partnership will also study buildings, responsible for 10.8 per cent of Quebec's emissions, Plante said.
One aspect of the partnerships'work will be getting buy-in from the public, since governments can't do this alone, Plante noted.
And reducing emissions from transportation and other sources won't happen without support from higher levels of government, added Plante, who has continued to push for the proposed Pink Line mÃ©tro extension even though the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec government has said it isn't a priority.
Miller said he did not want to tell the Quebec government what to do "but it's my perspective from being involved in municipal politics for a very long time that city governments, especially the mayor, understand what the transport needs of their community are, and I think that the policies and the projects that they develop should be the ones that are funded."
So in that sense, the Pink Line is "the right thing to do," he said.

It's coming! Snow on the way, temperatures to drop this weekend

Full text: Don't let Wednesday's warm temperatures and brief sunny periods fool you; it really is time to dig out the woollies and winter boots.
Environment Canada is predicting sinking temperatures over the next week, with snow on the weekend for parts of the province and flurries in Montreal by Tuesday.
"Today it (went) up to 12 degrees, and that probably is the warmest we are going to see in the next week at least," said Peter Kimbell, warning preparedness meteorologist with the Meteorological Service of Canada.
"The normal high is plus seven, so we are well above normal today, but it only goes downhill from here on in."
Indeed, Environment Canada is forecasting a high of 8 C for Thursday, then 4 on Friday, 5 on Saturday, 1 on Sunday, and 0 on Monday. Tuesday is showing a high of -1, with a 60 per cent chance of flurries.
The Weather Network is forecasting 5 cm of snow in Montreal next Tuesday, and then 1-3 cm of snow on each of next Thursday, Friday and Saturday (Nov. 15, 16, and 17).
Some sources, such as the Farmer's Almanac, have predicted a snowier and colder-than-normal winter in Montreal, while Environment Canada's seasonal forecast, issued on Oct. 31, said that November, December and January will be slightly warmer than average in Montreal.
But Kimbell warned against putting a lot of stock in forecasts of more than a week or two.
"We are continuing to advance in the accuracy of our short-term forecasts, but for these long-term or seasonal forecasts, the accuracy is just not there."
But he added "the trend is pretty clear. In the next week to 10 days, possibly even longer, it's going to continue to be cold."
"In the short term, there is some snow expected northwest of Montreal on Saturday. Abitibi, Rouen, those places are going to get some snow north of Montreal and maybe even in the Laurentians somewhat. And next Tuesday is another possibility (for snow in Montreal). But again, it's early," he said.
And if you feel like October was a little brutal this year, you're right. After three months of above-normal temperatures and what seemed like endless heat waves well into September, Montreal had its coldest October since 1993. That was a surprise to some, considering last October was one of the hottest in history.
Montreal already had its first snowfall, just before Halloween, on Oct. 27-28, when an accumulation of 3 cm fell overnight.
In October, Montreal saw mean temperatures of 6.8 C, which is 1.7 degrees below the normal mean of 8.5 C.
And while it may feel like we've had a lot of rain this autumn, we actually got less than normal in October, only 75 mm as opposed to the average of 91 mm.
Rain was, however, very heavy in some parts of the province in October. The Abitibi, TÃ©miscamingue and Matagami regions got 60 to 100 mm of rain between Oct. 9 and 11, causing basement flooding, culvert failures and flooded and closed roads.
Strong winds on Oct. 15 and 16 caused power outages in Montreal, the National Capital and ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches regions.
Several areas of the GaspÃ© Peninsula have already seen significant snow accumulation, including Murdochville, which received more than 40 cm on Oct. 24-25.

Full text: Don't let Wednesday's warm temperatures and brief sunny periods fool you; it really is time to dig out the woollies and winter boots.
Environment Canada is predicting sinking temperatures over the next week, with snow on the weekend for parts of the province and flurries in Montreal by Tuesday.
"Today it (went) up to 12 degrees and that probably is the warmest we are going to see in the next week at least," said Peter Kimbell, Warning Preparedness Meteorologist with the Meteorological Service of Canada.
"The normal high is plus seven so we are well above normal today, but it only goes downhill from here on in."
Indeed, Environment Canada is forecasting( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) a high of 8 C for Thursday, then 4 on Friday, 5 on Saturday, 1 on Sunday, and 0 on Monday. Tuesday is showing a high of -1, with a 60 per cent chance of flurries.
The Weather Network( https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/14-day-weather-trend/quebec/montreal?from7day=1 ) is forecasting 5 cm of snow in Montreal next Tuesday, and then 1-3 cm of snow on each of next Thursday, Friday and Saturday (Nov. 15, 16, and 17).
Some sources, such as the Farmer's Almanac, have predicted a snowier and colder than normal winter in Montreal, while Environment Canada's seasonal forecast, issued on Oct. 31, said that November, December and January will be slightly warmer than average in Montreal.
But Kimbell warned against putting a lot of stock in forecasts of more than a week or two.
"We are continuing to advance in the accuracy of our short-term forecasts, but for these long-term or seasonal forecasts, the accuracy is just not there."
But he added "the trend is pretty clear. In the next week to 10 days, possibly even longer, it's going to continue to be cold,"
"In the short term there is some snow expected northwest of Montreal on Saturday. Abitibi, Rouen, those places are going to get some snow north of Montreal and maybe even in the Laurentians somewhat. And next Tuesday is another possibility (for snow in Montreal). But again, it's early," he said.

Several areas of the GaspÃ© Peninsula have already seen significant snow accumulation, including Murdochville, which got more than 40 cm on Oct. 24-25.

Full text: Here's a look at ValÃ©rie Plante's eventful debut year as Montreal's mayor.
2017 November
. After running an energetic, upbeat, mobility-focused campaign, ValÃ©rie Plante of Projet MontrÃ©al wins the election( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-election-results-valerie-plante-headed-from-obscurity-to-history ), riding a wave of dissatisfaction with incumbent Denis Coderre to become the city's first female mayor.
. The incoming administration says it is surprised to find a $358-million budgetary shortfall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/projet-montreals-first-challenge-a-358-million-budget-shortfall-report ) left behind by Coderre. It says it will have to make up for the deficit in its first budget.
. Plante unveils her executive committee. It features an equal number of women and men but includes no visible minorities or anglophones( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-executive-committee-will-reflect-balance-diversity-plante-says ).
The "Bonjour-Hi" controversy: Plante says "Bonjour" should be encouraged but won't say whether "Hi" should be dropped.
December
. After Quebec's National Assembly urged merchants to drop "Bonjour-Hi" as a greeting, Plante is asked if she will encourage the use of Bonjour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/valerie-plante-supports-bonjour-but-wont-say-if-hi-should-be-dropped ). "As mayor, I can't impose rules but ... Montreal is the francophone metropolis of North America," she says. "It's an asset, it's a plus and we want to showcase it." But she won't say if 'Hi' should be dropped.
. The Quebec government suspends Montreal chief of police Philippe Pichet after a damning report about the force's internal affairs division.
. Plante cancels the 2018 Formula E electric-car race( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/in-the-wake-of-bombshell-reports-mayor-to-address-formula-es-future-in-montreal ), one of Coderre's pet projects, after being unable to agree on a location with the event's promoters. During the election, she had vowed to move the event out of downtown Montreal.
. The new administration does away with a controversial bylaw that put strict limits on pit bull-type dogs( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-suspends-pit-bull-ban-will-consult-before-reworking-bylaw ), saying such dogs are no longer considered a dangerous breed in Montreal. It promises a new bylaw later in the year.
When the Plante administration unveils its first budget, the tax hike sparks a backlash.
2018 January
. The provincial government agrees to help pay for 300 new hybrid buses for the SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ), one of Plante's election promises.
. Plante unveils her first budget. The average tax bill will go up by 3.3 per cent( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-mayor-valerie-plante-hikes-taxes-more-than-expected ) in 2018. To many, that appears to break her promise not to increase taxes by more than the inflation rate, which in 2018 was to be 2.1 per cent. Suburbs are blindsided by the average 5.3-per-cent hike in what they'll have to pay the city - more than twice what they were expecting.
. Plante's tax hike sparks a backlash. Plante brushes aside criticism, saying she wasn't actually reneging on a pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was due to a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." She later admits her administration could have done a better job( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-we-could-have-been-more-clear-before-raising-taxes-valerie-plante-says ) explaining the budget.
. Plante's snow-clearing point person, Jean-FranÃ§ois Parenteau, apologizes after an uproar over icy sidewalks and slow snow removal( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-snow-crisis-more-like-snow-fiasco ). Plante promises to do better, spending more on salt, ordering bigger blowers for overflowing snow dumps and investing in "ice crushers" to deal with sidewalks.
The first and last Formula E race in Montreal in July 2017. Only 13,646 people paid to watch the race, organizers later reveal.
February
. It turns out 30,000 tickets( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-formula-e-10000-more-freebies-than-previously-revealed ) (10,000 more than originally thought) were given away for the 2017 Formula E, says the non-profit agency running the race as it reveals a deficit of almost $14 million. It later emerges that 35,000 tickets were actually given away; only 13,646 people paid to watch the race.
. One of Plante's top lieutenants, Plateau-Mont-Royal borough mayor Luc Ferrandez says of the tax-hike election promise( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ferrandez-accuses-plante-administration-of-amateurism ): "We never, never should have promised that in the election campaign. It was amateurism." Some interpret it as a swipe at Plante.
. Details emerge of a pilot project to temporarily eliminate through traffic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plan-to-stop-through-traffic-over-mount-royal-gets-mixed-reviews ) on Mount Royal. Many are surprised by the plan but during the election campaign, Projet MontrÃ©al had said it would "implement a plan for the progressive reduction of transit traffic" on Mount Royal.
. Some of the most vulnerable seniors, including anglophones and immigrants, are being excluded by the Plante administration's plan to consult elderly Montrealers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anglophones-immigrants-left-out-of-citys-consultations-on-seniors-researchers ) on how to make Montreal more senior-friendly, according to two research organizations. More meetings are added to assuage critics.
. Plante announces a committee will look into providing free or cheaper transit to seniors, children and people on low incomes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-announces-consultation-on-reducing-transit-fares ). This fulfills an election promise.
March
. Montreal makes it easier to use car-sharing services( https://montrealgazette.com/news/car-sharing-coming-to-more-montreal-neighbourhoods ) by allowing them to expand to more neighbourhoods. This fulfills an election promise.
. Plante sets up an advisory committee on diversity issues( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/new-advisory-committee-to-help-montreal-better-represent-minorities ) that will include people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as Indigenous Peoples, the LGBTQ community and those with reduced mobility.
The Mount Royal project: a segment of Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. is closed to traffic from June 2 to Oct. 31.
April
. Plante says she is "very open" to letting Montreal police officers wear religious garb( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-doesnt-rule-out-hijabs-turbans-in-police-force ).
. A $21.2-million plan to encourage people to buy homes in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-makes-announcement-on-housing ) is unveiled.

Full text: Here's a look at ValÃ©rie Plante's eventful debut year as Montreal's mayor.
2017
November
After running an energetic, upbeat, mobility-focused campaign, ValÃ©rie Plante of Projet MontrÃ©al wins the election, riding a wave of dissatisfaction with incumbent Denis Coderre to become the city's first female mayor.
The incoming administration says it is surprised to find a $358-million budgetary shortfall left behind by Coderre. It says it will have to make up for the deficit in its first budget.
Plante unveils her executive committee. It features an equal number of women and men but includes no visible minorities or anglophones.
December
After Quebec's National Assembly urged merchants to drop "Bonjour-Hi" as a greeting, Plante is asked if she will encourage the use of Bonjour. "As mayor, I can't impose rules but ... Montreal is the francophone metropolis of North America," she says. "It's an asset, it's a plus and we want to showcase it." But she won't say if 'Hi'should be dropped.
The Quebec government suspends Montreal chief of police Philippe Pichet after a damning report about the force's Internal Affairs Division.
Plante cancels the 2018 Formula E electric-car race, one of Coderre's pet projects, after being unable to agree on a location with the event's promoters. During the election, she had vowed to move the event out of downtown Montreal.
The new administration does away with a controversial bylaw that put strict limits on pit bull-type dogs, saying such dogs are no longer considered a dangerous breed in Montreal. It promises a new bylaw later in the year.
2018
January
The provincial government agrees to help pay for 300 new hybrid buses for the SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al, one of Plante's election promises.
Plante unveils her first budget. The average tax bill will go up by 3.3 per cent in 2018. To many, that appears to break her promise not to increase taxes by more than the inflation rate, which in 2018 was to be 2.1 per cent. Suburbs are blindsided by the average 5.3 per cent hike in what they'll have to pay the city - more than twice what they were expecting.
Plante's tax hike sparks a backlash. Plante brushes aside criticism, saying she wasn't actually reneging on a pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was due to a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." She later admits her administration could have done a better job explaining the budget.
Plante's snow-clearing point person, Jean-FranÃ§ois Parenteau, apologizes after an uproar over icy sidewalks and slow snow removal. Plante promises to do better, spending more on salt, ordering bigger blowers for overflowing snow dumps and investing in "ice crushers" to deal with sidewalks.
February
It turns out 30,000 tickets (10,000 more than originally thought) were given away for the 2017 Formula E, says the non-profit agency running the race as it reveals a deficit of almost $14 million. It later emerges that 35,000 tickets were actually given away; only 13,646 people paid to watch the race.
One of Plante's top lieutenants, Plateau-Mont-Royal borough mayor Luc Ferrandez says of the tax-hike election promise: "We never, never should have promised that in the election campaign. It was amateurism." Some interpret it as a swipe at Plante.
Details emerge of a pilot project to temporarily eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal. Many are surprised by the plan but during the election campaign, Projet MontrÃ©al had said it would "implement a plan for the progressive reduction of transit traffic" on Mount Royal.
Some of the most vulnerable seniors, including anglophones and immigrants, are being excluded by the Plante administration's plan to consult elderly Montrealers on how to make Montreal more senior-friendly, according to two research organizations. More meetings are added to assuage critics.
Plante announces a committee will look into providing free or cheaper transit to seniors, children and people on low incomes. This fulfils an election promise.
March
Montreal makes it easier to use carsharing services by allowing them to expand to more neighbourhoods. This fulfils an election promise.
Plante sets up an advisory committee on diversity issues that will include people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as Indigenous Peoples, the LGBTQ community and those with reduced mobility.
April
Plante says she is "very open" to letting police wear religious garb.
A $21.2-million plan to encourage people to buy homes in Montreal is unveiled. The highest subsidies - up to $15,000 - are for families with children who purchase a newly built dwelling in the downtown core valued at up to $450,000. This fulfils an election promise.
Plante announces a $123-million plan to remake a stretch of Ste-Catherine St. W. She scraps Coderre's plan to heat sidewalks and keep two car lanes and parking. The street will be reduced to one lane between Mansfield and Bleury Sts. and parking will be eliminated.
Details of the Mount Royal pilot project (June 2 to Oct. 31) are unveiled. Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. will be closed to traffic between the parking lot at Smith House and the one at Beaver Lake.
May
The McCord Museum is shocked to learn Plante plans to build a park on the site reserved for the museum's new $150-million location.
In a scathing report, Montreal's inspector-general says former mayor Coderre's office set up a non-profit organization to skirt the law on awarding contracts for the 2017 Formula E.
June
Mount Royal pilot project begins.
Plante announces that merchants affected by roadwork can receive compensation of up to $30,000 per year. This fulfils an election promise.
Organizers of the Formula E file a $33-million lawsuit against Plante and the city of Montreal for damages caused by the decision to cancel the event, saying the city had a binding legal agreement to host it for at least two more years.
Suspended Montreal police chief Philippe Pichet gives up his battle to get his job back but will remain employed as the force's chief inspector.
Plante announces Montreal will triple the number of housing inspections it completes within the next four years as part of its plan to tackle unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.
July
Plante does not take part in Canada Day festivities, despite having attended St-Jean-Baptiste activities in June and the St. Patrick's Day parade in March.
Quebec earmarks $15 million to study nine public transit projects in Montreal, including the Pink Line.
West Island motorists and mayors denounce a decision by Quebec and Montreal to not allow cars on a planned access route to the Kirkland station of the new RÃ©seau express mÃ©tropolitain electric light-rail line. Only buses and bikes will be allowed. A planned parking lot is also scrapped.

Plante announces a public consultation, to begin in September, about a future public space on McGill-College Ave. Plante says it's too early to say how much of the street will become a pedestrian walkway.

Full text: Our family has been discussing the report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and our grandparents reminded us of the rapid, huge industrial changes during the Second World War in order to defeat the Nazi war machine. The IPCC report and Paris accord make it clear that our generation is facing a threat to our planet greater than any in history. By the time we are 35, or sooner, unless we make sacrifices the way our grandparents did and reduce greenhouse gases, scientists from around the world tell us the climate crisis will have reached catastrophic levels.
What can we do? Nobel Prize winner William Nordhaus calls for carbon taxes worldwide. That is possible, in the same way that the world adopted the Montreal protocol to save humanity from a depleted ozone layer several decades ago. Similarly, we can drastically cut greenhouse emissions.
We know we can fight climate change because more than 2,000 people have visited our grandparents' off-grid house, where we've learned about the huge economic potential of solar, wind and sustainable buildings. Canada can be a leader in saving our world and future generations from the worst of the coming heat waves, floods and other catastrophes by developing fossil-fuel alternatives. If our leaders won't act, we young people can start a global tsunami of youth activism via the internet to rescue our future from them.

Protesters press Legault to act on climate change; Critics see lack of focus on environment during campaign as a warning sign

Full text: Hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Montreal and the Centre-Sud on Saturday, chanting and blowing horns to make noise about the state of the environment after an electoral campaign that was all but silent on climate change.
"There is no Planet B," they shouted, as they moved from one TV station to another in the hope of making the news.
"System change - not climate change," they wrote on placards.
"For the future of our children," they said, with their toddlers and teenagers in tow.
The non-partisan protest was the fourth in as many weeks under the banner of The Planet Goes to Parliament, calling on provincial and federal governments across the country to make climate change a top priority.
Having spawned and supported seven other protests across Quebec, from Cowansville to Saguenay, the organizers hope to expand across the country.
Recent elections in Ontario and Quebec, where Doug Ford and FranÃ§ois Legault both campaigned for premier's jobs with barely a mention of the environment, do not bode well, they said.
On Friday, Ford was in Calgary to attend an "anti-carbon tax" rally, siding with premier-hopeful Jason Kenney in urging Albertans to fight "the worst tax ever."
Legault, meanwhile, the premier-elect of Quebec, was elected along with the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec on promises to enlarge and extend certain highways and even build a third road link between the south and north shores of Quebec City.
"The CAQ's only argument was to say that by building more roads there will be less traffic congestion, so fewer greenhouse gas emissions," said Dominic VÃ©zina.
"They didn't even name any potential environment ministers on their list of possible ministers.
... When it comes to the environment, they're not serious."
Carrying a sign that showed the distances from Montreal to Vanuatu, Haiti, the Philippines and Honduras - all of which have born the brunt of extreme climate events - VÃ©zina said he thought Quebecers weren't as concerned as they should be because they haven't personally felt the effects of climate change. Yet.
Other protesters said we are already feeling the effect of climate change - even here.
About 90 people died in Quebec this summer in eight separate heat waves.
"After the summer we just had, we have to start asking questions," said JÃ©rÃ´me Boislard.
"Climate change is already happening."
Legault has to focus on public transit, not more roads, he said.
"I don't care who's in government, but I want to make sure the younger generations get to to live in a habitable world. Of all the political parties, the CAQ spoke the least about the environment. But Legault said he was going to govern for all Quebecers, so he shouldn't forget those who voted to protect the environment."
The protest came days before the United Nations'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest summary findings on Monday, warning that droughts, wildfires, coral-reef destruction and other climate and environmental disasters could grow worse as soon as 2040.
Evelyne Beaulieu, who was marching in Montreal with her two children, aged five and eight, hoisted a sign that read, "I love my planet."
Beaulieu said she worried about the environment not in two or three generations, but in her children's own lifetime.
"The CAQ hasn't said much at all about the environment - that's what makes me afraid," she said. "We have to keep protesting. Maybe they will see us, and something will change. But if we don't even try ..." csolyom@postmedia.com Twitter.com/csolyom

Full text: Hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Montreal and the Centre-Sud on Saturday, chanting and blowing horns to make noise about the state of the environment after an electoral campaign that was all but silent on climate change.
"There is no Planet B," they shouted, as they moved from one TV station to another in the hope of making the news.
"System change - not climate change," they wrote on placards.
"For the future of our children," they said, with their toddlers and teenagers in tow.
The non-partisan protest was the fourth in as many weeks under the banner of "The Planet Goes to Parliament," calling on provincial and federal governments across the country to make climate change a top priority.
Having spawned and supported seven other protests across the Quebec, from Cowansville to Saguenay, the organizers hope to expand across the country.
Recent elections in Ontario and Quebec, where Doug Ford and FranÃ§ois Legault both campaigned for premier with barely a mention of the environment, do not bode well, they said.
On Friday, Ford was in Calgary to attend an "anti-carbon tax" rally, siding with premier-hopeful Jason Kenney in urging Albertans to fight "the worst tax ever."
Legault, meanwhile, the premier-designate of Quebec, was elected along with the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec on promises to enlarge and extend certain highways and even build a third road link between the south and north shores of Quebec City.
"The CAQ's only argument was to say that by building more roads there will be less traffic congestion, so fewer greenhouse gas emissions," said Dominic VÃ©zina. "They didn't even name any potential environment ministers on their list of possible ministers. ... When it comes to the environment, they're not serious."
Carrying a sign that showed the distances from Montreal to Vanuatu, Haiti, Philippines and Honduras - all of which have born the brunt of extreme climate events - VÃ©zina said he thought Quebecers weren't as concerned as they should be because they haven't personally felt the effects of climate change. Yet.
Recent elections in Ontario and Quebec, where Doug Ford and FranÃ§ois Legault both campaigned for premier with barely a mention of the environment, do not bode well, protesters in Montreal said on Saturday, Oct. 6, 2018.
Other protesters said we are already feeling the effect of climate change - even here.
About 90 people died in Quebec this summer in eight separate heat waves.
"After the summer, we just had we have to start asking questions," said JÃ©rÃ´me Boislard. "Climate change is already happening."
Legault has to focus on public transit, not more roads, he said.
"I don't care who's in government, but I want to make sure the younger generations get to to live in a habitable world. Of all the political parties, the CAQ spoke the least about the environment. But Legault said he was going to govern for all Quebecers, so he shouldn't forget those who voted to protect the environment."
The protest comes only days before the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases its latest summary findings on Monday, after a week-long meeting in South Korea, in which it is expected to assess the current level of climate change, and the efforts necessary to avert catastrophic change.
It is expected to be bad news.
Evelyne Beaulieu, who was marching in Montreal with her two children, five- and eight-years old, hoisted a sign that read "I love my planet." Beaulieu said she worried about the environment not in two or three generations, but in her children's own lifetime.
"The CAQ hasn't said much at all about the environment - that's what makes me afraid," she said. "We have to keep protesting. Maybe they will see us, and something will change. But if we don't even try ..."

Quebec election: Climate change becomes focus of party rivals in Gatineau

Full text: GATINEAU - Two of the five worst rainstorms in 90 years, the worst floods on record and, on Friday evening, a tornado - this western Quebec town has seen all four in less than 18 months.
For Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin the cause is clear: climate change.
"Are we going to take this threat seriously? It's not a theory, it's people who are displaced, people who suffered, people who have lost everything," Pedneaud-Jobin said on Saturday. "In Gatineau, we've suffered a lot, we're continuing to suffer and one of the main sources of that, it's clear, is climate change."
Standing beside QuÃ©bec solidaire co-spokesperson Manon MassÃ© and FranÃ§ois Legault, the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec leader, it was the second time in a few hours the mayor had appeared alongside two rivals for the premiership of Quebec who had temporarily put aside their difference to show their support for the tornado-ravaged community.
"It's important for citizens that are going through very tough times to understand that all the leaders are together," Pedneaud-Jobin said said of the visits. "I think it's a show of solidarity and it does count when you're going through tough times. It's also an occasion to speak about real problems that will need real solutions in the future."
Earlier in the day, it was Parti QuÃ©becois Leader Jean-FranÃ§ois LisÃ©e and Philippe Couillard - who temporarily suspended his campaign to act more as premier than Liberal leader - who visited victims of the storm.
By 4:30 p.m., the mayor said, the majority of people who had been displaced by the tornado, and spent the night in a temporary shelter in a CEGEP, were in the process of returning to their homes. While many would be returning to broken windows and rooms still without electricity, the buildings were at least structurally sound, Pedneaud-Jobin said.
For those whose homes were damaged, it could take much longer, he said.
The area most affected by the storm is a poorer one, Pedneaud-Jobin added.
The next step, according to Legault, is to compensate victims.
"We're talking about many poor people and they may have lost all the assets that they've built in their life, so it's important that they know as fast as possible how much will they get back from the government," he said.
For MassÃ©, it has to go further than money - community support is needed for the victims, she said, many of whom are new arrivals and may have lost everything all over again.
"For me, it's very important to be here all together, to show solidarity, but also at the same time to acknowledge we have problems with climate change and we have to do something," she said.
Legault also talked about showing support for the community.
"It's not the time for politics," Legault said earlier in the day. "It's important that we're all united today behind the premier."
The CAQ leader said he also sees a connection between extreme weather and climate change.
"There have always been tornadoes, but it's obvious that now, because of climate change, there are more extreme events," Legault said.
However, one CAQ candidate, Ãric Girard told HuffPost QuÃ©bec( https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/09/17/changements-climatiques-eric-girard-caq_a_23530188/?ncid=other_trending_qeesnbnu0l8&utm_campaign=trending ) he isn't sure about the link between extreme weather events, including heat waves, and human-caused climate change. According to the article, which was published on Monday, Girard describes himself as a "climate skeptic."
"He said we cannot attribute one specific happening to this but, clearly, we see the numbers, it's clear that the climate change increased the kind of situation we see here today," Legault said.
For Legault, the largest contribution Quebec can play to fighting climate change is exporting hydro power - which will allow for the shutdown of coal and oil plants in other party of North America.
"There's no wall," he said. "We're all on the same planet."
But while Legault has called for more electricity exports from Quebec, he has opposed the Apuiat wind farm on Quebec's North Shore.
He said Quebec needs to sign more export agreements - and build transmission infrastructure - before it builds additional power-generation facilities, adding a dam can store energy in a way a wind farm can't.
Legault's climate plan has faced criticism from other parties.
"We have a credible plan to fight global warming. And the parties that don't are on the wrong side of history," LisÃ©e said.
Before heading to Gatineau, Legault met with the mayor of Laval and other mayors from Montreal's North Shore,
In Laval, Legault was scheduled to talk with local mayors about transportation - he wants to expand the RÃ©seau express mÃ©tropolitain train network in Laval and extend Highway 19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-liberals-expected-to-announce-highway-19-extension ). Legault has called for the expansion of other highways and the building of a third connection - a bridge or tunnel - between Quebec City and LÃ©vis.
MassÃ© said politicians can't talk about fighting climate change and expanding highways at the same time.
"It's clear that it's incompatible, except for questions of safety and I don't think that's the main reason Mr. Legault wants to extend highways," MassÃ© said.
She said her party's climate plan isn't about winning the provincial election, it's about saving the planet.

Thousands of runners to converge on downtown Montreal this weekend

Full text: For the first time since the city began hosting a marathon, downtown will serve as the start and finish line for 25,000 runners who are expected at the 28th edition of the Oasis International Marathon de MontrÃ©al this weekend.
The new venue for the two-day event, which features a half-marathon and 10-kilometre, five-kilometre and one-kilometre races along with the 42.2 kilometre distance, is part of what its new organizer calls a fresh direction aimed at bringing the races closer to spectators.
"We wanted to be more central to our public and to offer them another experience of Montreal," race director Dominique PichÃ© said.
PichÃ©, a former Montreal police officer, also serves as race director for the Ironman triathlons in Mont-Tremblant.
In June 2017, Ironman bought the Rock 'n' Roll marathon series of races in North America and Europe, which includes the Oasis International Marathon de MontrÃ©al, and appointed PichÃ© to produce the Montreal races.
In recent years, the marathon and half-marathon races started on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge, wended their way down to Parc Jean-Drapeau, then travelled up Place Jacques-Cartier into Old Montreal and ended in Parc La Fontaine in Plateau Mont-Royal, following a fear-inducing climb up Berri St. under Sherbrooke St. W. near the finish.
This year, the marathon and half-marathon will start at RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque Blvd. and St-Urbain St.( https://www.runrocknroll.com/fr/evenements/montreal/courses/parcours ) on Sunday, Sept. 23, at 7:30 a.m. Both routes head west along St-Patrick St. to Monk Blvd. before returning downtown through Griffintown. Both races finish at Quartier des spectacles on Ste-Catherine St. W. at St-Urbain.
And both groups of runners will get to sweat their way up Robert-Bourassa Blvd., though the marathon route also travels up Berri St. to venture east to Parc Maisonneuve before returning downtown.
While changing the course routes and moving the event site downtown were big undertakings, PichÃ© said he also worked to raise prize money to bring elite runners back to the marathon after an eight-year absence.
"For me, Montreal is an Olympic town and when we have such a marathon as we do, elites are part of our DNA," he said. PichÃ©, who was born in Hull, said he has an attachment to the Montreal race since it was his first marathon in 1996.
But there's one notable absence this year - there's no free public transit being offered to race participants. The race fee used to include return transit fare, which runners could pick up with their race bibs ahead of race day.
The race organizer paid for the transit tickets.
However, Philippe DÃ©ry, a spokesperson for the SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al, said the transit agency isn't a partner of the event this year and said it was the race organizer's decision to not offer free transit.
The STM will add staff for the event, he said, but the agency is suggesting that runners buy their transit tickets in advance rather than on race day to avoid long lineups. DÃ©ry also said the STM warned the race organizer.
PichÃ© offered a mea culpa and said he "profoundly hopes" to bring back free transit passes next year.
It was a combination of factors, PichÃ© said, including last year's decision to cancel the marathon due to a heat wave, which entailed reimbursing 5,000 participants while trying to plan the changes for this year.
"I called it the perfect storm," he said. There was also time pressure to select entertainment befitting the Quartier des spectacles and to find an alternative to distributing plastic water bottles to runners.
"I'm still very behind the (free public transit) because I believe that we all have a responsibility to make sure that public transit is utilized more," PichÃ© said. "I'm working hard to give Montreal a marathon they're proud of."

For Off-Islanders, time to prep for fireplace season

Full text: Despite the unexpected latesummer heat wave we've enjoyed this past week, the first vivid patches of red and orange are beginning to appear, and there's a new little chill in the early morning air hinting at the cooler autumn days to come.
Although I'll miss summer days lounging by the pool and hanging out on sunny terrasses, I'm looking forward to chilly nights cozied up by the fireplace, playing games, reading books, strumming my guitar, visiting with friends or just staring into the flames.
My neighbours and I will soon be preparing for fireplace season: splitting and stacking cords of wood, sweeping chimneys free of creosote, and clearing out old ashes.
When you live Off-Island, a wood-burning fireplace or stove isn't just a luxury. For those of us without backup generators, having a fireplace and a good stash of well-seasoned wood is a practical hedge against freezing during our all-too-frequent winter power failures.
In the few short years we've lived here, I've lost count of the winter nights we've spent bundled up in darkness, playing board games by the fire while we waited for the lights to come back on. Thanks to the fireplace, those chilly days without power have been some of the best. Now, when the power flickers, the kids get excited to roll out sleeping bags by the fireplace and break out the Yahtzee and Monopoly.
For many Montrealers, however, snuggling up by an old-fashioned wood-burning fireplace will soon be a thing of the past. As of Oct. 1, a new City of Montreal bylaw goes into effect that will ban the use of wood-burning appliances that don't meet strict emissions standards. Those who ignore the ban could face fines ranging from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars for repeat offenders. For now, however, the ban only applies to the city's 19 boroughs, not demerged municipalities or Off-Island.
Perhaps one day the fireplace ban will spread to the rest of the West Island and across the bridge. The environmental argument against wood-burning fireplaces is hard to refute. In Montreal, it's estimated that 60 per cent of winter smog is due to burning wood. According to the Quebec Environment Ministry, wood smoke is a health hazard, both inside and outside the home.
But foolishly, and a little selfishly, I'm glad I can still look forward to lighting mine up this fall. We humans are not always logical creatures. It may be bad for me, but I can't resist the appeal of a crackling fire. I want to enjoy it as long as I can.

Full text: For the first time since the city began hosting a marathon 28 years ago, downtown will serve as the start and finish line for 25,000 runners who are expected at the Oasis International Marathon de MontrÃ©al this weekend.
The new venue for the two-day event, which features a half-marathon and 10-kilometre, five-kilometre and one-kilometre races along with the 42.2-kilometre distance, is part of what its new organizer calls a fresh direction aimed at bringing the races closer to spectators.
"We wanted to be more central to our public and to offer them another experience of Montreal," race director Dominique PichÃ© said.
PichÃ©, a former Montreal police officer, also serves as race director for the Ironman triathlons in Mont-Tremblant.
In June 2017, Ironman bought the Rock 'n'Roll marathon series of races in North America and Europe, which includes the Oasis International Marathon de MontrÃ©al, and appointed PichÃ© to produce the Montreal races.
In recent years, the marathon and half-marathon races started on the Jacques Cartier Bridge, wended their way down to Parc Jean-Drapeau, then travelled up Place Jacques-Cartier into Old Montreal and ended in Parc La Fontaine in Plateau Mont-Royal, following a fear-inducing climb up Berri St. under Sherbrooke St. W. near the finish.
This year, the marathon and half-marathon will start at RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque Blvd. and St-Urbain St. on Sunday at 7:30 a.m. Both routes head west along St-Patrick St. to Monk Blvd. before returning downtown through Griffintown. Both races finish at Quartier des spectacles on Ste-Catherine St. W. at St-Urbain.
And both groups of runners will get to sweat their way up Robert-Bourassa Blvd., though the marathon route also travels up Berri St. to venture east to Parc Maisonneuve before returning downtown.
While changing the course routes and moving the event site downtown were big undertakings, PichÃ© said he also worked to raise prize money to bring elite runners back to the marathon after an eight-year absence.

Quebec election: Rally to call for greater focus on the environment

Full text: Almost 1,000 people are expected to take to the streets Saturday afternoon in Montreal to press political leaders to put the environment at the centre of their electoral platforms, and develop carbon reduction strategies - now.
Under the heading "The Planet Joins the Campaign,"( https://www.facebook.com/events/264044397570388/ ) demonstrators will meet at the Montreal Science Centre at the Old Port at 2 p.m. and make their way to Mont Royal Park at the corner of Duluth and Parc Avenues.
Citing ever more alarming statistics about the local effects of climate change - eight heat waves this summer, responsible for causing 90 deaths in Quebec - organizers want the political parties to "finally acknowledge that the climate is the foremost challenge of our time" and to commit to establishing a carbon budget that would allow Quebec to reach its own emissions reduction targets: 20% below the 1990 level by 2020, and 37.5% by 2030.
Speakers expected to take the microphone at the demonstration include former QuÃ©bec Solidaire leader FranÃ§oise David, Charles Ste-Marie, of the Conseil central du MontrÃ©al mÃ©tropolitain, and Laure Waridel, a co-founder of Ãquiterre.
"We ask that the political parties present a coherent environmental program, because now more than ever, our planet needs coherence," organizers wrote.

Quebec election: Public transit at core of QS economic transition plan

Full text: A Quebec solidaire government would invest massively in public transit infrastructure and offer rebates to encourage a progressive transition to electric vehicles, gradually building to a ban on gas-powered vehicles on Quebec roads by 2050.
QS spokesperson Manon Masse said her party would inject a total of $13.3 billion into public transit over the next four years, a move the party claims would not only stimulate the economy and create jobs, it would allow Quebec to meet its ambitious climate change targets.
"Climate change is the biggest challenge of the 21st century," said party spokesperson Manon MassÃ© at a news conference in Parc Lafontaine. "Our great-great-grandchildren will blame us if we don't act now, and they will thank us if we do. At QuÃ©bec solidaire, we want to be on the right side of history."
The party has already announced that if elected, it would cut public transit fares in half. MassÃ© said QS would also invest $7.6 billion in new money into public transit infrastructure across the province (for a total of $13.3 billion), bring in radical rebate programs to encourage transition to electric vehicles and stop licensing gas-powered private vehicles by 2050.
The $13.3 billion in public transit investments by 2022 is a key element of an economic transition plan that MassÃ© claims will create more than 300,000 jobs across Quebec. Those jobs would not only stimulate the economy, she said, the plan would allow Quebec to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 95 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050.
"It's not even 11 a.m. and it's already 31 degrees," she said Tuesday. "These heat waves we've been experiencing this summer are only the trailer for the film that's coming. ... With our transition plan, Quebec will become a world leader in the fight against climate change. Our plan will also create the biggest work site across Quebec since the Quiet Revolution."
Dismissing criticism that the plan to half transit fares and invest billions more into infrastructure is not financially viable, MassÃ© said the money would be borrowed from banks, as any government does when financing capital investments. A QS government would halt all investment in new road projects, except those necessary to improve public safety, she said.
"The debt to gross domestic product ratio is around 49.3 per cent. At the end of a QS mandate it would be around 49.5 per cent," MassÃ© said. "When I say we will create 300,000 jobs by 2030, I am stimulating the economy, injecting money into all the regions of Quebec, and stimulating the GDP, so we keep that ratio low."
To encourage the purchase of hybrid or electric cars, a QS government would offer different levels of rebates to Quebecers depending on their situation. Those with low incomes, with children, and those living in areas with poor public transit service will qualify for higher rebates.
QS would also revive a former program called Faites de l'air that offered incentives to encourage owners of older, polluting vehicles to take them off the road.

"When I say we will create 300,000 jobs by 2030, I am stimulating the economy, injecting money into all the regions of Quebec, and stimulating the GDP, so we keep that ratio low."
To encourage the purchase of hybrid or electric cars, a QS government would offer different levels of rebates to Quebecers depending on their situation. Those with low incomes, with children, and those living in areas with no public transit will qualify for higher rebates.
QS would also revive a former program called Faites de l'air that offered incentives to encourage owners of older, polluting vehicles to take them off the road.
More to come.

Full text: A Quebec solidaire government would invest $13.3 billion into public transit over the next four years, a move the party claims would not only stimulate the economy and create jobs, it would allow Quebec to meet its ambitious climate change targets.
"Climate change is the biggest challenge of the 21st century," said party spokesperson Manon MassÃ© at a news conference in Parc Lafontaine. "Our great-great-grandchildren will blame us if we don't act now, and they will thank us if we do. At QuÃ©bec solidaire, we want to be on the right side of history."
A QuÃ©bec solidaire government would cut public transit fares in half, invest $7.6 billion in new money into public transit infrastructure across the province (for a total of 13.3 billion), bring in radical rebate programs to encourage transition to electric vehicles and stop licensing gas-powered private vehicles by 2050.
Investing $13.3 billion in public transit by 2022 is a key element of an economic transition plan that MassÃ© claims will create more than 300,000 jobs across Quebec. The public transit plan will not only stimulate the economy, she said, it will allow Quebec to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 95 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050.
"It's not even 11 a.m. and it's already 31 degrees. These heat waves we've been experiencing this summer are only the trailer for the film that's coming. ... With our transition plan, Quebec will become a world leader in the fight against climate change. Our plan will also create the biggest work site across Quebec since the Quiet Revolution."
Dismissing criticism that the plan to half transit fares and invest billions more than the Liberals already plan to invest in transit projects is not financially viable, MassÃ© said the money would be borrowed from banks, as any government does when financing capital investments. A QS government would halt all investment in new road projects, except those necessary to improve public safety, she said.
"The debt to gross domestic product ratio is around 49.3 per cent. At the end of a QS mandate it would be around 49.5 per cent," MassÃ© said. "When I say we will create 300,000 jobs by 2030, I am stimulating the economy, injecting money into all the regions of Quebec, and stimulating the GDP, so we keep that ratio low."
To encourage the purchase of hybrid or electric cars, a QS government would offer different levels of rebates to Quebecers depending on their situation. Those with low incomes, with children, and those living in areas with no public transit will qualify for higher rebates.
QS would also revive a former program called Faites de l'air that offered incentives to encourage owners of older, polluting vehicles to take them off the road.
"The other parties claim, with a straight face, that building more highways will solve the congestion problems in Montreal and Quebec City," said Ruba Ghazal, QS's spokesperson for environment and candidate in Mercier riding.
By offering to expand highways and byways across the province, the other parties are following the old election strategy of Maurice Duplessis era, she said.
"The experts know that the more asphalt you pour, the more congestion you get, but these parties continue to think that the more asphalt you pour, the more votes you get," Ghazal said.
More to come.

The air apparent; Pollution threatens the world's health, write Craig and Marc Kielburger

Full text: Stepping off a plane in Delhi a while back, Craig noticed a billboard in the distance. Your whitest whites, it promised, advertising a new brand of laundry detergent. The once-white button-down in the photo had yellowed - so had the teeth of the Bollywood actor wearing it. Both were stained with soot.
We thought of this when, for a few days this June, air pollution in Delhi was too high to measure. The dense, acrid smog choking India's capital was literally off the charts.
Dirty air surrounds 90 per cent of the world's population, and as many as nine million die each year from pollution-related illnesses - including 8,000 Canadians. It wasn't long ago that parents sent their kids outside for fresh air. Now smog warnings are as much a part of summer in Canadian cities as heat waves.
While the Great White North breathes easier than most countries - Canada ranks third in air quality, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) - many cities, including Winnipeg, Windsor, Ont., and Montreal come dangerously close to the recommended limit. Some, like Sarnia, Ont., and Chatham, Ont., exceed it. Inhaling pollutant particles can lead to everything from asthma, lung disease and cancer to mental health conditions, diabetes and dementia. Air pollution adds $36 billion to Canada's health-care spending annually.
Global levels of air pollution rose eight per cent between 2011 and 2016 - and though scientists practically shouted this from rooftops, few of us change our behaviour.
Air is invisible, making its contamination easier to ignore. So how do we gain perspective on what the WHO calls the world's single largest environmental risk? Earlier this year, at an art installation outside London's Somerset House, visitors walked through geodesic domes filled with air climactically controlled to replicate the atmosphere of polluted environments. They tasted the sour ethanol of SÃ£o Paulo, the bitter scent of industry in Beijing and stale smell of old cars in Delhi.
The final dome came as a respite - the pristine, almost sweet-smelling air of Norway's Tautra Island. With one last inhale, visitors were back on London streets, inhaling diesel fumes. Many took notice of London's poor air quality for the first time, inevitably leading to conversations about the city's pollution.
Experiences like this affect people in ways that facts and figures rarely do. To move the needle, we need creative ways to make this invisible issue come alive for Canadians, including young people, who are more vulnerable to respiratory illness and the effects of air pollution.
In lieu of a ticket to Delhi, a kid-friendly science project will spark conversation. Take a piece of white plastic (a cut-up milk carton will do), smear petroleum jelly over top and attach it to a pole or a fence. In a few days, particles of soot and exhaust will be stuck to your DIY pollution catcher. Kids are not the ones idling in driveways or culling rainforests, but they will inherit our dirty air and its consequences. Helping them see the issue from a young age is a first step.
This summer, as the mercury rises and we escape to easy breathing at the lake, reminding ourselves of the urban haze is the least we can do. Craig and Marc Kielburger are the co-founders of the WE movement, which includes WE Charity, ME to WE Social Enterprise and WE Day. For more dispatches from WE, check out WE Stories.

Allison Hanes: Time to pay attention to the real election campaign

Full text: Like many Quebecers, I'm preoccupied this week trying to get the kids into the routine of a brand-new school year and facing up to the fact that, despite the latest heat wave, summer is really over.
There's so much going on at home that, for the average person, it could easily escape notice that there's an election campaign in full swing - except for all those signs on lampposts and lawns, of course.
But then again, it's hard to tell the difference between the official campaign and the perma-campaign these days, anyway. With the Oct. 1 election - Quebec's first vote held on a fixed date since being enshrined in law - party leaders have been jockeying for position for months, making promises, unveiling star candidates, revealing platform planks and glad-handing at public events. But has the public been paying much attention?
The actual campaign, with the telltale signage and the leaders' buses criss-crossing Quebec, got underway last week while some Quebecers were still on vacation and many others were still in vacation mode. Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard exercised his discretion as premier to kick things off a little earlier than expected, pulling the trigger on a 39-day run-up to Quebecers casting their ballots. But even before that the parties were in pre-campaign mode, hitting the summer barbecue circuit. Between the policy conventions and the press conferences, there has barely been a moment they weren't campaigning.
With fixed-date elections, the mystery is taken out of when it will be called, which levels the playing field; but some of the excitement is also missing. It's like clicking on the television and joining a program mid-stream.
And with voting day on the municipal, provincial and federal scenes set for the fall every four years now, Quebecers may also be forgiven for feeling a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu. This time last year, the prelude to the municipal election was well underway. The official campaign period didn't start until September and voting day was in early November, but ValÃ©rie Plante - then the underdog Projet MontrÃ©al candidate, now Montreal's mayor - got a long, running start. Policy announcements were drawn out over a marathon summer, even if many voters only made up their minds in the final sprint.
This time next year, we will surely find ourselves in similar circumstances. A fixed-date federal vote is set for Oct. 21, 2019, but the lead-up will almost certainly begin before the leaves start falling from the trees. That will make it three years in a row contenders for public office took to the hustings when many Quebecers were on vacation. (Maybe one level of government could have opted for a spring vote, just to keep things interesting and make their appeals when the electorate tends to be more plugged in?)
Because as much as Quebecers may be tuned out at this particular moment, what is happening is important. This democratic exercise may be less of an existential crisis than elections past, with a bid for sovereignty off the table (in the short term, at least). But with the economy thriving and public finances in top shape, what is at stake are the bread-and-butter programs and services that affect our daily lives.
Do we want free dental care( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-free-dental-care-for-children-up-to-16-and-seniors-liberals-pledge ) for teens and seniors, as the Liberals are promising, or free education( https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1120154/frais-scolarite-universite-cegep-education-cpe-qs-manon-masse-gabriel-nadeau-dubois ) from the pouponiÃ¨re to a PhD as proposed by QuÃ©bec solidaire? Do we want the Tinder-like carpooling app( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-pq-says-it-would-develop-tinder-app-for-carpooling ) put forth by the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, or bigger baby bonuses for large families( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-campaigns-in-townships ) pitched by the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec? The Liberals are dangling free daycare for 4-year-olds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-liberals-pledge-free-daycare-for-4-year-olds ), while the CAQ is promoting universal pre-kindergarten( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-caq-promises-free-pre-kindergarten-for-four-year-olds ) to free up child-care places for younger kids. It's up to us to choose.
And it's also up to us to decide what kind of society we want to be. Are we one that welcomes immigrants and relishes diversity? Or are we going to tell people what they can and cannot wear to be fully contributing members?
Democracy may be the worst system, as Sir Winston Churchill once said, save for all the others. In other words, for all the cynicism that sometimes surrounds the electoral process and the partisan bickering of our representatives, we should cherish and preserve our right to choose our own government. It must not be taken for granted - especially as it comes under attack from its enemies around the globe.
So no matter how distracted we are with our daily lives, we owe it to ourselves to sit up and pay attention. At least for the next few weeks.

The official campaign period didn't start until September and voting day was in early November, but ValÃ©rie Plante - then the underdog Projet MontrÃ©al candidate, now Montreal's mayor - got a long, running start. Policy announcements were drawn out over a marathon summer, even if many voters only made up their minds in the final sprint.
This time next year, we will surely find ourselves in similar circumstances. A fixed-date federal vote is set for Oct. 21, 2019, but the lead-up will almost certainly begin before the leaves start falling from the trees. That will make it three years in a row contenders for public office took to the hustings when many Quebecers were on vacation. (Maybe one level of government could have opted for a spring vote, just to keep things interesting and make their appeals when the electorate tends to be more plugged in?)
Because as much as Quebecers may be tuned out at this particular moment, what is happening is important. This democratic exercise may be less of an existential crisis than elections past, with a bid for sovereignty off the table (in the short term, at least). But with the economy thriving and public finances in top shape, what is at stake are the bread-and-butter programs and services that affect our daily lives.
Do we want free dental care( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-free-dental-care-for-children-up-to-16-and-seniors-liberals-pledge ) for teens and seniors, as the Liberals are promising, or free education( https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1120154/frais-scolarite-universite-cegep-education-cpe-qs-manon-masse-gabriel-nadeau-dubois ) from the pouponiÃ¨re to a PhD as proposed by QuÃ©bec solidaire? Do we want the Tinder-like carpooling app( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-pq-says-it-would-develop-tinder-app-for-carpooling ) put forth by the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, or bigger baby bonuses for large families( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/legault-campaigns-in-townships ) pitched by the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec? The Liberals are dangling free daycare for 4-year-olds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-liberals-pledge-free-daycare-for-4-year-olds ), while the CAQ is promoting universal pre-kindergarten( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-caq-promises-free-pre-kindergarten-for-four-year-olds ) to free up child-care places for younger kids. It's up to us to choose.
And it's also up to us to decide what kind of society we want to be. Are we one that welcomes immigrants and relishes diversity? Or are we going to tell people what they can and cannot wear to be fully contributing members?
Democracy may be the worst system, as Sir Winston Churchill once said, save for all the others. In other words, for all the cynicism that sometimes surrounds the electoral process and the partisan bickering of our representatives, we should cherish and preserve our right to choose our own government. It must not be taken for granted - especially as it comes under attack from its enemies around the globe.
So no matter how distracted we are with our daily lives, we owe it to ourselves to sit up and pay attention. At least for the next few weeks.

Full text: PART FOUR OF A FOUR-PART SERIES
For Frederick Law Olmsted, getting there was half the fun.
That's clear from his writings and from the gently sloping, meandering 6.6-kilometre pedestrian and bike road on Mount Royal that bears the landscape architect's name.
The mountain's grandest views are "greater when they are made distinct spectacles or when they are enjoyed as successive incidents of a sustained poem, to each of which the mind is gradually and sweetly led up," the designer of Mount Royal Park wrote in 1881( https://books.google.ca/books?id=nbQNAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PA78&dq=olmsted%20brackenfell&pg=PP11#v=onepage&q&f=false ), five years after the 200-hectare oasis opened.
Olmsted wanted to "reinforce the spirit of the mountain," says Jean-Michel Villanove, head of public programming at Les Amis de la montagne.
"It's a little hill - he wanted its mountainous spirit to come out. For that, he created a long road that allowed people to immerse themselves in different areas, different ambiences.
"He wanted visitors to take their time and discover the mountain on their way up so they could feel the therapeutic effects of nature and enjoy the beauty of the landscapes."
Mount Royal's busiest path begins at Sir George-Ãtienne-Cartier monument on Park Ave., a landmark gathering place in the city.
***
Our walk starts at the Sir George-Ãtienne-Cartier monument on Park Ave( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5148725,-73.5861139,15.95z )., near Duluth Ave. (Look for signs indicating you're on Chemin Olmsted, heading in the direction of Beaver Lake/Mount Royal Chalet.)
The road, which covers the breadth of the mountain's southern flank, starts at an open gathering place (site of the Sunday Tam-tams) and then runs parallel to busy Park Ave. as you head in the direction of Mont-Royal Ave. But you'll soon be immersed in nature.
You feel the presence of the mountain as the forest gradually becomes more dense and then you're walking along the bottom of a steep escarpment, an area Olmsted referred to as "the Crags."
This part of the road is nice and wide (enough to fit two lanes of car traffic if it was allowed here) and the trees that line it provide a welcome canopy on hot summer days.
You feel the presence of the mountain as the forest grows thicker and you walk along the bottom of a steep escarpment, an area Olmsted referred to as "the Crags."
About two kilometres from the start, you'll reach the steep staircase( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5049603,-73.5847895,2a,75y,196.84h,96.4t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sDOWU0zqBd-ddd4AqFpFD-Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i36?hl=en ) (near the Peel St. entrance to the mountain) that reaches the chalet and adjacent Kondiaronk Lookout.
It's one of the shortcuts you can take if you don't want to walk the entirety of Olmsted Rd. If Olmsted is too long for you, along the way secondary trails perpendicular to the road also act as bypasses.
Many benches provide respites along Olmsted, Mount Royal's busiest path.
On a recent visit in mid-July, I was joined by countless ramblers, runners, women pushing strollers, plus one sweaty shirtless man on roller skis. Plenty of cyclists were also here as this is one of the few Mount Royal pathways where bikes are officially allowed.
If you stick to Olmsted Rd. past the stairs, you'll come upon a vestige of the days when calÃ¨ches plied the road( https://archivesdemontreal.ica-atom.org/parc-du-mont-royal-caleche-train-belvedere-chalet-1964 ), known at the time as Chemin des CalÃ¨ches/Carriage Drive. It's a water trough( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5020412,-73.5870638,2a,15.2y,294.76h,83.51t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sxOPALehthMDEw7K9WiSMyA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i36?hl=en ) - a feature now used by horses in the Montreal police cavalry unit, which has stables near Smith House.
This road was made wide, sinuous and with a gentle slope( http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/scripts/large.php?Lang=2&accessnumber=II-89328.1&idImage=148906 ) in part to make it easier for the horse-drawn carriages( http://www.mccnew.mcgill.ca/scripts/large.php?Lang=1&accessnumber=M2011.64.2.305&idImage=325065 ).
A water trough is a vestige of the days when calÃ¨ches made their way along Olmsted Rd. It is now used by horses in the Montreal police cavalry unit. Its stables are located near Smith House.
For the next kilometre or so, you're in a densely forested area.
Soon, there will be a break from the forest, a restorative stopover before you continue toward the summit.
Coming around a bend, you'll catch a glimpse of soothing water. You've reached Beaver Lake and the large, inviting clearing before it, a grassy area dotted with trees whose shade creates popular summer picnic spots.
If you didn't pack a meal, you can buy food and drinks at the restaurant on Beaver Lake or the smaller cafÃ© at Smith House welcome centre further down Olmsted Rd.
***
Don't miss the chance to get up close to the 30-metre-high steel cross installed to commemorate the wooden cross planted in 1643 by Montreal co-founder Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve.
After Smith House, you'll reach a 2.2-kilometre section of Olmsted Rd. that's referred to as the "Boucle du Sommet" on signs and maps.
The ring road, whose focal point is the chalet, encircles the top of the mountain and is not as shady as the first section. I made the mistake of walking it in the mid-day sun during a heat wave. You have been warned.
Despite the challenging conditions, I pressed on, getting close-up views of two mountain structures that Montrealers normally only see from kilometres away.
First, the unsightly red-and-white, multi-pronged broadcasting antenna( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5022606,-73.5873829,197a,35y,310.01h,78.88t/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) that soars 112 metres in the air and transmits signals for about 20 local radio and TV stations.
Second: the iconic 30-metre-high steel cross( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5087897,-73.5855868,164a,35y,269.82h,75.91t/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ), installed to commemorate the wooden cross planted in 1643 by Montreal co-founder Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve to thank God for saving the colony from floods.
Benches provide respites along Mount Royal's busiest path.
Be sure to also visit Mount Royal's unheralded peak (233 metres), though alas there is no view here.
You have to know where you're going as there is no sign or explanatory panel.
From the main path, you'll see a second antenna( https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5083167,-73.5874453,137a,35y,267.35h,55.8t/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) - this one white and shorter than the broadcasting one - at the end of a secondary path.
A city of Montreal communications antenna used by emergency services, it's in an unmarked clearing atop a shabby mound covered with patchy grass, weeds and dirt.
This is the mountain's topmost point.
It's a far cry from what Olmsted proposed for this location, an area he described as the "crown of the mountain."
From the main path, a second antenna can be seen - this one white and shorter than the broadcasting one. This is the mountain's topmost point.
Olmsted wanted this spot to be the end point of a walk to the summit, suggesting a restaurant be built here, as well as an elevated platform from which mountain-goers could take in a 360-degree view of the city, according to Charles E. Beveridge, a historian who has written extensively about Olmsted.
Designed to resemble an old French farmhouse, "the most distinctive feature of the (proposed) structure was the viewing tower that Olmsted envisaged, rising high enough to provide a panoramic view and appearing to the surrounding countryside like an actual crowning form, sheathed in tin or - preferably - gilded copper," Beveridge wrote in a 2009 study of Olmsted's Mount Royal plan( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/BUREAU_MTROYAL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/OLMSTED-VISION-MONT%20ROYAL-AVRIL2009-VERSION%20ANGLAISE-FINAL.PDF ).
That vision never became a reality.
The last stop before you head back is a small lookout on Olmsted Rd. near the communications antenna, offering a sweeping view that includes Mount Royal's two other summits: Outremont (211 metres) and Westmount (201 metres).
Like many of the mountain's secondary lookouts, the view is partially obstructed, with trees in need of a trim.
After more than two hours of wandering the mountain, I wasn't about to retrace my steps.
So after leaving Olmsted Rd., I made my way to Camillien-Houde Way and was whisked away by an air-conditioned 711 Parc-du-Mont-Royal/Oratoire bus.( http://beta.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/return-711-bus-line ) A summer-only bus route, it will take you from the top of the mountain to the bowels of Montreal, with stops at the Snowdon and Mont-Royal mÃ©tro stations.
On any given day, the pathway is busy with ramblers, runners, women pushing strollers, even lovers walking hand in hand. Cyclists are also plentiful, for here bikes are officially allowed.

Walking tours offer guidance - and some are free
If you would rather take a guided tour of Mount Royal, turn to Les amis de la montagne.
The non-profit group, which has been working to conserve and promote Mount Royal for more than 30 years, offers several discovery walks. Here are a few of them:
Every Wednesday at 6 p.m. until Oct. 30, a guide takes visitors on a free hour-long walk starting at Smith House. Visit the Kondiaronk Lookout near the chalet, the Escarpment Path and the Camillien-Houde Lookout. In French.
Twice monthly on Saturday afternoons in August (4, 25), September (8, 15) and October (6, 27), a free 90-minute tour begins at the Sir George-Ãtienne Cartier Monument at street level and ends at Smith House, near the chalet. In French.
For the From One Summit to Another walk, a guide takes visitors from the Kondiaronk Lookout to the observatory atop Place Ville Marie. It will be offered Aug. 19, Sept. 16 and Oct. 28. In English or French. Cost: $28 per person. Online reservation required.
If you're up for a 14-kilometre, seven-hour trek, Les amis offers a tour that includes all three Mount Royal summits. The walk will be offered on Sept. 23 and Oct. 14. In French. Cost: $26 per person. Online registration required.
Offered for the first time this year, a Les amis walk focuses on "the historical bonds between MontrÃ©al's Scottish culture and the mountain." It starts at Smith House near the Kondiaronk Lookout and ends at the McCord Museum. It will be offered on Sept. 20 and Oct. 11. In English or French. Cost: $14 per person. Online registration required.

PART 4 OF 4 INTRODUCTION
Mount Royal is more than Beaver Lake, the chalet lookout and the Camillien-Houde belvedere. And it's best enjoyed on foot.
So I set off to hike the mountain, walking four distinct routes through lush forests, along steep escarpments and to quiet corners so far from Montreal traffic, noise and crowds I could have been in the backwoods.
Along the way, I took in impressive vistas from some of Montreal's highest points, and learned about the millenniums-long history of human use of Montreal's three-peaked crown jewel. Some unexpected vestiges of bygone eras were discovered along the way.
The walks, with a mix of lengths and difficulty levels, will take you to the summits in Montreal, Outremont and Westmount and along the eastern, western, northern and southern flanks.
Interactive maps are available for each walk on the Montreal Gazette website. The city of Montreal gives away detailed paper maps of Mount Royal's trails and attractions; the map is available on the mountain at Beaver Lake, Smith House and the chalet at the Kondiaronk Lookout.
IF YOU GO
Difficulty level: Easy but long
Starts: Sir George-Ãtienne-Cartier monument on Park Ave.
Ends: Mount Royal Chalet
Distance: 6.6 kilometres
Estimated time: 2.5 hours
Accessibility: Gentle slopes make this ideal for people pushing strollers.

Full text: Step on the pedals of the new Bixi electric bike and it sets off with a pleasant surge, like someone has given it a mini adrenalin shot. Since regular Bixis lumber in an amiable kind of way at the best of times, and the electric version, at 66 pounds, is considerably heavier than its 50-pound manual counterpart, the smooth boost comes as a welcome surprise.
You have to pedal to make the electric motor kick in (it's called "electric pedal assist") so there's no sitting there with your feet up in the air as the bike whisks you along. But it's summertime and the pedalling is easy, as the motor takes the brunt of the pushing power. It feels like riding a conventional Bixi, but with less effort. Takeoffs are a breeze, and going uphill is far easier, although as I found out, on very steep routes there is still some work involved.
The Montreal Gazette test drove the new e-Bixi on Wednesday morning, the first day that the city's popular bike-sharing service introduced 20 electric bikes to its 6,500-bicycle fleet as part of a three-month pilot project to road-test them and get feedback. More may be added by November. Bixi made the move in response to requests from their regular users, and to keep pace with a trend in electric bike-sharing services that is increasingly popular worldwide, said spokesperson Audrey Messier-Morissette.
Bright blue and with a slightly wider frame to accommodate its electric motor, the bikes are made by Quebec firm Cycles Devinci and being loaned out by PBSC Solutions Urbaines. They have a top speed of 25 kilometres an hour and a range of about 60 kilometres. Since the solar-powered Bixi docking stations don't have sufficient energy to charge the bikes, Bixi will monitor their energy levels and recharge them as needed. There are also tests being conducted in St-Laurent, where bikes will be parked in electrified docks that can charge the bikes in four hours.
Bixi officials have noted in the past that 70 per cent of customers use their bikes for downhill rides. I assume the electric bikes are designed in part to coax them into commuting uphill as well.
I find my bike at a docking station on de Maisonneuve Blvd. downtown near the Bay (the e-bike locations are indicated on the Bixi app with a lightning-bolt symbol). There are a handful available in the downtown core Wednesday morning. I rent one for the usual Bixi rate of $5 a day. Other than the electric boost, it feels much like riding a regular Bixi. The electric ones require users to wear a helmet to conform to Quebec Highway Safety Code rules, and to be at least 18 years old (or between 14 and 17, if you have a scooter or moped licence). I take mine down into Griffintown, pedalling lightly the whole way, enjoying the added push when I ascend slight hills. Disc brakes in the front and back provide excellent control. Since the motor does much of the work, there are no gears.
"You have to try this thing," I tell Gazette photographer Allen McInnis when we meet for the photo shoot. He does, likes it, but wonders how it might handle when people do slow U-turns. I find it handles fine. Using it is intuitive and easy. Contrary to the fears of some, there is no sitting back and laughing maniacally as the bicycle zooms haphazardly down crowded bike paths. The 25 km/h limit puts a quick brake on any zooming.
I take the bike back up Peel St. toward downtown, and find I have to pedal with a bit of force to ascend, but nowhere near what it normally takes. To give the motor a real test, I ride up steep University St. next to the McGill University campus. Again, it requires some extra pedal power, and I am perspiring lightly by the time I get to Pine Ave. Pedalling a manual bike in our current heat wave conditions, however, I would have been soaked. To go up the even steeper stretch leading to the McGill University residences next to the old Royal Victoria Hospital, I have to stand on the pedals to coax the bike up.
My Bixi ride history tells me I rode for one hour (with stops for chit-chat and photos), covered 14.7 kilometres and burned 393 calories, but I suspect the app didn't take the electric motor into account for the calorie count. Despite the humid 24 C, I'm dry. And in a good mood. The e-bike elicits a lot of looks, and I get a taste of what it's like to drive a Ferrari. An ecologically friendly, very cheap Ferrari.
The only drawback? Getting back on my regular, rusty commuter bicycle and having to do all the work myself. Turns out the guilt over using electric assistance is very short-lived. rbruemmer@postmedia.com twitter.com/renebruemmer

Full text: Step on the pedals of the new Bixi electric bike( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bixi-to-go-electric-in-august-with-two-pilot-projects ) and it sets off with a pleasant surge, like someone's given it a mini-adrenaline shot. Since regular Bixis are lumbering in an amiable kind of way at the best of times, and the electric versions are considerably heavier than their manual counterparts, the smooth boost comes as a very nice surprise.
You have to pedal to make the electric motor kick in (it's called "electric pedal assist") so there's no sitting there with your feet up in the air as the bike whisks you along. But it's summertime and the pedalling is easy, as the motor takes the brunt of the pushing power, so it feels much like riding a conventional Bixi, but with less effort. Takeoffs are a breeze, and going uphill is far easier, although, as I found out, if you take a very steep route, there is still some work involved.
The Montreal Gazette test drove the new e-Bixi on Wednesday morning, the first day that the city's popular bike-sharing service introduced 20 electric bikes to its 6,500 bicycle fleet as part of a three-month pilot project to road-test them and get feedback. Bright blue and with a slightly wider frame to accommodate its electric motor, the bikes are made by Quebec firm Cycles Devinci and are being loaned out by PBSC Solutions Urbaines. They have a top speed of 25 kilometres an hour (you can feel the bike gently hold you back once you attain that speed) and a range of about 60 kilometres. Since the solar-powered Bixi docking stations don't have sufficient energy to charge the bikes, Bixi will monitor their energy levels and recharge them as needed. Bixi officials have noted that 70 per cent of customers use their bikes for downhill rides. I assume the electric bikes are designed in part to coax them into commuting uphill as well.
The power meter on a new electric Bixi.
I find my bike at a docking station on de Maisonneuve Blvd. downtown near the Bay (the e-bike locations are indicated, on the Bixi app, with a lightning-bolt symbol). There are a handful available in the downtown core Wednesday morning. I rent one for the usual Bixi rate of $5 a day. Other than the electric boost, it feels much like riding a regular Bixi. The electric ones require users to wear a helmet to conform to Quebec Highway Safety Code rules( https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/electric-bike/ ), and to be at least 18 years old (or 14-17, if you have a scooter or moped license). I take mine down into Griffintown, pedalling lightly the whole way, enjoying the added pull when I ascend slight hills. Disc brakes front and back provide excellent control.
Less effort, but still some muscle required on steep inclines.
"You have to try this thing," I tell Gazette photographer Allen McInnis when we meet for the photo shoot. He does, likes it, but wonders how it might handle when people do slow U-turns. I find it handles fine. Using it is intuitive and easy. Contrary to the fears of some, there is no sitting back and laughing maniacally as the bicycle zooms haphazardly down crowded bike paths. The 25-kilometre-an-hour limit puts a quick brake to any zooming.
I take the bike back up Peel St. toward downtown, and find I have to pedal with a bit of force to ascend, but nowhere near what it normally takes. To give the motor a real test, I ride up steep University St. next to the McGill University campus. Again, it requires some extra pedal power, and I am perspiring lightly by the time I get to Pine Ave. Pedalling a manual bike in our current heat wave conditions however, I would have been soaked. To go up the even steeper stretch leading to the McGill University residences next to the old Royal Victoria Hospital, I have to stand on the pedals to coax the bike up.
Bixi says more electric bikes will likely be added by the end of the season.
My Bixi ride history tells me I rode for one hour (with stops for chit-chat and photos), covered 14.7 kilometres and burned 393 calories. A calorie-counting app tells me I would normally burn about 650 calories in an hour of cycling, where i would have covered closer to 25 kilometres. Despite the humid 24 C, I'm dry. And in a good mood. The e-bike elicits a lot of looks as well, and I get a taste of what it's like to drive a Ferrari. An ecologically friendly, very cheap Ferrari.
The only drawback? Getting back on my regular rusty commuter bicycle and having to do all the work myself. Turns out the guilt over using electric assistance is very short-lived.

Fariha Naqvi-Mohamed: Counting down the days until school starts

Full text: "It's the most wonderful time of the year." No, it's not Christmas that's on my mind, but an infamous office supply store commercial( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz56prGBiS8 ) that used a holiday tune as a soundtrack. It showed a parent pushing a large red cart while skipping down the aisle getting school supplies as the children followed, dragging their feet along. That commercial would make me cringe as a child. As a parent, I can identify all too well. In fact, I found myself singing that very same tune earlier this week as I started perusing the shelves of the local big box store.
I love my kids. I'm just going to put that out there. However, the incessant Fortnite-playing, and the playdate followed by sleepover, followed by playdate, followed by the movies routines that have been our summer, have been exhausting. For me, anyway. In case you're not familiar with Fortnite: It is the obsession of all children this summer and the bane of their parents. It turns the most boisterous 10-year-old into a game-playing robot. Kids play this game for hours on end. They even link up with one another on a headset so they can play remotely with their friends. (Whatever happened to being given a tennis ball and encouraged to throw it against the garage door?)
The longer days, sweltering heat waves and the endless video game obsession have made this summer one for the record books.
My summer began with a beautiful meme I saw on Facebook, showing a parent lovingly hugging their children, with the caption reminding us that we only have 18 summers with them before they grow up. That inspired me, gave me goosebumps, even. It warmed my heart and made me want to start baking my kids cookies, planning playdates and day trips to the zoo. Then they woke up, and the arguing began, the incessant "he said, she said" arguing, the "he's looking at me funny, she's breathing too loud" accusations that make me want to give myself a time out or better yet, send myself to bed early.
I get it; not everyone is so fortunate to be able to allow their kids the flexibility of staying home for the summer. In fact, a large percentage of parents have little choice but to put their children in day camps while they work outside of the home.
But working from home while your children are also home for the summer is no easy feat. It's a great way to save money, as day camps are not cheap, but not a great way to keep your sanity, unless, of course, you are willing to fall back on a web of support. Whether that support comes in the form of swapping playdates, co-parenting at a park while the kids play together or being blessed to have friends pick up your kids so you can work, it's essential to identify and cling to whatever floats your boat and helps keep your sanity.
Having a pair of pre-teens at home is a blessing. Although they are becoming more autonomous, they still want to spend time with us. I know that the moment they go back to school I will miss them dearly. I will miss the midnight snacks, the sleepovers, the giggling, the day trips, the long walks and the pool parties. The days of routines, after school activities, homework, tests and dictÃ©es are around the corner, though there is something to be said for being able to settle back into a routine.
While I know I only have 18 summers with them and will miss them the moment they go back to school, for now, I am counting down the days until the most wonderful time of the year.

T'Cha Dunlevy: Osheaga 2018 wraps with 'no regrets'

Full text: Nick Farkas and Jacques AubÃ© were happy men on Sunday afternoon. The 13th Osheaga Music and Arts Festival was another one for the books, boasting sellout crowds of 45,000 attendees for each of its three days, and further cementing its status as one of the essential stops of summer in Montreal.
"It's an event that's unique, maybe even one of the city's gems," said AubÃ©, general director and COO of evenko, the promoter that puts on Osheaga. If he does say so himself; but it's hard to argue with a three-day party that continues to draw droves of music lovers to Quebec on an annual basis.
An impressive 70 per cent of this year's festival-goers were from outside the province, a proportion that is well above norms elsewhere, AubÃ© noted. More numbers: 50 per cent of fans streamed in from Ontario, and 65 to 70 per cent were women.
It was Osheaga's second year at the temporary site on Ãle Notre Dame, as renovations continue for the revamped regular site at nearby Jean-Drapeau Park. Work is on schedule, AubÃ© and Farkas (Evenko's VP of concerts and events) noted, and the new grounds should be ready to accommodate even bigger crowds of up to 65,000 starting next summer.

That doesn't mean attendance will jump by 20,000 immediately; Evenko is intent on metering things to maximize attendees' comfort, as well as circulation on the site, according to AubÃ©.
This year's festival will be remembered for the show that almost wasn't. Friday night headliner Travis Scott arrived on a private jet but got delayed at customs, taking the stage at 11:03, an hour and 15 minutes late( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/tcha-dunlevy-observations-and-highlights-from-day-1-at-osheaga ), three minutes past curfew and eight minutes after the scheduled end of his set. The American rapper played til 11:40, making for the latest wrap time of any Osheaga to date. It's not an experience Farkas is keen to relive.

"It was super stressful," he admitted. "You have no control. We had six phones going. I was phoning his New York production manager. We were being told he was in the car; he's not in the car; he lost his cell; he's going back for his cell; now he's in the car..."
"Still, it was a thrill," AubÃ© enthused, to which Farkas shot back with a playful yet haunted, 'No."
Scott's performance was nonetheless among this critic's weekend highlights, as were several performances by female artists, including Friday appearances from Jenny Lewis, St. Vincent and Yeah Yeah Yeahs; plus Blondie, Kali Uchis and LP on Saturday.
Dua Lipa performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
British dance-pop star Dua Lipa stole the show on Sunday. Every once in a while you see an artist perform at Osheaga and think, "This coulda been a headliner." Lipa was that artist this year.
The singer's late-afternoon set on the River Stage had it all: showmanship, galvanizing hits and a wildly enthusiastic crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see. No complaints, though - it was fitting to have the sun still out for her sunny, singalong songs, lending a massive beach party vibe to the proceedings. Simply irresistible.
Post Malone performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
The same could be said for Post Malone. It seemed like everyone at Osheaga was on-hand for the Syracuse, N.Y., rapper's sunset set on the River Stage. His torch song I Fall Apart (questionably dedicated to "the b-h that broke my heart," followed by a prompt for the crowd to chant "F-k that b-h!," which it did) garnered a heartfelt singalong, as did pretty much everything he played. Hands swayed side to side for So Flex, while waves of cheers greeted White Iverson and Rockstar.
It was a starkly different vibe when dark Ohio rockers The National took over on the opposing Mountain Stage.

"Hello. It's good to be back here. How's it going?" intoned lead singer Matt Berninger, seemingly enjoying the opportunity to play party pooper, offsetting Post Malone's radio-friendly urban jams with his band's soul-searching anthems. Let's just say there wasn't much crossover between the two crowds, and the crowd thinned dramatically for Berninger and his crew. Despite The National's profound artistic merit, it felt like a misstep in terms of programming.
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
But while a downer after Post Malone, The National was a suitable setup for Florence and the Machine. Enchanting British singer Florence Welch just headlined Osheaga with her band in 2015, yet she's always a delight. With a captivating stage presence and a soaring voice, she pranced about the stage barefoot, spreading pixie dust in her wake.
"Are you guys having a good time so far?" she asked. "I know it's the end of the festival, and it's a lot - we're going to heal you, okay? You're going to leave this festival and nobody's gonna have a hangover. No one's going to have any regrets."
And so it was.

Full text: Nick Farkas and Jacques AubÃ© were happy men on Sunday afternoon. The 13th Osheaga Music and Arts Festival was another one for the books, boasting sellout crowds of 45,000 attendees for each of its three days, and further cementing its status as one of the essential stops of summer in Montreal.
"It's an event that's unique, maybe even one of the city's gems," said AubÃ©, general director and COO of evenko, the promoter that puts on Osheaga. If he does say so himself; but it's hard to argue with a three-day party that continues to draw droves of music lovers to Quebec on an annual basis.
An impressive 70 per cent of this year's festival-goers were from outside the province, a proportion that is well above norms elsewhere, AubÃ© noted. More numbers: 50 per cent of fans streamed in from Ontario, and 65 to 70 per cent were women.
It was Osheaga's second year at the temporary site on Ãle Notre Dame, as renovations continue for the revamped regular site at nearby Jean-Drapeau Park. Work is on schedule, AubÃ© and Farkas (Evenko's VP of concerts and events) noted, and the new grounds should be ready to accommodate even bigger crowds of up to 65,000 starting next summer.

Full text: Nick Farkas and Jacques AubÃ© were happy men on Sunday afternoon. The 13th Osheaga Music and Arts Festival was another one for the books, boasting sellout crowds of 45,000 attendees for each of its three days, and further cementing its status as one of the essential stops of summer in Montreal.
"It's an event that's unique, maybe even one of the city's gems," said AubÃ©, CEO of Evenko, the promoter that puts on Osheaga. If he does say so himself; but it's hard to argue with a three-day party that continues to draw droves of music lovers to Quebec on an annual basis.
An impressive 70 per cent of this year's festival-goers were from outside the province, a proportion that is well above norms elsewhere, AubÃ© noted. More numbers: 50 per cent of fans streamed in from Ontario, and 65 to 70 per cent were women.
It was Osheaga's second year at the temporary site on Ãle Notre Dame, as renovations continue for the revamped regular site at nearby Jean-Drapeau Park. Work is on schedule, AubÃ© and Farkas (Evenko's VP of concerts and events) noted, and the new grounds should be ready to accommodate even bigger crowds of up to 65,000 starting next summer.

British dance-pop star Dua Lipa stole the show on Sunday. Every once in a while you see an artist perform at Osheaga and think, "This coulda been a headliner." Lipa was that artist this year.
The singer's late-afternoon set on the River Stage had it all: showmanship, galvanizing hits and a wildly enthusiastic crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see. No complaints, though - it was fitting to have the sun still out for her sunny, singalong songs, lending a massive beach party vibe to the proceedings. Simply irresistible.
Post Malone performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
The same could be said for Post Malone. It seemed like everyone at Osheaga was on-hand for the Syracuse, N.Y., rapper's sunset set on the River Stage. His torch song I Fall Apart (questionably dedicated to "the b-h that broke my heart," followed by a prompt for the crowd to chant "F-k that b-h!," which it did) garnered a heartfelt singalong, as did pretty much everything he played. Hands swayed side to side for So Flex, while waves of cheers greeted White Iverson and Rockstar.
It was a starkly different vibe when dark Ohio rockers The National took over on the opposing Mountain Stage.

Let's just say there wasn't much crossover between the two crowds, and the crowd thinned dramatically for Berninger and his crew. Despite The National's profound artistic merit, it felt like a misstep in terms of programming.
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
But while a downer after Post Malone, The National was a suitable setup for Florence and the Machine. Enchanting British singer Florence Welch just headlined Osheaga with her band in 2015, yet she's always a delight. With a captivating stage presence and a soaring voice, she pranced about the stage barefoot, spreading pixie dust in her wake.
"Are you guys having a good time so far?" she asked. "I know it's the end of the festival, and it's a lot - we're going to heal you, okay? You're going to leave this festival and nobody's gonna have a hangover. No one's going to have any regrets."
And so it was.

It was Osheaga's second year at the temporary site on Ãle Notre Dame, as renovations continue for the revamped regular site at nearby Jean-Drapeau Park. Work is on schedule, AubÃ© and Farkas (Evenko's VP of concerts and events) noted, and the new grounds should be ready to accommodate even bigger crowds of up to 65,000 starting next summer.

Full text: Nick Farkas and Jacques AubÃ© were happy men on Sunday afternoon. The 13th Osheaga Music and Arts Festival was another one for the books, boasting sellout crowds of 45,000 attendees for each of its three days, and further cementing its status as one of the essential stops of summer in Montreal.
"It's an event that's unique, maybe even one of the city's gems," said AubÃ©, CEO of Evenko, the promoter that puts on Osheaga. If he does say so himself; but it's hard to argue with a three-day party that continues to draw droves of music lovers to Quebec on an annual basis.
An impressive 70 per cent of this year's festival-goers were from outside the province, a proportion that is well above norms elsewhere, AubÃ© noted. More numbers: 50 per cent of fans streamed in from Ontario, and 65 to 70 per cent were women.
It was Osheaga's second year at the temporary site on Ãle Notre Dame, as renovations continue for the revamped regular site at nearby Jean-Drapeau Park. Work is on schedule, AubÃ© and Farkas (Evenko's VP of concerts and events) noted, and the new grounds should be ready to accommodate even bigger crowds of up to 65,000 starting next summer.

That doesn't mean attendance will jump by 20,000 immediately; Evenko is intent on metering things to maximize attendees' comfort, as well as circulation on the site, according to AubÃ©.
This year's festival will be remembered for the show that almost wasn't. Friday night headliner Travis Scott arrived on a private jet but got delayed at customs, taking the stage at 11:03, an hour and 15 minutes late( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/tcha-dunlevy-observations-and-highlights-from-day-1-at-osheaga ), three minutes past curfew and eight minutes after the scheduled end of his set. The American rapper played til 11:40, making for the latest wrap time of any Osheaga to date. It's not an experience Farkas is keen to relive.

T'Cha Dunlevy: Osheaga Day 2 highlights and reviews( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/tcha-dunlevy-osheaga-day-2-highlights-and-reviews )
"It was super stressful," he admitted. "You have no control. We had six phones going. I was phoning his New York production manager. We were being told he was in the car; he's not in the car; he lost his cell; he's going back for his cell; now he's in the car..."
"Still, it was a thrill," AubÃ© enthused, to which Farkas shot back with a playful yet haunted, 'No."
Scott's performance was nonetheless among this critic's weekend highlights, as were several performances by female artists, including Friday appearances from Jenny Lewis, St. Vincent and Yeah Yeah Yeahs; plus Blondie, Kali Uchis and LP on Saturday.
Dua Lipa performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
British dance-pop star Dua Lipa stole the show on Sunday. Every once in a while you see an artist perform at Osheaga and think, "This coulda been a headliner." Lipa was that artist this year.
The singer's late-afternoon set on the River Stage had it all: showmanship, galvanizing hits and a wildly enthusiastic crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see. No complaints, though - it was fitting to have the sun still out for her sunny, singalong songs, lending a massive beach party vibe to the proceedings. Simply irresistible.
Post Malone performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
The same could be said for Post Malone. It seemed like everyone at Osheaga was on-hand for the Syracuse, N.Y., rapper's sunset set on the River Stage. His torch song I Fall Apart (questionably dedicated to "the b-h that broke my heart," followed by a prompt for the crowd to chant "F-k that b-h!," which it did) garnered a heartfelt singalong, as did pretty much everything he played. Hands swayed side to side for So Flex, while waves of cheers greeted White Iverson and Rockstar.
It was a starkly different vibe when dark Ohio rockers The National took over on the opposing Mountain Stage.
The National performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
"Hello. It's good to be back here. How's it going?" intoned lead singer Matt Berninger, seemingly enjoying the opportunity to play party pooper, offsetting Post Malone's radio-friendly urban jams with his band's soul-searching anthems. Let's just say there wasn't much crossover between the two crowds, and the crowd thinned dramatically for Berninger and his crew. Despite The National's profound artistic merit, it felt like a misstep in terms of programming.
Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine performs at Osheaga in Montreal on Sunday, August 5, 2018.
But while a downer after Post Malone, The National was a suitable setup for Florence and the Machine. Enchanting British singer Florence Welch just headlined Osheaga with her band in 2015, yet she's always a delight. With a captivating stage presence and a soaring voice, she pranced about the stage barefoot, spreading pixie dust in her wake.
"Are you guys having a good time so far?" she asked. "I know it's the end of the festival, and it's a lot - we're going to heal you, okay? You're going to leave this festival and nobody's gonna have a hangover. No one's going to have any regrets."
And so it was.

Full text: The impact of last week's nearly hour-long blackout at the MUHC superhospital( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muhc-investigating-cause-of-generator-failure-during-power-outage ) was far more serious than publicly disclosed, as surgeons had to resort to using flashlights to finish operations already in progress, the Montreal Gazette has learned.
The flashlights were easy to find, because for the first six months after the superhospital opened in 2015, the McGill University Health Centre stocked the operating rooms with plenty of flashlights and batteries in case of feared blackouts, a highly placed source said.
Since its opening, the sprawling Glen site facility in Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce has been plagued by a host of electrical problems, from faulty wiring in the ORs to power limitations that requirethe MUHC to shut off the air conditioning in the packed cafeteria and atrium during heat waves( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/power-limitations-force-muhcs-glen-site-to-selectively-cut-off-central-air ).
The darkened ORs quickly turned hot and stifling on July 23 as the power was also cut to the dedicated ventilation systems.
Following that blackout, MUHC officials launched a joint investigation with the private consortium in charge of maintaining the superhospital to determine the possible causes of the outage beyond a defective back-up generator.

"Oh my God, they actually had to finish surgeries using flashlights," a second source told The Gazette. "This raises the question: how often do they inspect the backup generators?
"It's ludicrous, completely irresponsible," added the same source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The MUHC released a statement on July 25 that confirmed the blackout affected the emergency department and operating rooms, but it did not mention that flashlights were deployed during surgery.
"Some patients ... experienced delays and have had their care plans modified," the statement said, without elaborating on exactly how patients were affected.
Richard Fahey, director of human resources, communications and legal affairs at the MUHC, denied on Wednesday that the public hospital network was less than forthcoming by not disclosing that surgeons had to use flashlights.
"The power outage was disclosed to the public via a press release on our website and social media, including the fact that the ORs were affected," he said in an email. He did not address why the MUHC did not disclose that flashlights had to be used.
Pressed for more details, Fahey revealed for the first time that "because one of the 11 generators did not function properly, all adult ORs were without full power during 51 minutes.
"That being said, anesthesia machines and other equipment that had battery backup were operational," he added. "Only two adult patients were in the ORs at the time of the power outage. All patients undergoing procedures during the power outage were informed that their procedures were completed with limited resources under the skillful hands of MUHC surgeons."
Still, there is mounting anger among senior MUHC managers toward Groupe immobilier de santÃ© McGill (GISM), the private consortium headed by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin that installed the electrical system during the construction of the superhospital. GISM officials were not available for comment Wednesday.
Critics of public-private partnerships in England - where such projects were pioneered - have accused private consortia of placing profit over safety in the construction of hospitals. The MUHC public-private partnership was supposed to prevent any cost overruns, but the provincial government in January paid GISM $108 million( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/superhospital-public-private-partnerships-are-costlier-than-ever-critics ), on top of the $1.3-billion contract, to settle a lawsuit.
The government settled with the consortium despite previous comments by Health Minister GaÃ©tan Barrette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-innisfree-company-sues-quebec-and-muhc-for-superhospital-cost-overruns ) that "this lawsuit is not based on justifiable grounds."
The Montreal Gazette has also learned that employees at the Glen site have been complaining of headaches because the air exchanges are turned off overnight to save on electricity costs, leaving stale air throughout the complex of buildings. The MUHC is under tremendous pressure by Barrette to cut its deficit despite increasing clinical volumes.
Fahey of the MUHC did not respond to a question about the air exchanges. But he did emphasize that "the MUHC considers the 51-minute power outage a serious event and is working diligently with its partner, GISM, to significantly reduce the risk and prevent a similar event from occurring again."
Dr. Pierre Gfeller, the newly-appointed executive director of the MUHC, is overseeing the investigation with GISM.
Blackouts in ORs are extremely rare, but not unprecedented. In 2011, generators in two hospitals in San Diego failed( http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/sdut-regional-hospitals-fully-operational-friday-2011sep09-story.html ) and staff had to use flashlights to illuminate some areas and battery packs were used on patients with ventilators.

Full text: The impact of last week's nearly hour-long blackout at the MUHC superhospital was far more serious than publicly disclosed, as surgeons had to resort to using flashlights to finish operations already in progress, the Montreal Gazette has learned.
The flashlights were easy to find, because for the first six months after the superhospital opened in 2015, the McGill University Health Centre stocked the operating rooms with plenty of flashlights and batteries in case of feared blackouts, a highly placed source said.
Since its opening, the sprawling Glen site facility in Notre-Damede-GrÃ¢ce has been plagued by a host of electrical problems, from faulty wiring in the ORs to power limitations that require the MUHC to shut off the air conditioning in the packed cafeteria and atrium during heat waves.
The darkened ORs quickly turned hot and stifling on July 23 as the power was also cut to the dedicated ventilation systems.
Following that blackout, MUHC officials launched a joint investigation with the private consortium in charge of maintaining the superhospital to determine the possible causes of the outage beyond a defective back-up generator.
"Oh my God, they actually had to finish surgeries using flashlights," a second source told The Gazette. "This raises the question: how often do they inspect the backup generators? "It's ludicrous, completely irresponsible," added the same source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The MUHC released a statement on July 25 that confirmed the blackout affected the emergency department and operating rooms, but it did not mention that flashlights were deployed during surgery.
"Some patients ... experienced delays and have had their care plans modified," the statement said, without elaborating on exactly how patients were affected.
Richard Fahey, director of human resources, communications and legal affairs at the MUHC, denied on Wednesday that the public hospital network was less than forthcoming by not disclosing that surgeons had to use flashlights.
"The power outage was disclosed to the public via a press release on our website and social media, including the fact that the ORs were affected," he said in an email. He did not address why the MUHC did not disclose that flashlights had to be used.
Pressed for more details, Fahey revealed for the first time that "because one of the 11 generators did not function properly, all adult ORs were without full power during 51 minutes.
"That being said, anesthesia machines and other equipment that had battery backup were operational," he added. "Only two adult patients were in the ORs at the time of the power outage. All patients undergoing procedures during the power outage were informed that their procedures were completed with limited resources under the skilful hands of MUHC surgeons."
Still, there is mounting anger among senior MUHC managers toward Groupe immobilier de santÃ© McGill (GISM), the private consortium headed by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin that installed the electrical system during the construction of the superhospital. GISM officials were not available for comment Wednesday.
Critics of public-private partnerships in England - where such projects were pioneered - have accused private consortia of placing profit over safety in the construction of hospitals. The MUHC public-private partnership was supposed to prevent any cost overruns, but the provincial government in January paid GISM $108 million, on top of the $1.3-billion contract, to settle a lawsuit.
The government settled with the consortium despite previous comments by Health Minister GaÃ©tan Barrette that "this lawsuit is not based on justifiable grounds."
The Montreal Gazette has also learned that employees at the Glen site have been complaining of headaches because the air exchanges are turned off overnight to save on electricity costs, leaving stale air throughout the complex of buildings.
The MUHC is under tremendous pressure by Barrette to cut its deficit despite increasing clinical volumes.
Fahey of the MUHC did not respond to a question about the air exchanges. But he did emphasize that "the MUHC considers the 51-minute power outage a serious event and is working diligently with its partner, GISM, to significantly reduce the risk and prevent a similar event from occurring again." Dr. Pierre Gfeller, the newlyappointed executive director of the MUHC, is overseeing the investigation with GISM.

Full text: Busy Tuesday? Here are a few stories you might have overlooked.
Ariel Jeffrey Kouakou's parents wrote an open letter to the person they believe took their boy near a north-end Montreal park in March.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/no-room-for-hatred-ariel-kouakous-family-forgives-possible-abductor ) Still convinced Ariel was abducted and is alive somewhere, the family describes in the letter how they're ready to forgive the person if they come forward and would even welcome them into their lives.
"We're trying to look at this in a positive way," said the missing boy's father, Kouadio FrÃ©dÃ©ric Kouakou, on Tuesday. "For someone to abduct a child, it's because they're missing something, either affection or a child's presence in their life."
Montreal police suspect the 10-year-old drowned in RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies after entering a park that borders the water, but Kouakou has repeatedly rejected the idea. He believes someone has his child. The letter describes the different emotions the family has been living through for the last four months. Adding to the anguish, Kouakou writes, is the "pain of the unknown and questions without answers."
This July was the hottest the island of Montreal has experienced in nearly 100 years.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-damn-july-was-one-of-hottest-on-record-in-montreal ) The month's average temperature of 24.2 C fell just half a degree shy of the all-time high of 24.7 C, recorded 97 years ago in 1921.
The 2018 average is also three degrees above the mean July temperature of 21.2 C. From day to day, a three-degree increase might not seem like a lot, but over a month, it makes a difference, said Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault. He explained that mean monthly temperatures tend to vary by one degree year to year, so a difference of three degrees is "way (above) normal for a month-long period."
Dominique Paquin, a climate simulation and analysis specialist with research consortium Ouranos, said it's too early to definitively attribute the waves of extreme heat that spread across the northern hemisphere in July to climate change, "but we know that with climate change, the number of days with extreme heat will increase."

Poll: Did it feel like the hottest July in nearly 100 years?( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/poll-did-it-feel-like-the-hottest-july-in-nearly-100-years )
The city of Montreal has proposed three alternative sites for the new McCord museum( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-offers-three-new-potential-locations-for-mccord-museum ), after announcing in May that the planned site for the museum's new $150-million home would instead be turned into a park.
Each site fulfils the museum's criteria, the city said in a statement released Tuesday, including that the building be downtown, near the Quartier des Spectacles and easily accessible by public transit. President and CEO of the museum, Suzanne Sauvage, said the McCord is considering two of the three choices, but studies to find out which site is best could cost as much as $250,000 each.
"It's a nice effort that the city made, but our favourite site was still the EugÃ¨ne-Lapierre site," Sauvage said, referring to a location that the Coderre administration had initially promised next to the Place des Festivals.

Full text: Regardless of whether the sun shines, the temperature rises to 31 C or it pours rain, there are plenty of free events and activities around town to keep you busy on the weekends. (Which is good news since Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) is predicting all three types of weather in the next few days.)
Here are some freebies happening in and around Montreal from Friday, July 20 to Sunday, July 22:
Movies in the park... and indoors
Tis the season for free outdoor film screenings, now that the heat wave is behind us and sitting outside is enjoyable again. Cinemania( https://www.festivalcinemania.com/en/featured/cinemania-unveils-its-summer-program ) will be screening the award-winning "farmland thriller" Bloody Milk on Saturday at 9 p.m. on the terrace of Renoir at the Sofitel Hotel Golden Mile downtown. On Sunday, Film Noir au Canal( http://filmnoiraucanal.org/ ) will present Jean Renoir's Les Bas-Fonds (French with English subtitles) at 9 p.m. in St-Patrick's Square.

Free outdoor film screenings in Montreal all summer long( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movies/free-outdoor-film-screenings-in-montreal-all-summer-long )
And if it rains, there's always the Fantasia International Film Festival, with numerous indoor screenings all weekend (at a cost). Speaking of Fantasia...
An immersive Fantasia experience( https://fantasiafestival.com/en/programs/experience-fantasia-vr-1 )
Along with the vast array of feature films( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movies/18-crazy-films-at-22nd-fantasia-festival-from-nicolas-cage-to-kung-fu ) and shorts being screened at Concordia University until Aug. 2, the Fantasia Film Festival is presenting 13 virtual reality experiences this weekend. From Thursday until Saturday, festivalgoers can immerse themselves in the works of French film director Alexandre Aja, Canadian playwright Jean Yoon as well as Montreal's Maude Thibodeau and Chantal Dumas - to name just four.
The event will be held in the atrium in front of Concordia's J.A. DeSÃ¨ve Theatre from July 19 to 21 between noon and 8 p.m. Sessions last 20 minutes, and participants are encouraged to vote for their favourite film.
You can't go wrong with fireworks( https://www.laronde.com/fr/larondefr/linternational-des-feux/feufive )
Finish your Saturday with a bang (or several). The Philippines' Dragon Fireworks Inc. will light up the sky this weekend in their first competition at L'International des Feux Loto-QuÃ©bec. The theme: video games, arcade games and TV series. We're talking everything from Super Mario to Game of Thrones to Angry Birds.
As always, liftoff is at 10 p.m.
Special mention: Osheaga block party( https://www.evenko.ca/en/events/14186/block-party-gatineau/downtown-gatineau/07-21-2018 )
If you find yourself in Gatineau on Saturday, drop by the Osheaga block party as a prelude to the three-day blowout running in Montreal from Aug. 3 to 5 (or as a cheap alternative if you're not willing to shell out $320 for a general admission weekend pass to the festival).
Doors open at 2 p.m. in downtown Gatineau with an impressive assortment of Montreal talent, including producer Shash'U, rapper FouKi and urban electro DJ Poirier.

Leaf blower blowup made Beaconsfield a global laughing stock: mayor

Full text: Beaconsfield is known for its yacht clubs, two-car garages and quiet streets.
Leaf blower uprisings? Not so much.
But this normally tranquil bedroom community of Montreal made headlines well beyond its own tidy borders last week when police( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/police-called-to-quell-beaconsfield-leaf-blower-uprising ) were called to keep the peace at a raucous city council meeting.
Voices were raised, insults exchanged before council voted in favour of a bylaw( https://www.beaconsfield.ca/en/what-s-new ) to restrict the use of leaf blowers from June 1 till Sept. 30, beginning in 2019.
News of Beaconsfield's controversial leaf blower ban made national headlines, and Mayor Georges Bourelle later appeared on both CTV and TVA television networks to explain his city's decision to ban blowers during the summer months and what prompted tensions to flare.
"It's an embarrassment," Bourelle said of all the attention.
"We made Beaconsfield the laughing stock of the world, if I can say so."
The mayor said last Monday's council meeting was unruliest he's presided over since first being elected in 2013.
Bourelle said some in the crowd were openly hostile to the point of being physically intimidating.
"This was the most rowdy and the most disrespectful crowd ever," he said. "People even tried to block us trying to walk into the council chambers. There were people standing there who put up their elbows as we walked in."
With Montreal coping with an oppressive July heat wave, all hell broke loose during a heated question-and-answer period with citizens in the packed council chambers of city hall.
Bourelle said much of the dissent had been sown beforehand by disgruntled political opponents.
Of the 100 or so people who showed up to council, only about half were hostile to the leaf blower ban, he said.
"In a town of 20,000, 50 to 60 people is not representative of the majority."
While contractors voiced their concerns that a ban will force them to find other less effective means to clear away lawn debris, other critics were upset with the city's lack of transparency by not revealing the results of a local survey the city commissioned to help determine public sentiment on the issue.
The city argued the ban minimizes pollution and health risks.
Of 600 residents surveyed, the somewhat ambiguous results( https://www.beaconsfield.ca/images/stories/pdf/Greffe/leger_souffleurs_feuilles_beaconsfield_rapport_20180518.pdf ) show support for a partial ban, even though a majority were not bothered that much by leaf blowers to begin with.
(Some 45 per cent of residents surveyed owned leaf blowers).
While the answers might have been blowin' in the wind, Bourelle said the survey was intended for internal use and could be viewed on the city's website following the council vote.
But that did not sit well with some residents .
"There was a mob mentality," said Bourelle, who was called a "bully" for his handling of the ban.
Only once before has seen people so worked up over an issue in normally tranquil Beaconsfield.
"We once had an information session on public billboards that also got very heated," he said.
So billboards and leaf blowers are push-button issues in Beaconsfield?
Bourelle laughed and said: "It's most unfortunate. It's sad. I'm embarrassed to see a group give such a bad reputation to Beaconsfield."
But the mayor added: "What happened (July 9) does not reflect the real peaceful residents we have in Beaconsfield."
The next council meeting is set for Aug. 20.

Full text: Beaconsfield is known for its yacht clubs, two-car garages and quiet streets.
Leaf blower uprisings? Not so much.
But this normally tranquil bedroom community of Montreal made headlines well beyond its own tidy borders last week when police( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/police-called-to-quell-beaconsfield-leaf-blower-uprising ) were called to keep the peace at a raucous city council meeting.
Voices were raised, insults exchanged before council voted in favour of a bylaw( https://www.beaconsfield.ca/en/what-s-new ) to restrict the use of leaf blowers from blowers from June 1 till Sept. 30, beginning in 2019.
News of Beaconsfield's controversial leaf blower ban made national headlines, and Mayor Georges Bourelle later appeared on both CTV and TVA television networks to explain his city's decision to ban blowers during the summer months and what prompted tensions to flare.
"It's an embarrassment," Bourelle said of all the attention.
"We made Beaconsfield the laughing stock of the world, if I can say so."
The mayor said last Monday's council meeting was unruliest he's presided over since first being elected in 2013.
Bourelle said some in the crowd were openly hostile to the point of being physically intimidating.
"This was the most rowdy and the most disrespectful crowd ever," he said. "People even tried to block us trying to walk into the council chambers. There were people standing there who put up their elbows as we walked in."
With Montreal coping with an oppressive July heat wave, all hell broke loose during a heated question-and-answer period with citizens in the packed council chambers of city hall.
Bourelle said much of the dissent had been sown beforehand by disgruntled political opponents.
Of the 100 or so people who showed up to council, only about half were hostile to the leaf blower ban, he said.
"In a town of 20,000, 50 to 60 people is not representative of the majority."
While contractors voiced their concerns that a ban will force them to find other less effective means to clear away lawn debris, other critics were upset with the city's lack of transparency by not revealing the results of a local survey the city commissioned to help determine public sentiment on the issue.
The city argued the ban minimizes pollution and health risks.
Of 600 residents surveyed, the somewhat ambiguous results( https://www.beaconsfield.ca/images/stories/pdf/Greffe/leger_souffleurs_feuilles_beaconsfield_rapport_20180518.pdf ) show support for a partial ban, even though a majority were not bothered that much by leaf blowers to begin with.
(Some 45 per cent of residents surveyed owned leaf blowers).
While the answers might have been blowin' in the wind, Bourelle said the survey was intended for internal use and could be viewed on the city's website following the council vote.
But that did not sit well with some residents .
"There was a mob mentality," said Bourelle, who was called a "bully" for his handling of the ban.
Only once before has seen people so worked up over an issue in normally tranquil Beaconsfield.
"We once had an information session on public billboards that also got very heated," he said.
So billboards and leaf blowers are push-button issues in Beaconsfield?
Bourelle laughed and said: "It's most unfortunate. It's sad. I'm embarrassed to see a group give such a bad reputation to Beaconsfield."
But the mayor added: "What happened (July 9) does not reflect the real peaceful residents we have in Beaconsfield."
The next council meeting is set for Aug. 20.

The office mantra for the summer? 'Dress appropriately'

Full text: During a recent Toronto heat wave, chief executive officer Dan Kelly went to the office attired in something he would never have worn to work even a few years ago "a polo shirt and jacket" instead of his usual business suit, dress shirt and tie.
That's about as casual as Mr. Kelly, head of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), gets when it comes to his own work garb. But, like an increasing number of executives, he believes there "has to be a strong business case" for dictating the wardrobe choices of others. The formal business dress code is falling out of fashion.
At General Motors Co., CEO Mary Barra has pared the previous 10-page dress code down to two words: Dress appropriately. Companies such as accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers and human resources firm Accenture have adopted a "Dress for Your Day" policy, trusting employees to decide when they can go business casual and when they should bust out The Suit. Tim Ryan, PwC's U.S. chairman, wore jeans when he announced the more relaxed corporate dress policy in the summer of 2016.
Chartered accountant Penny Partridge, chief people officer at PwC Canada, said it did not make a lot of sense to tell professionals how to dress "when we trust them with millions of dollars in complex issues with our clients."
The policy applies year round.
"In the summer, can people take it a little bit far? Oh, yeah.
We joke that sometimes people think that they are at the beach or at a nightclub, but these are sort of one-offs and we talk to people when we see that," Ms. Partridge said in an interview. There's no need to make it a bigger deal than it is, she said.
Accenture tries not to be too prescriptive, but offers "soft guidelines," says Nicholas Greschner, Accenture Canada's human-resources director. "We tested it out three summers ago and just continued on with dress for your day throughout the year." On the whole, employees have found a good balance between expressing their personal styles, while respecting their clients' preferences. "If you do need to wear a suit, you wear a suit, right?" Some employers, however, still feel the need to issue the annual summer memo on what dress is considered acceptable in the warmer weather - it could be khakis, golf shirts, capri pants - and what is not.
Employers should also communicate their expectations on grooming and hygiene. "During the warm summer months, body odour and other hygiene issues may become more prevalent," U.S. firm XpertHR said in its 2018 report on summer workplace issues.
At the CFIB, Mr. Kelly gets calls from CFIB members asking whether they can require employees to cover tattoos with long-sleeved shirts, whether it is fair to prohibit men from wearing sandals in the workplace when women are allowed to do so, whether they can ban flip-flops. The old rules don't necessarily apply, and "there is no hard and fast" on how to address some of these issues now, he said.
There is a case to be made for lightening up on the wardrobe front, Mr. Kelly said. "A lot of companies are being more energy conscious, so if you require people to wear jackets, suits and ties to work, obviously your cooling costs are going to be higher compared with environments where you are allowing people to wear short sleeves or even shorts in some locations."
With workplace norms changing so quickly, employees, too, are seeking guidance on what, exactly, "business casual" means. At Accenture's Montreal office, the men's employee resource group organized an event with Holt Renfrew to understand the trends, Mr. Greschner said in an interview.
PwC employees in Toronto recently held a fashion show at Hudson's Bay Co. "where we had our own people modelling appropriate professional business attire," Ms. Partridge said.
They had the opportunity to shop afterward, with personal style advice from the Bay experts.
According to a recent report by the Office Team division of HR firm Robert Half, piercings, visible tattoos, jeans and leggings are more acceptable at work than they were five years ago. "Employers have become less tolerant of flip-flops, shorts and tank tops."
However, employees will not necessarily know if they have run afoul of unwritten dress codes. Senior managers are uncomfortable in the role of fashion police and only 8 per cent of 300 surveyed for the Office Team report have spoken to an employee about inappropriate attire.

Hot spots and highlights of Montreal's 39th jazz fest

Full text: Was that so hard? In its annual closing news conference, Saturday, the Montreal International Jazz Festival did what neither SLAV director Robert Lepage nor singer Betty Bonifassi appeared able to over the past two weeks: they apologized.
For more than 30 minutes, jazz fest president and general director Jacques-AndrÃ© Dupont sat before reporters, fielded questions, and admitted that mistakes had been made in the festival's reaction to the uproar surrounding the controversial production.
The "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," featuring a white director and mostly white cast, drew charges of cultural appropriation and was officially cancelled on Wednesday.
It's not every year that most of the jazz festival wrap-up session is spent talking about a single show. It's usually a rather tame and convivial affair, with programmers touting their personal highlights and media lobbing softballs about attendance, and whether the musically diverse event can still be considered a jazz festival.
But this year was like no other in memory. SLAV began its run on June 26, two nights before the beginning of the festival. And though it played for only three of the scheduled 16 performances, the debate surrounding the show extended right up to the jazz festival's final day.
With a heat wave blanketing Montreal for much of the festival, it felt like the city was the setting for a reboot of Spike Lee's 1989 film Do The Right Thing, in which racial unrest consumes New York on the hottest day of the year.
Dupont extended his support to Lepage and Bonifassi, but also expressed his and the festival's understanding of the dissent expressed by Montreal's black community.
He and the jazz festival's VP of programming, Laurent Saulnier, emerged from a four-hour meeting with members of the black community on Friday with a greater appreciation of the latter's concerns.
"We're being told that the world is changing, that we should listen more," Dupont said, "that some subjects we don't understand well - that there are issues for Montreal's black community that we don't get.
"It was about having a real discussion. Some things that were said were hard, but at the same time, it was really constructive. I was really happy, because we want to do more, and I want us to do better."
And with that simple mea culpa, Dupont and the jazz festival added welcome nuance to a debate that has too often been framed as an assault on artistic freedom.
The only hiccup in the festival's stance was the admission that its real reasons for cancelling the show on Wednesday were Bonifassi's injury - she broke her ankle after the third performance, June 28 - and public security.
Dupont did well to specify that the festival was concerned for the safety of jazz festival attendees, artists and "the people who come to protest on the site - the security of everyone."
But he went on to single out the "aggressiveness" of some protesters, specifying that "though some people protested in an extremely correct, pacifist manner, some people were very aggressive, and the festival feared that if we continued, there could be (incidents)."
While the broader safety concerns are credible, it is worth noting that the only violent acts documented during the protests occurred when an elderly white woman entering the theatre slapped a young black female protester on opening night; following which, police pushed away Montreal singer-songwriter Pierre Kwenders.
The 39th jazz festival came to a close Saturday night as throngs of music-lovers swarmed a packed festival site to take in the soaring sounds of Grammy-winning American rock band The War On Drugs.
This critic's personal highlights included the infectious energy of Toronto R&B upstart Jessie Reyez, who headlined the mid-fest free outdoor blowout; the mischievous spirit of innovative American jazz vocalist CÃ©cile McLorin Salvant and the spell cast by Belgian chanteuse Melanie Di Blasio.
Among jazz fest VP Saulnier's favourites were Seal, British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings'band Sons of Kemet, as well as a flurry of local acts including Montreal-Brooklyn collective Megative, Nomadic Massive and Haitian-QuÃ©bÃ©coise artists Dominique Fils-AimÃ© and MÃ©lissa Laveaux.
Festival co-founder AndrÃ© MÃ©nard's list included Ry Cooder, George Thorogood, jazz fest faves Gogo Penguin, John Medeski, Montrealer Jordan Officer and New York's Too Many Zooz.
MÃ©nard also made a special mention of the emotional performance by veteran Montreal jazz singer Ranee Lee, who took the stage Friday evening at L'Astral despite having just lost her husband of 46 years and longtime collaborator, guitarist Richard Ring.
"Rather than stay home, she decided to do a concert," MÃ©nard said, going on to reveal that he invited Lee back, on the spot, to play next year's 40th edition, June 27 to July 7, 2019, which will be MÃ©nard's last. tdunlevy@postmedia.com Twitter.com/TChaDunlevy

Full text: Indoors
Bobby McFerrin with David Worm, Joey Blake and the Jireh Gospel Choir (7 p.m., Maison symphonique de MontrÃ©al, $65.60 to $91.10) There are worse ways to close out the 39th Montreal International Jazz Festival than in the presence of one of the world's greatest a cappella singers in our city's most sonically pristine concert hall. McFerrin revisits his 1998 improv album, Circlesongs, for which he engaged in lyric-less jams with 12 other singers. Prepare to be transported.
Outdoors
The War On Drugs (9:30 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne-Mance St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) Fresh off winning this year's Grammy for best rock album, Philadelphia's atmospheric rock band The War On Drugs headlines the jazz fest's closing free outdoor blowout. With the oppressive heat wave behind us, it's a night to let your mind wander to Adam Granduciel's expansive sounds, offset by a warm breeze and cold beer.
R.L. Boyce (9 and 11 p.m., Hyundai/CBC/Radio-Canada Stage, corner de Montigny and Clark Sts., free) This veteran Mississippi bluesman was profiled in Montrealer Daniel Cross's wonderful 2016 documentary I Am the Blues. His latest album is called Roll and Tumble, and like the man behind it, it's the real deal.

Full text: INDOOR:
Melanie De Biasio( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/en-CA/Programmation/Concert/9499 ) (8 p.m., Monument-National, $41.75)
Few singers can cast a spell like Belgian chanteuse Melanie De Biasio. Borrowing elements of jazz, blues and soul, she can sound like Nina Simone or conjure the spirit of Tom Waits. Her fourth album, Lilies, recorded alone on her computer, drifts through stark, ethereal atmospheres interspersed with infusions of funky rhythms. Sure to be a treat in the intimate confines of Monument-National.
OUTDOOR:
Megative( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/En/Programmation/Concert/9669 ) (9 and 11 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne-Mance St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free)
Gus Van Go of Montreal '90s ska-punk crew Me Mom and Morgentaler and Tim Fletcher of 2000s indie-rock act The Stills converge in this reggae-punk-electro act with enough urban cool to tame the heat wave and start a laid-back dance party for the hometown crowd - over two sets on the outdoor main stage. Woot!
Thornetta Davis( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/en/Programmation/Concert/9661 ) (9 and 11 p.m., Hyundai/CBC/Radio-Canada Stage, corner St-Urbain St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free)
Thornetta Davis was a backup vocalist for Bob Seger and Kid Rock before going on to become Detroit's Queen of the Blues. The good times will roll as she sings songs from her 2016 album, Honest Woman, on the ever-popular blues stage.
The Montreal International Jazz Festival continues to Saturday. For more info, visit montrealjazzfest.com( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/ )

Soaking up the world cup in a hockey town

Full text: Summer has finally arrived and Montreal is in the middle of a heat wave, but I'm tethered to the television.
It's the middle of the World Cup, which only comes around every four years, and it's getting down to the wire. After 32 teams were whittled down to 16 for the knockout round, we're now on the verge of the quarter-finals. Is your team still in the competition? That's the thing about Montreal. Canada doesn't have a horse in this race, so when it comes to who we support, we are the sum of our varied and diverse parts.
Maybe you back the country where you were born. Maybe it's where your ancestors came from. Maybe it's a place you've visited and liked. Maybe you've adopted a team based on a player you admire. Maybe you've been moved by an improbable backstory - for the human drama at the tournament is sometimes more compelling than what happens on the field.
The Icelandic coach who moonlights as a dentist? The Iranian keeper who was homeless for a time blocking a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty kick? Senegal's joyful pregame dance warm-up? Sometimes the real heroes, those who capture hearts and minds, turn out not to be the Neymars and the Lionel Messis.
Yes, there is drama aplenty, and sometimes of the soap-operatic kind. Take Argentina's early meltdown and quest to recapture its mojo, while cementing Messi's legacy. Iconic veteran Diego Maradona's antics in the stands and health scares made for a riveting subplot.
There's always plenty of controversy: over video-assisted reviews, questionable calls, or stoppage time running long when football powerhouses were on the ropes.
The biggest controversy of all may be how Russia ended up playing host. The awarding of the games to Russia by FIFA, soccer's world governing body, was the result of an epic corruption scandal uncovered by former British spy Christopher Steele of "pee tape" fame and pursued by former FBI director James Comey. And there's no doubt the World Cup is a PR opportunity for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
Having to look the other way at the unsavoury politics that too often sully the sport is the downside of soccer. The darkest moment of the Russian World Cup was surely was when Egyptian superstar Mohamed Salah was hung out to dry by his national team, who set up shop in Chechnya and let notorious dictator Ramzen Kadyrov cosy up to and embarrass the world's most talented Muslim athlete.
There were other lows, too, like death threats and slurs directed at Swedish player Jimmy Durmaz for a mistake that resulted in a winning goal for Germany. Never mind Durmaz was born in Sweden, he was assailed as an "immigrant" and "suicide bomber." Never mind that Sweden has reached the quarter-finals and Germany went home early. Such attacks betray an ugly side to the beautiful game that should not be tolerated.
The World Cup is supposed to be fun, a chance to join with your compatriots or fellow partisans to cheer on your team, celebrate success, or commiserate in defeat. Sure there's a bit of nationalistic jingoism to it, waving flags and sporting your colours on game days, but in Montreal, it's generally harmless fun.
If you're not watching, you can often tell who won by who's doing victory laps or which bar's patrons have spilled out into the streets to revel. Little Italy is pretty quiet these days, since the Azzuri failed to qualify, but Spanish, Portuguese, French, Brazilian, Argentine, Colombian, Tunisian and Moroccan supporters have congregated on game day, often just a few blocks apart.
The Mexican population staked out the Georges-Ãtienne-Cartier monument at the foot Mount Royal and cruised Parc Ave. in euphoria when they beat Germany. (Hirving Lozano's goal caused a mild earthquake at home).
Our tribal identities have long defined our soccer allegiances in Montreal. But come 2026 - eight years and two World Cups from now - we should have a team in the contest. Canada along with the United States and Mexico, just won a joint bid to host that tournament. Montreal will be the site of three games. And as a host nation, we should automatically qualify.
Canada is a far cry from Mexico or the U.S. when it comes to fielding a viable team. Our women have been the superior force in the last few years. So coach John Herdman has now moved over to the men's squad to whip them into shape.
Will Montrealers abandon their traditional allegiances to cheer for our own team in 2026, especially if they take to the pitch at the Big O? The World Cup could fill the off-season gap quite nicely in this hockey-obsessed town. Maybe we won't cancel school on game days, like they do in Uruguay, but there should be enough love of the beautiful game to one day become a unified soccer nation. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: More than 36,000 clients of Hydro-QuÃ©bec were waking up Tuesday morning without power - and air conditioning - as a record-breaking heat wave continued to crush parts of the province.
As of 7 a.m., Hydro-QuÃ©bec was reporting that 36,640 customers didn't have electricity - 6,495 of them in the Outaouais( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/outaouais.html#bis ) region, 14,209 in the LanaudiÃ¨re( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/lanaudiere.html#bis ) and 8,815 in the the Laurentians.
The outages were caused by a chain of severe thunderstorms that swept through Monday evening, Hydro-QuÃ©bec said.
By contrast, only 80 customers lost power in Montreal, which was narrowly missed by the storms but was put under a severe thunderstorm warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/severe-thunderstorm-warning-issued-for-montreal-and-surrounding-areas ) Monday evening.
Hydro-QuÃ©bec said that it was too early to say when power would be restored to all its customers.
The outages continue on a day when temperatures are expected to climb as high as 32 C with a humidex of 37.

Max Domi will be turning his father into a Canadiens fan

Full text: Max Domi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130519 ) couldn't wipe the smile off his face Saturday afternoon when he met with the media and tried on his new Canadiens No. 13 jersey in the team's Brossard locker room.
"I'm super excited to be here," said the 5-foot-10, 195-pound left-winger who was acquired from the Arizona Coyotes earlier this month in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. "I haven't been able to stop smiling the whole time."
Domi was making a quick, 24-hour visit to Montreal to drop in on the Canadiens' evaluation camp and meet with general manager Marc Bergevin, coach Claude Julien and other members of the team's staff while also looking for a new place to live.
"I spoke with everyone, pretty much," said the 23-year-old Domi, who is coming off a disappointing season in which he scored only nine goals - including four empty-netters - and added 36 assists in 82 games. "I think it's a summer where everyone's trying to get better and everyone's trying to make a bounce-back year. To be part of that is awesome and we're all looking forward to that."
Here's some more of what Domi had to say when he spoke with the media Saturday:
On his earliest hockey memory:
"I took a hockey stick everywhere with me when I was a kid. Most kids would sleep with like teddy bears or bunnies or whatever. I slept with a hockey stick. I don't know how comfortable that would have been back in the day when they were wooden sticks, too. I'm sure it was like a senior TPS stick or something like that ... I don't know. Anyways, I took a stick everywhere I went and as soon as someone would walk in my front door in Mississauga, Ont., ... it doesn't matter who they were, how tall they were, how old they were, what gender they were, I was like: 'You're coming down and I'm shooting some tennis balls on you in the basement before you do anything. You're not allowed to go say hi to anyone, let's go play mini-sticks.' So I was pretty keen on opening that door. Anyways, that's kind of the memories that stick out most is just always wanting to play hockey every day that I was a kid. Obviously, school was a big part of that, but for me it was always I can't wait for practice to end and I can't wait for the game on Friday, Saturday, waking up at 6 in the morning and ultimately getting to play in the NHL one day. And now I'm living that, so it's pretty surreal."

On the big media scrum Saturday, something he didn't see in Arizona:
"Arizona was good. It's a great place to play ... it's a hidden gem. You can say whatever you want about the fan base there and the fact that we don't have these kind of media scrums there. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of good people in the (Coyotes) organization from top to bottom. Coaching staff, management, training staff and the fans, marketing people and all those people. They're awesome. They treat you like first class and just fun to be around. It's unfortunate that the last few years have gone the way that they went. But I'm excited that they brought me over here in Montreal and I wish that whole franchise nothing but the best. In a perfect world, I'd like to see us play against those guys in the Stanley Cup final. I wish them nothing but the best. I'm excited to take the right foot forward here and I'm a Montreal Canadien now, so that's all behind me."

On his meeting with Julien on Saturday:
"We didn't really get into the details. Just talked about what I was doing here, catching up on summer plans and training stuff and basically stuff in life. I talked to him a little bit on the phone, but that's the first time I met him in person. So pretty cool to see him and definitely excited to get to work with him."
On the current makeup of the Canadiens:
"The general manager's been a part of a some Stanley Cup teams and stuff. You've got a coach that's won a Stanley Cup. You got older guys like Shea Weber, whose been a guy that I've been looking up to before I even played in the NHL. You got the best goalie in the NHL (Carey Price). You got guys like Brendan Gallagher, you got Shawsy (Andrew Shaw), I mean the list really goes on with all the young kids coming up. Just to be a part of that and to fit in is pretty special. So huge honour. I'm really, really excited. I'm not really sure what kind of role I'll have, but whatever that is I'm going to try and do it to the best of my ability."
On growing up as the son of former NHL tough-guy Tie Domi:
"I definitely can't change my last name, that's for sure. But you know what, it's part of who I am and there's a lot of positives that come with that. I've got a lot of childhood experiences and memories that you can't make up. Getting to go to the Air Canada Centre, getting to call a guy like Mats Sundin someone like your uncle pretty much. He still sends me little workouts to do throughout the summer and even if I don't shoot the puck - I didn't shoot the puck that well last year - he's the first guy to text me. So just a relationship like that and me being able to see how my dad handled stuff like this. How he would kind of endure everything, all the ups and downs of an 82-game season. Sometimes, you're not playing great ... how do you get through that? It's the work ethic and really just doing whatever it takes to win. You know what, I focus on the positives of that and I don't know if I'd be where I am today without the help of him. A lot of learning's been going on between us. He's been out of the NHL for I don't know how many years (Tie retired following the 2005-06 season). I've been in the NHL for three and he still sends me texts after every game, kind of the same sort of thing as he did when I was in minor hockey. He's not really worried about the goals and the assists and the points. He's more worried about the discipline and the hard work and just being a good teammate and winning. That's all it's about and he's made that very clear since I was a kid. He's really ingrained that, so I take a lot of pride in listening to him."
On the possibility of getting his father - who spent most of his career with the Toronto Maple Leafs - to wear a Canadiens jersey:
"It's funny, we were just doing this thing for Twitter and someone asked that: 'Are we going to see your dad in a Habs jersey?' I answered it ... as if you know what, I'm going to try and get him to at least pose for a picture with one in the first game here in Montreal. You know what, if you would have told anyone in their right mind 5-10 years ago that Tie Domi was going to be a Montreal Canadiens fan they would have looked at you and laughed and said that's crazy. I'm his son and I'm playing for one of the most historic franchises in all of sports and he's the biggest Habs fan in the world now. So it's a reality. I'm super excited to be a part of it and he's just as pumped."

Full text: Max Domi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130519 ) couldn't wipe the smile off his face Saturday afternoon when he met with the media and tried on his new Canadiens No 13 jersey in the team's Brossard locker room.
"I'm super excited to be here," said the 5-foot-10, 195-pound left-winger who was acquired from the Arizona Coyotes earlier this month in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. "I haven't been able to stop smiling the whole time."
Domi was making a quick, 24-hour visit to Montreal to drop in on the Canadiens' evaluation camp and meet with general manager Marc Bergevin, coach Claude Julien and other members of the team's staff while also looking for a new place to live.
"I spoke with everyone, pretty much," said the 23-year-old Domi, who is coming off a disappointing season in which he scored only nine goals - including four empty-netters - and added 36 assists in 82 games. "I think it's a summer where everyone's trying to get better and everyone's trying to make a bounce-back year. To be part of that is awesome and we're all looking forward to that."
Here's some more of what Domi had to say when he spoke with the media Saturday:
On his earliest hockey memory:
"I took a hockey stick everywhere with me when I was a kid. Most kids would sleep with like teddy bears or bunnies or whatever. I slept with a hockey stick. I don't know how comfortable that would have been back in the day when they were wooden sticks, too. I'm sure it was like a senior TPS stick or something like that ... I don't know. Anyways, I took a stick everywhere I went and as soon as someone would walk in my front door in Mississauga, Ont., ... it doesn't matter who they were, how tall they were, how old they were, what gender they were, I was like: 'You're coming down and I'm shooting some tennis balls on you in the basement before you do anything. You're not allowed to go say hi to anyone, let's go play mini-sticks.' So I was pretty keen on opening that door. Anyways, that's kind of the memories that stick out most is just always wanting to play hockey every day that I was a kid. Obviously, school was a big part of that, but for me it was always I can't wait for practice to end and I can't wait for the game on Friday, Saturday, waking up at 6 in the morning and ultimately getting to play in the NHL one day. And now I'm living that, so it's pretty surreal."
On the big media scrum Saturday, something he didn't see in Arizona:
"Arizona was good. It's a great place to play ... it's a hidden gem. You can say whatever you want about the fan base there and the fact that we don't have these kind of media scrums there. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of good people in the (Coyotes) organization from top to bottom.

Full text: Pointe-Claire( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/news/eco-grazing-sheep-at-edgewater-park/ ) has found a natural way to trim the grass at Edgewater Park, located along Lake St-Louis near the Pointe-Claire Village( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-passes-planning-guidelines-for-village-district ).
Beginning Monday, the city will introduce six sheep to the park as part of an "eco-grazing project."
The project will run daily, from June 11 to July 20, between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.
The sheep will be allowed to graze in the park while in a temporary enclosure. "As they graze on grass, they will help maintain the park in a completely natural manner," the city said.
"We care about sustainable development, and this fun and educational initiative is part of our approach," said Mayor John Belvedere.
The public can buy feed for the sheep every Saturday for 25 cents.
"A shepherd will be at the park at all times to watch over the flock," the city said.
Pointe-Claire will also hold a series of educational activities at Edgewater Park( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claires-edgewater-park-gets-a ).
June 14: Knitting with sheep - all levels
June 21: Bilingual story hour, followed by a craft (ages 3 to 6)
June 28: Art creation for families
July 5: Family picnic, followed by a children's show (in French)

Full text: Pointe-Claire( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/news/eco-grazing-sheep-at-edgewater-park/ ) has found a natural way to trim the grass at Edgewater Park, located along Lake St-Louis near the Pointe-Claire Village( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-passes-planning-guidelines-for-village-district ).
Beginning Monday, the city will introduce six sheep to the park as part of an "eco-grazing project."
The project will run daily, from June 11 to July 20, between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.
The sheep will be allowed to graze in the park while in a temporary enclosure. "As they graze on grass, they will help maintain the park in a completely natural manner," the city said.
"We care about sustainable development, and this fun and educational initiative is part of our approach," said Mayor John Belvedere.
The public can buy feed for the sheep every Saturday for 25 cents.
"A shepherd will be at the park at all times to watch over the flock," the city said.
Pointe-Claire will also hold a series of educational activities at Edgewater Park( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claires-edgewater-park-gets-a ).
June 14: Knitting with sheep - all levels
June 21: Bilingual story hour, followed by a craft (ages 3 to 6)
June 28: Art creation for families
July 5: Family picnic, followed by a children's show (in French)
July 12 : Yoga with sheep - adults (bring your own yoga mat)
July 19: Shearing and spinning demonstration
In case of bad weather - rain, storms or even heat waves - the sheep will be placed in a shelter, and the outdoor activities will be moved to the NoÃ«l-Legault Community Centre, located at 245 Lakeshore Rd., in Pointe-Claire.

Montreal marathon director hopes to foster world-class event

Full text: Dominique PichÃ© sees a bright future for the Montreal marathon.
"We're an Olympic city and my goal is to build this race to the point where it's one of the top-10 marathons in the world," PichÃ© said after revealing details for the 2018 event at a news conference that featured appearances by Montreal Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante and a brass band.
"We would like to be in the same category as New York or Boston," said PichÃ©, who serves as the race director.
"We have a long way to go, but there's no reason why we can't be as big as Ottawa or Toronto."
One step toward that goal is to attract elite runners. PichÃ© has handed that task to Laurent Godbout, a former journalist who has also served as executive director of the of the Quebec Track and Field Federation.
"Our prize money is modest, only $50,000 total, but we have to start somewhere," said Godbout.
The men's and women's winners will each receive $5,000. The winners at last month's Boston Marathon each received US$150,000, while the New York winners collect US$100,000. Ottawa features the most lucrative Canadian race, with $40,000 to the winners.
The Sept. 23 race has been rebranded as MIMO - an acronym for Montreal International Marathon Oasis - and will feature a series of new courses with activities taking place around the Quartier des Spectacles.
PichÃ© said another goal of the event is community involvement and he's drawing on Montreal's reputation as a city of festivals.
"We envision this as Montreal's fall festival," said PichÃ©, who also directs the successful Ironman Triathlon at Mont-Tremblant. "We'll have music and other cultural events associated with the races. We want to encourage as many runners as possible to compete, but we also want to offer opportunities for non-runners to participate in the activities in the week leading up to the race.
"We'll have various events at Complexe Desjardins to promote fitness and a healthy lifestyle in the week leading up to the races and on Friday, people will have the opportunity to participate in the Montreal Marche Ã  Midi," said PichÃ©. "This will be a three-mile walk through the streets around the Quartier des Spectacles. Someday, I would like to see these walks spread to all the sectors of the city."
PichÃ© said he and his colleagues drew on the city's history when they laid out the course for the 42.32-kilometre marathon.
"We tried to highlight some of the most interesting neighbourhoods," said PichÃ©.
The runners will head west from Complexe Desjardins and weave their way through Chinatown and the Old Port before running along the Lachine Canal. They will return downtown on the same route and then embark on an eastbound out-and-back, which will include a loop though the Botanical Gardens.
"The course is good for the runners because they'll see the same streets going out and coming back, and they'll be able to plan how to pace themselves on the return," said Godbout.
There will be several other races in addition to the marathon. On Saturday, runners will be able to choose between five-kilometre and 10-kilometre races, and there will also be a one-kilometre race for kids.
For those not up for a full marathon, there will be a 21.1-kilometre half marathon on Sunday.
Last year's full marathon was cancelled because of a heat wave, which saw a high of 30 C and a humidex of 40 C on race day. phickey@postmedia.com Twitter.com/zababes1

A Cinco de Mayo celebration

Author: Chesterman, Lesley

Full text: Riding the wave of Mexican cuisine's new-found popularity, chef Carlos Flores and Edgar Banos, of the Montreal restaurant Emiliano's, aim to do things differently.
"Mexican cuisine can mean everything from street food to highend restaurants," says Flores, "but what we want to emphasize are quality ingredients."
And so they do, making tacos not only with fried fish or the traditional pulled pork (carnitas), but also with local lobster, duck and lamb, topped not only with the classic salsa but innovative condiments like cherry and serrano pepper marmalade.
Inquiring about their menu plans for Cinco de Mayo on May 5, they laugh a bit. "It has become such a Mexican restaurant clichÃ©," Flores says. Adds Banos: "It's a celebration, but it's not Mexican independence day, which is what a lot of people believe."
It marks Mexico's victory over the French army at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. "It's not like we won a war or anything. We just won one battle," Banos says. "And we were defeated the next day."
The dish most associated with the Puebla region is mole, the spiced chili sauce famous for including chocolate served over chicken, pork, turkey or eggs. Mole would be ideal, but recipes are lengthy. So here are some alternatives:
MANGO MARGARITA
Serves:
1 For the spiced sugar syrup:
1 cup (500 mL) water
1 cup (250 mL) granulated sugar pinch cloves
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1. Bring water and sugar to a boil. Add cloves, cinnamon, stir, remove from heat, and let cool.
2. Keep refrigerated
3. In a shaker with ice combine:
1 1/2 oz (45 mL) white tequila
1/2 oz (15 mL) lemon juice
1/2 oz (15 mL) spiced sugar syrup
1/2 oz (15 mL) mango purÃ©e
4. Shake over ice and pour into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Garnish with a slice of lime.
MESCAL MOJITO
This drink could be made with tequila, but it takes on a new dimension when made with mescal. Banos says, "the smokier the mescal, the better."
Serves: 1
1 1/2 oz (45 mL) mescal
1/2 oz (15 mL) fresh lime juice
5 mint leaves
1/4 lime wedge, sliced in half
Pomegranate juice
Sparkling water
1. Muddle the mescal, lime juice, mint and lime wedge together in a glass. Fill the glass with ice.
2. Pour over enough pomegranate juice to fill one quarter of the glass. Top with sparkling water.
3. Stir well and garnish with a slice of lemon and a mint sprig.
DUCK TACOS WITH APPLE POBLANO CHUTNEY
Chef Carlos Flores makes this unusual taco with duck breast, but you could also try it with lamb or even braised pork shoulder. This recipe consists of three preparations and then a final assembly of the taco plates. The chutney and salsa can be made a few hours in advance.
Serves: 4 (12 tacos)
1. Duck breasts
3 Pekin duck breasts, about 225 g (8 oz) each
Sea salt and pepper
1. Prepare the duck breasts: With a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck breasts in a criss-cross pattern without cutting too deeply into the fat, season with salt and pepper, then place in a dry, thick-bottomed pan, skin side down, and fry on medium heat (without touching) for 10 minutes. Turn the duck breasts over and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove the duck breasts from the pan, and place on a plate, skin-side up. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.
2. Pico de gallo (salsa)
2 medium sized tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 small white onion, diced
2 tbsp (30 mL) chopped cilantro
1 tsp (5 mL) minced jalapeno pepper
1 tbsp (15 mL) lime
1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
Sea salt to taste
1. In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and taste to adjust seasonings.
3. Apple and Poblano pepper chutney
1 large red cooking apple, such as Cortland, peeled, seeded and diced
1/2 cup (125 mL) sugar
1/2 cup (125 mL) water
1/2 poblano pepper, seeded, deveined, and diced
1 1/2 tbsp (375 mL) sherry vinegar
Pinch of salt
2. Place the apple, sugar and water in a small pot over medium-low heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the pepper, bring to a simmer, and cook until the apple is tender yet still holds its shape. When the sauce is thick and glossy, add the sherry vinegar, stir well and remove from heat. Add salt to taste and set aside to cool to room temperature.
4. Tacos and plate assembly
1 1/2 cups grated Cotija cheese (or substitute with Feta)
12 fresh corn tortillas, 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter
Chives to garnish
1. To assemble the plates: Warm the tortillas on a lightly oiled grill pan over medium-high heat to warm through (you want a few grill marks on them), then line up three on each plate.
2. Slice the duck breast into as thin slices as possible, and distribute the slices evenly in the middle of each taco. Top the duck slices with a small spoonful of chutney, followed by a spoonful of salsa. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top as well as a few chives to garnish. Serve immediately.
GUACAMOLE WITH CRAB AND ROASTED PINEAPPLE
Guacamole is a must at any Mexican feast. This one's dressed up with Canadian crabmeat and pineapple, which adds a lovely sweetness to this unctuous dip.
Serves: 4
1/2 cup (125 mL) diced golden pineapple
1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil Sea salt and pepper
3 large avocados
1/2 small white oniosn
2 Italian tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 bunch cilantro leaves, chopped fine
2 to 3 limes (depending on size)
1/3 cup (80 mL) mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought
1/4 jalapeno pepper
1 1/2 cups (375 mL) snow crabmeat
Tortilla chips (preferably unsalted) to serve
1. Preheat oven to 400 F (205 C). Place the pineapple on a baking sheet on parchment paper, toss with olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and roast for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.
2. Prepare the guacamole: Halve the avocados, remove the pit and slice the flesh into large cubes. Place the cubes in a bowl, and lightly mash about one third with a fork. Stir in the onion, tomato and juice of one lime (or two small limes). Season with salt and pepper and a bit more lime juice if needed. Set aside.
3. With a blender or hand blender, blend together the mayonnaise, jalapeno and juice of remaining lime until smooth, then gently fold it into the crabmeat, followed by the roasted pineapple and any accumulated juices on the paper. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Divide the guacamole over four plates and top with the crab mixture. Stick some chips into the guacamole and serve, with extra chips alongside.

The Week in Review: It was stupidly cold for April and still very busy

Abstract: Quebec sparred with the federal government over the handling of asylum seekers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-welcomes-ottawas-new-attitude-to-asylum-seeker-issue ) Early on Wednesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/come-here-and-look-after-it-quebec-demands-federal-help-with-asylum-seekers ), Premier Philippe Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Testimony at Alexandre Bissonnette's sentencing hearing was heard throughout the week( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-mosque-shooting )
On Monday, the court heard about Bissonnette's internet usage prior to the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-trawled-trumps-twitter-feed ). He was checking Donald Trump's Twitter feed every day. In the lead-up to the attack, he also checked the Twitter feeds of right-wing American commentators, as well as conspiracy theorists, and alt-right and white supremacist/neo-Nazi leaders. Aymen Derbali, who survived the attack but was paralyzed from the waist down, was the first to present a victim-impact statement( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-survivor-aymen-derbali-says-bissonnette-is-insincere ). Without looking at the killer, Derbali said he did not believe Bissonnette when he said last month he regretted the shooting. "He was just looking for compassion from the public," Derbali told Judge FranÃ§ois Huot. "Believe me, nothing is harder than telling little girls about the death of their father," Louiza Mohamed-Said, whose husband Abdelkrim Hassane died in the attack, told the court on Tuesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooter-looked-like-he-was-playing-a-video-game-survivor ). She said Bissonnette committed a hate crime aimed at terrifying the Muslim community.
29-year-old Megda Belkacemi was the first of the 17 children who lost their fathers in the shooting to speak at the the hearing.On Wednesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/daughter-of-quebec-mosque-shooting-victim-testifies-with-her-back-to-killer ), she explained that her father was a professor at a university in Algiers where the rector was killed by terrorists. After that, her parents quit their jobs and fled to Canada. Khaled Belkacemi, a 60-year-old food sciences professor at UniversitÃ© Laval was killed in the mosque. "The violence that my parents fled caught us," she said. "I have a deep fear for my security, the security of my family, my future children and of all society knowing" that Bisssonnette may one day be released, she told Justice Francois Huot. Earlier in the day, Ibrahim Bekkari Sbai, who was in the Quebec City mosque on Jan. 29, 2017, implied Bissonnette's father was partly responsible for the massacre, saying he "contributed to the education of a monster." Huot interjected and spent several minutes explaining that based on the evidence before him, there is nothing to back up Sbai's assertion. Huot said that Bissonnette's parents are, in his view, "collateral victims and I'm convinced they are suffering immensely," Zineb Soufiane, whose father, Azzeddine, died after tackling Alexandre Bissonnette during the shooting, testified on Thursday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-mosque-shooting-an-act-of-terrorism-community-leader-says ). "He was the best father. He was the best man," Zineb Soufiane, holding back tears, said Thursday. "He wanted to help everybody, Quebecers, whether they were Muslims or not."
The judge is to decide Bissonnette's prison sentence. The maximum punishment he could impose is life in prison without the possibility of parole for 150 years.
Quebec sparred with the federal government over the handling of asylum seekers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-welcomes-ottawas-new-attitude-to-asylum-seeker-issue )
Early on Wednesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/come-here-and-look-after-it-quebec-demands-federal-help-with-asylum-seekers ), Premier Philippe Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here. His immigration minister, David Heurtel, described the province's demand for $146 million for the care of asylum seekers who entered the country illegally at the Canada-U.S. border near the St-Bernard-de-Lacolle post as a starting part. The numbers of crossings have swelled in recent weeks and the province's 1,850 spots for asylum seekers are filling up. In a letter to Heurtel, federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen deplored the fact Quebec has only four temporary shelters up and running, while last summer it had opened 13, including making use of hotels, the former Royal Victoria Hospital and the Olympic Stadium. The letter, Couillard said, shows Ottawa is completely disconnected with what's happening in Quebec. Whereas last year's spike in crossings into Quebec was due to a temporary wave of Haitian asylum seekers fleeing the United States after Donald Trump said they were no longer welcome, the province says today's asylum seekers are coming from all over - including Nigeria and Asia - and 40 per cent don't want to stay in Quebec. "Quebec played a humanitarian role last year and is ready to do it again, but within its capacity to do so. My message to Ottawa is to say it's time to start working. You (Ottawa) have to play your role right now," Couillard said. On Thursday, Heurtel welcomed a "change in tone" from the federal government( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-welcomes-ottawas-new-attitude-to-asylum-seeker-issue ). He said Ottawa's attitude had shifted after Couillard blasted Ottawa and that the the federal government was no "listening and interested in concrete measures." That's a far cry from the attitude in March, when Ottawa said it had done enough to help Quebec, he said. At the same time, he said Quebec is not backing away from its plan to impose a ceiling on the number of arrivals it will accept in temporary shelters in the coming weeks: "We are maintaining our ceiling of 1,850 places in temporary housing centres because our resources remain limited. We are not going to open the Olympic Stadium."
Montreal's fire department is out of step with a diverse city, its management acknowledged( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/fire-department-still-mainly-male-and-white )
At present, there are just 29 female firefighters out of 2,360 (1.2 per cent), 24 visible minorities (one per cent) and five Indigenous people (0.2 per cent). The fire department plans to double those numbers in the next three years and triple them by 2025, city health and wellbeing director Suzanne Desjardins and fire chief Bruno Lachance announced at a meeting of the public security committee. Fo Niemi executive director of the Montreal-based Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations, said the plan has good intentions but lacks specifics. "Our biggest concerns are the lack of specifics when it comes to visible minorities and Indigenous people, and when it comes to the role of the union and equity group members inside the department in the design, implementation and evaluation of the plan as well as the department's annual performance," he said.
A Montreal family is fighting to keep Babe, its pet pig, at home( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/family-fights-to-keep-pot-bellied-pet-in-montreal )
Sara-Maude Ravenelle and her husband say Babe is the ideal companion - he's affectionate, gets along with their cats and their 10-month-old daughter, doesn't bark or bite and he does his "business" outside like a dog would. When she adopted the pig, her family lived in Rosemont-La Petite Patrie and they petitioned the borough mayor for permission to keep Babe as a domesticated animal. The mayor - FranÃ§ois William Croteau - wrote Ravenelle a letter in 2015 confirming that there were no municipal bylaws preventing her from keeping Babe. But things changed the following year after the administration of Montreal mayor Denis Coderre drafted a list of animals that citizens are permitted to keep in their home. Pot-bellied pigs did not make the cut. The animal list was part of the municipal reforms adopted alongside Coderre's infamous pit-bull ban. But after Coderre lost his bid for re-election last year, the ban was lifted by new Mayor ValÃ©rie Plante. However, the animal list hasn't been updated since. After Ravenelle's neighbour lodged a complaint with the borough Tuesday, an inspector came by her home and issued Ravenelle a formal warning to get rid of the 60-pound pig. Montreal mayor ValÃ©rie Plante said the situation showed why it was necessary to revise the city's animal bylaw and that she'd been talking with the borough mayor, Pierre Lessard-Blais, who is discussing the situation with Ravanelle. "We're confident we're going to find some kind of a compromise," Plante added.
The first-ever medical marijuana dispensary in the Kanesatake Mohawk territory( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/marijuana-dispensary-on-mohawk-territory )
The dispensary is, strictly speaking, illegal. But puts founder Clifton Ariwakehte Nicholas at odds with the provincial police who patrol Kanesatake and Grand Chief Serge Simon, who insists he won't allow a dispensary on the Mohawk settlement without community consultations. "I'm ready to face whatever is coming my way," Nicholas told the Montreal Gazette. "I believe in my right to health, my right to exist and to prosper in my land. (Cannabis) is an important medicine, but that's a side issue. The real issue is rights." Legislation by the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to legalize a recreational cannabis market is expected to come into effect this summer. Nicholas's business is decidedly not a part of that system. Like most Mohawk traditionalists, Nicholas doesn't recognize the federal government's authority over Kanesatake - a 12-square-kilometre parcel of land on the mouth of the Ottawa River. Nicholas knows there's a real risk his dispensary will be raided and he'll see his life savings go up in smoke. But the upside, he says, is worth it. "I've been poor my whole life. In my early childhood, there were 12 of us in a three-bedroom house growing up. My mother scrubbed toilets in Westmount to keep food on our table. At some point, shouldn't we have the right to lift ourselves out of a bad situation?"

Ottawa vows to work with Quebec on refugee crisis; 'Our system is stretched and can't be stretched any more': Couillard

Abstract: Earlier in the day, Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here. Just a few hours before he headed to Ottawa for the talks on the crisis, Heurtel repeated Ottawa has failed to realize the number of asylum seekers this year has already tripled to 6,074 from about 2,000 during the same period in 2017. Over the last few days, Legault has called on the government to put a lid on the number of asylum seekers it accepts. Since Quebec's population is roughly 23 per cent of Canada's population, the number it accepts should be 23 per cent of the total, he says.

Full text: After Premier Philippe Couillard blasted Ottawa on the issue of asylum seekers Wednesday morning, the tone of the debate became much more conciliatory at night.
Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen and Quebec Immigration Minister David Heurtel arrived together in Ottawa for a meeting of the working group formed in August to deal with the refugee crisis.
"The federal government recognizes Quebec has had a lot on its shoulders in the last nine months with the majority of irregular migrants who have come to the province," Garneau said.
"Already, we feel the tone is changing and there is a real willingness to work with Quebec to find concrete solutions and this is the purpose of the meeting today," Heurtel added.
Neither would indicate whether the softened tone meant extra federal money would be heading to the province.
Quebec is demanding $146 million for the care of asylum seekers who entered the country illegally at the Canada-U.S. border near the St-Bernard-de-Lacolle post.
Earlier in the day, Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here.
Couillard reminded the Trudeau government that managing borders is essentially a federal responsibility and centres harbouring asylum seekers will soon be filled to capacity, which is Ottawa's problem, not Quebec's.
"The question was: What are you going to do when the limit is reached?" Couillard told reporters.
"It's not for me to answer.
Asylum seekers are totally a federal jurisdiction. The answer should be coming from them.
"People in Ottawa need to realize our system is stretched and cannot be stretched any more.
"We can't have this (influx) year after year, after year. The system is going to bust. That's real life, that's the reality."
Couillard, who was flanked by Heurtel, was referring to Ottawa's response to Quebec's request for more aid and more screening of asylum seekers crossing the border from New York at Roxham Rd. near Hemmingford.
Over the last few weeks, the numbers have dramatically increased, with Quebec announcing the province's 1,850 spots for asylum seekers in four locations are rapidly filling up.
More than 70 per cent of spots are filled; once that hits 85 per cent, Quebec says it will no longer place anyone crossing the border illegally.
But in a letter to Heurtel, Hussen instead deplores the fact Quebec has only four temporary shelters up and running, while last summer it had opened 13, including making use of hotels, the former Royal Victoria Hospital and the Olympic Stadium.
Hussen said the situation risks causing delays at the border and an "unacceptable humanitarian situation."
The letter, Couillard said, shows Ottawa is completely disconnected with what's happening in Quebec.
"It's time the federal government came to Quebec and looked after this," Couillard told reporters.
"We are extremely dissatisfied, this response is not acceptable.
"It shows a complete lack of understanding of what is happening in the field and what Quebec experienced last year.
"Quebec played a humanitarian role last year and is ready to do it again, but within its capacity to do so. My message to Ottawa is to say it's time to start working. You (Ottawa) have to play your role right now.
"The issue of asylum seekers is strictly federal. Let the federal government come here and look after it."
Just a few hours before he headed to Ottawa for the talks on the crisis, Heurtel repeated Ottawa has failed to realize the number of asylum seekers this year has already tripled to 6,074 from about 2,000 during the same period in 2017.
The situation is completely different from last year when Quebec responded to what was a temporary wave of Haitian asylum seekers fleeing the United States after U.S. president Donald Trump said they were no longer welcome, he said.
Today's asylum seekers are coming from all over, including Nigeria and Asia.
It is estimated 40 per cent don't want to stay in Quebec.
Heurtel said projections suggest there will be up to 400 crossings a day this summer, compared with 250 in 2017.
"What we are seeing is a new phenomenon and we have to react differently," said Heurtel noting none of the shelters used in 2017 were designed as long term housing for asylum seekers.
He repeated Ottawa needs to get more involved and ensure and better distribution of the new arrivals across the county because Quebec has hit its limit.
He said the issue isn't necessarily one of money but of real practical problems of capacity.
As an example, since the wave started last year Quebec has received about 2,500 children and they all needed access to the education system. That is the equivalent of five new elementary schools in Montreal.
Hussen, however, has responded saying Quebec already got $490.2 million - $112 million more than last year - to offer services to immigrants.
Quebec maintains its request is for additional funds to cover $146 million in unprecedented expenses from last year's influx.
Quebec's opposition parties, however, have stepped up the pressure on the Couillard government to act with Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec Leader FranÃ§ois Legault highlighting the fact Ottawa has not yet received a detailed invoice from Quebec for the $146 million.
Over the last few days, Legault has called on the government to put a lid on the number of asylum seekers it accepts.
Since Quebec's population is roughly 23 per cent of Canada's population, the number it accepts should be 23 per cent of the total, he says.
In 2017, Quebec received 50 per cent of the asylum seekers who had come to Canada, apparently because Roxham Road has taken on an international reputation as an easy way in.
The CAQ, which is also on the record as wanting fewer legal immigrants, does not spell out how the people are to be distributed in the rest of Canada but notes many were bused to Cornwall last year. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier Presse Canadienne contributed to this report.

Full text: OTTAWA - The federal government has agreed to review Quebec's claim for reimbursement of refugee claimants and is promising to take measures to ease the province's burden.
"We will work on the numbers together and we will find common ground," federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau said after Wednesday night's meeting of the task force on irregular migration, which was launched in August to deal with the crisis.
Ottawa has agreed to put in place a triage process for asylum seekers at the border to find out which province they want to go to. Those who do not wish to stay in Montreal will, depending on their skills, be directed to other areas of Quebec where there are labour shortages. The granting of their work permit will be accelerated so they can find a job as quickly as possible and pay for their living expenses.
Garneau also indicated that $74 million of the $173 million allocated in the last federal budget to manage irregular arrivals at the border will be used to speed up the processing of refugee claims by the Immigration and Refugee Board.
"This is a step in the right direction," said the Quebec Minister of Immigration David Heurtel. "The tone has changed. Already, there is more openness on the part of the federal government."
Heurtel expects to receive a cheque at the end of the exercise. "At one time it seemed like a completely closed door," he added. "What we have is a working group that is starting to work now. The federal experts will sit down with our experts, we will talk about cost breakdown. "
What had been an angry tone between Quebec and Ottawa softened before the meeting.
"The federal government recognizes very well that Quebec has had a lot on its shoulders in the last nine months with the majority of irregular migrants who have come to the province," Garneau said.
Quebec is demanding $146 million for the care of asylum seekers who entered the country illegally at the Canada-U.S. border near the St-Bernard-de-Lacolle post. This is a starting point, Heurtel said.
Earlier in the day, Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here.
Couillard reminded the Trudeau government that managing borders is essentially a federal responsibility and centres harbouring asylum seekers will soon be filled to capacity, which is Ottawa's problem, not Quebec's.

Full text: QUEBEC - After Premier Philippe Couillard blasted Ottawa on the issue of asylum seekers Wednesday morning, the tone of the debate became much more conciliatory at night.
Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen and Quebec Immigration Minister David Heurtel arrived together for a meeting in Ottawa to discuss the refugee crisis that is ramping up again in la belle province.
"The federal government recognizes that Quebec has had a lot on its shoulders in the last nine months with the majority of irregular migrants who have come to the province," Garneau said.
"Already, we feel the tone is changing and there is a real willingness to work with Quebec to find concrete solutions and this is the purpose of the meeting today," Heurtel added.
Neither would indicate whether the softened tone meant extra federal money would be heading to the province.
Quebec is demanding $146 million for the care of asylum seekers who entered the country illegally at the Canada-U.S. border near the St-Bernard-de-Lacolle post.
Earlier in the day, Couillard insisted front-line services are at a breaking point and turned up the heat by demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here.
Couillard reminded the Trudeau government that managing borders is essentially a federal responsibility and centres harbouring asylum seekers will soon be filled to capacity, which is Ottawa's problem, not Quebec's.
"The question was: What are you going to do when the limit is reached?" Couillard told reporters. "It's not for me to answer. Asylum seekers are totally a federal jurisdiction. The answer should be coming from them.
"People in Ottawa need to realize our system is stretched and cannot be stretched any more. We can't have this (influx) year after year, after year. The system is going to bust. That's real life, that's the reality."
Couillard, who was flanked by Heurtel, was referring to Ottawa's response to Quebec's request for more aid and more screening of asylum seekers crossing the border from New York at Roxham Rd. near Hemmingford.
Over the last few weeks, the numbers have dramatically increased, with Quebec announcing the province's 1,850 spots for asylum seekers in four locations are rapidly filling up.
More than 70 per cent of spots are filled; once that hits 85 per cent, Quebec says it will no longer place anyone crossing the border illegally.
But in a letter to Heurtel, Hussen instead deplores the fact Quebec has only four temporary shelters up and running, while last summer it had opened 13, including making use of hotels, the former Royal Victoria Hospital and the Olympic Stadium.
Hussen said the situation risks causing delays at the border and an "unacceptable humanitarian situation."
The letter, Couillard said, shows Ottawa is completely disconnected with what's happening in Quebec.
"It's time the federal government came to Quebec and looked after this," Couillard told reporters. "We are extremely dissatisfied, this response is not acceptable.
"It shows a complete lack of understanding of what is happening in the field and what Quebec experienced last year( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/increase-in-asylum-seekers-at-border-in-december-as-2017-sets-record-for-claims ).
"Quebec played a humanitarian role last year and is ready to do it again, but within its capacity to do so. My message to Ottawa is to say it's time to start working. You (Ottawa) have to play your role right now.
"The issue of asylum seekers is strictly federal. Let the federal government come here and look after it."
RCMP officers help a group of asylum seekers who had crossed into Canada illegally at Roxham Rd., near Hemmingford Feb. 20, 2017.
Just a few hours before he headed to Ottawa for the talks on the crisis, Heurtel repeated Ottawa has failed to realize the number of asylum seekers this year has already tripled to 6,074 from about 2,000 during the same period in 2017.
Up to 400 crossings a day expected
The situation is completely different from last year when Quebec responded to what was a temporary wave of Haitian asylum seekers fleeing( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/influx-of-haitian-refugees-taxes-quebec-shelters-immigration-minister-says ) the United States after U.S. president Donald Trump said they were no longer welcome, he said.
Today's asylum seekers are coming from all over, including Nigeria and Asia. It is estimated 40 per cent don't want to stay in Quebec.
Heurtel said projections suggest there will be up to 400 crossings a day this summer, compared with 250 in 2017.
"What we are seeing is a new phenomenon and we have to react differently," said Heurtel noting none of the shelters used in 2017 were designed as long term housing for asylum seekers.
He repeated Ottawa needs to get more involved and ensure and better distribution of the new arrivals across the county because Quebec has hit its limit( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weve-reached-our-limit-to-house-undocumented-asylum-seekers-quebec-says ).
He said the issue isn't necessarily one of money but of real practical problems of capacity.
As an example, since the wave started last year Quebec has received about 2,500 children and they all needed access to the education system( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-schools-preparing-for-hundreds-of-asylum-seekers ). That is the equivalent of five new elementary schools in Montreal.
Hussen, however, has responded saying Quebec already got $490.2 million - $112 million more than last year - to offer services to immigrants.
Quebec maintains its request is for additional funds to cover $146 million in unprecedented expenses from last year's influx.
Quebec's opposition parties, however, have stepped up the pressure on the Couillard government to act with Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec Leader FranÃ§ois Legault highlighting the fact Ottawa has not yet received a detailed invoice from Quebec for the $146 million.
Over the last few days, Legault has called on the government to put a lid on the number of asylum seekers it accepts. Since Quebec's population is roughly 23 per cent of Canada's population, the number it accepts should be 23 per cent of the total, he says.
In 2017, Quebec received 50 per cent of the asylum seekers who had come to Canada, apparently because Roxham Road has taken on an international reputation as an easy way in.
The CAQ, which is also on the record as wanting fewer legal immigrants, does not spell out how the people are to be distributed in the rest of Canada but notes many were bused to Cornwall last year.

Full text: QUEBEC - Front-line services are at the breaking point, Premier Philippe Couillard says, turning up the heat and demanding Ottawa help manage asylum seekers landing here.
Couillard reminded the Trudeau government that managing borders is essentially a federal responsibility and that centres harbouring asylum seekers will soon be filled to capacity, which is Ottawa's problem, not Quebec's.
"The question was: What are you going to do when the limit is reached?" Couillard told reporters. "It's not for me to answer. Asylum seekers are totally a federal jurisdiction. The answer should be coming from them.
"People in Ottawa need to realize our system is stretched and cannot be stretched any more. We can't have this (influx) year after year, after year. The system is going to bust. That's real life, that's the reality."
Couillard, who was flanked by Immigration Minister David Heurtel, was referring to Ottawa's response to Quebec's request for more aid and more screening of asylum seekers crossing the border from New York at Roxham Road near Hemmingford.
Over the last few weeks, the numbers have dramatically increased, with Quebec announcing the province's 1,850 spots for asylum seekers in four locations are rapidly filling up.
More than 70 per cent of spots are filled; once that hits 85 per cent, Quebec says it will no longer place anyone crossing the border illegally.
But in a letter to Heurtel, federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen instead deplores the fact Quebec has only four temporary shelters up and running, while last summer it had opened 13, including making use of hotels, the former Royal Victoria Hospital and the Olympic Stadium.
Hussen said the situation risks causing delays at the border and an "unacceptable humanitarian situation."
The letter, Couillard said, shows Ottawa is completely disconnected with what's happening in Quebec.
"It's time the federal government came to Quebec and looked after this," Couillard told reporters. "We are extremely dissatisfied, this response is not acceptable.
"It shows a complete lack of understanding of what is happening in the field and what Quebec experienced last year( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/increase-in-asylum-seekers-at-border-in-december-as-2017-sets-record-for-claims ).
"Quebec played a humanitarian role last year and is ready to do it again, but within its capacity to do so. My message to Ottawa is to say it's time to start working. You (Ottawa) have to play your role right now.
"The issue of asylum seekers is strictly federal. Let the federal government come here and look after it."
RCMP officers help a group of asylum seekers who had crossed into Canada illegally at Roxham Rd., near Hemmingford Feb. 20, 2017.
Just a few hours before he headed to Ottawa for talks on the crisis, Heurtel repeated Ottawa has failed to realize the number of asylum seekers this year has already tripled to 6,074 from about 2,000 during the same period in 2017.
Up to 400 crossings a day expected
The situation is completely different from last year when Quebec responded to what was a temporary wave of Haitian asylum seekers fleeing( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/influx-of-haitian-refugees-taxes-quebec-shelters-immigration-minister-says ) the United States after U.S. president Donald Trump said they were no longer welcome, he said.
Today's asylum seekers are coming from all over, including Nigeria and Asia. It is estimated 40 per cent don't want to stay in Quebec.
Heutel said projections suggest there will be up to 400 crossings a day this summer, compared with 250 in 2017.
"What we are seeing is a new phenomenon and we have to react differently," said Heurtel noting none of the shelters used in 2017 were designed as long term housing for asylum seekers.
He repeated Ottawa needs to get more involved and ensure and better distribution of the new arrivals across the county because Quebec has hit its limit( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weve-reached-our-limit-to-house-undocumented-asylum-seekers-quebec-says ).
He said the issue isn't necessarily one of money but of real practical problems of capacity.
As an example, since the wave started last year Quebec has received about 2,500 children and they all needed access to the education system( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-schools-preparing-for-hundreds-of-asylum-seekers ). That is the equivalent of five new elementary schools in Montreal.
Hussen, however, has responded saying Quebec already got $490.2 million - $112 million more than last year - to offer services to immigrants.
Quebec maintains its request is for additional funds to cover $146 million in unprecedented expenses from last year's influx.
Quebec's opposition parties, however, have stepped up the pressure on the Couillard government to act with Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec leader FranÃ§ois Legault highlighting the fact Ottawa has not yet received a detailed invoice from Quebec for the $146 million.
Over the last few days, Legault has called on the government to put a lid on the number of asylum seekers it accepts. Since Quebec's population is roughly 23 per cent of Canada's population, the number it accepts should be 23 per cent of the total, he says.
In 2017, Quebec received 50 per cent of the asylum seekers who had come to Canada, apparently because Roxham Road has taken on an international reputation as an easy way in.
The CAQ, which is also on the record as wanting fewer legal immigrants, does not spell out how the people are to be distributed in the rest of Canada but notes many were bused to Cornwall last year.

Full text: It's not difficult to pinpoint the exact moment when the International Olympic Committee took the disastrous wrong turn that led directly to the current mess in Pyeongchang.
The Pyeongchang games were irrevocably tainted before they began, tainted by the very visible presence of Team Russia. The same Russian team that was guilty of massive, state-sponsored doping at Sochi four years ago: the biggest single doping scandal in Olympic history.
All this began almost 17 years ago, at an IOC session in Moscow during a steamy week in July of 2001. The Russian capital was in the throes of a brutal heat wave that summer, with temperatures hovering around 38 or 39 degrees and Russian air conditioning simply not up to the task.
First, the IOC delegates bypassed Toronto to award the 2008 Summer Games to Beijing, ignoring the fact that China is a totalitarian state with an abysmal record on human rights. Then they chose the affable nonentity Jacques Rogge to succeed Juan Antonio Samaranch as president of the IOC over the blunt-spoken, enormously competent Richard Pound of Montreal.
Given two six-year terms as president, Pound might have cleaned up the Olympic movement and done away with doping and bribery for once and for all. He wasn't given the chance and now we see the result: the farcical presence of the team called "Olympic Athletes from Russia" in Pyeongchang.
Abetted by the inexplicable blundering of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the IOC has enabled future dictators to force their athletes to turn themselves into walking lab experiments, knowing that the consequences will be no more than a slap on the wrist. Different uniforms, same team, same boss: Vladimir Putin. Put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig.
Pound, an Olympic freestyle swimmer at the Rome Olympics in 1960 and a full-time tax lawyer who accomplishes more in a morning than most people do in a year, should have won the IOC presidency in 2001. But in the wake of the bidding and bribery scandal surrounding the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, Pound was handed the unenviable task of "cleansing the Augean stables," as he put it. He wielded a big broom and IOC members did not appreciate it.
When the final ballot came, Rogge won 59 votes, Korea's Kim Un-Yong (who had been linked to offers of financial incentives to voting members) 23 and Pound only 22.
It was a bitter defeat for Pound: Not so much because of the victory for Rogge, who had the backing of the massive European bloc, but because Pound had finished behind the Korean despite the vote-buying scandal.
Rogge would remain as IOC president for 12 years, during which his most notable accomplishment was to ditch the organization's imperial style in favour of a more egalitarian presence. But Rogge the diplomat was not the one to tackle the twin problems of bribery and doping head-on.
Next to his successor Thomas Bach, however, Rogge was a model of courage and determination. With full knowledge of the extent of Russian doping at Sochi, Bach folded before the Rio Games, and he did it again before Pyeongchang - then tried to make up for it with a few pointless words in his speech at the opening ceremony.
At the IOC session before the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, only the blunt, plain-spoken Pound has stood up to Bach and the jelly-spined IOC.
"I believe that in the collective mind of a significant portion of the world, and among the athletes of the world, the IOC has not only failed to protect athletes, but has made it possible for cheating athletes to prevail against the clean athletes," Pound said.
"We talk more than we walk.
The athletes and the public at large ... no longer have confidence that their interests are being protected. Our commitment to both is in serious doubt."
Worse, as Pound pointed out, the IOC hung the whistleblowers who exposed the Russian misdeeds out to dry. This in Putin's Russia, where those who displease the dictator can end up dead.
All in all, a disgraceful performance. Had Pound been elected president, you have to believe that all this might have been prevented. We'll never know. All we know is that Pound would have gone after corruption and doping with a wide broom and that he alone would have had the courage to stand up to Putin.
This is not about the handful of Russian athletes who may actually be clean.
I have enormous sympathy for the Russian people and Russian athletes - but the best way to protect them in the future would have been an outright ban.
A slap on the wrist is not the way to get the attention of the man who rigs American elections and turns his friends into billionaires with impunity: Forcing the Russians to stay home might finally have gotten his attention.
But because the IOC got it so terribly wrong in Moscow in the summer of 2001, the entire Olympic movement has been left to the mercy of the cheaters - and men like Vladimir Putin have no mercy. jacktodd46@yahoo.com twitter.com/jacktodd46

Abstract: Beyond counting steps, the latest devices use embedded sensors to track calories burned, distance and speed travelled, heart rate, sleep habits and much more. Offering real time feedback on the amount of physical activity performed daily, these wearable devices boast of keeping a pulse on your lifestyle. The quality of your sleep, the peaks and valleys of your heart rate and your activity profile can provide a basic picture of your overall health and lifestyle, which to date has been shared with few beyond personal physicians.

Full text: If there was a fitness tracker under the tree with your name on it, you're in good company. It's estimated that one in six consumers (in the U.S.) currently use wearable technology (smartwatches and fitness bands) and the number of units sold in 2017 were projected to ring in at 19 million. Yet despite the boom in sales, there's little research suggesting a matching boom in exercise activity.
Designed to monitor physical activity, fitness trackers have come a long way from the first generation of mass marketed pedometers that clipped to a waistband. Beyond counting steps, the latest devices use embedded sensors to track calories burned, distance and speed travelled, heart rate, sleep habits and much more. But their biggest selling feature is the belief that they'll lead to a healthier, more active lifestyle.
Offering real time feedback on the amount of physical activity performed daily, these wearable devices boast of keeping a pulse on your lifestyle. The feedback comes in a variety of formats with most models delivering a scrolling list of stats, displayed on a compact screen attached to a wristband, along with gentle reminders to get up and move, as well as the ability to set activity goals.
Based on the premise that all movement counts, the first wave of fitness trackers translated all activity into a step count, playing on the popular belief that 10,000 steps a day leads to better overall health. Everything was tallied - climbing stairs, pacing around the office, workouts at the gym, with early adapters tending to be already active individuals interested in quantifying their exercise habits.
Yet those initial models left a lot to be desired in terms of design, esthetics, comfort and user experience. Battery life was poor and there were persistent questions about their accuracy. They also failed to deliver the type of sophisticated stats that performance-based athletes (runners, cyclists, swimmers) were looking for. So despite lots of interest in the potential of fitness trackers to increase physical activity, they were often abandoned within weeks or months of purchase.
Designed to monitor physical activity, fitness trackers have come a long way from the first generation of mass marketed pedometers that clipped to a waistband. These were among the offerings in 2014: from left, Basis Peak, Adidas Fit Smart, Fitbit Charge, Sony SmartBand, and Jawbone Move.
The addition of a GPS and heart-rate monitor added to the devices' appeal, offering a more comprehensive selection of stats. Run, cycle, swim and gym workouts were now quantified and incorporated into the day's activities allowing users to get a fuller picture of their exercise habits. Wearables were getting smarter and sleeker. Consumers could now purchase a single piece of technology to tell time, monitor daily activity and workouts, receive phone alerts and play music.
But it's not just the ability to track physical activity that has put fitness trackers on so many wrists. The capacity to go from making users accountable only to themselves to sharing their activity through social networks has added yet another layer to the user experience. Building active communities that compete in friendly exercise challenges fosters positive peer pressure. Plus the addition of gentle reminders when daily activity is low, rewards and encouragement when activity is high keeps goals in sight.
Yet despite all that fitness trackers/wearables have to offer, a recent study reported that 30 per cent of users stop wearing their devices after six months and 50 per cent eventually stop using theirs altogether. Some feel unwanted pressure to reach daily targets and end up removing the device if they underachieve. Others don't like feeling as though the device is controlling their lives. And some find the information a repetitive reminder of their daily routine.
Ultimately, compliance is based on the belief that fitness trackers will lead to a healthier lifestyle. But to date, there's little evidence to prove they're effective. Anecdotally, consumers report being initially motivated to raise their step count and daily activity, pleased to see their stats improve. But over the long haul, do fitness trackers motivate people to move more, sleep better and live a healthier life? And while manufacturers are striving to make the devices do more, there are words of caution about the privacy of the information gathered.
Insurance companies and some employers have been known to offer incentives to those who maintain a healthy level of activity as reported by their fitness tracker. Most units store your personal information in the cloud, which makes it easy to share. But there are questions about the security of the data and what else employers and insurance companies will do with the information. The quality of your sleep, the peaks and valleys of your heart rate and your activity profile can provide a basic picture of your overall health and lifestyle, which to date has been shared with few beyond personal physicians.
Then there's the question about the accuracy of the data. The rush to join the competitive wearable tech market has caused manufacturers to push their product out at a rate that calls to question their reliability. Who evaluates whether the information that appears on your fitness tracker is a fair representative of your heat rate, number of calories burned, distance travelled, steps taken and stairs climbed? The data varies considerably between the various models on the market.
Does all of this mean your new gadget is a waste of money? Not at all. Fitness trackers are a tool designed to bridge the gap between how much exercise you think you're doing and how much you're really doing. They also try to be that gentle push so many people need to get moving. But at the end of the day, the real work still needs to be done by the wearer not the wearable.

Palestinian leaders are calling for protests over Trump's Jerusalem decision
President Donald Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinian leaders condemned the move, arguing it had undermined any hope for a two-state solution, and Hamas called for an uprising. Saeb Erekat, a leading Palestinian negotiator, said the policy change has "disqualified the United States of America to play any role in the peace process." Palestinian leaders have called for "three days of rage," and Israel's military is looking at closing streets in central Jerusalem.
Palestinians consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the Six-Day War in 1967, the capital of their future state. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated Canada's long-standing stance that Ottawa will not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, though he refrained from saying anything that could be implied as criticizing Mr. Trump for the controversial move.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, praised Trump's move, saying "there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel." Go here for a primer on the competing claims over the historic city and Trump's divisive answer.
Our editorial board argues that Trump should have consulted the wisdom of his own book before making his decision: "The Art of the Deal's second commandment is this: "Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself." Not a bad piece of advice. But President Trump's announcement on Wednesday did the exact opposite. His move has obvious and potentially catastrophic downsides for the Middle East, and America's standing in the region. It antagonizes Arab allies, weakens Arab moderates, fuels radicals who will celebrate it as proof that the U.S. is the enemy of Palestinians and Muslims, and breaks with the rest of the international community. And the upside? There is none - except possibly for the President's popularity with some voters in Middle America."
The Senate ethics watchdog is investigating a China trip by three Tory senators
Senators Victor Oh, Don Plett and Leo Housakos travelled to China in April of this year, but did not disclose the trip It as either sponsored travel or a gift. Chinese media reported that the three senators visited at the invitation of Beijing-based Pantheon Asset, a Chinese firm involved in the management of "high-net-worth families." Pantheon recently opened a Vancouver office. Housakos's office initially said the trip was partly paid for by China and a Canadian-based trade group. But Oh later said he didn't see a need to declare the trip since his "family" had paid for all the senators' expenses. Oh said the trip was to visit his ancestral home.
A Somali man has been found guilty in the kidnapping of Amanda Lindhout
Ali Omar Ader could face life in prison when he is sentenced next year. The guilty verdict brings to a close an ordeal that started in 2008, when the Alberta-born Lindhout, working as a freelance journalist, was kidnapped near Mogadishu along with an Australian photographer. They were held captive for 15 months, only released after a ransom payment. Ader was accused of working with the kidnappers as a negotiator and translator.
An RCMP officer posing as a business agent lured Ader to Canada in 2015 with the promise of a book deal. Instead, he was arrested. The case against Ader was a landmark in Canadian law, with police charging him for an act committed abroad.
First Nations leaders want to control cannabis sales in their communities
Chiefs say they want the right to govern the sale and distribution of marijuana and to set the laws that will oversee its use by their people. The federal government has pledged to legalize marijuana by July of next year. Ottawa is letting each province determine rules around distribution and the minimum age of consumption. But First Nations leaders say they may want to diverge from provincial rules.
Meanwhile, some Ontario mayors say they don't want marijuana retail shops
"We have taken a stance of: We are not a willing host," Richmond Hill Mayor Dave Barrow said. The town's council will hold a vote on the matter next week. The mayors of Markham and Vaughan have also expressed concerns over the Ontario government's plan to open 40 cannabis outlets by July of next year. Municipalities opposed to physical shops won't be forced to accommodate one in the first wave of openings.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Montreal's police chief has been suspended
Chief Philippe Pichet failed to rein in turmoil and corruption on the force, Quebec's Public Security Minister Martin Coiteaux said. The decision to suspend Pichet follows a 96 page-report that Coiteaux described as "devastating." It outlines botched investigations, favouritism and cover-ups. Roughly 20 cases were found to have been mishandled, including a sexual-assault allegation against an investigator. The government has appointed the head of the provincial force as interim leader of the Montreal police. He'll be tasked with cleaning up the corruption until a new chief is found.
MORNING MARKETS
The greenback rose to its highest level in two weeks on Thursday over optimism the United States would successfully push through tax reforms, while world shares rebounded after two straight days of losses. Tokyo's Nikkei gained 1.5 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.3 per cent, though the Shanghai composite lost 0.8 per cent. In Europe, London's FTSE, Germany's DAX and the Paris CAC 40 were up by between 0.2 and 0.6 per cent by about 5:30 a.m. ET. New York futures were also up. The Canadian dollar was down to about the 78-cent (U.S.) mark. Oil rose in a sign that investors are wary of pushing the market lower in response to an unexpectedly large rise in U.S. stocks of refined products.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Imagining movies - and the world - without sexual predators
Since its inception, those who ran the American film industry decreed that the stories that matter are about sexy women and tough men. Anyone who didn't fit that mould or tried to protest was told, or forced, to be quiet. Until now. ... Advocates are often criticized for having complaints without solutions, but it's hard to imagine a world without misogyny and violence when we live on earth as it exists now. These ills are so pervasive that surmounting them requires a high, steep climb, and no one knows what's on the other side. Perhaps it's fitting that the film industry lead the way - we're ready for stories that show us who we really are and who we could eventually be." -
There's more to Rogers' ownership of the Blue Jays than money
"For the Rogers family, non-core assets such as the Jays and the Cogeco stake seem to resemble a child's treasured piggy bank: Cash that can be accessed if needed, but only by breaking something with sentimental value. Rogers was built with debt and has weathered financial storms. The company is in better financial shape now than at any point in its history. [Rogers CEO Joe] Natale has the luxury of time as he decides what to do with non-core assets. There's a solid financial case for selling sports teams and the Cogeco stake. But marketing strategies and family sentiment will drive Rogers's final decision on these assets." -
HEALTH PRIMER
Must-have foods for a nutrition-minded pantry
Stocking your kitchen with a good mix of everything from cooking oils to nut butters to canned foods is essential for being able to whip up a quick and nutritious meal. When it comes to oils, extra virgin olive oil is great for salad dressings, while canola and grapeseed can be used cooking. Peanut, almond and tahini are a few nut and seed butters great for snacks, smoothies and dips. For canned foods, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, beans and tuna are a few choice options. Go here for more tips on dried fruit, breakfast cereals, pasta and spices.
MOMENT IN TIME
Bakelite is patented
Dec. 7, 1909: If you had to pick a date that truly revolutionized consumer-goods manufacturing, it would be Dec. 7, 1909, the day Bakelite was patented. Leo Baekeland, a Belgian-born American chemist, had been trying to create a better shellac when he began experimenting in the early 1900s with phenol and formaldehyde combinations. Instead, he invented Bakelite, the early plastic known as the world's first truly synthetic resin. Unlike earlier plastics, Bakelite was heat-resistant and did not conduct electricity, making it a great insulator. Better still, it could be easily molded and would retain its shape even when heated. By the 1930s, Bakelite was being used to make jewellery, kitchenware and all sorts of household objects. Even today, collectors love the stylish, distinctive look of Bakelite and will spend hundreds, even thousands, of dollars at auction for Bakelite baubles in good condition - something to think about next time you're out antiquing. -

Singing the sartorial praises of Leonard Cohen, Canada's moody men's-wearÂ icon

Full text: Leonard Cohen is often called âthe godfather of gloom,' but Nathalie Atkinson reports that the late artist's influence on fashion - and fashion's impact on his own career - goes beyond the moody wardrobe
In the 1966 documentary , Leonard Cohen, the prodigal poet, returns to perform for a hometown audience in Montreal. As he leads the filmmakers around his local haunts, Cohen appears to be wearing the he later immortalized in verse. "I had a blue raincoat. It was a Burberry," Cohen told an interviewer of the garment. "And it had lots of buckles and various fixtures on it. It was a very impressive raincoat. I'd never seen one like it. And it always resided in my memory as some glamorous possibility that I never quite realized." The artist, who could articulate the depths of the human heart with unmatched precision, also, it seems, had an intuitive understanding of the relationship between clothing and identity.
A year after his death at the age of 82 in November 2016, the city of Montreal is preparing to host a series of large-scale events dedicated to that persona, including a multi-disciplinary exhibition at the MusÃ©e d'art contemporain that invites more than 40 contemporary artists to interpret Cohen's work. Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything, opening Nov. 9, will include virtual reality, music, interactive installations and photography. Yet Cohen's relationship to fashion goes unexplored, despite the fact that it's a frequent motif in the poems, novels and music that have inspired so many.
Consider how many Leonard Cohen profiles over the years have spent paragraphs describing his soignÃ© wardrobe. For a 1988 article, one Rolling Stone journalist observed that Cohen's chalk-striped, double-breasted sartorial splendor remained intact despite a July heat wave, in part because Cohen slipped off his trousers partway through the interview and carefully draped them over a chair to prevent them from wrinkling.
Photographed in Amsterdam in 1972, Leonard Cohen sported a more bohemian look than the melancholy style that became his signature.

"When you take a look today, his style is very reminiscent of Margiela meets Dries Van Noten," says Olie Arnold, style director for Mr. Porter, who also notes that the godfather of gloom's sombre outfits mirror the themes of Cohen's songwriting and poetry. "There was this sartorial elegance to him, and it always felt effortless and thrown together. He was proper cool, rocking a trilby with beads on his wrist." Today, a music industry marketing executive would call that synergistic style "on brand," but Cohen came about his interest in fashion much more authentically.
To a man raised in a well-to-do Jewish family dedicated to the garment business, style mattered from an early age. Cohen's grandfather, Lyon, took over Montreal's Freedman Company, which made suits and coats for retailers across Canada, in 1906. Biographer Ira Nadel writes that the Cohen household, "reflected his father's formality rather than his mother's earthy personality." Nathan Cohen, Nadel says, always dressed in a suit, and his son was expected to wear one to dinner (in his book , Harvey Kubernik suggests Nathan ruled with such formalism and propriety that he even wore vested three-piece suits and spats on family vacations to Florida).
In the late 1950s, after a stint at Columbia University in New York, Cohen returned to his hometown and worked at the family firm. In his own work as an aspiring writer though, suits figured as symbols of conformity. His look at the time was that of the rebel intellectual by way of Greenwich Village. "Hanging out with Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, you can see how his style was of the moment," Arnold points out. "I think things like caps and rollnecks worn by the Beat generation set the tone for his style."
"I can't find any clothes that represent me. And clothes are magical, a magical procedure," Cohen told interviewer Michael Harris in 1969. "They really change the way you are in a day... until I can discover in some clearer way what I am to myself, I'll just keep on wearing my old clothes."
The more sober uniform that became his signature begins to emerge in 1975, on the cover of the album: a sepia photo captures his suited reflection in a Milan hotel room mirror as he's adjusting his tie. By the time of , Cohen's first real commercial success in 1992, he had mastered this wardrobe persona. Dark, double-breasted pinstripes with wide peak lapels (usually Armani), a bolo or tightly knotted necktie and, occasionally, a tie bar. Ordained a Buddhist monk in 1996, Cohen sometimes wore Armani suits while he meditated, and imbued his everyday look with such monastic intention the blazers and trousers may as well have been liturgical vestments.
It's that sullen wardrobe aesthetic that most often makes its way onto designer mood boards, but it is, in fact, Cohen's music and lyrics that have the biggest impact on fashion collections. The strains of accompanied deconstructed Margiela men's wear during the Spring 2017 shows, for example. As it happens, Giorgio Armani has said his favourite song is .
Over the years, lyric fragments have worked their way onto the runway. In the spring of 2009, Raf Simons offered a stark black beach towel bearing the oft-quoted verse: "There is a crack in everything/that's how the light gets in." The knits of Eckhaus Latta's Fall 2017 collection are emblazoned with the lyrics of Cohen's 1974 song . And New York designer Thaddeus O'Neil found inspiration for his Spring 2018 men's-wear line in the pages of , Cohen's mystical and psychosexual novel from 1966. Lest you think Cohen would grimace at all these sartorial homages, shortly after his world tour ended in 2011, he collaborated with Comme des GarÃ§ons on a capsule T-shirt collection featuring his words and drawings.
Cohen also enjoyed at long friendship with former Vogue Paris editor Joan Juliet Buck and, in the 1980s, dated fashion photographer Dominique Issermann, who directed the videos for and . The latter's black-and-white montage of meaningful glances and abandoned suitcases resembles an early Calvin Klein perfume commercial. Despite the lyric, "I don't like your fashion business mister," its stark style - and the noir anti-hero figure of Cohen wandering a windswept beach in a dark overcoat - reverberates through the industry to this day.

The downtown festival rigmarole that occurs each summer in Montreal is as much of a drawback as a draw for many. You can jump right in or avoid the scene altogether, but taking refuge in one of the area's restaurants to watch things unfold is a great compromise.
During festival season, there are a few restaurants where you are really in the heart of the action. I reviewed the promising new Blumenthal in this space a few weeks ago (since then, it has opened a snazzy terrasse), but the best-placed eating spots for festivalgoers are probably Brasserie T and Taverne F. Located in two refurbished construction containers, these restaurants made waves back when they opened in 2010. I have dined at both several times since then, especially in winter, as they are a short stroll from Place des Arts. But it is in summer that they really come into their own. Both feature summer terrasses overlooking Place des Festivals, where the show isn't in a theatre next door, but often right in front of your table.
Taverne F is part of Groupe Ferreira, the empire headed by restaurateur Carlos Ferreira, with his daughter Sandra as second in command. I'm a fan of Ferreira Cafe, arguably downtown's swishest restaurant, always filled to the rafters while serving some of the best modern and traditional Portuguese food and wines on the planet. Groupe Ferreira also includes the chic cafe/lunch spot Vasco da Gama as well as their latest, Campo, a Portuguese grilled-chicken restaurant.
Away from the hub of the other restaurants, Taverne F has always felt like a distant cousin in the family. It began life as F Bar, with chef Gilles Herzog overseeing a small-plate menu with a Portuguese focus. I recall great ideas and dishes from F Bar's early days, save for some unevenness in the cooking. I don't know what the kitchen layout is in these container locales, but the dining rooms are a little cramped. Still, the restaurant seemed destined to succeed.
But in 2014 Ferreira and company decided to mix things up, renaming the restaurant Taverne F and unveiling a new menu featuring petiscos: small Portuguese dishes similar to Spanish tapas, designed for sharing. Chef Joao Dias of Ferreira Cafe was now overseeing the menu, and the wine list was given an overhaul as well.
Having sampled the old and new menus, I never really sensed that much of a difference. Call it F Bar or Taverne F - they seem pretty much interchangeable - though I've always been surprised they didn't give this restaurant more of a wine-bar mission, as that genre of restaurant is hugely popular these days and Portuguese wines not only offer excellent value, but are definitely worth discovering. Now, three years since the last makeover, I wondered how Taverne F was evolving, especially at this time of year, when the crowds and tourists descend.
Arriving on a quiet Tuesday just after the end of the jazz fest, we grabbed a seat between the terrasse and dining room and perused the paper placemat menus. Despite chilly temperatures that prevented us from sitting on the terrasse (in July!), I ordered their version of a mojito, which arrived in an oversized mug filled with ice, mint and, despite the Captain Morgan logo on the glass, not much in the way of rum. After a few sips of that, we opted for two wines by the glass: a nice white Alentejo and a Cuvee Ferreira from the family vineyard, available - and recommendable - in both white and red. The wine list isn't long, but the selection is food-friendly and fairly priced.
We ordered three starters: pea soup, octopus salad and salmon gravlax. Garnished with salt cod, chives and coriander, the soup had a velvety texture, but the portion was generous and pea flavour gets repetitive (OK, dull) after the first, say, seven spoonfuls.
The octopus salad was equally ho-hum. Made with slices of cold poached octopus paired with a completely tasteless chickpea and eggplant puree, the dish was finished off with a tomato/red pepper coulis, wilted arugula and pickled onions. As promising as that salad sounded on paper, the reality was a dreary mix falling dismally short of its potential.
Same for the gravlax. The marinated salmon was missing any kind of herb flavouring that would have added pizzazz, and the accompanying Parmesan tuiles were stale. Instead of the listed "egg parfait," the composition included one of those jelly-textured slow-cooked eggs. Why? The romaine drizzled with Parmesan dressing underneath the salmon was good, but the dish lacked cohesiveness.
Discouraged by the starters, I anticipated the worst with the mains. Happily, not so.
The first to arrive was a cassoulet of pork and clams. This Portuguese classic, served with large white beans and a tomato sauce, was simply delicious. The meat was tender, the clams were juicy and the sauce, enhanced with cumin, bacon and parsley, was perfect. Yum! Then came a dish called caldeirada, featuring salmon, shrimp, clams and mussels in a fish fume, flavoured with coconut milk and lemon grass. I really enjoyed the switch of flavour profile, with more of a Thai feel to this dish than Portuguese. But the broth was served as hot as a McDonald's coffee. Hot is good, but scorching hot, not so much; the shrivelled shellfish obviously took a beating in the heat.
For a third main, we opted for the Taverne F hamburger, which seems like the kind of dish you could grab here with a nice glass of red Portuguese wine for a preor post-show bite. The burger toppings include Sao Jorge cheese, shallots, onion confit and tarragon mayonnaise. With its burnt bun and wilted toppings, the burger placed in front of me didn't look like much. And the fries alongside looked like they had been sitting around a while. But one bite and I was hooked. Looks can be deceiving in the burger game, and this one scored. Like the fish dish, it was blisteringly hot (which made me think a microwave is getting good use in this kitchen), but the flavours were excellent. The fries, though, were definitely past their prime.
Desserts provided a welcome hit of sweetness, but not much more. A soft caramel cake drizzled with liquid caramel was good, but the accompanying sorbet (pear, I think) didn't add much in the way of excitement. As for the quenelle of chocolate mousse sprinkled with salt and olive oil and meringue, I would have preferred a smaller portion and better-quality chocolate.
Service was competent, but certainly more frosty than friendly. All taken, I found the Taverne F experience lacking. With a name like Ferreira behind this establishment, expectations are high. But at present it feels a little laissez-faire, a little lazy, a little neglected. With a cuisine this dynamic to work with and a location this cool, I just don't get it. A serious injection of TLC would make a world of difference.

Full text: Marlon B. Wright was remembered Friday as a promising welterweight fighter who went on to become one of Canada's top boxing referees, officiating title bouts around the world.
The 51-year-old Mr. Wright died Thursday night at Montreal's SacrÃ©-Coeur Hospital surrounded by his family, said Michel Hamelin, head of Quebec's combatsports commission.
The Jamaica native who grew up in Montreal had been suffering from melanoma, a form of skin cancer, since 2014. But he was still working as recently as Feb. 24, when he handled a bout in Quebec City between former supermiddleweight champion Lucian Bute and Eleider Alvarez.
Mr. Wright's rÃ©sumÃ© in two decades as third man in the ring includes Kell Brook's loss to Gennady Golovkin in a middleweight title unification bout in London in September and David Lemieux of Montreal's middleweight title win over Hassan N'Dam in 2015.
He worked title fights in Europe, Asia and North America, but was also a regular on fight cards large and small around Quebec.
"It's a big loss," Mr. Hamelin said. "We'll miss him for sure."
Several fighters, including Mr. Bute, Mr. Lemieux and World Boxing Council light heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson of Montreal, posted messages of condolence on social media.
Despite the accolades, Mr. Wright is perhaps best known in the boxing world for his controversial call in 2008, when Mr. Bute retained his International Boxing Federation title despite being knocked senseless late in the final round by Librado Andrade.
Mr. Wright stopped midway through his count to wave Mr. Andrade back to a neutral corner.
What some criticized as a long count gave Mr. Bute time to get up just before the final bell and get the victory by decision in a fight he had dominated through the first 10 rounds. Mr. Wright's actions, televised live in the United States, were scorched by many fans and media members, includ.
ing some who nicknamed him Marlon B. Wrong.
"The Andrade fight really gave him a scar on his career that might have hurt his advancement, but to me, he was one of the best referees I've ever seen," said trainer, cutman and broadcaster Russ Anber. "I always thought he should be up there with the best refs in the game."
Mr. Anber helped train Mr. Wright at the Olympic Boxing Club in Montreal in the early 1980s.
He described the young pugilist as "a hell of a fighter. He had that something - that flow, that coordination, that jive."
Mr. Wright turned pro in 1983, but fought only 11 times, going 10-1, all in Quebec. He won his last bout in 1992 over Alain Bonnamie. Mr. Anber said Mr. Wright could have gone far, but boxing was in a lull in his era and he didn't have a manager willing to take him on the road, as Mr. Anber did with two other Jamaican Montrealers, Otis and Howard Grant.
Otis Grant, who won the World Boxing Organization middleweight title in the 1990s, recalled that one of his first amateur fights was against Mr. Wright.
"He is one of only three guys in the world who have victories over me and my brother," said Otis Grant, who later became Mr. Wright's teammate on the Quebec amateur squad. "He didn't shine in the pros, but when he transitioned into a referee, he excelled."
Howard Grant was Mr. Andrade's trainer for the Bute fight and drew a six-month suspension for shoving Mr. Wright in the ring.
"I lost my cool in the heat of the moment," Howard Grant said. "I apologized to him.
"We were friends. We lost one of the good ambassadors for our sport. I'm happy he's not suffering any more. He's had it rough the last few months."
When Mr. Wright decided to become a referee, he had a firstrate mentor in Guy Jutras, who many consider the best Canadian boxing official of all time.
Fight promoter Yvon Michel, a former Canadian Olympic team coach, said he was always pleased when Mr. Wright was assigned to one of his fights.
"Most of the time, you didn't notice him in the ring and that's a good quality in a ref," Mr. Michel said. "He was a real pro.
"He knew the impact a ref had on a fight. He had good judgment.
I know a lot of people will remember him from when he saved Bute, but it was the perfect call.
He gave the benefit of the doubt to the world champion."

Full text: How we got here - and what's likely to happen next.
?
Four hundred soldiers were deployed in Quebec on Saturday as flood waters threatened many parts of the province.
So far, more than 130 communities have been hit by flooding, with some 700 people forced to abandon their homes.
Eastern Ontario is also enduring the same woes befalling Quebec, while on the other side of the country, British Columbia is suffering flooding and mudslides.
Here's how we got here - and what's likely to happen next:
Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, centre, and Ile Bizard Mayor Richard Belanger walk through the flooded streets of the Ile-Mercier district of Ile-Bizard, Que., on Friday, May 5, 2017. Forecasts are calling for several more days of rain.

Perhaps it's helpful to start with a little context: the 30-year average for April rainfall in Ontario and Quebec is in the neighbourhood of 80 millimetres. This year's accumulation of the wet stuff was almost exactly double that, flirting with a record set in 2005. It's a simple equation: more rain equals more floods, especially in spring.
Indeed, what we're witnessing this weekend is merely the zenith in a series of what began as more localized events last month; several towns in the Outaouais region of Quebec and in low-lying areas around Montreal began evacuating families two weeks ago.

This weekend is a different beast altogether. According to municipal officials in the Montreal region, the water levels of some of the major rivers jumped by as much as 10 centimetres overnight, thanks to pelting rain on Friday and Saturday morning. The offshoot is that flood waters have washed through areas that in some cases had not seen any for decades.
A record-setting snowstorm in late March probably added to the flooding. Combined with a heavier snow pack and mostly cool April temperatures, the spring melt in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec has taken longer than in a typical year. With rivers and streams already surging with melted snow and overflowing water tables saturating the ground, it doesn't take much rain to cause mayhem. And there's been lots and lots of rain.
The Ottawa River crashes past a warning sign at the Chaudiere Falls in Ottawa on Saturday, May 6, 2017.
Justin Tang/THE CANADIAN PRESS
Rivers - spoiler alert - flow downstream, and while destructive spring surges are mostly a thing of the past on the St. Lawrence River (because of dredging), such is not the case for the Ottawa River and its tributaries. Some of the heaviest flooding has hit the Gatineau region. Civic officials in Gatineau have reportedly said that the Gatineau River could rise as much as another 25 to 35 centimetres in the coming days. The situation there and in points north and west cause run-on effects that can reverberate all the way to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
The situation has prompted a response from the Canadian Armed Forces. On Saturday, 400 soldiers based in Valcartier, near Quebec City, were dispatched to aid in stemming the floods. One convoy of military trucks and personnel carriers was sent westward to the Gatineau area, while another trucked to the Mauricie region near Trois-RiviÃ¨res. Contingents were also sent to Rigaud, just west of Montreal, and to Laval, just north of the city. Others could soon be sent to the LanaudiÃ¨re region northeast of the city, and to the Laurentians, Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux said at a news conference in Gatineau. The provincial disaster preparedness department's war room, which is co-ordinating the relief effort, has been relocated from its usual headquarters in Quebec City to Montreal. East of Ottawa, the community of Clarence-Rockland declared a state of emergency on Friday in anticipation of continuing heavy rain.
Morrell Park is completely covered with flood water from the Saint John River in Fredericton, N.B., on Saturday, May 6, 2017.
Stephen MacGillivray/THE CANADIAN PRESS
The bad news is it's going to get worse. A gigantic, slow-moving low-pressure system is stuck over most of Eastern Ontario, Quebec and western New Brunswick; forecasters indicate rainfall between Saturday and Sunday could range from 70 to 100 millimetres (ie., about a month's worth of rain in 24 hours). Environment Canada has issued rainfall warnings for 46 districts in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and flood alerts in a dozen more. By Tuesday, the edge of the front is expected to pour rain on Nova Scotia.
This isn't the first time that flooding has severely impacted Canadians in Ontario and Quebec. As awful as the current devastation is, the evacuations, casualties and damage don't really compare to historically destructive natural disasters in terms of scale. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel dumped 200 millimetres of rain on the Toronto region; 81 people died in the flooding. On July 14, 1987, a flash flood in Montreal, caused by heat-wave thunderstorms (a one-day record of 100 millimetres of rain), forced the evacuation of 40,000 homes and knocked out power to 350,000 more. Nine years later, a flood in the Saguenay towns of Chicoutimi and La Baie wiped out entire neighbourhoods, claiming 10 lives and causing $1.5-billion in property damage.
Flood debris is seen on the road in Cache Creek, B.C., Saturday, May 6, 2017. The small B.C. community was hit this week with flooding from melting snow pack.
JONATHAN HAYWARD/THE CANADIAN PRESS
The combination of the spring melt and recent rainfall has also impacted parts of British Columbia, with flooding and mudslides throughout the province. The City of West Kelowna declared a local state of emergency Saturday to address the flooding, and residents whose safety was at risk have been evacuated. Central Okanagan Emergency officials said 90 properties in the Fintry Delta area north of Kelowna were under an evacuation order due to flooding, while neighbouring residents are warned to be prepared to leave their homes on short notice if conditions worsen. DriveBC said sections of the Trans-Canada Highway near Salmon Arm and Glacier National Park had been closed due to mudslides.

Full text: From the iconic artists who inspired fashion to the veggies that took over our dinner plates - plus notable quotes from industry trendsetters - Globe Style contributors look back on the year's top trends and personalities
Nonagenarian fashion plate Iris Apfel.

Tastemakers
Douglas Coupland
If ever there was an artist armed for the New Age, Vancouver's Douglas Coupland is it. His ability to provide social commentary via myriad creative media has always inspired me. A grand thinker who always seems poised to ride pop culture's next big wave, he's one of the few who manages to walk the line between art and commerce with great aplomb. We had a stimulating conversation about the future of 3-D photography shortly after the launch of a cross-Canada portrait project Coupland had been commissioned to do by Quebec retailer Peter Simons. I was impressed by Coupland's enthusiasm for new technology and how he takes it all in stride:
"The question I get most is, âHow do I vaccinate myself against the future?' Who knows what they're going to invent next week, next year, five years from now? How do I not end up being road kill in all of this? And the answer to that is to figure out what it is that you actually enjoy doing. I know people who go up to 70 or 80 and they never figured out what it is they enjoyed doing. But if you enjoy doing it - making pancakes, making shoes, chopping tree branches - then that's what you should be doing. It doesn't matter what kind of technology they come up with - you're always going to enjoy what you're doing with it."
Kim Cattrall
British-born, Canadian-raised Kim Cattrall is proof positive that great things come to those who go for them. The much-celebrated actress who charmed female bonnes vivantes the world over as sassy Samantha on went on to inspire women of a certain age by executive producing her own vehicle - the acclaimed TV series , which explores the dilemma of aging and the midlife quest for happiness. I spoke with Cattrall, a great champion of Canadian fashion, just before she hosted this year's CAFA Awards, and we had a refreshing chat about effortless style and the value of feeling comfortable in one's own skin:
"Whenever I look at someone who looks very chic, it looks effortless. It's about not trying too hard, either with an outfit, or a hairstyle, or makeup... I've been in this skin for coming up on 60 years, and I think what I like is just me, hanging out, being real, feeling relaxed, feeling that my clothes are part of what's representing me, but they aren't me."
Iris Apfel
Though fashion is often accused of being youth obsessed, there are few in the fashion world who aren't in awe of Iris Apfel. At 95, her passion for style is palpable, and her lifelong love of sartorial play has made her a walking piece of art. A former interior designer and textile manufacturer, Apfel is considered a bonafide style icon - a true original who thinks outside the conventional dress box and celebrates herself with some of the most flamboyant ensembles imaginable. I relished our chat about the necessity of staying true to one's self and always maintaining a sense of humour:
"I think it's important to find humour in everything because I think if you don't have a sense of humour about living, you might as well be dead. I think taking yourself or your clothes too seriously is just terrible and that's a big mistake. There are a lot of well-dressed women who are very uptight about the way they dress and they take every button as a serious matter. That's ridiculous. No matter how well dressed you are, if you're not relaxed, then you don't look relaxed and you're not going to look well. I always say if being well dressed or being fashionable makes you uptight and uncomfortable, it's much better to be happy than well dressed."
Sarah Gadon
In this modern-day galaxy of dazzling female stars, few shine as brightly as Toronto's own Sarah Gadon. A favourite of filmmaker David Cronenberg, Gadon's starred in three of the famed director's films, and even one by his son Brandon, called . More recently, Gadon was in production this year on , the miniseries based on Margaret Atwood's novel of the same name. Gadon, who's been acting since the age of 10 and is as intellectual as she is beautiful, enjoys the glamour of red carpets without ever letting it go to her head. I spoke with her just before the Toronto International Film Festival and was intrigued by her take on what true Canadian style has come to mean on the world stage:
"I would say that we're very transient and adaptable and we have this objectivity, which I think allows us to stand alone. I certainly feel that way in terms of my own career. With Hollywood or the States or the rest of the world, it's like we're up here in Canada looking down on it all, and we absorb it all culturally but we have this distance from it. I think we used to be ashamed of that, but now it's become this massive tool that's making us stand apart."
Jenna Lyons
When it comes to sartorial panache, few figures are as striking as six-foot-tall style icon Jenna Lyons. The 47-year-old Boston-born president and creative director of American sportswear giant J. Crew dresses to the beat of her own style drum, inspiring legions of fans with her bold approach to the art of juxtaposition. Lyons is known for her warmth and candour, and I've always been charmed by how grounded she's remained over the years. I cozied up with the fashion powerhouse over coffee at The Four Seasons' CafÃ© Boulud in Toronto where we discussed the current casualization of fashion and what truly great personal style is all about:
"There's no question that style goes far beyond what you wear. The people who I think are the most elegant are the people who make good eye contact, have a firm handshake, smile, brush their teeth... I'm constantly telling my son to look people in the eye when you talk to them. People will remember the way you treated them more than they will remember your outfit. That's important and that is part of style. I think those things add up far more deeply and have much more weight in the end than being able to put a couple of things together that look cute."
Vancouver's glitzy Face the World Foundation gala.
Society
National Ballet of Canada Mad Hot Ballet Gala, Toronto, June 7
Mad Hot Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada's top fundraising initiative, is held each year in the spring, and continually proves to be one of the country's most important and wildly fun events. Co-chaired this year by Bernadette Morra and Victoria Webster and held at Polson Pier, a venue by the water, the gala drew a dreamy mix of ballet supporters including Jonas and Lynda Prince, Jay Smith, a first vice-president with CIBC Wood Gundy, and my hosts Ryerson and Michele Symons. There were gen-next movers, too, like Fernanda Dovigi and Jenna Bitove, and fashionable party fixtures including decorator Colette van den Thillart and Sarah MacDonald out for good measure. Presiding over it all: Karen Kain, who was celebrating 10 years as artistic director of the ballet company. Later in the evening, dancers of the professional variety, including Evan McKie and Heather Ogden, kicked it up well into the night with dancers of the very much non-professional-but-A-for-effort sort.
The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts Ball,Montreal, Nov. 4
I have never not had a fantastic time at a Montreal ball. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts ball, held in support of the museum, is an absolute must attend. Unlike other cities, where galas are held mid-week and become a sort of obligation, this one gets going on a Saturday with 900 or so excited guests, who later in the evening are joined by the museum's Young Philanthropists' Circle just in time for dancing (an activity, alongside table-top vodka shots, that Montrealers take very seriously at their balls). In the crowd this year were backers of the fine arts, including Scotiabank CEO Brian Porter, Michael Penner, chairman of the board of Hydro-QuÃ©bec, Minister of Canadian Heritage MÃ©lanie Joly, style setter Dominique Bertrand, and Transcontinental Inc. board chair Isabelle Marcoux, all of whom helped raise $1.2-million for the musÃ©e.
LOOK 2016,Calgary, Oct. 22
The latest instalment of Contemporary Calgary's high-energy and incredibly well-attended annual fundraiser featured a big name, Steve Martin, who spoke on-stage with writer Adam Gopnik. Star power or not, however, the event always sells out early and is on the social calendar of every in-the-know Calgarian for good reason. The evening is capital-F fun and is served with a side of substance, all in support of the city's fantastic new home for contemporary art. Among those in attendance: Can-art superstars like Kim Dorland and Janet Were, mover/shaker duo Jay and Viviane Mehr and old-guard big givers Morris and Ann Dancyger.
The Governor General's Performing Arts Awards,Ottawa, June 12
The Governor General's Performing Arts Awards, held in the nation's capital, is a truly Canadian event that I look forward to each year. The evening is a chance to celebrate the performing arts and honour a fascinating crop of creators who have contributed greatly to the cultural fabric of this country. A grand dinner is served inside the National Arts Centre for big givers who come from far and wide for the evening; among them this year were Earle and Janice O'Born, Salah Bachir and Jacob Yerex of Toronto and Gail Asper of Winnipeg. After, it's a full-on production on the Southam Hall stage. Oh yes, and David Johnston, the Governor General himself, was there, too. He and his wonderful wife Sharon, fresh off a plane mere hours after celebrating the Queen's 90th birthday across the pond, made it just in time to celebrate Canada's talent at this year's event.
Face the World Foundation,Vancouver, May 14
At the helm of this event's 26th edition was Jacqui Cohen, the bold and connected president and CEO of Army & Navy Department Stores, who opened her palatial waterfront home to a few hundred guests for a glitz-filled good-time gala. Since the event's launch a quarter century ago, over $17-million has been raised and distributed to a bevy of local organizations, and come 2017, Jacqui and daughter Kasondra will join forces to grow the event by engaging with a wider age range and broader audience. Kit and Ace co-founder J.J. Wilson was in attendance this year, as were Keg CEO David Aisenstat and Concord Pacific's Terry Hui. And on stage was Steven Page.

Design
Jeanette Hlinka,Toronto
With everyone Marie Kondo-ing their homes, minimalism is hot at the moment. But it has been a lifelong pursuit for lawyer-turned-designer Jeanette Hlinka. "I am, as you can see, a minimalist," she explained. "I was born that way." The expansive living room in her hundred-year-old home in Toronto's Casa Loma neighbourhood is filled with an intriguing mix of pieces. From the antique Chinese lacquered cabinet to the Barcelona daybed by ultimate minimalist Mies van der Rohe to the contemporary loveseat by Toronto-based designer Sarah Richardson, all exist in a perfect symbiosis.
Clotilde Orozco and AlejandroSanguino, Vancouver
Having spent most of their life savings on a transcontinental move, Spanish architects Clotilde Orozco and Alejandro Sanguino were left with a shoestring budget for decorating their Strathcona basement rental apartment. So, naturally, they built their own furniture by utilizing inexpensive plywood sheets and framing lumber, and combining them with alley finds. The result: a whimsical take on a family room, complete with a play kitchen for their young daughter. "We decided it was an opportunity to do something different than what we had in Madrid, which was a regular house with tables and chairs," said Sanguino. Different doesn't even begin to describe this DIY wonder.
Nam Dang-Mitchell,Calgary
When interior designer Nam Dang-Mitchell first laid eyes on her turn-of-the-century Calgary home, she was expecting to see an -style kitchen, but instead, she got something out of . The designer set out to recreate what she imagined the kitchen would have looked like in its former glory, with additional inspiration from her European travels. "In big mansions and chÃ¢teaux, my favourite areas are always the kitchens, the servants' quarters," said Dang-Mitchell. "They just have this life about them and austere beauty, which is such a contrast to the opulence of the rest of the house." Of course, unlike the fictional Bellamy family of , no help is needed here when concocting delicious meals.
Luke Edward Hall,London
There is something to be said about British charm, and Luke Edward Hall's London home has no shortage of it. The London-based artist and interior designer and his partner Duncan Campbell find joy in collecting rare pieces such as the 1960s leather Walter Antonis sling chair, Fontana Arte Murano glass mirror, and the Paolo Buffa bar cabinet with malachite panels, a prized antique find. Decorating is an ongoing process for the couple. "I don't think a home is ever really finished. That's the fun," said Campbell. "These are things that we have acquired together over the years, and each one has a story attached." Combine that with an enviable art collection that includes works by John Bellany and Tinko Czetwertynski, and the young couple is truly living the maximalist dream.
Steven Cook,Toronto
Bright colours may not be Steven Cook's thing, but the former chief merchant at Holt Renfrew can work black and white like no one else. "It hasn't been conscious because I've kind of bought what I liked, but everything is very graphic and crisp and very tailored," said Cook. His downtown Toronto condo features some true rarities, including a 1930s mahogany table that once belonged on the Normandie, a famous cruise ship with interiors designed by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, and the 1909 velvet parlour set by Josef Hoffmann. The old-timey glamour is coupled with an impressive collection of art and design books, providing inspiration at every step.
Dyson's innovative hair dryer.
Beauty Customization and wearable tech influenced the efficacy - and cost - of cosmetics, writes Caitlin Agnew
Dyson SupersonicHair Dryer
The buzziest launch of the year may have very well been for the quietest product. Dyson spent four years and about $100-million on its first-ever hair dryer, a futuristic device that boasts precision airflow, reduced noise, lighter hand-held technology and intelligent heat control. The company, known for its state-of-the-art vacuums and fans, recruited a team of aero-acoustic engineers to push the tone of the motor to a sound frequency beyond the audible range for humans, bringing peace, quiet and great hair to your morning routine. $499 at Hudson's Bay (www.thebay.com) and through www.dysoncanada.ca.
Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face & Body Stick SPF 50+
Travelling light is easy - until you have to pack your toiletries, that is. Keeping it below the 100-mL limit for carry-on luggage is next to impossible for those of us with a skincare routine that boasts (gulp) 10-plus steps, but Neutrogena has got our backs. The American company launched a solid sunscreen this year that's basically like a deodorant stick, but with waterproof broad-spectrum UV protection. Anything that adds sun protection and room in my suitcase for more serums has got my vote. $13.99 at mass-market retailers.
Giorgio Armani Lip Magnet
The matte-lip trend was arguably the biggest colour cosmetics product news story of the year, made popular on Instagram and taken viral by Kylie Jenner and her popular Lip Kits. While countless brands launched their own matte liquid lipsticks, Armani's version, the Lip Magnet, is wispy in comparison, drying down to a width that's smaller than the diameter of a hair. It has the desired matte finish, stays put and imparts a "bare lips" sensation. The end result is a comfortable wear for those of us who need our lipstick to last IRL, not just on social media. $45 at Sephora, Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay and Nordstrom.
Nannette de GaspÃ©Restorative Techstile Masque for the Face
Skincare companies never shy away from bragging about their new technologies, incorporating impossible sounding ingredients with equally impossible sounding results, but this is one instance in which I welcome the boast. For a process that's as delightful as it is innovative, Nannette de GaspÃ©'s masks for face, eyes, hands, neck and mouth use a dry delivery system to get anti-aging ingredients into the skin. The company's namesake founder is also the executive chair of Quebec-based Biomod, a company that creates wearable tech for the health and beauty fields. Instead of using water to deliver active ingredients to skin, these masks are activated by pH, heat and movement for a more concentrated hit of anti-aging goodness. $145 at Holt Renfrew (www.holtrenfrew.com).
M.A.C InstaCurlLash Mascara
In today's "as you like it" era of ultimate customization, there's no longer a need to settle for something that's just good enough, as M.A.C's InstaCurl mascara demonstrates. The name is a true double entendre, as the formula curls lashes upon application for all-day, flake-free hold, but here's where it gets interesting: The wand can be twisted to curve the brush, so that it can be moulded to fit every eye shape, catching even the tiniest corner lashes. What seems like a small adjustment makes a big difference when it comes to our never-ending quest for Bambi-like lashes. $27 at M.A.C stores and counters (www.maccosmetics.ca).
Roasted cauliflower.
Entertaining From the kombucha craze to cocktailpairings, flavours got peculiar
Asian to the foreground
Asian food is slowly getting its due, and this will continue into 2017. It has been an unfortunate reality that restaurant goers have no problem paying $20-$30 for a plate of pasta, but balk at the idea of forking over $10 for a bowl of handmade soup noodles at a Chinese restaurant. But Tokyo now has two ramen restaurants with Michelin stars, and a new generation of North American Asian chefs are using their understanding of plating, atmosphere, cocktails, wines, seasonal cooking and the like to enhance the value of Asian cooking in the minds of clientele - you can see it at DaiLo in Toronto, Momofuku in New York and Mr Jiu's in San Francisco. This has been coupled with an influx of quality, easily accessible cookbooks on Asian cooking - Andy Ricker's and Fuchsia Dunlop's , for instance - that are helping people understand exactly what goes into Asian cuisines. - Haan Palcu-Chang
Fermentation for the win
Kombucha has been around for centuries, but has been enjoying time in the spotlight again. Known for its alkalizing properties, which help reduce inflammation in the body, the fermented tea tastes great and can be used many different ways when cooking. Made using a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast (known as SCOBY), by playing with the length of the ferment, you can create sweet kombucha, sour kombucha and even vinegar. You can use it in vinaigrettes, pickling liquids, compressions and seasonings. It is starting to be used in food today by experimental chefs as well as put on tap along side beer at some restaurants. We have recently used it for many things at Market [in Calgary] like pickling liquids, broths and fried SCOBY. - Sean MacDonald
Vegetables viefor attention
Moving vegetables from the side of the plate to its centre is becoming the norm rather than the exception. The movement has roots with Alice Waters, but gained momentum anew with Yotam Ottolenghi, recent books like Travis Lett's , and those from Jessica Koslow, Anna Jones and Angela Liddon, creating an increased respect for quality produce in general, and an overall interest wherein meat is not the focus of meals (or not present at all). We see veg being paid loving attention, with dishes such as whole smoked cauliflower heads sliced like a roast, or hen of the woods mushrooms deep fried Ã  la KFC. There's play with textures, combinations of raw and cooked, the pickled and preserved. The results are inspired and immensely satisfying. - Tara O'Brady
Cocktail complement
This past year, I have loved seeing how food pairing has moved beyond something that is only done with wine. While non-alcoholic mixed drinks have been popping up as an alternative to wine pairings on fine-dining tasting menus for a while, at Pasdeloup we focus on pairing cocktails with our dishes. Cocktails are great for pairing with food because instead of coating the palate in the way wine does, spirits actually absorb fats, and therefore rinse the palate and prepare it for the next bite. What I love about pairing cocktails with food is that the possibilities truly are endless. From one bartender to the next, a chef can experience a crazy variety of drinks being paired with their dishes. - Lina Caschetto
Frank Stella's graphic pops of colour.
Fashion and shopping Inspiration came from artistic muses,mesmerizing surfaces and moody memes, writes Odessa Paloma Parker
Frank Stella
I love graphic shapes, colour and patterning, so Frank Stella is an ideal inspiration for me style-wise. I visited his retrospective at The Whitney last year and was immediately excited to explore a potential connection between his work and what was appearing in the style landscape. I loved being able to pull together pieces - including that spectacular Loewe bag - that celebrate all of those things. It's such a happy assortment!
PracticalValentine's Day gifts
As a person who falls into the "has everything category," my favourite gifts to receive are ones that will last, and even improve my life somehow. I find the frivolity of many holiday gift guides upsetting given where our consumer culture is at right now, so I wanted to focus on items that have an elevated sense of usefulness. Some thought the deodorant was unromantic but, hey, giving the gift of toxin-free beauty sounds quite lovely to me.
Grumpy Valentine'sgifts
I also enjoyed putting together the other Valentine's Day gift round up we ran, which celebrated mild misanthropy by way of sarcastic, witty items that said "meh" to love. Even for people who aren't single, the tireless messaging of eternal connections can be a bit much around that time of year; it was fun to turn a traditional gift guide on its ear.
Frida Kahlo
When Assouline published its new book about Friday Kahlo, I knew it would make for a vibrant style story. Frida has been the inspiration to many performers and personalities, and her iconic work and sense of style will undoubtedly continue to spark imaginations for a long time to come. I was very happy to be able to include a few Mexico-based brands in this story as well.
Iridescent home decor
Exploring the relationship between all facets of style is very interesting to me, so I relished the chance to connect Florence Welch's shimmering Gucci gown that she wore to the MET Gala with some novel items for the home. Sometimes people prefer to take greater risks with their style behind closed doors, and what better way to add a little oomph to the kitchen than an iridescent serving spoon?

Full text: He's come back down from the mountaintop. And now, freed of depression and with a Buddhist lease on life, Leonard Cohen is finally ready to bring the world more music and words
?
During his five years atop Mount Baldy, his fellow monks named him Jikan, the silent one, although in lighter moments he became known as Bad Monk. Today, almost 30 months after his descent back into the heat and hustle of Los Angeles, he is Leonard Cohen once again.
Still, the patterns of monastic life remain intact. On this summer day, as always, he has risen hours before dawn, before the birds and cars and helicopters have filled the air with sound; he has stepped out the back door of the humble house he shares with his daughter Lorca in a struggling downtown neighbourhood, and he has strolled into the back-yard studio. Here he maintains the one constant in his peripatetic life: the clean, white room almost devoid of ornamentation, like the one in the Zen monastery, like the one on the Greek island of Hydra, like the rooms where it all began in Montreal, five decades ago.
At midday, after eight hours of work and meditation and songs from a room, he greets his two visitors as if they were the oldest comrades. "Welcome, friends, welcome," he says, in the oak-aged baritone that has won the hearts of countless listeners, thousands of drinking companions, hundreds of lovers. As always, he is immaculately groomed, in a tailored dark-blue suit and a necktie. Over the next hours, he will show us the quiet corners where he laboriously crafts and recrafts his verses, the files where he stores dozens, sometimes hundreds of drafts of every one of his works. He will make us chopped-egg sandwiches, and he will share a bottle of very good riesling. And, most of all, he will talk about the 10 new songs, and the 250 new poems, and the years of self-imposed isolation that have led to this autumnal renaissance.
Leonard Cohen is once again a songwriter, eight years after he swore he'd given up the craft for good. Ten New Songs, the title of the recording he will release next month, is possibly his most poised, hypnotic work yet, a set of secular and holy incantations whose pared-down lyrics refract contradictory waves of meaning and myth. His monotone growl seems to have dropped another octave, if possible, and added an appealing, resined buzz, like a bowed string-bass. He is producing poetry with the same agonizing, methodical approach as always, but at a greater pace and a greater artistic restraint. His songs are co-written, a concept almost unthinkable for a man who has devoted his life to the first person, with Sharon Robinson, a musician who seems better at writing Leonard Cohen songs than Leonard Cohen is.
"Collaborations happen so rarely in my case," he says. Robinson, herself a sometime follower of the Zen teacher Joshu Sasaki Roshi, Cohen's guru, had written the music for two of his best songs, Everybody Knows and Waiting for the Miracle, and she was waiting for him when he came down from the mountain. "We didn't have an idea that there would be a record. We just wanted to get together and write some songs together, because the process has always been very peaceful, so we wrote one and then two and then three. She has an extraordinary penetration of my lyrics."
And, most extraordinary, Leonard Cohen is no longer wracked with bouts of depression. Though he has devoted every moment of his adult life to expressing the agonies of the human condition, and has frequently fallen completely to pieces himself, in his seventh decade Cohen seems to have found a genuine state of grace. Something must have happened, something profound, up there on Mount Baldy. However, it will take time, and careful listening, to learn exactly what.
Most surprising is that Cohen's sudden lack of angst hasn't rendered him artistically impotent. In fact, it appears to have done the opposite.
On this visit, he talks enthusiastically about the prospect of a concert tour, another custom he'd forsworn in 1993; he devotes even more enthusiasm to the prospect of writing a third novel.
"I think people, perhaps legitimately sometimes, feel that anguish or suffering is the engine of creativity. It's a very popular notion . . . I think most people live their lives in an emergency, and I'm certainly not unique in this respect. I have certainly battled depression over the years, and my time on Mount Baldy was one of the remedies. And I found that my depression might have been the background of my work, but not the spur, not the trigger.
"Although," he says with a chuckle, "without that background, the work isn't easier. You know, lifting boulders isn't easier when you're in a good mood."
And keep in mind that this is a very Leonard Cohen kind of good mood.
In other words, it is powered by the deepest kind of pessimism about the human project. His album's most immediately telling tune, Boogie Street, seems to mark his reappearance on the scene: "O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,/ I never thought we'd meet./ You kiss my lips, and then it's done:/ I'm back on Boogie Street."
Tellingly, it is a lament, the saddest song on the album.
It is 1964, and Leonard Cohen is predicting the future. He is 30, and he has just to begun to write his second novel, Beautiful Losers, in a swirl of barbiturates and acid under the Mediterranean sun of Hydra, where he has bought a house for $1,500. "I am an old scholar," he types, as a Ray Charles record spins on the turntable beside him, "better-looking now than when I was young." And then he adds a note of bathos: "That's what sitting on your ass does to your face."
Half a lifetime later, Leonard Cohen is himself an old scholar, four years from his 70th birthday, and he may well be better-looking now than when he was young. He has traded the laconic, smouldering appeal of the rebellious poet and folksinger for a chiselled Bogart cool, a look of gravity unburdened by ponderous affectation. He carries it off very well. But this has not been achieved by sitting on his ass. Those years at California's Mount Baldy Zen Center were constant, intense physical labour, at high altitude and low temperature, a highly disciplined and ordered regime of menial tasks and strenuous meditation. He quotes a Zen saying: " âLike pebbles in a bag, the monks polish one another.' You're working shoulder to shoulder with one another, there's intensive labour to keep the facility going. So the notion of spiritual aspiration as an objective is somewhat discouraged in this particular expression."
It is a spiritual practice that seems to have been tailor-made for Cohen: Enlightenment through household chores. Ten years older than most of the baby-boom guitar slingers, Cohen has also stood apart from them in his asceticism, his obsessive rigour. "I've always had an aesthetic interest in austerity - I prefer a bare room to a cluttered room," he says. "And, as one of Gandhi's aides once said, it costs a lot of money to keep Mahatma Gandhi in poverty. I liked the life on Mount Baldy for that reason: It's not an easy life but it's a simple life."
It is autumn of 2000, and Leonard Cohen is in Montreal for the funeral of Pierre Trudeau, with whom he had shared a mutual admiration and a few common traits. He visits the hospital bed of Irving Layton, his dear friend and poetic inspiration, who has been in frail health. They share an illegal smoke in the hospital lobby, and talk turns to their favourite game.
Irving: Leonard, have you noticed any decline in your sexual interest?
Leonard: As a matter of fact I have, Irving.
Irving: I'm relieved to hear that, brother.
Leonard: So I take it, Irving, that you yourself have experienced some decline in your sexual interest.
Irving: I have.
Leonard: When did you first notice this decline?
Irving: Oh, about the age of 16 or 17.
Leonard Cohen has had the rare luxury of complete self-absorption almost all his life. From his first moment of success in the late 1960s, he has given himself plenty of time, creating an album every four or five years and a book less frequently; since then, he has been financially and, in most cases, sexually independent. His one near-marriage in the 1970s produced his two beloved children (Lorca and Adam, both adults who live near him now, she a furniture-store owner and he a promising musician) but never had any pretence of exclusivity. His lovers have been many, but his commitments have never lasted, his last major relationship fading in the late 1980s. His only real marriage has been to himself, and to his ideals. By his own account, it has been a fractious and abusive marriage.
In the midst of this self-absorption, more than any other artist of his generation, Cohen has gone out of his way to make his life as difficult as possible. Physically, emotionally and intellectually, he has been relentlessly hard on himself his whole life. As he describes it, he is caught on the horns of a paradox: a man who depends on the self for his livelihood, yet who strives for the deepest kind of self-abnegation.
"I recently read a conversation by Isaac B. Singer - he said every creator knows the painful chasm between his inner vision and the final expression." Cohen cocks an eyebrow. "I don't know that painful chasm. I know other painful chasms, but that's one I don't know, because I don't have a sense of a compelling inner vision I can locate, and that's why it takes me a long time to write: I have to go beneath my opinions, which long ago I ceased to have any great interest in.
"My own opinions are predictable; I can dredge them up in a conversation over a drink to keep the talk flowing. And I feel the same way about beliefs: My beliefs are predictable, and I find them kind of tiresome. So I need to write a lot to avoid the opinion, the belief or the slogan, and to come up with the freshness that determines the living quality of a piece of work."
If these seem like rabbinical labours, his new songs like complex prayers to someone who may or may not be a deity, it is because Cohen's life has been taken over by the most complicated and indescribable kind of spirituality. He has always embraced the responsibility of the cohenim, the Jewish priestly class who kept the fires burning; his practice of Zen has only enhanced this. Even on Mount Baldy, he observed the Sabbath. "I certainly wasn't looking for a new religion - I was very happy with my own and old religion. I wasn't interested in a new set of religious principles."
It is a cold mid-winter evening in the middle of the 1990s, and the monks of Mount Baldy are pacing around an empty fire pit in the snow, in a tough kind of walking meditation. Through the mountain air, they are surprised to hear loud voices speaking Yiddish in the distance. Cohen thinks: This must have something to do with me. He leaves the meditation line, and encounters two Lubavitcher Rabbis, the most orthodox of the Orthodox, who had been serving the community at the foot of the hill. One says: "We heard there was a Jew on the mountain." They have come to rescue Cohen, he realizes. He brings them back to his cabin, where the last flames of the Hanukkah menorah are still burning. He finds a half-full bottle of scotch in the cabin, and some Turkish cigarettes, and they spend the evening singing and dancing. "After that," Cohen says, "they visited us quite often up there."
"The ponies run, the girls are young,/ The odds are there to beat./You win a while, and then it's done -/ Your little winning streak./ And summoned now to deal/ With your invincible defeat,/ You live your life as if it's real,/ A Thousand Kisses Deep."
So begins Ten New Songs, with a statement of its most salient theme: an acceptance of the notion that we have no control over our fates.
As we discuss this song, Cohen is surveying the objects on the big oak desk in the front room of his house. These objects include a half-dozen mockup album covers, all of them designed by Leonard Cohen. The final cover will feature a digital photo of Cohen and Robinson, taken by Cohen. He has designed the covers of most of his 14 recordings, often with his own photos. Since his first poetry collection, Let Us Compare Mythologies in 1956, he has controlled cover art, paper stock and typography in his books. His next collection, likely to be published by McClelland and Stewart next year, will be no exception. On this album, Cohen and Robinson sing all the parts and play all the instruments; it was recorded in their home studios, often by exchanging music files over the Internet. Also on the desk are several recently recorded CDs; these contain different mixes of the album with varying tonal balances. Cohen will choose which mix to use - in every step of the recording and production process, he is intensely involved.
So here we have another paradox of Leonard Cohen: A man who is obsessively in control of every element of his art, yet who devotes that art to telling us that we have absolutely no control.
"We don't write the play, we don't produce it, we don't direct it and we're not even actors in it," he says, speaking of A Thousand Kisses Deep in particular and his world view in general. "Everybody eventually comes to the conclusion that things are not unfolding exactly the way they wanted, and that the whole enterprise has a basis that you can't penetrate. Nevertheless, you live your life as if it's real. But with the understanding: It's only a thousand kisses deep, that is, with that deep intuitive understanding that this is unfolding according to a pattern that you simply cannot discern."
It is the Zen of country and western, of rhythm and blues, two genres that influence his beliefs almost as much as his complex of religions.
At some deep level, his music remains hurtin' music. At McGill University, he led a country group, comprised of young urban Jewish men, called the Buckskin Boys; the last major album he listened to was by George Jones. Ten New Songs includes one overt country song, which continues the theme of powerlessness against fate: "I fought against the bottle,/ But I had to do it drunk -/ Took my diamond to the pawnshop -/ But that don't make it junk."
Absent is the worldly wit of his last two albums of new material, The Future and I'm Your Man. This material is no less clever, but slower to reveal itself. There is one number that could be called a protest song, The Land of Plenty ("May the lights in The Land of Plenty/Shine on the truth some day.") - but its lyrics are almost entirely devoted to the singer's lack of worthiness. "Mostly this song is about my lack of credentials to sing this song, and my ignorance about the place from which it arose," he says. And then he offers the song's key line: "Don't really have the courage/ To stand where I must stand./ Don't really have the temperament/ to lend a helping hand."
And this brings us back to Boogie Street, an address mentioned frequently on this recording. At first blush, you might take this to mean Cohen's return to Babylon from the mountaintop. But he has something more universal, more despairing, in mind. He points out the song's culmination, a lyrical kick in the face: "Though all the maps of blood and flesh/ Are posted on the door,/ There's no one who has told us yet/ What Boogie Street is for."
"Boogie Street is the place where we always live," he says, settling into an easy chair. "It's Boogie Street at the monastery, too. It's everywhere."
As Buddhism's holiest clichÃ© would put it: Life is suffering. Cohen sees little more: "The evidence accumulates that ours is not an entirely happy undertaking. The amount of suffering that one sees and hears about is shattering. But the only comfort in the matter is Thy Will Be Done. To whatever degree you want to establish that as a principle in your life: The notion that it's unfolding according to a mechanism that you can't possibly penetrate. Acceptance. Or surrender."
A bleak conclusion, especially from a man who says he has left depression behind. Surely there must be a glint of hope, as he suggested in his oft-quoted 1993 song Anthem: "Ring the bells that still can ring./ Forget your perfect offering./ There is a crack in everything./ That's how the light gets in."
He offers a wry smile, and a shrug of admission.
"Of course there are moments - I suppose when you embrace your children, or kiss your beloved, or plunge into a pool of cold water - when you forget who you are, when you forget yourself, and that's a very refreshing occasion, and it's paradise, there's no you. But you resurrect immediately, into Boogie Street. If you're lucky, you resurrect with the residue of the experience of paradise. But, as Roshi says, you can't live in paradise - no restaurants or toilets."
It seems that Leonard Cohen has finally managed to forget himself, even as he prepares to place himself upon the public stage once again, after his longest retreat. Self-erasure is a difficult way to find peace, and an even tougher way to make art, but somehow he has managed to accomplish it.
"It's been a very graceful moment," he says, as he bids his guests farewell and turns back to the plain white room. "These things are always temporary, but I'm happy to be in it."
"I was once a secretary to a Zen monk who was establishing zendos in Trappist monasteries. There had been a rapprochement between Zen and the Trappists started by Thomas Merton. In one place, we talked to this prisoner, and he asked, âHow do you get through the day?' The monk said, âYou should regard this place as your own. We're not invited to make this place our own, but that's what you must do.' " And then Cohen adds, a little mournfully, "This monk also said to me - his English wasn't so good - âOlder you get, lonelier you become, more deep the love you need.'" The poetry business

At Emiliano's, Mexican far more than tacos; Authentic flavours emerge in mole, flans, even caramel tequila

Abstract: Served in threes, the tacos I tried were the tacos "carnitas"- filled with pulled pork, onion, cilantro and radish - as well as the fish tacos garnished with jalapeno, avocado, grilled cipollini onions, lettuce and lime (tell me you're not drooling after reading that list of ingredients).

Full text: Â  There is a brilliant series on Netflix by the name of Chef's Table that has many a food lover hooked. Now on its second season (with a third that will focus on chefs from France), the show's recent highlight was an episode devoted to Enrique Olvera, chef/owner of several restaurants including Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme in New York.
Not only is this chef a modest and endearing character, his food looks sublime, with takes on such classics as mole and tacos, as well as more personal creations like smoked corn with coffee mayonnaise and ant powder, and a meringue and corn cream dessert so enticing that I was soon on Expedia searching for flights to Mexico.
In chef Olvera's hands, Mexican cuisine is reaching new gastronomic heights - excellent, because like so many cuisines branded "ethnic," Mexican food has been relegated to the cheap-eats beat for far too long. With chefs such as Olvera making waves, Mexican cuisine is finally coming into the international spotlight. Yeah!
That said, in this part of the world, it still has a ways to go. Having reviewed but a handful of lacklustre Mexican restaurants over the years in Montreal, I have yearned to see Mexican restaurants
fully exploit the potential of this cuisine. Instead, I have eaten a lot of salsa, nachos and quesadillas, and watched many a waiter mix guacamole table-side with about as much enthusiasm as a meter maid sliding tickets onto windshields.
But lately I have a feeling Montreal Mexican may be turning a corner. You can eat tacos at dozens of places around town, and a lot of them are seriously delicious. But beyond the cool taquerias, we're finally seeing Mexican restaurants taking this cuisine in all sorts of fun directions (like the excellent Escondite, reviewed this summer) or emphasizing authenticity, like this week's restaurant, Emiliano's.
The new Old Montreal eatery opened in mid-June with its goal spelled out right on the menu: "Show Montrealers and the world what real authentic Mexican cuisine looks like."
Sounds good to me. I dined at Emiliano's twice, and on both occasions the restaurant was close to capacity while many of the surrounding restaurants were close to empty. Has bistro ennui set in? Perhaps. Emiliano's happens to be a pretty hopping place with a large bar, high tables, an added second-floor dining room, an open kitchen in the back and Mexican music playing at a loud-but-still tolerable volume.
Our firecracker of a waitress, Patricia, welcomed us with a smile and went over the menu in some detail. Mexican food lovers will find such favourites as tacos, ceviches, tamales, quesadillas and enchiladas, but there's also a good selection of dishes beyond the Mexican faves served at Cancun all-inclusives.
I suggest beginning with Emiliano's guacamole, served with either homemade tortilla chips or "chicharron," curls of fried pork fat. Like hummus, guacamole has become the go-to snack a lot of us are making and munching on at home. This one stands out because of its chunky texture and because the chips aren't overly salted, therefore not overwhelming this subtle avocado condiment/dip. Paired with a not-too-jolting "perfect margarita," as it was called on the menu, this duo provided the ideal entree to the evening.
After reading the description of the first soup on the menu, the "sopa Azteca," I ordered it straight away. Good move, as this lusty mix of roasted tomatoes, pasilla peppers, panela cheese and creme fraiche, garnished with slices of avocado and strips of crispy tortilla, was one of the best soups I've tasted in ages.
I'd also highly recommend the grilled queso fresco plate, which features a stack of pan-fried queso fresco cheese, a slice of chorizo sausage, avocado and julienned mango. Plated alongside are three warm tortillas used to wrap up a bit of everything in that stack, top with a squeeze of lime, fold over and devour. So, so good.
After the entrees, the next part of the menu comes under the category of "street food." From there we sampled tacos and quesadillas. Served in threes, the tacos I tried were the tacos "carnitas"- filled with pulled pork, onion, cilantro and radish - as well as the fish tacos garnished with jalapeno, avocado, grilled cipollini onions, lettuce and lime (tell me you're not drooling after reading that list of ingredients).
The pork taco was good because the meat was so tender, but the fish taco was the one to beat. The fish was crisp, the tortilla was soft, the lettuce provided crunch and the jalapeno, a welcome spicy kick. Terrific!
As for the quesadilla, not my fave, alas, as the pork pieces inside the folds were tough, and taken as a whole the quesadilla seemed to be missing that extra element to take it into "wow" territory. Instead, try the enchiladas, especially the green enchiladas. Filled with shredded chicken and flavoured with cilantro and onion, the tortillas are topped was so good that I spooned some onto the pork tacos.
After an abundance of tortillas, it was a bit of a relief to try a dish served without a wrapper. We opted for the chicken with mole, paired with coconut rice and stuffed with cheese and chunky mushrooms.
Though I wished the chicken breast wasn't so dry and stringy (overcooked as it was), the stuffing was moist and scarffable, and the mole offered layers of spice and fruit flavours with tingly heat and a less chocolatey taste than one anticipates in a mole (chocolate is the standout ingredient in mole, but truth is there are far more nuts, garlic, chilies and fruit in its makeup). For dessert, there's a silky classic flan served with a coffee and tequila caramel. Yum! The "tres leches," the famous Latin American cake made with evaporated, condensed and regular milk, was nice and moist and topped with plenty of coconut shavings. Thumbs-up.
We limited our beverage intake to cocktails, beer or water but there's a better selection of wines here than expected, though I wished there were more South American - or especially Mexican - wines available to offer even more in the way of discovery. The cocktail list could be beefed up, and the beer selection needs work, as three listed were not available. The Mexican brand that was on the list is about as exciting as a Molson Canadian.
Though no gastronomic event, my night at Emiliano's was a success because the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the people could not have been more friendly. I'd come back here in a heartbeat, not only for the many dishes I have yet to try (the cactus salad ... the chile ... the tamales) but simply to sit back, relax and have a bit of fun. What a welcome addition to the scene.

Full text: Pact that aims to phase out hydrofluorocarbons is signed by 170 countries
? The federal government will pass regulations requiring a dramatic reduction of the powerful greenhouse gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said, after 170 countries reached a deal on the weekend to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons.
The agreement contains binding commitments and penalties for countries that do not meet them, unlike the Paris accord that has voluntary commitments. It is expected to prevent up to 0.5 C of global warming by the end of this century. The discussions occurred this weekend at a United Nations summit in Kigali.
"This is a really good deal," Ms. McKenna said in an interview. "We're really bending the curve [on the use of HFCs]; it's a real practical example of how we can work together on climate action."
She said Ottawa will adopt regulations to reduce the use of the chemicals in the coming years. The government will provide rules and incentives for the destruction of existing HFCs, which are often simply vented into the atmosphere when air conditioners and refrigeration units are disposed of.
The Kigali agreement complements the climate-change agreement reached last December in Paris, where countries agreed to work to limit the increase in the average global temperature to less than 2 celsius degrees.
The new agreement comes slightly more than a week after governments agreed in Montreal to a deal that will eventually mean declines in GHG emissions from airlines on international flights.
HFCs came into common use after countries agreed under the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase out another class of chemicals, chlorofluorcarbons, that were depleting the Earth's protective ozone layer.
HFCs are now the world's fastest-growing greenhouse gases, increasing roughly 10 per cent per year. They are also one of the most powerful, trapping a thousand times more heat in the Earth's atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
Under the HFC deal, countries can petition to impose trade sanctions on governments that fail to live up to the agreement.
While developed countries pushed for an even-tougher phase-down schedule, warm-climate developing countries pushed back, agreeing to a lengthier timeline. But the global chemical industry supports the amendment to the Montreal Protocol and says it is ready implement it.
The rapid growth of HFCs in recent years has been driven by a rising demand for air conditioning, particularly in developing countries with a fast-expanding middle class and warm climates. The Kigali agreement provides for exemptions for countries with high average temperatures to phase down HFCs at a slower pace.
Negotiators in Kigali came away with a weaker deal than the United States and Canada had initially hoped, after India and Middle Eastern countries demanded the longer timelines for their phase-down.
Countries closer to the equator are already experiencing rising temperatures and scientists forecast summer heat waves that will bring intolerable conditions and an even-greater demand for air conditioning.
Ms. McKenna said the resulting agreement is still a major step forward, and it could lead to more action as industry responds by producing more efficient and effective replacements.
"It is not often you get a chance to have a 0.5-degree centigrade reduction by taking one single step together as countries - each doing different things perhaps at different times, but getting the job done," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a release. "If we continue to remember the high stakes for every country on Earth, the global transition to a clean energy economy is going to accelerate."
Under the agreement, Canada and other developed countries would not increase their HFC use after 2018, and would reduce it to 15 per cent of 2012 levels by 2036.
China and other middle-income countries are to stabilize their use by 2024, and reduce it to 20 per cent of 2021 levels by 2045, while India, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia are to freeze the growth in HFC use by 2028 and reduce it to 15 per cent of 2025 levels by 2047.
With Canada now set to begin the phase-down of HFCs, there is pressure to ensure the existing stock of the powerful greenhouse gas is properly disposed of.
Montreal-based PureSphera Ltd. captures and destroys HFCs and other gases used as coolants and in foam insulation in refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners. The company operates in Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and is looking to expand across the country if the federal government acts on HFCs.
Its chief executive, Jean Shoiry, is urging Ottawa to require appliance dealers to charge a fee - roughly $50 - that would pay for "end of life" disposal.

In making room for others, we make room for ourselves - and for Canada

Full text: Our country is huge, but the true measure of its size has more to do with attitudes than geography
6degreescanada.com
Recently, I was on the Queen streetcar in Toronto when a woman pushing twins in a stroller attempted to get up the steps. A man with dreadlocks wearing a pinstripe suit and a lady with a patent-leather handbag rushed to her aid and, after a brief struggle, she landed safely and pushed the stroller down the aisle. The twins, a boy and girl, stared apprehensively at the rest of us. People cleared the seats around them so the stroller had lots of room and the mother could sit.
In Canada we are used to making space. Most of us, or our parents or grandparents, had room made for us in this country. Whether, like me, they got on a Red Cross exchange boat in 1942 that carried 30 per cent more passengers than it legally should have, or were plucked from a Vietnamese refugee camp in Hong Kong in the 1970s and landed in Edmonton in mid-winter, or were flown from Chile to Vancouver after the 1973 coup, or fetched up in Montreal as a deserter from the U.S. Army in 1979 - we were driven here by forces beyond our control.
There is something particular about Canada, with its atmosphere of benevolent neglect, of letting people alone, that makes it possible for those who arrive with nothing, to sense that they can belong and be part of something they can help to construct.
I think it has to do with the negotiation of space. It isn't just that we live in an enormous country, the second-largest in the world. It isn't just because our population doesn't match that land mass. It is because we have come to a country where we have created what Montreal-born playwright Olivier Kemeid calls the empire of the dispossessed. The twins in their stroller, the people who made room for them, are part of that continuing stream. As Canadians, we are all part of the politics of that empire.
My own experience as a refugee during the Second World War exemplifies this. I know very well what it is like to have room made for me, to know what it is like to go somewhere unknown and be taken in. Personally, my family never felt that anyone was making space for us that would not otherwise have existed. So, to me, always, Canada is open and spacious. Canada can welcome others as it did me.
I think this is very profound in the psyches of most of us Canadians. We don't know why we feel that way; that's just the way it is. We are busily creating our empire because we know what it is like to have nothing. I negotiated my space in this country just as somebody who would later come from Dar es Salaam, Ho Chi Minh City or Belgrade would do.
And I am sure that none of us, in negotiating that space, in becoming what we have become in this country, has stayed the same as we would have, had we remained where we were born. The context would have been so different, the conditions so varied, that, once here, we have negotiated something which I call a political space for ourselves.
This political space exists because Canada has given us a wide berth and a lodging that attaches us to something larger than simply our race or our culture or our religion or language. I'm convinced that it has to do with the geography, the space and the climate. We now belong to associations such as parent-teacher, neighbourhood ratepayers, Rotary. We have settled.
Moving beyond our checkered past
With the notable exception of the Indigenous peoples, we are all immigrants to this country. But our history of immigration has been tarnished. If all space is politically negotiated, we have certainly gone through times in which the politics have betrayed our ethical sensibility.
There were also the years when we passed legislation to restrict immigration, such as discouraging the Chinese from entering Canada by inflicting the notorious head tax, evicting Doukhobors from the land they had worked and made fruitful for years in Saskatchewan, and refusing shamefully to take in Jews we knew were being persecuted in the 1930s.
But we have been able to acknowledge these disgraceful actions and, more important, we have been able to change and we have been conscious in making that change. Consciousness is also a political act on behalf of a country. People who behave in an unconscious manner do not know what they are doing and they will hurt, maim and distort the historical context in which they live. What distinguishes Canada from many other countries is that, once we had decided we would be inclusive, we did it consciously, with purpose.
We have learned much of this generosity from the way in which the Indigenous peoples welcomed us: They taught us how to use canoes to navigate the waterways that took us to the heart of the continent we then claimed as ours. They showed us how to live in the wilderness and how to survive the cold.
This generosity made it possible for us to have a long history in giving. For most of my life, we were a country that cared for the world. With institutions like the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), we gave aid in areas such as education, health and agriculture.
Graduates of universities went abroad with the World University Service and Canadian University Service Overseas. In the latter part of the 20th century, it was considered normal to go to newly independent Rwanda or Tanzania and work to establish universities there. We dropped racial barriers and opened our doors to the world.
Our climate has also been a formative force on our national character. Our climate our character. You cannot live in a country with seasons that range from freezing to brutally hot without acknowledging a need for co-operation. After every major snowstorm there seems to be a front-page story about a farmer trudging through the drifts to invite stranded motorists to come and warm up or spend the night.
Reading these stories, we recognize ourselves. In the recent Fort McMurray fire, 1.5 million acres burned and 88,000 people were evacuated. Only two died - as a result of a traffic accident. In 2003, during a scorching heat wave that hit France, 14,802 mostly elderly people died from heat-related causes in their homes. Too few thought to knock on doors and ask if anyone needed help.
For some years now, there has been a phenomenon in coffee shops known as "pay it forward." Someone in line will pay for the next customer's coffee, and that person, in turn, will pay for the next person behind them. Eventually, of course, the chain is broken; someone doesn't pay it forward and the generosity ends.
But the fun is in seeing how long that takes. A few years back, a record was set in a Tim Hortons franchise in Winnipeg. Over the course of three hours, on a freezing morning just before Christmas, 228 people in the drive-thru line paid for the order of the next customer.
These acts are something that grow out of our inhospitable climate and the way in which we were originally welcomed by the Indigenous peoples.
Today, in any citizenship ceremony in Canada (and we have 2,900 a year), if there are 49 new citizens taking the oath, they will come, on average, from 25 different countries. This astounding feat is matched nowhere else. Eighty-six per cent of people who move to Canada stay to become citizens - the highest rate in the world. (The U.S. rate is just half that, 44 per cent.) I believe people take up Canadian citizenship because they know, having lived here for three to five years, that we want them to be citizens. We don't declare love to them, because that's not what Canadians do, but they see that they will be able to be at ease here, that we are willing to include them and that they will be able to live their lives relatively free of rejection and stereotypes.
Immigrants who become citizens take it very seriously and, as the findings of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship (ICC) survey, Ballots & Belonging, indicate, their exercise of the vote shows that. Immigrants who'd been Canadian citizens for less than 10 years turned out 70 per cent for the federal election last fall. Immigrants with more than 10 years turned out at 76 per cent.
Even before becoming citizens, immigrants volunteer at a rate of 38 per cent, which is slightly below the 45 per cent of people (over 15) who were born in Canada. But immigrants tend to donate more time - 162 hours a year, on average, versus 152. Immigrants are also just as likely to donate money, but they give more of it - in 2010, an average of $554 versus $409 for those who are Canadian-born. Even immigrants with lower incomes contribute more - those with an annual household income of less than $40,000 gave an average of $404 compared with $214 for their homegrown counterparts.
As for political engagement, 78 per cent of new citizens indicated in the ICC's survey that they had discussed the last election and searched for information about it and their local candidate. Three-quarters said they'd voted in their first Canadian election because voting is important and they wanted to have their voices heard. Now, 13 per cent of our members of Parliament are foreign-born.
Looking at these statistics, it is evident that the integration process fostered by citizenship is moving at a good pace. Not that we should be complacent. The ICC stats also show that (political parties, take note) only one-quarter of the new citizens had had candidates actually knock on their doors. And because newcomers are seizing upon the space being made for them, Canadian-born citizens should realize that they have to participate as well.
Giving all Canadians their rightful turn
Voting is only one aspect of the way in which we can help people to belong; the important thing about our relationship to each other as citizens and to the nation is the social mobility made accessible through our interaction with others, our public education, and through the democratic freedoms we enjoy.
Within the five or six years that newcomers usually have to wait to become full-fledged citizens in Canada, they learn how to assess what their life will be like if they commit to this country. This period of engagement seems to be particularly fruitful; it has been to our benefit and will continue to be - as of 2030, Canada's net population growth will be entirely attributable to immigration. This will make it possible for us to continue to nurture the kind of society we have established: its medical benefits, public education, cultural activities and, of course, infrastructure such as roads and hospitals.
If we do not have a steady increase in population, we won't have the money required to support all this. We need our immigrants and new citizens to become part of Canada if we are to maintain the country as we know and love it. And we will change and adapt as we receive people from around the world.
For most of my adult life, I have watched people drive through an intersection in my neighbourhood. It's a four-way-stop, and everyone always takes their rightful turn. Never have I seen an accident or someone trying to run straight through.
This is, for me, a metaphor of how we have behaved in Canada: We are willing to wait for our turn - because we know that we're going to get one.

Full text: Â  Louise Charbonneau could have made other plans for her Labour Day weekend, but instead she decided to make the 90-minute drive down to Montreal from Trois-Rivieres.
"I wouldn't miss this for anything," she said outside Ecole Le Plateau on Monday, where Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe gathered with candidates for a party council meeting and rallied his supporters with a 30-minute speech.
"We're here because we believe," said Charbonneau, a campaign director in Trois-Rivieres. "We've been pushing for Quebec to become a country since Rene Levesque. For us, Quebec can't go without the Bloc Quebecois in Ottawa."
Cars decorated with Quebec flags and Bloc Quebecois stickers filled the parking lot outside the school as hundreds gathered from all over inside, using small Bloc pamphlets to wave offthe heat.
Duceppe used the event to rebrand the campaign itself: after displaying the slogan "Qui prend pays, prend parti" around the province in recent weeks, the party will now be running behind "On a tout a gagner."
The party leader stood in front of a majority of the party's 78 candidates as he pushed for Quebec sovereignty and focused on why Quebecers should vote for the Bloc instead of the New Democratic Party.
Recent polls have suggested the Bloc has an uphill battle ahead. The party barely registered in Montreal on a Mainstreet/Postmedia poll last week, and a CROP poll conducted on behalf of the NDP showed Duceppe could be in trouble in his own riding, Laurier-Sainte-Marie.
But in Duceppe's speech, there was little mention of a party trying to overcome the odds or facing the reality of potentially not winning any seats come Oct. 19.
If feeling desperate, Duceppe hid it behind confidence - the Bloc dropping from 54 seats to four over the last decade was presented not as a decline but as a sign of resilience instead, and supporters boasted that his return to the helm of the party this summer has breathed new life into it.
Duceppe mentioned Conservative Leader Stephen Harper a handful of times and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau even less, but described Mulcair as a foil to what the Bloc stands for.
He said Quebecers looking for change in 2011 were "seduced" by Jack Layton but ended up with Mulcair instead, adding that the NDP hasn't done anything for the province in four years.
"For Quebec now, change is passing from orange to blue," he said. "From the NDP to the Bloc Quebecois."
The Bloc leader got most animated when addressing environmental issues. He blamed the federal government for the Lac-Megantic disaster, discussed pipelines and accused Mulcair of flip-flopping his stance on the Energy East Pipeline.
"With independence we'll decide ourselves if there will be pipelines that pass on our territory," he said as he brought his fist down onto his podium, working the crowd on hand into a standing ovation. "We won't let Calgary and Ottawa decide what happens on our territory."
Mario Beaulieu, former Bloc leader, now the president of the party and candidate in the Montreal riding of Pointe-de-L'Ile, said the focus on the NDP is a result of Bloc candidates meeting many Quebecers who are the fence between the two parties.
"We saw a lot of people who are undecided, and who want to vote for the NDP to get rid of Mr. Harper," he said, "but strategic voting in that way can be very unpredictable in terms of results." He echoed what Duceppe pushed for in his speech, which is for Quebecers to "vote with their hearts."
Duceppe ended his speech on the idea of Quebec becoming a country.
"With independence we can establish coherent government programs to help our families, support our regions, train our workers, and take care of our people," he said.
"We have everything to gain by making Quebec a French-speaking country, free and proud in the land of America."
Duceppe sealed his appearance with a kiss to his wife before making his way outside to his campaign bus - freshly adorned with the party's new slogan - where he posed for a few photos with supporters before taking off.
He was heading to officially open his campaign office in Laurier-Sainte-Marie, which he represented for almost 20 years before losing to the NDP's Helene Laverdiere in the last federal election.

Full text: Â  Fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride. Jim Popp may be many things to many people, and few will dispute his record as a general manager. As a head coach? That, arguably, hasn't always ended as well.
So it should come as no surprise, when push comes to shove and he's backed into a corner, Popp will come out fighting, swinging wildly and defending himself - always entertaining, garrulous and, at times, bombastic. There will never be a slow news day around the Alouettes again this season. Stuck for an angle? Just ask Popp a question.
And so it begins again - for the fourth time - Thursday night at Tim Hortons Field (7:30 p.m., TSN, RDS, TSN Radio-690), when the Als meet the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The game marks the latest instalment of Popp as head coach, the general manager stepping in for the popular and well-respected Tom Higgins, fired last Friday, less than 24 hours after Montreal's victory at British Columbia. The Als have a 3-5 record, while the Ticats are the Canadian Football League's hottest team at 6-2, riding a five-game undefeated string. Former Hamilton defensive-lineman Angelo Mosca, now suffering from Alzheimer's, will have his number retired during a halftime ceremony.
"It's never an easy situation when people are popular, whether they're winning or losing. Tom's a liked guy, no question. We're also not winning games we should be winning. Or getting results. He's done everything he can. It's not a knock at him. There were players who didn't like Don Matthews or Marc Trestman. There's always
people who aren't going to like a change. That's understandable. Get used to it. It's life," Popp said Wednesday, holding court with media members for 15 minutes, never ducking an issue while answering opinionated questions about his popularity in the room, ulterior motives and what in thunderation is going on here - a move that has widely been panned.
It's a move - perhaps impulsive reaction - that was made by owner Robert Wetenhall, after consulting with Popp. The GM claimed other options were explored, promoting from within, but this was Wetenhall's request. Popp said never once has he asked to coach when someone else was fired. It has generally been the organization's mandate to have both a GM and head coach, knowing Popp's strength is in personnel.
He replaced Rod Rust in 2001, Matthews in 2006 and Dan Hawkins in 2013. Popp coached the entire 2007 season, the Als losing 10 of 18 games, and he anticipated returning in 2014, Higgins not hired until late February. Popp's overall record, including playoffs, is 17-24, Montreal never having missed the playoffs under him or any other coach. In 2006, the team reached the Grey Cup but lost.
"Tom and I got along great, We had no problems. We worked hard together. We just didn't have as much success," Popp said. "Is there a right time or situation? I don't think there ever is. If we'd have lost in B.C., there wouldn't be near as much made about this. Or had we waited two games. If we were 2-7, everybody would have been expecting a change. It just happened to come after a win. So did Dan Hawkins.
"Sure I'm going to take heat. I'm a big boy. I didn't run Tom out of town. I don't do that to coaches. At the end of the day, if people want to give me crap, that's fine. I'm not worried about my legacy. There's been enough proven and documented," Popp continued. "All I'm concerned about is the players."
The decision to remove Higgins, of course, wasn't based exclusively on his record. Montreal's five losses have come by a combined 15 points, so the effort was there. But it was Popp, a year ago, who had JeffGarcia and Turk Schonert parachuted onto the coaching staffwhile the Als were losing seven of eight games.
And it was Popp who told Higgins how things might improve offensively this season. Nothing wrong with that - but when Higgins seemingly refused to take his boss' advice, there was cause for concern.
And when Higgins, honest as always, made controversial comments about veteran rush-end John Bowman last week, his fate likely was sealed.
"I would hope I have the confidence of the players. I brought every one of these guys here. Everybody has their own opinion. Unsolicited opinions are about as helpful as the bubble gum on my shoe. I couldn't care less," Popp said. "Internally, you're never going to make everybody happy.
"I feel I have great leadership skills. I explained to them what I think needs to be fixed. I've been asked several times to step in under difficult situations. I've been able to show them the way and get into the playoffs. It doesn't mean I wave a magic wand."
With the Ticats unbeaten at home in 10 league and playoffgames over the last year while scoring an average of 36.5 points per game, it might take more than Popp pulling a rabbit out of his hat to stop this juggernaut. Even a speed bump at this juncture might help. Still, Montreal players know they've already defeated Hamilton once this season, at home, last month.
"Everybody's talking about the streak. They're 6-2. The last team they lost to was us," Bowman emphatically stated.
As expected, Als tailback Tyrell Sutton will miss the game with what's being described as general soreness. He's on the one-game injured list. Rush-end Aaron Lavarias, who underwent surgery on his finger, is back on the six-game list.

Full text: Â  Ah, to be young in Montreal, especially now when restaurant terrasses are spilling over with gorgeous twentysomethings sipping cocktails, nibbling charcuterie and relishing a city that Jay Baruchel may be abandoning but the rest of us are heartily embracing this time of year. Politics? Potholes? Playoffs? In summer, who cares? From June to August, Montreal is in deep short-skirt/muscle-shirt mode when the living is easy, the festival ambience kicks into overdrive, and on steamy nights, the lines at the neighbourhood glaciers snake down the streets. Few cities "do" summer better than Montreal.
On an especially sweltering recent Friday, I headed to the Main, or more specifically the strip of St-Laurent between Laurier Ave. and St-Viateur St. that has once again reclaimed its status as the cool section of that iconic street. In the 1980s, this very same hood was ground zero for branche Montreal, and the epicentre was the unbeatably awesome 24-hour bar/eatery/magazine stand/candy counter, Lux.
I've mentioned Lux in this column before - and how I miss it! You'd go to Lux to people-watch and gaze at pictures of Madonna or Sam Shepard in Interview magazine, which you couldn't afford because you blew your money on a bowl of Lux french fries, enjoyed with - gasp! - mayonnaise. Sure, there was The Shed down south on the Main near clubs like Business and DiSalvio's, but the streets around Lux in the '80s felt a little bit like Soho, where you could easily imagine a scene from Scorsese's After Hours coming to life.
Sadly, when Lux closed in the mid-'90s, that scene more or less died with it. Years passed, and restaurants came and went. But now that whole section of Mile End is feeling fresh again, thanks to a bevy of new hip retail stores and especially restaurants like Lawrence, Soy, Sel Gras, Mais, Sparrow and Magpie. As of last November, you can add the new Japanese bistro Thazard to that list.
A term designating a fish belonging to the mackerel family, Thazard is the brainchild of two of Montreal's most happening restaurateurs, Edward Zaki of Chez Victoire, Mimi la Nuit and BarBounya, and Dave Schmidt of Mais, Datcha, Le Mal Necessaire, Kabinet and Maison Sociale fame. The dynamic duo hired chef Hachiro Fujise (formerly of Cafe Sardine) to concoct a Japanese bistro menu. Cocktails were a given, and to further entice the after-hours youngins, from Thursday to Saturday the kitchen service would run until 2 a.m. When the restaurant launched seven months ago, there was a lot of buzz about the French-style gueridon service and hotdogs made from octopus. But on my visit both the service trolley and the octodogs were nowhere to be found. The charcuterie platter and seafood platter from the original menu appear to have been scrapped, too. Yet there's more than enough here to satisfy. Fujise's North American/Asian fusion cooking is presented in a small-plates style, with a steak and burger for those with bigger appetites and three ramen bowls to boot. I'm a fan of this new Nippon wave of casual dining laden with tatakis, tartares and tofu, especially in hot weather where a little spice and a lot of greens make sense. What a treat it was to be in this stunning space filled with young diners feasting on spring rolls, salmon and ramen.
We began with two cocktails, both excellent, if a little on the small side. Thazard's wine list isn't especially long, but the private imports on offer are tempting and well-priced. We opted for a bottle of Muscadet Clos de la Fevrie, a great choice to pair with this food and, at $48, an affordable one at that.
Salmon tataki and green papaya salad were the first two dishes to hit the table. Served with blobs of shiso jelly, green tea-infused oil and ginger-infused balsamic, the squares of slightly seared salmon had enough in the way of flavour enhancers, and a few vegetable chips to add texture. Very nice. The papaya salad was just as good, though I think a little Thai-style heat would have kicked the flavours up a notch.
After a surprisingly long wait (in a half empty restaurant), we were served our first hot dishes: chicken karaage and chef Fujise's take on poutine. The chicken, a house favourite I'm told, deserves all the praise it has been getting. Served in round nuggets with garlic aioli alongside as well as green herbs and kimchee, the chicken was lightly spiced, moist and just great when dunked in that potent garlic mayo. Yes! The poutine was piggier and even more delicious. Starting with a bowl of dreamy french fries, the poutine variation included a topping of kimchee, miso butter and cheddar cheese curds. The combination of flavours was an absolute treat, with a serious dose of tang boosting every bite along with the gooey cheese and perfect fries. I ate the whole bowl. Wonderful.
I guess I should thank the kitchen for the long wait before the next course in order to digest the poutine, yet the room was hot (an upping of air conditioning is in order) and the lights were constantly being lowered. After 20 minutes, I was ready to curl up under the table and take a nap. But then came the Wagyu burger and a bowl of tonkotsu (pork) ramen. The burger was good, and the accompanying fries were again, terrific. But the burger was garnished with kimchee, and by now we had eaten kimchee on three dishes. There is such a thing as kimchee overload; another drawback in using it on the hamburger was that it overwhelmed the flavour of the meat. Why bother using such elite Wagyu when the spicy, pickled cabbage is the flavour that dominates?
As for the ramen, based on a pork stock enhanced with shoyu (soy sauce), and served with pork belly, the classic boiled egg, and leek-infused oil, this version was kotteri-style: thick and opaque, packed with emulsified fats and made from long-boiled bones. Slight smoky and with a rich mouth feel, this version was very good, though probably better as a meal onto itself than the final dish of a long, hot night. I could manage only half the bowl - but I enjoyed every slurp.
Dessert might sound crazy after all this, but we polished offmost of a matcha creme brulee despite it's gloopy texture. I also enjoyed the molasses cookie coated with a thick lemon icing and served with a luscious, spiced chocolate mousse. Yum!
Prices are reasonable, especially as two dishes per person would be adequate (we had three and staggered out stuffed). Thazard also serves lunch weekdays, with most dishes priced under $12 and wines by the glass at $5. Sweet!
Though I still think my generation was lucky to have hot spots like Lux to make us feel with it in our youth, I'm kind of jealous that young people today can enjoy restaurants like Thazard with its slick decor and inventive Asian menu. It may not be open 24 hours a day like my old hangout, but they sure do more with the french fries.

Full text: Â  So what kind of heartburn do you think the Max 67 burger would cause in Boston today?
In the 34 times they've met in post-season series, the Canadiens and Bruins have had some glorious, even historic, battles, Montreal pounding out 25 victories.
Alas, there will not be a 35th this spring, not with the Bruins having gone into a shockingly early hibernation by failing to be among the 16 NHL teams to advance to the playoffs.
So let's focus instead on the Ottawa Senators, whom the Canadiens have met only once in the modern-era post-season, losing an eventful five-game Eastern Conference quarter-final two seasons ago.
That 2013 series began with nauseating niceness between two clubs that are neighbours geographically but which had, at the time, no history at all.
Fast-forward two years, to the 2015 Eastern Conference quarter-final that begins at the Bell Centre on Wednesday, and a nastiness that likely lies in wait.
It was May 1 almost two years ago, on the eve of the opener, that Ottawa's then-captain Daniel Alfredsson stood outside his team's Bell Centre dressing room and reverse trash-talked his opponent.
The 40-year-old spoke glowingly and graciously of Canadiens fans, the energy of the Bell Centre, even about the grand history of the stately old Forum.
Before it ever began, Alfie practically killed the series with kindness.
Indeed, the silky Swede's first career point on Montreal ice had come at the Forum a month before the venerable barn had closed; he assisted on the Feb. 10, 1996, game-winning goal scored by Senators captain Randy Cunneyworth - you remember him - on a team coached by Jacques Martin - you remember him, too.
"Before we had the team (born for the 1992-93 season), people were either Toronto or Montreal fans," Aldredsson said of hockey faithful in the national capital region. "We had a lot of Montreal fans in Ottawa and we're converting them one step at a time. We think this series will go a long way toward helping that, as well."
Oh my, how it did that. A best-of-seven that began steeped in mutual admiration dissolved into bitterness and violence on the ice, fingerpointing, sniping by two coaches, shabby officiating and injuries that overflowed the clinic.
It got offto a horrifying start in Game 1, Canadiens centre Lars Eller leaving the ice on a stretcher after having been knocked out, concussed with facial and dental fractures, when flattened by the high, hard open-ice check of the Senators' Eric Gryba.
The Ottawa defenceman would be suspended for two games, which did little to still the waves.
Then-Senators coach Paul MacLean called Gryba's check "a hockey play," and ruffled Montreal feathers by blaming it on a suicide pass to Eller by Canadiens defenceman Raphael Diaz. Or, as MacLean called Diaz, "No. 61, whoever that is."
Canadiens coach Michel Therrien was incensed by MacLean's apparent lack of sensitivity for the injured Eller, who would miss the rest of the series.
"Inappropriate comment," Therrien said through gritted teeth before Game 2. "No respect for the player who was on the ice bleeding. ... That was a lack of respect to Lars Eller. A lack of respect to his family. And I'm never going to accept that. Never."
MacLean shrugged offthe heat he was getting for referring to Diaz only by his jersey number.
"If that was being harsh, being cruel to the player 61, it's a big world out there. Grow up," he said.
But it was Canadiens forward Brandon Prust who poured a refinery on this fire, asked to comment on the view of the bushy-moustached MacLean that the Gryba hit was legal.
"(MacLean) already showed enough disrespect," Prust said, "so we don't really care about what that bug-eyed fat walrus has to say."
Jackpot. "Bug-eyed. I've never been called that before," MacLean would reply. "That's a new one. Walrus? That's too easy.
"But I'll tell you one thing - I'm not fat. I might be husky, but I'm not fat. I took offence to that."
Did this series suddenly have teeth? It even lost some.
Senators goalie Craig Anderson lost a tooth in the 4-2 Game 1 Ottawa win when he was drilled in the head by a slap shot.
His Canadiens counterpart, Carey Price, lost the bottom of his two front teeth in Game 2 when he was clipped by defenceman Jarred Tinordi's skate during Montreal's 3-1 victory. Game 3 in Ottawa, a 6-1 win for the home team, was a gong show - 236 penalty minutes, including a third-period line brawl and MacLean actually calling a timeout with 17 seconds left on the clock, leading by five goals.
With that, Therrien's complexion became a red you only see in the cartoons.
The Senators swept the last two, 3-2 in Ottawa and finally 6-1 back at the Bell Centre.
Game 4 featured a few eyebrow-raising late-game calls to the disadvantage of the Canadiens on which Ottawa pounced; still, no excuses, as the team's posted motto had declared since Day 1 of the season, the Senators clearly were the superior team.
Many fair-weather Habs fans abandoned ship midway through the third period of the finale back at the Bell Centre, their heroes trailing badly, the arena halfempty at the final siren. Those who fled showed a wonderful appreciation of their team that had finished dead last in the Eastern Conference the year before, rebuilt its front office and coaching staffduring the summer, was building a strong future, then had this shopping list of misery during the playoffs:
Price suffered a knee injury in Game 4 and was forced to yield the net to backup Peter Budaj for the final match.
Captain Brian Gionta was shelved with a torn bicep that required surgery a few days after elimination.
Eller was sidelined, though believing he'd be ready to go if the Canadiens advanced to the semifinals.
Prust missed Game 5 with a separated shoulder, a joint he himself pressed back into place in the corridor outside his dressing room in Game 4 overtime.
Max Pacioretty played Games 3 to 5 with a dislocated shoulder suffered in Game 1 that forced him out of Game 2.
Defenceman Alexei Emelin was watching it all from rehab, having been sidelined in early April with a torn ACL.
The virtually indestructible Andrei Markov - and after his two knee reconstructions, how strange to call him that? - wasn't leaning on the clinic crutch.
"We can't say we're looking for excuses with injuries," Markov said in the wake of elimination. "Every team has them, but the good teams find a way to play (with) them.
"We lost some guys, but at the same time, some other players stepped up and played well (in place of ) them. If we lost the series, it means we didn't play hard enough."
The Canadiens of two years ago couldn't solve Senators goalie Anderson, who had a .950 save percentage in the five-game series, and they were outscored 20-9. Now they face the netminding revelation that is the Hamburglar, Andrew Hammond. Where Price was off-the-charts brilliant all season long, leading the NHL in save percentage (.933), goals-against (1.96) and wins (44), the journeyman Hammond has been magnificent for Ottawa, losing just once in his 23 decisions, fractionally better statistically than Price during the stretch run.
In four games against Ottawa this season, the Canadiens were outscored 14-9, losing three times.
That means less, perhaps, than momentum.
The glass-half-full crowd believes the Senators are a team of destiny, surely their dazzling charge to get into the playoffs being only the start of something magical.
Those with a tumbler half empty will tell you the Senators will be on fumes, having drained their tank just getting to the postseason, and the only direction for them to go now isn't up.
But this is why they play the games. Stack up the Canadiens and Senators any way you like, crunch the numbers to tell any tale you want.
And then remember that hockey, especially unforgiving playoffhockey, is played on ice, not on paper.
Surely, the Canadiens-Senators matchup getting underway on Wednesday can't be as deliciously bizarre as their only series to date.

Authentic Neapolitan appeal; Pizza is main event at Pizzeria Nolana, which has reasonable prices and chic decor

Full text: Â  I can still remember the first time I noticed people getting seriously excited about pizza in Montreal. In was in 2006, and the pizzeria was Bottega. I recall master baker James McGuire telling me that he had been helping the owners, Fabrizio and Massimo Covone, develop a pizza dough. Then came word that the dome-shaped, woodburning oven would be shipped over, brick by brick, from Italy. The pizza wouldn't be the standard oldschool Montreal pie, tough-crusted, heavy on the toppings, usually all-dressed and sometimes even with the cheese beneath - rather than above - the works. When I finally tasted it I thought to myself, "Wow, minimalist." And compared to that old-school Amelio's, Pendeli's or Tasty Food, it was.
The authentic Neapolitan pizza has a soft and puffy crust with burnt blisters around the edge, a bit like Indian nan bread. The pizza cooks at ultra high temperatures (about 750-degrees F) for less than two minutes (90 seconds is ideal). When properly crafted, a Neapolitan pizza can be folded in four and eaten with your hands. At Toronto's Torroni pizzerias, the pizzaioles will not slice the pie in advance because a proper pizza is meant to be folded. (I gotta give it to Toronto, they may not have much of a hockey team but do they ever have superb pizza). As for toppings, less is more - or this pillowy pie becomes soggy. Round of dough, a smear of tomato sauce, a few slices of mozzarelle di bufala, couple basil leaves, blast together under blistering heat, and now we're talking pizza.
Bottega was a resounding success (still is) and suddenly a new wave of young restaurateurs started thinking that on the competitive Montreal restaurant scene, Neapolitan-style pizza was looking like the next big thing. Soon enough, a bunch of excellent pizzerias popped up around the city. There was Vinizza (sadly defunct), Magpie, Geppetto, and Bevo. More recently I've enjoyed the fabulous pizzas at Industria, Pizza n[degrees] 900, and those Impasto boys' pizzeria, Gema. And there are others on the horizon. The most recent pizzeria du moment is Pizzeria Nolana.
Created and operated by Gian Paolo De Riggi and his father, Agostino De Riggi, in partnership with restaurateur Jorge da Silva of the Mtl Cuisine group, Nolana is in the former long and narrow locale (a former lunch counter) of restaurant Racines, which closed last August after only nine months. I wasn't wild about Racines' cuisine, but I loved the decor, created by none other than new partner Agostino De Riggi, who is also responsible for the look of all Mtl Cuisine group's restaurants. De Riggi has refreshed the space making the most of the towering teal ceilings hung with Lambert et Fils Studio chandeliers, antiqued mirrors, bare bones wooden furniture and that fabulous line of tall windows facing the street. There's a bar at the end of the room that includes an open kitchen, and behind that is a Neapolitan-style wood burning pizza oven. The ambience is buzzy and fun, with semi-loud background tunes and diners young and old. Our waiter was a champ, who knew his menu well and despite the crowds, never kept us waiting.
The menu includes sfizi (smallplate appetizers), freddi (salads), salumi (charcuterie), a long list of pizzas as well as stuffed focaccia, a few pastas and as many desserts. The wine list is excellent, with a large number of primarily Italian, privately imported bottles under $60, as well as a few tourist-friendly Canadian selections. Prices are reasonable, but the restaurant is quite chic, making it a good choice for a first date or a family dinner.
We began with a selection of sfizi: eggplant involtini, a frittatine di pasta, panino rustico, and the requisite polpetta di care, a.k.a. meatball. I liked the eggplant, sliced then grilled and rolled round some burrata and set in a puddle of tomato sauce. Classic and perfectly scarfable. The frittatine turned out to be a chunk of fried spaghetti served with a cheesy white sauce and red peppers. Tasted a bit like leftovers, but that sure didn't stop me. The panino was a rolled pasta, filled
with rapini, pancetta mozzarella and sausage. Good, but nothing exciting. The meatball was the best of the lot. Light in texture, perfectly seasoned and served with a vibrant tomato sauce, that meatball was textbook.
Before we launched into the mains, I ordered a fennel and citrus salad. Glad I did. This Sicilian classic rarely disappoints, and this one was so crunchy, sweet and acidic that it wiped my palate clean for the next course to come.
The pizzas are the main event at Nolana, and I would highly recommend the three we tasted. Served on cutting boards with scissors alongside, the pizzas are oval in shape, have minimal toppings and a delicious crisp crust. The first, the traditional margherita (tomato, mozzarella and basil) was just what you want a margherita to be, tangy, chewy and lush. Our wonderful waiter recommended the porchetta pizza that was strewn with thin slices of fatty roast pork, a few dabs of salsa verde and a topping or fresh arugula. I would have liked a bit more here (something spicy?) but that didn't stop me from polishing it off. The third was topped with sausage bits, tomato and nduja (spreadable salami). The cheese on this one was ricotta, and the contrast with the spicy meat was nice, if a bit heavy. Still, the pizzas here are terrific.
We did try one pasta, mozzarellafilled ravioli topped with braised rabbit, escarole, olives, mozzarella and porcini. The portion was small and the price was high ($23), which bothered me at first but by the time this rich dish was finished, I was happy with what we were served.
What I loved here was the way the tender rabbit meat melded with the mushrooms and the pasta pillows. With a few sips of Chianti ... how sensual.
My favourite of the three desserts on offer was a deconstructed cannoli, a little tower of pastry shells, ricotta cream and a swirl of caramelized orange sauce underneath. Yum! I watched my 10-year-old devour the custard-filled bombolone. Served with a glass of sweet milk, these dense doughnuts are perfect for kids, less so for adults looking ahead to bathing suit weather. And then came the Nutella pizza. With a slightly salty crust, thick layer of chocolate/hazelnut cream and a topping of roasted marshmallows, this is hands down the piggiest dish I've eaten thus far in 2015 and hopefully the last. My teeth - and pancreas - are still aching remembering that one.
I'm sure everyone will love it. criticsnotebook@gmail.com twitter.com/LesleyChestrman You can hear Lesley Chesterman on ICI Radio-Canada Premiere's (95.1 FM) Medium Large Tuesdays at 10 a.m., and on CHOM (97.7 FM) Wednesdays at 7:10 a.m.

Full text: Â  This new column focuses on the issues of urban renewal and resilience. It is part of our biweekly Montreal Reimagined series. Luca Barone is a native Montrealer who graduated from McGill University's Faculty of Law and Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He has studied urban affairs and worked in real estate development in both Montreal and New York City.
When the High Line, a linear park created out of a disused, elevated railway, opened in New York City in 2009, I walked along it in awe of its splendid greenery and lush urbanity. But it also made me angry: as a Montrealer, I wanted my own city to make something as ambitiously beautiful. In 2012, I penned an op-ed in this newspaper about it, in which I wrote, "Had such an idea been proposed for Montreal, would it ever have seen the light of day? That kind of audacity would probably have been ignored by developers indifferent to innovative design, or buried under the weight of municipal red tape."
How has our city fared since then? To the observers of municipal affairs, a long-standing source of frustration has been the lag between when discussions about innovative urban policies take root elsewhere around the world and when, if ever, they start resonating here. For a long time, our city's problems seemed overwhelming: corruption, collusion, failing and falling infrastructure, a stagnant economy. We collectively shrugged
our shoulders. What stood in the way of meaningful solutions was that we were not candidly assessing our problems, and, when we were, we did so within the framework of obsolete and dated policy-making concepts. In a city full of thoughtful citizens, few good ideas made it to city hall. Yet out of all that gloom came something transformative: in the past few years, the way both ordinary Montrealers and city officials speak about their city has slowly shifted from resigned apathy to a more productive engagement. This greater involvement from civil society, in concert with a refreshingly active mayor, has carried fresh ideas into the dialogue about our city, exemplified by the Je Fais Mtl campaign (formerly Je Vois Mtl).
The "smart city" initiative endorsed by Mayor Denis Coderre is helping to bring our city back into the global conversation about how to make a good city great. A smart city - a fluid term - adopts a technology - and data-driven approach to governance that uses digital tools to improve all aspects of urban life from traffic management to energy efficiency. Coderre has made turning Montreal into a smart city a priority for his administration by creating a Smart and Digital City Office at city hall tasked with defining Montreal's objectives in becoming a smart city and planning how to achieve them. In late January, the city unveiled the broad goals of its threeyear smart city plan, from free public Wi-Fi to greater municipal transparency. Granting citizens access to municipal data in order for mobile apps or other ventures to be developed is a hallmark of the transparency championed by smart cities everywhere, so this is a good place to start. However, Montreal's smart city initiative is still too young and nebulous to be assessed. One objective absent from the city's initial goals of "collect, communicate, co-ordinate and collaborate" is attracting top talent to work in municipal government. Cities are only ever as smart as those people who are empowered to make decisions in it. San Francisco's Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation organized the "San Francisco Mayor's Innovation Fellowship
Program, which brought four mid-career professionals into the public sector for the first time" in an effort to make working in government "cool again."
Beyond the data-sharing and transparency components of a smart city, Montreal ought to look beyond the obviously digital to make our city smarter. A smarter city is necessarily a more adaptable one, a place that keeps working no matter what unexpected event occurs. In addition to developing useful mobile apps, we need to look at our city as a complex system of interdependent actors and structures to think about how Montreal can be more resilient. A resilient city is one where streets do not close because extreme cold has caused water mains to rupture or where city officials find unobtrusive means to facilitate the flow of people and goods despite a closed artery. Resilience sounds by turns clinical and puritanical, but all it means is that a city should plan for all foreseeable events, thereby making itself a more stable, enjoyable place to live, work, invest and play. In 2013, former American Institute of Architects President Clark Manus highlighted the importance of resilience: "As innovative as a city may profess to be, resilience is a critical linchpin that any 21st century city must fully address. Resilience is the new Green." An initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation called 100 Resilient Cities defines urban resilience as "the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience." Events like Hurricane Sandy and the widespread flooding it caused in New York City underscore the need to design structures that are not only more energy efficient but that can withstand extreme weather. As Montreal's brutally cold February demonstrated, modern cities need to be resilient enough to keep functioning well in the face of challenging conditions like prolonged periods of severe cold.
Last December, Montreal was selected to join the 100 Resilient Cities network along with 34 other cities out of a pool of 331 applicant municipalities. Membership provides cities with the support to hire a Chief Resilience Officer tasked with elaborating and implementing a resilience strategy. Montreal identified its resilience challenges as aging infrastructure, a declining or aging population, heat waves, the risk of hazardous materials accidents (in light of the catastrophic train derailment in Lac-Megantic) and infrastructure failure. Preparing to mitigate the effects of these and other risks by innovative means is of central importance to Montreal's prosperity.
Resilience is a pressing concern in urban governance today because it acknowledges imperfection and seeks to improve city life despite chronic problems. Cities must attempt to remedy persistent ills, but the implementation of most systemic solutions is necessarily a lengthy process - covering the Ville Marie Expressway, for instance, would take a while even with the most efficient project management. Aiming not to make the best the enemy of the better, resilience emphasizes adaptability and working around problems to improve city life on an ongoing basis. Montrealers should be pleased to know that their city government is embracing this concept as we brace for several years of major public works projects.
We do not yet have unimpeachable governance or an urban amenity that compares to the High Line, but at least we have finally begun asking the right questions about how to improve Montreal.

Full text: Â  Climate change is making our winters more unpredictable and, consequently, harder to manage. Within a few days in early January, Montrealers saw 20 centimetres of snow, 20 millimetres of freezing rain, and intense freezing temperatures.The city of Montreal struggled to remove snow, salt the ice, and make the roads and sidewalks safe.
"This is an exceptional situation, and one of the worst that a city could go through in terms of snow removal," Philippe Sabourin, a spokesperson for the city of Montreal, said at the time. "On an operational level, these changing temperatures make things much more complex."
For Dr. Damon Matthews, climate change specialist and Concordia University professor in the department of geography, planning and environment, this is the new reality of a changing climate.
"Winters in Canada have been warming faster than other seasons," he explained. "The rule of thumb in terms of how it affects precipitation is that we're expecting more of it overall, but it's not more frequent. So we have more intense precipitation events."
Matthews, whose research on climate change recently demonstrated that the outdoor skating season in Canada has been significantly reduced over the years (see infographic), says we're especially seeing an increase in variability. "There were some pretty wild swings in temperature earlier this winter,"he noted."That's consistent with how climate change is affecting the jet stream."
Can we confront climate change in a way that's meaningful enough to make a difference? "The challenge is big," Matthews said. "There's no single solution, but there are lots of little solutions." The focus for a number of researchers in Montreal is developing solutions to reduce the impact of climate change.
BEING READY
When the city experiences power outages, in part due to increasingly extreme weather, the search for alternative energy sources becomes a priority. Dr. Pragasen Pillay, Concordia engineering professor and NSERC/Hydro-Quebec senior industrial research chair, is investigating sources of renewable energy already present in large buildings.
For example, processing food waste through large-scale composters and converting it to methane or electricity could be key to creating local power sources in Montreal's city centre. "This could be used for emergency back up power ,"Pillay said. "With these tall buildings, we still need to power elevators and light hallways. Being able to have this kind of energy locally for emergencies would be valuable."
In other words, if we're hit by another ice storm that's as severe as what we experienced in 1998, downtown Montreal would not lose power entirely. In fact, its buildings could generate and store some energy, and possibly even power traffic lights and other facilities.
A waste-to-energy approach also has added ecological benefits. For instance, if food waste is used for energy, it won't need to be carried to landfills. "You could process waste directly in the building, offsetting the building'sneeds," Pillay said. "You'd also reduce trucking needs, the cost of landfills, and the diesel and fuel required to take that food waste to landfills."
Pillay says other countries, meanwhile, are also producing alternative energy from landfills.
BETTER ROADS
Winter-readiness should also be measured by how well our infrastructures can endure harsh weather conditions. To that end, Concordia engineering professor Dr. Tarek Zayed and his team are working to find durable solutions for our roads.
Zayed and his team developed a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) based management system,which provides information about how well the concrete's insides are performing after scanning a bridge deck using GPR.
When bridges in Montreal collapse or start chipping, it's also partly because of winter. "When bridges get older, they have concrete cracks," Zayed said. "These cracks carry the salt and water from rain, which quickly deteriorates the rebar inside the concrete. It'll corrode and rust, and corrosion can'tbestopped. After a while, the bridge becomes dangerous because it cannot carry its load."
The Ministere des Transports du Quebec commissioned Zayed and his team to study the province's bridges using the GPR,hoping it will help them decide how we can make these types of structures safer.
The team is also studying road markings, which, as any driver has noticed, can fade away in just one season.That's because the very tools we use to deal with winter - snow plows and salt - make road markings disappear.So the trick is to find long-lasting materials that won't.
Markings can be made with water-based paints, thermoplastic, epoxy paint, tapes, or Methyl Methacrylate (MMA). "They're different in lifespan," Zayed explained. "Sometimes it's done by water-based paint, which is the least expensive, but has a shorter duration. Usually, at stop signs and traffic lights, they use epoxy,which lasts longer."
THROUGH THE ROOF
Concordia engineering professor Dr. Hashem Akbari is remarkably optimistic in the face of climate change and the extreme winters it causes.
"For the first time, it was documented that the ozone hole in the South Pole was repairing itself," he said. "That was because of the protocol refusing the use of CFCs around the world.It's an example of implementing the science and coming to the expected result."
Akbari has been working on ways to make cities cooler to reduce their impacton Global Warming. He calls cities "heat islands," because their temperature is often about five degrees warmer than suburban or rural areas. His work looks for ways to cool down a city's hottest surfaces - usually roofs and pavements - which cool air temperatures by up to three degrees and improve air quality, both indoors and outside.
Cooling roofs and pavements is a strategy that has a long arm. It causes a decrease in air-conditioner use,it reduces the demand and consumption of energy, and it can cut down greenhouse gas emissions. "Reducing the air temperatures in Los Angeles by just three degrees Celsius is as effective as having everyone in the city drive electric cars," Akbari said.
One solution he recommends is white roofs,which reflects hort wave radiation back to the sky. In principle, they work similarly to rooftop gardens, or "green roofs," but they don't incurany incremental costifa cool roof is specified for the original installation."With roof top gardens, you need to move dirt to the top of building, you need water, you need the structure to support the weigh," he noted.
Roofs are also available in other highly reflective coloured materials, or absorbent surfaces, which can contain water, allowing it to evaporate slowly, and thus cool the air. As for pavements, while more needs to be developed, cool stones are one way to keep these surfaces cold and permeable.
That these technologies are available now explains why Akbari is so hopeful. "We can and we will make a difference," he said. His work on cool surfaces proves it.

Full text: L.A. won their sixth elimination game of the 2014 playoffs and they did it in massively impressive fashion, rolling out to a 3-0 first-period lead and then defeating Anaheim 6-2
? The heat wave engulfing southern California finally broke Friday, temperatures moderating after inferno-like conditions had been burning up the state in the latter part of the week.
Happily for the Los Angeles Kings, their red-hot play in elimination games was in no way affected by the temperature drop.
The Kings won their sixth elimination game of the 2014 playoffs and they did it in massively impressive fashion, rolling out to a 3-0 first-period lead and then defeating the Anaheim Ducks 6-2 Friday night at the Honda Center. With the win, the Kings advanced to the Western Conference final and a rematch against the defending Stanley Cup Chicago Blackhawks, the series scheduled to open Sunday in the Windy City.
"It was definitely our best game of the series," said Kings' centre Anze Kopitar, who added two more points to extend his lead in the playoff scoring race. "We came out strong. We got after it right away. Justin got us on the board pretty quick and we rolled after that. It was a complete effort by all 18 guys that were dressed."
Anaheim's loss meant that all four No. 1 seeds - the Boston Bruins, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Colorado Avalanche and the Ducks - were eliminated by the end of the second round. Chicago, with 107 regular-season points, now gets home-ice advantage for as long as they're alive.
Selanne played a minor role on this Ducks' team, averaging just over 12 minutes per night in the playoffs, as coach Bruce Boudreau opted to go with a younger line-up as the season moved along.
Boudreau, whose record fell to 1-5 in seventh games of series, was his usual blunt self, post-game.
"The first period was like men against boys, quite frankly," assessed Boudreau. "They were bigger, stronger, faster, and seemed more determined. We were on our heels. Everything we said we wanted not to do, we did. By the time we started playing well in the second, [Jonathan] Quick was there to make the saves when they needed them."
The game also marked the end of Teemu Selanne's storied NHL career. Selanne waited until just before the start of training camp before notifying Ducks' general manager Bob Murray that he was coming back, but this season would be it. At 43, in a career that began with a 76-goal season on behalf of the 1992-93 Winnipeg Jets, Selanne will finish with 1,457 points in 1,451 career regular season games, plus a Stanley Cup championship with the 2007 Ducks.
Selanne returned in the hopes that he could finish his career in the winner's circle again, and after Anaheim managed a 116-point regular season, it looked as if he might have a chance. But when it really truly mattered, the Ducks had no answers for the playoff pedigrees of their crosstown rivals.
"I knew it was going to be either an unbelievable big party, or a huge disappointment," said Selanne, of the loss in Game 7 to the Ducks. "There's nothing in between. This time, it was not the party. Very disappointed right now, especially the way we played in a Game 7. That's what hurt the most. We had no business there. The numbers tell everything. That's the saddest part.
"It's a funny game. We had our chances, but couldn't take advantage of them. That's how it goes. Very, very disappointing.
"We wanted to go further. We all felt that we have a chance to go to the next round, and maybe all the way. It's going to be tough to wake up tomorrow and realize it's all over."
There is also a chance that former Montreal Canadiens' captain Saku Koivu, 39, could retire after this season. Koivu sat out the Olympics this year, in the hopes of staying fresh for a deep Stanley Cup run. Koivu said he would for a few weeks to let the sting of the loss dissipate, but he too seemed to be leaning towards retirement.
For the Kings, a trio of former Philadelphia Flyers' players - Justin Williams, Jeff Carter and Mike Richards - led the way offensively, all of them scoring first-period goals against the Ducks' rookie goaltending sensation, John Gibson, who came down to earth the past two games, after opening his NHL playoff career with a pair of impressive wins.
Gibson's night ended when Anze Kopitar scored the Kings' fourth goal two minutes into the second period, at which point, Boudreau gave him the mercy hook and inserted Jonas Hiller. Hiller, a pending unrestricted free agent, was likely also playing the final few minutes of his Ducks' career. Hiller gave up the final Kings' goals - to Marian Gaborik, who scored his playoff leading ninth of the post-season, and then to Tanner Pearson.
But Gibson was hardly the only culprit on the Anaheim side, even as he was widely outplayed by Quick, who lost his shutout on Kyle Palmieri's goal with 2:58 to go in the second period and L.A. up by five.
Corey Perry scored a third-period goal for the Ducks to key a frantic late push, but in reality, his best chance to shift the momentum of the game came much earlier - when he was awarded a first-period penalty shot with the Ducks down by two early in the game. But Quick calmly poke-checked the puck off of Perry's stick as he went in on the deke and 64 seconds later, Richards' goal made it 3-0 Kings, draining the energy from the Honda Center. Home teams are now 1-5 in Game 7s this season.
Ducks' team captain Ryan Getzlaf had warned beforehand, "we can't be afraid to lose" - but in the tentative way Anaheim tip-toed out of the gates, that's exactly how it appeared. The Ducks elected to start Getzlaf against the Kopitar line and the Kings immediately responded by hemming them in for virtually the entire first shift.
It didn't get any better for the Ducks, who were lucky not to be down by five goals at the first intermission, after Slava Voynov hit the post on a late-period power-play and Gibson made a snappy save on Tyler Toffoli. The shots were 16-6 in L.A.'s favor at the end of 20 and you probably didn't need to run the Corsi numbers to figure out who had the run of the play.
"They came out and got some quick goals and never really looked back," said Getzlaf, who acknowledged that nerves played a factor in the Ducks' poor start. "Really tough emotions right now. They came out and played the way they can play. They're a good hockey team. They know what they're doing in these situations.
The Ducks clearly hadn't learned much from last year's first-round pratfall against the Detroit Red Wings, in which they played a stinker of a Game 7 and lost as well.
The Kings, by contrast, had no problem embracing the moment, as they have so many other times in recent playoffs past. Williams, Mr. Game 7, scored the pivotal opening goal and now has an eye-popping 12 points in six career Game 7s.
"I am obviously proud of those numbers," said Williams. "I am certainly not the only guy who has great numbers in Game 7. As a team collectively, we have shown that we are able to get it done. At the same time we might have two more to play this year. We are moving on and we are happy but we know it's just halfway there."
Los Angeles advanced to the Western Conference final for the third consecutive season; the next round features a match-up of the past two Stanley Cup champions. It may not resonate in the TV ratings the way the Montreal Canadiens-New York Rangers' series will, but for aficionados of the game, it should be good theatre, Chicago's free-flowing attack style against L.A.'s buttoned-down defensive approach.
L.A. lost to the Blackhawks in five last year, largely because of injuries to key players, but a healthy Drew Doughty should make it closer this time around. It'll be a challenging turnaround time - opening the next round fewer than 48 hours after finishing up the last one - but the Kings have had minimal travel thus far in the playoffs, which should help, and likely won't have to play the second game until Wednesday night, giving them some recovery time.
"When you've done special things together, you have the confidence, no matter what happens, to do that again," said Richards.
Richards actually made that comment before the game, but it was equally true afterward. On paper, through the 82-game regular season, the Kings aren't a lot different than a lot of other teams - they had 100 points, the same as Montreal. But in the playoffs, their leadership group tends to find a way.

Full text: Meteorologists dislike it, it's inaccurate and it was never intended for widespread use, but Canadians find the term handy enough that they're unwilling to abandon it
? Millions of Canadian weather obsessives spread the lie so easily you'd think they were telling you the Earth is an oblate spheroid.
"It's minus 50 out there!" they'll say, casually omitting that what they're telling you is wind chill - a calculation, not a temperature measurement, invented by North American weather services because their citizens would not accept more scientific methods to tell you to cover up because it is both cold and windy.
Even many weather men and women admit it: They hate the wind chill index, a basic calculation of temperature and wind speed that has spread like a virus and often replaced the actual temperature in weather reports and casual conversation. They hate it because it misleads everyone about how cold it actually is.
"Wind chill is the scourge of most meteorologists because it really skews the picture," said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment Canada.
Wind doesn't change temperature, but it does blow away the thin layer of warm air that surrounds the skin, hastening frostbite and hypothermia. The problem is that the actual chilling effect of the wind varies with sunshine and each layer of clothing, every shifting gust or wind-breaking building or tree.
A jogger running open-faced into the wind will deal with far greater wind chill than a commuter completely bundled up waiting for a bus in a shelter. Both, however, will freeze to death if the actual temperature is cold enough and they stay outside long enough.
Environment Canada's own system of wind chill warnings exposes the flimsy scientific basis of the system: They will issue a wind chill warning in Southern Ontario when the value hits -30 C. In the North, that number is -55 C. Winnipeg is about halfway in between. If the temperature is -45 C with no wind, no warning at all is issued, even if you'd still likely freeze to death if exposed long enough. (The weather service plans to introduce a catch-all Extreme Cold Warning later this year.)
"What we consider cold and what Vancouver considers cold is very different, even if we freeze at the same rate," said Lori Graham, a CTV weather presenter based in Montreal. "But in my experience, people just want the simplest explanation possible - what makes the most sense to them."
What makes the most sense to people may not be the most scientifically accurate, but wind chill warnings blown out of proportion and spread widely have benefits, according to physicist Miguel Tremblay, who studies wind chill measurements and other environmental issues.
He notes the entire concept of wind chill was developed in the 1940s by scientists working in the Antarctic who never intended it to become a popular forecasting tool. However, it's handy to scare people into adopting "appropriate behaviour corresponding to cold temperatures," Mr. Tremblay said. Besides, he added, "it costs nothing to deploy."
Don't expect Environment Canada to change wind chill calculations any time soon. "Canadians love wind chill," Mr. Phillips said. "It's hard to unite Canadians on any subject, but 82 per cent say they will use wind chill. It's almost become personal for them."
Like many tales of Canadian unity, this one reached a turning point in the 1980s. At the time, three distinct indexes of wind chill were in use in the Maritimes, Prairies, and Ontario and Quebec.
A grand experiment was run on the Prairies and in the North to move away from the "-25 C, feels like -37 C" method of measuring chill from wind, into actually measuring how much heat was lost each second over a given surface. However, in places such as Winnipeg this produced weather reports only a science geek could love: "The temperature is -28 C, with a wind chill of 3,000 watts per square metre."
Prairie people accepted the change with their stereotypical stoicism. While "wind chill of 3,200" seems meaningless to most, "farmers would know to go check on their cows in the barn and teachers knew when to cancel recess," Mr. Phillips said. "They took it as a point of pride they were willing to adapt to something more scientific."
But weather fanatics in the East revolted at the new science, and what ensued was a crumbling of national standards.
In Atlantic Canada, wind chill was reported by how many minutes it would take for skin to freeze. (This is a system favoured by Mr. Tremblay, the physicist, not because of scientific value but because it is more useful. It's a number often passed along by presenters such as Ms. Graham, but isn't an official part of Environment Canada forecasts.)
In Ontario and Quebec, people held on to an even more rudimentary calculation than the one used today to say "the temperature is -34 C, feels like -60 C."
"We let the regions use what they want," Mr. Phillips said. "That was a mistake."
In the 1990s, weather experts in Canada and the United States came up with an initial version of the current system. It exaggerated wind chill even more, Mr. Phillips said. "It assumed the exposed person was nude sitting on a park bench," he said. Business people who rely on clients braving cold, such as ski hill operators, demanded the calculation be toned down, Mr. Phillips said. "People were cancelling reservations! Now we at least presume the person is properly clothed and not sedentary."
Canadians have long told themselves lies and misinformation about the weather.
Many early settlers in Eastern Canada believed it would warm up if there were fewer trees around. Montreal, after all, is at a latitude south of mild Paris. They appeared to be unaware of the effects of ocean and upper air currents, Mr. Phillips said.
In the 1800s, when Canada was trying to draw pioneers, government salesmen would go to Europe to try to draw out immigrants with instructions to omit only one word in their presentations to packed halls: cold. Once in Canada, hundreds of those immigrants died of hypothermia each winter.
"Even into the 1930s," Mr. Phillips said, "the papers would have stories that read like sports scores with death tolls."
Today, nobody can say they are not warned.
COLD, HARD FACTS
Colder than Mars
Tuesday, Dec. 31, was the coldest day in Winnipeg in 80 years, with temperatures plunging early in the day to -37.9 C. With the wind chill added, it felt like -48 C. It hasn't been that cold in Winnipeg in December since 1933, and it was so cold it was warmer on Mars. "According to the Curiosity Rover, Mars reached a maximum air temperature of -29Â°C today," the Manitoba Museum posted on Twitter. "Winnipeg's high was -31Â°C."
Canada's all-time cold
On Feb. 3, 1947, the weather station at Snag near the Alaska Highway in western Yukon recorded the coldest temperature ever in North America, -63 C. Back then the village boasted a population of a few dozen natives, fur traders and military airport personnel. That 1947 cold snap set record lows across Canada, including -54.4 C in Norman Wells, NWT, and -50.6 C in Fort McMurray, Alta. Saturday's forecast for the now-unpopulated Snag? -16 C.
Canada's first weatherman
On a very cold late December night in 1794 in York Factory, Man., Peter Fidler, a Hudson's Bay Company man and one of Canada's first weather observers, recorded that gin froze solid at -27 C, brandy at -32 C and rum at -35 C.
When Great Lakes freeze over
The relatively shallow Lake Erie, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron freeze over once every several decades. But for the deeper Lake Ontario and the even deeper Lake Superior, freezing over is rare. Newspaper reports say Lake Ontario froze over in 1875 and 1934. "The cold wave left in its wake a series of events unprecedented in the memory of most," The Globe reported in 1934. "The 45-mile stretch between Cobourg and Rochester, N.Y., was a solid mass of ice."
Frost quakes
Eastern Canada's current extreme cold snap has been a bang. Or, to use the more scientific term, a cryoseism. These frost quakes occur when rapidly declining temperatures cause moisture trapped in cracks in the ground to rapidly freeze and expand. As pressure is released, it can cause fissures, cracks and loud banging sounds. "Very rare, very cool, but very scary," says CBC meteorologist Jay Scotland.
Coldest place, on average
Eureka, a small research base on Nunavut's Ellesmere Island, is officially Canada's coldest weather station. The average annual temperature is -19.9 C, but in February, usually the coldest month, Eureka's average temperature is -38.4 C. In February, 1979, Eureka recorded the lowest average monthly temperature in North America, -47.9 C. For 18 days, temperatures stayed below -45 C. On Feb. 15, the station also surpassed its previous all-time low with a recording of -55.3 C.

Full text: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visit hospital and cooking class in Montreal
? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have no doubt been briefed about Canada's "two solitudes" and, in their back-to-back visits to Ottawa and MontrÃ©al, they got a vivid illustration of just how vast the French-English chasm can be.
After massive adoring crowds in the nation's capital on Friday, the royal couple were greeted by more hostile and modest crowds just a couple of hours down the road on Saturday.
At their two public appearances in MontrÃ©al, at Sainte-Justine Hospital and the Quebec Tourism and Hotel Institute, Prince William and his bride Catherine were met with loud chants of "down with the monarchy" from a small group of radical separatists, and valiant ripostes of "Will and Kate, Will and Kate" from a slightly larger, but more restrained group of federalists.
Because of the protests, security whisked the pair quickly from their limousine into private receptions. There were no walkabouts, no handshakes and barely time for a smile.
"It was really, really disappointing," said Jessica Ma, a Montrealer who waited more than three hours in blistering 28 C heat and barely got a glimpse of the Duchess from her front-row perch at Sainte-Justine. "She didn't even wave or anything."
Outside the downtown cooking school, security was even more oppressive, with police cordoning off the road and the riot squad being deployed to keep protesters and well-wishers alike almost a block away.
The crowd was a strange mixture of little girls in their Sunday finest and seniors waving pictures of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, alongside tattooed, pierced youth brandishing signs festooned with slogans like "Monarchy: Nobody Voted For That" - the groups united only by their anger at being kept far way from the Duke and Duchess.
Seemingly, the only person who came away happy was Mikayla Neves, a 10-year-old Montreal girl who was plucked from the crowd and allowed to present Catherine with a bouquet. "I'm going to tell all my friends I was on TV," she said.
While Prince William and Catherine ignored the crowds outside, they spent an hour touring the neonatology and cancer wards of Sainte-Justine Children's Hospital and then met privately with four patients and their families. In that meeting, both young royals made an effort to speak in French.
Vincent Grenier, a 10-year-old patient in the hematology and cancer ward, told reporters that Prince William told him "Tu es fort" (you're strong) and Catherine, when presented with one of his drawings, responded "C'est super."
The Duchess, who wowed the crowds with her elegant outfits in Ottawa, dressed more conservatively in MontrÃ©al. She wore a grey wool Kensington dress by Catherine Walker, a favourite designer of Diana. The choice was symbolic because the designer died of cancer last year. Prince William wore a navy khaki suit.
For their cooking class, the couple donned white chef's jackets for a brief cooking course and then feasted on a luxurious meal featuring local ingredients, including Lake Brome duck, Ãles-de-la-Madeleine lobster, and Charlevoix lamb, along with QuÃ©bec wines and Inuit tea.
They were then travelling overnight to QuÃ©bec City aboard the HMCS MontrÃ©al, a navy frigate that the British media dubbed the Love Boat.
Yesterday's protests were organized by the RÃ©seau de rÃ©sistance du QuÃ©bÃ©cois, a marginal group of separatists who have made a name for themselves protesting during royal visits.
Dominique Beaulieu, one of the leaders of the group, said the Duke and Duchess were "parasites" because the money spent on their tour could be better spent on healthcare and education.
But there were also monarchists in the crowd, including Gary Sims, who waved a flag emblazoned with a photo of Prince William and Catherine and a t-shirt bearing the image of Queen Elizabeth.
"They don't know their history," he said of the protesters. "If it wasn't for the British influence in North America, there would be no French at all."
But Mr. Sims he has no problem with the protest itself. "It's a democracy. As long as they're peaceful, it's fine," he said.
But Brigitte Lefebvre, a sovereigntist who came to see the couple "because they're cute and famous" was a lot less forgiving.
"Those people are a disgrace," she said of the protesters. "They make Quebeckers look rude and backwards. We should be better hosts than this."
More protests are expected Sunday in Quebec City, where the royal couple is slated to visit a hostel for street youth, City Hall and the old fort at LÃ©vis Forts national historical site.

Brasserie T!
www.brasserie-t.com
The sad clown clawing at the window and rubbing his belly in feigned hunger was only an amuse bouche. Soon, costumed revellers bearing colourful torches paraded into view followed by stilted mummers in enormous gowns. It's festival season in Montreal and Le Grand Spectacle is in full effect outside the windows of Brasserie t!, Normand Laprise's ebullient new restaurant on the grounds of the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art.
Chef Laprise will be familiar to readers of this newspaper for his frequent contributions to the Chef's Recipe column. His restaurant, Toque!, is entering its 17th year and remains one of Canada's culinary jewels. At t! he has eased up on many of the more challenging, labour-intensive and expensive dishes of the earlier establishment and created a classic brasserie menu that's affordable (nothing tops $20 and the amiable wine list has plenty of choices around the $40 mark) and often stunning.
The restaurant is housed in an unusual orange-accented glass rectangle that resembles an oversized bus shelter or an especially fancy airplane loading bridge. It is very bright and very loud inside in a way that you will find either festive or exhausting, depending on your appetite for rambunctious joie de vivre.
That playfulness extends to the menu, which opens with little snacks like fried cheese, fresh oysters and quite creamy devilled eggs - their luscious yolks are piped in in swirls, topped with finely chopped chives and a sprinkle of paprika. A less disciplined diner could make a meal of them.
Before the charcuterie arrives, tiny Mason jars of house-made gherkins and an incredibly thick honey mustard vinaigrette are deposited on the table. The zippy acidity of the former and the smooth, velvety sweetness of the latter act as worthy foils for the excellent cured meats. A dense, porky sausage inside a toasty little slice of brioche tastes like what happens to pigs in a blanket when they go to heaven. A version of pork cretons, the traditional Quebecois breakfast staple, is pretty much pure pork fat and therefore completely delicious.
Beyond the cured meats there are also some excellent raw dishes. The salmon tartare is particularly good thanks to the freshness of the fish and some expert seasoning. Your first taste is of herbs underpinned by an encroaching saltiness that is surpassed by the rich slickness of the salmon and finally a fading chili heat.
Not everything achieves such exalted levels, however. A goat cheese appetizer with roasted beets and a layer of mashed potatoes is oddly starchy and underwhelming, while the pork ribs - cooked as they should be: tender but not too tender - are saddled with an overly sweet barbecue sauce that lacks any real personality.
There was also some dissent at my table over the fries, which are cut a bit thicker than the gold standard (i.e., McDonald's) and cooked until really dark. Some thought they had a great homemade quality to them while the purists felt they were overdone. They reminded me of my French-Canadian grandmother's, so I loved them.
Laprise is not the only veteran Montreal chef to open a new restaurant this summer. Costas Spiliadis, the godfather of Greek cuisine in the city, has also launched Cava, a beguiling and beautiful new spot focusing on the earthy, robust food of the Greek mainland.
Beef is the star attraction at Cava, where primal cuts of Creekstone Farms Premium Angus are displayed like ancient amphorae in a tall, temperature-controlled aging cabinet, the focal point in a room spoiled for elegance. Great bouquets of tiger lilies add colour and a subtle, heady aroma. It is easy to imagine Don Draper and Prof. George Falconer sharing a scotch and divulging secrets at the handsome dark bar. Oval columns divide that space from the radiant duo-chromatic dining room with its thick layers of linen, tall ceiling and gorgeous tile floor salvaged from an old church and expertly refurbished.
A showstopper of a space, it is a suitable setting for Chef Spiliadis, who may be Canada's finest culinary export. His other restaurant, Milos, which has defined Greek food in Montreal for 30 years, has branches in New York and Athens. He is building a cooking school on the island of Kythira, is about to unveil restaurants in Las Vegas and Miami and has recently opened an upscale deli, Marketta, in Manhattan. And his private wine-import business supplies Cava's wine list, which includes such treasures as a vivacious Greek sparkling wine made from the moschofilero grape.
Clearly, though, Spiliadis has not lost sight of what's coming out of his kitchen, as evidenced by Cava's manitaria, a plate of meaty roasted spring mushrooms (portobello, oyster, king, shiitake) dressed with herbs and olive oil and paired with a grilled cube of springy, black-sesame-seed-crowned cheese. It is utterly simple, but deeply satisfying.
A low rumbling, by contrast, announces the arrival of the ham. Wheeled over on a tall butcher block, the Jamon Iberico de bellota gran reserva is the ne plus ultra of cured pork. Aged for 36 months, the black-hoofed leg is clamped in a vaguely S&M-evoking steel contraption and carved tableside. Veins of marbled, golden-hued fat running through the dark red muscle contribute to the sweet and nutty flavours that evolve slowly as the slices melt in the heat of your mouth. It may not be cooking, but it is flavourful beyond compare.
When the kitchen is at its best, as with paidakia (luscious grilled lamb chops piled high on a chopping board and served with definitive tzadsiki) and giouvetsi (supple veal shoulder and orzo slowly cooked together in a clay pot and topped with dry goat cheese shavings), it is sublime. Also transcendent is that righteous, sapid beef, cooked rare and sliced in thick, mouth-watering chunks.
There are times, though, when the kitchen's heart doesn't seem to be in it. A risotto of spinach with dill, feta and mint yogurt is flat and dull, while hortopites (thumb-sized pastries filled with herbs and feta) suffer from a tough phyllo casing. And where the loukaniko sausages should be gutsy and intense, they are dry and mealy.
The denim- and sneaker-sporting staff can also seem at odds with the formality of the room and their lapses in service can feel like neglect: Wineglasses sit empty, cutlery is not replaced before dishes arrive and, when a meal is long over, it's disheartening to have to wave down a server to get the bill.
Also, intriguing dishes such as gioulbasi (a milk-fed lamb cooked for seven hours en papillotte with garlic, pink pepper, throumbi and kefalograviera cheeses) and the seven-course tasting menu all need to be ordered in advance. Cava, though, doesn't have a website, so it's impossible for first-time visitors and out-of-towners to know that these options are available.
Nonetheless, it's a delight to spend an evening in such a lovely room and in the care of such a talented kitchen. For the past several years, Montreal's food scene has been driven largely by new young talents - Martin Picard at Au Pied du Cochon, Fred Morin and David McMillan at Joe Beef, Claude Pelletier at Le Club Chasse et PÃªche and Mario Navarette at Raza, to name a few - so it's invigorating to know that the veterans can still teach the young turks some new tricks.
It is also worth mentioning that, since my visit, one of the city's finest chefs, Carlos Ferreira of the estimable Ferreira CafÃ©, has opened a new Portuguese brasserie, Bar F, just across from Brasserie t! I can't wait to see what this seasoned chef is doing.

Full text: After nightmare loss in Regina, defending Grey Cup champions ready to move on to new challenge
? Nearly a week after the nightmare in Regina, the Montreal Alouettes' defence was ready to put it to rest and start worrying about Ricky Ray and the Edmonton Eskimos.
The opening game of the Canadian Football League season on Canada Day was a thriller for everyone except the defending Grey Cup champions, who squandered a 21-point lead in the second half and lost 54-51 in double overtime to the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Their lead was erased on three consecutive Saskatchewan possessions as quarterback Darian Durant shredded the defence with long plays while piling up a large part of his 478 passing yards.
In the game, Wes Cates ran for 112 yards, Weston Dressler had 154 receiving yards and Rob Bagg had 121.
Safety Mathieu Proulx knows what went wrong.
"After thinking about it, looking at it a lot, what happened is we got comfortable," Proulx said Wednesday after the team sweated out practice in a heat wave. "We relied on our reputation and on the guy next to us instead of relying on our keys and our assignments.
"We kind of let go of the game and each did our own thing. To be a great defence, you have to trust the integrity of the defence and not compromise it by doing something you're not told to do. If you have the A-gap, you've got the A-gap. If you're told to be 12 yards deep, be 12 yards deep. Don't try to outplay the system."
The presumably chastened Alouettes will give it another try on Sunday when they travel to Edmonton to face what may be an even more formidable passer in Ray.
Proulx rejects the argument that the Montreal defence is adjusting to the off-season loss of tackle Keron Williams and cornerback Davis Sanchez, who both signed with British Columbia. The Lions opened the season with a 25-10 win over Edmonton.
Experienced players Jermain McElveen on the line and Stanford Samuels in the backfield have taken over from Williams and Sanchez.
Montreal will be missing another piece after linebacker Diamond Ferri went down with a knee injury, but his spot will be taken by Ramon Guzman, who plays enough to be just like a starter. Jon Banks is likely to move in as the backup.
"That's the most obvious and easy thing to blame," added Proulx. "Our defence has a great group of football players - it's not one or two guys that make the difference. It's no excuse."
It was a wake-up call for the team that opened last season by beating the then-defending champion Stampeders in Calgary and went on to a 15-3 season and a Grey Cup.
With few off-season changes, the Alouettes were favoured to win again, although the opening game debacle has raised doubts.
"It's better to get the wake-up call in Week 1 than Week 18," Proulx added. "When we came to camp last year one of the things we worked on was to finish teams. When we had the lead, to step on them and finish the game. That's something we obviously weren't able to do."
It wasn't just the defence.
There was also the play late in the first half when the Alouettes forgot what down it was and, thinking it was second instead of third, gave up the ball on downs instead of kicking a short field goal.
Saskatchewan then scored a touchdown when Montreal had only 11 men on the field.
So it seemed that everyone was daydreaming.
"We didn't play well enough to win that game," said Als coach Marc Trestman. "We had mistakes on all sides of the ball that went into the loss.
"We spent a few minutes being complacent, we lost our focus and they were right back in the game. I'm hoping to turn a negative into a positive by learning that we now know the score means nothing in the CFL, that no score is enough and you have to play a complete game. We didn't do that."
Middle linebacker Shea Emry said the defence got the message.
"It's something that's in the past - as a team we're all moving on to the next game," he said. "We definitely got our mental mistakes corrected."
The Alouettes hope to have defensive back Mark Estelle back from injury, which would help their pass coverage. De'Audra Dix started in Estelle's spot last week. Fullback Dahrran Diedrick may also return, likely to play on special teams.
The Alouettes picked up former Eskimos receiver Kevin Challenger this week for their practice roster, but Trestman said the Montreal native would not dress against his former team. He said that for now, the 28-year-old needs to learn the offensive system and may eventually get playing time if he impresses in practice.

Full text: Guy Drouin is banking $45 million on the fact that, in good times and bad, people still want to have fun
Limoges is, by every account, a sleepy corner of Ontario. While many of the town's 2,000 residents make the half-hour commute to Ottawa every day, others in these parts are kept busy plowing fields and raising dairy cattle.
Tourists have always been the folks who hurtle along the neighbouring Highway 417 to somewhere more exciting, not even bothering to stop for gas. The region's major attraction is a cheese factory, closely followed by a carefully tended swath of forest that is popular among hikers and cross-country skiers.
But "the coming of Calypso," as the locals like to say, may change Limoges forever. Starting June 7, when Calypso water park opened its doors on the outskirts of town, the quiet streets of Limoges could be filled with tourists. At least, that's the hope of Quebec amusement park veteran Guy Drouin, who is the owner of this sprawling $45-million outdoor entertainment mecca. Planted on 70 acres of recently deforested land east of Ottawa, the newly anointed largest water park in Canada features 35 slick slides and a wave pool the size of three National Hockey League rinks.
If the park meets Drouin's deliberately modest targets, more than 350,000 people will pass through the gates over the three months between June and Labour Day, when Calypso closes for the season. On peak days, Drouin hopes that up to 12,000 people will exit the highway at Limoges, making the short hop from Ottawa or the 75-minute drive from Montreal.
The man behind this water park venture has reason to feel confident. After all, the profits from his first theme park, Valcartier Vacation Village near Quebec City, provided a big chunk of the capital he needed to build Calypso. That's just as well, because talking bankers into lending money to a seasonal business is as difficult as it sounds.
Still, everything will need to go right for the park to stay in the black and generate enough cash to keep its head above water - margins are super thin, utilities cost a fortune and there's always other tourist destinations competing for fickle family entertainment dollars. And then there's the weather (but we'll get to that later).
Drouin is aware of the risks, but he has done his homework. For starters, consumer demographics favour his choice of location in the Ottawa-Gatineau region, where the average family income in 2007 was $75,200, compared with the national average of $68,800, according to Statistics Canada. Even more attractive, says Drouin, is the lack of similar parks within a 100-kilometre radius. "There's no real park out there to compete with us," he says. "There are a lot of museums, but not a lot of outside activities. It's very expensive to do this, but if we can get 25 per cent market penetration, we are doing very well."
Drouin's preoccupation with theme parks has a uniquely Canadian beginning that can be traced back to a Quebec City toboggan hill. It was there, in 1963, that his father, Adrien, began charging patrons a small fee to slide down his rolling hills. Adrien's ambition for the business didn't extend far beyond sledding, but when his son took over in 1971, he modernized the hill, introduced cross-country ski trails and skating tracks, and hosted the park's first off-season event, a motorcycle competition.
Over the next 10 years, Drouin expanded the winter activities at Valcartier Vacation Village, constructing huge inner-tube slides and elaborate skating paths. And in 1980, he introduced water features, taking his cue from the Father of the Water Park, George Millay, "a man who turned water into gold" at his Wet 'n Wild park in Orlando.
"When I worked for my father and took over, I had been in university in Montreal and read a lot of things," says Drouin. "Marketing was new, and we kept being told it was the end of the industrial age and the start of a leisure age. There were very few parks offering water attractions anywhere."
The leisure age failed to materialize, but water parks took off anyway. There are now more than 1,000 of them in North America alone (including city and hotel pools with higher-end water slides), according to the World Waterpark Association. About 80 million people visited water parks in Canada, the United States and Mexico in the summer of 2008, and attendance rose by 3 per cent to 5 per cent annually between 2003 and 2008.
The tide turned in 2009 with the collapse of the economy, and so-called destination parks - those that cater to both tourists and locals - struggled to hold their share of consumers' declining discretionary dollars. Total visits to entertainment parks in Orlando, for example, fell by 9 per cent in 2009, according to the Themed Entertainment Association's global attractions report. But TEA noted that lower-cost regional parks often benefit during an economic downturn, as consumers shift to less-expensive entertainment options. Valcartier Vacation Village is a case in point: Attendance in 2009 rose by a healthy 5 per cent on a year-over-year basis, says Drouin.
His Quebec park has a huge advantage over its new Ontario cousin, however: It is open year-round.
Water parks have become the low-cost way for investors to get in on the amusement park business, says Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services Inc. Parks such as Canada's Wonderland, north of Toronto, and the Six Flags parks in the U.S., would cost upward of $500 million to build from scratch today, and that's assuming the land was reasonably priced.
Both water parks and amusement parks make most of their money at the gate, supplemented by food sales and other merchandise. A pair of adults with two young children will pay about $100 to gain entry to Calypso for a day; for season's passes, the same family will have to fork over a little more than $450. But prying entertainment dollars out of cash-strapped families won't be easy for even the biggest and best-located venues.
Water parks also face a peculiar challenge that Speigel has never been able to figure out. "It is the strangest thing," he says. "People will go to amusement parks when it rains; they'll happily line up to ride roller coasters. But they will not go to a water park, even though they intend to get wet when they get there. You simply have to have sunshine."
The Ottawa-Montreal corridor usually enjoys warm summers. Last year was unseasonably cold, however, making it more difficult to entice people to outdoor attractions. "This year we hope and we pray to see better weather," says Martin Roy, a spokesperson for La Ronde amusement park in Montreal. "It's all you can do-you plan, you add attractions. But if the weather does not help you, it can be a very bad year."
Drouin is well aware of the damage that cold, rainy weather can inflict on an outdoor water park's balance sheet, but he has some effective, if expensive, solutions. The water at Calypso will be maintained at an even 27 C-not quite up to bathtub standards, but comfortable enough that Drouin believes visitors will keep coming even when the air temperature dips. He won't say how much it will cost to keep the water toasty throughout the season, but acknowledges that utilities and labour will comprise his biggest expense.
Theme park consultant Speigel offers his own insight: "What? He's heating the water? It's not often done. And you know why, of course. It's incredibly, incredibly expensive."
The gas-fired boilers that heat the water are about as low tech as it gets in Drouin's park - everything else is strictly high end. The water is forced through fine sand and scrubbed clean every 90 minutes - among the fastest times in the industry. And since children's pools can be a breeding ground for disease if the water is not treated properly, Calypso will refresh them every 20 minutes. Over at the 50,000-square-foot wave pool, concealed fans generate an array of wave patterns towering up to 1 1/2 metres above the surface.
Perhaps the most important technological investment at Calypso is its point-of-sale system, which uses a swimmer's fingerprint to process transactions. When patrons arrive at the front desk, they leave behind their fingerprint impression and credit card number, and simply point at whatever they want to buy throughout the day. Drouin's company developed its POS system with the help of Quebec-based Softicket. Disney uses a fingerprint scanner that prevents guests from sharing their tickets, but only a few other parks have the technology. It's all about getting consumers to spend on discretionary items without having to reach into their pockets - a real challenge when the majority of people are wearing bikinis or swim trunks.
Drouin may be a visionary, but his introduction to the region was nothing short of a disaster. After convincing local officials that the water park - and its 500 jobs - would be a good fit with the community, he gave the facility a name that didn't translate well into French. In this predominantly French-speaking area of Ontario, where people's identity is wrapped up in their linguistic heritage, Drouin made the mistake of naming his park Sunnyland.
Residents took this as an insult, a sign that Drouin cared more about the town's proximity to major arterial routes than its people. The uproar - well, the mumbling - forced him to issue an apologetic press release expressing his desire to see the project "unfold in harmony with the local community."
"We became aware of the comments concerning the linguistic concerns of the region's residents on the choice of Sunnyland and we decided to change it to a bilingual name," he said in the release. "We feel confident this change will help make Calypso park a source of pride for the residents."
While the naming misstep was easily addressed, the locals initially had concerns about "the coming of Calypso" that weren't so easy to fix. They were ambivalent about its presence in their midst, wondering if they really wanted the influx of visitors and traffic problems.
As for the many trees that were removed from the land that Drouin purchased from the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, "we were able to keep that from becoming a distraction by recycling all the wood," says Sylvain Lauzon, Calypso's executive vice-president, who was hired two years ago to manage the development. "It's used in the bridges around the park, and we also planted hundreds of new trees to recreate some of the green space."
Local concerns appeared to evaporate as the park edged closer to completion, and thousands of spectators flocked to the preview days last fall. When an exit sign was posted on the highway, it seemed to spark a realization that the project was happening-whether they liked it or not.
The county's preliminary study forecasting economic spinoffs of about $750 million over 10 years was met with widespread cynicism in the local press, but there are some small signs that the park may act as a catalyst for growth. Limoges now has its own tourist information centre, and thousands of new homes are set to be built around town. And while local politicians aren't convinced the park is responsible for the sudden explosion of construction, there's nevertheless a boomtown feeling in the air.
"Is this park a good idea? I wouldn't do this if I did not think so, and I've been doing this a very long time," says Drouin. "We are close to Ottawa, which has nothing like this. We are close to Montreal. There is nothing else like this anywhere around."
He won't know if the business model is a success for several years, he says - long-term feasibility can't be gauged in one season. Nor will he talk about his target for season's passes, although he's clearly comfortable with the 6,000 of them he has already sold. "We have now sold the type of number that makes it much easier to sleep at night," he says. "Now we wait for the sun, and hope for the best."

A few years back, I was standing in a courier shop, filling out the paperwork to send a Christmas present off to my aunt in Montreal (last minute, of course) when I overheard the clerk behind the counter berating a customer for filling out his form incorrectly. It wasn't so much what she said, as the tone of her voice. Clearly, the customer was making her job more difficult and she wanted him to know it.
Curious, I looked up and was suddenly struck by a vision of irony. There on the wall behind her, in large six-inch letters, was the company's mission statement. I'm paraphrasing, but essentially it said that they were committed to providing the best customer service experience available from any business in any industry. And as if to emphasize the point, at the bottom was the giant signature of the company's president.
Well, I'm not one to let a good bit of irony pass me by, so when it was my turn at the counter, I casually made reference to the sign on the wall and asked the clerk what she thought of it. Her reply said it all. "When you've been at a place like this as long as I have, you learn to ignore stuff like that". Wow!
Now this is a large enough company that I'm certain their people have been through customer service courses. Probably more than one. And the packages all seem to make it to their destinations, so their systems are likely fairly solid. So what's the problem?
In a word, it's "culture". Culture is the compass that guides the daily behavior of people in an organization. Its influence over a business is huge, and yet rarely is it paid much attention to.
One of my teachers is fond of saying, "culture eats process for breakfast". What he means is that while systems are important for driving business value, people are critical. In the case of the courier company, while there likely were existing customer service policies in place, they clearly had little impact on the clerk in question. On the other hand, had the clerk been personally driven to give exemplary customer service, a few poorly documented policies wouldn't have kept her from doing just that.
Every business has a culture, including yours. The question is, "how do you get your culture working in your favor?"
To answer this question, we need to start at the beginning. And every great culture begins with great people. Great people for your organization, that is. And great people for your organization are those who share your corporate values. For example, Brian Scudamore, founder of 1-800-Got-Junk?, says he doesn't try to motivate his people, he hires people who are already highly motivated and then plugs them into an environment that nurtures and supports this attitude.
What describes your ideal culture? Whether you're a fun, energetic team of graphic artists or a cautious group of detail-oriented accountants, you need to be as explicit as possible when you're seeking to build your team, so that you don't waste time meeting people who won't fit in.
To build and keep the type of all-star team you need to grow your value and get your business to the next level, you also need to develop a workplace that offers people the opportunity to grow. In other words, you need to give your people a reason to go to work on Monday morning, other than just to collect a paycheque.
Done properly, this is what Dr. Anthony Williams, VP Corporate Learning for Coast Capital Savings, calls a "teaching organization". A "teaching organization" is one in which people are encouraged to not only learn from each other, but to play an active role in educating, supporting, and helping everyone else to improve as well. The result is an environment where everyone is inspired to look for opportunities to make things better.
At Wardell, for example, we have weekly meetings where everyone is responsible for teaching something to everyone else. Usually it's on topic, to do with business, but sometimes it's something on a personal level that everyone can learn from. When we leave the meeting, everyone has contributed something of value to the company and to each other.
To really make this work, it's also important that you continuously share your plans for the future with new (and existing) employees. By inviting your whole team to take part in building your company with you, you create an inspiring environment, which is exactly the type of place great people chose to work. You'll know it's working when you hear your people talking about the company as if they were owners. For example, instead of saying "the company picked up a big contract this week", they'll say "we picked up a big contract this week". The more you hear the words "we, us and our", the better.
It may take some work, but by proactively developing your culture, you can effectively build a workplace that consistently offers opportunities for your team to grow, to be motivated and to contribute in significant ways to the future of your enterprise. And really, what more could you ask for?

Succession dilemma: Without the right plan, your business is doomed to flounder
Hardly a day goes by without my coming face-to-face with the issue of business succession. Every banker, lawyer, accountant, and financial planner I know talks about it. Seminar after seminar deals with this issue, and all for good reason. After all, thanks to the baby-boomer generation, more than two thirds of independent Canadian business owners are planning to exit their businesses in the next 10 years (Canadian Federation of Independent Business, 2006).
But what we aren't hearing about so much is who is going to buy these businesses. Certainly some will be picked up by competitors, some will be bought by managers, and some will be passed on to future generations. However, the grim reality is that the product of many an entrepreneurs' blood, sweat and tears will simply cease to exist.
To avoid this fate, many entrepreneurs across the nation have begun succession planning. And while planning of this kind is absolutely necessary, it's also absolutely pointless unless the business owner truly understands what effective planning looks like for their business. In my experience, many don't.
Succession planning done right, requires that the business owner develop and execute a road map that proactively "productizes" his or her business into a self-sustained, truly valuable organization. Value. This is indeed an elusive word and one that is much more difficult to measure than the revenues, assets and profits we're all used to reading on our financial statements. It is, however, the key to what makes a succession, successful.
So how do we identify and ultimately drive value? To answer this question, we first need to understand that a valuable organization is one that is independent of its ownership. Therefore, the goal of an effective succession plan must be to transform a business from an owner-reliant organization into a genuine investment. After all, as a potential buyer, which would you pay more for?
Consider the following concept I call the "value pyramid."
It consists of four stages, or levels, of business development. As a business moves from one level to the next, risk is reduced, and the business takes a corresponding leap in value. The pyramid is designed to help a business owner, during the process of succession planning, consider the value of his or her business from the perspective of a potential buyer.
Level One: an owner driven business. In this type of business, the owner makes it all happen. Because this level of business is highly reliant on its owner, the risk of a business losing its profitability following a succession is highest.
Level Two: a people driven business. In this scenario, key people in the company, other than the owner, make the business happen. At this level, succession-related failure is reduced, but still plays a role due to the fact that the key people could leave, and thus take valuable information, and even customers, with them.
Level Three: a process driven business. This type of business is run by systems, which greatly reduce the risk of failure after a succession. At this level, systems are in place to ensure that operations continue according to plan, with or without the owner or key employees, so the business is set up fairly well to run itself. This type of business has more inherent value than the first two levels.
Level Four: a culture driven business. In this environment, the culture (driven by both people and systems) make the business happen. Level Four is considered as close to a pure "investment" as a business can come. Its culture indoctrinates new hires into an environment of continuous improvement, based on systems. The result is a "culture of excellence". This type of business has the least chance of succession-related failure, and is therefore considered the most valuable.
Once a business owner determines which of the four levels they are at, they can then move forward in developing and executing a succession plan that will get them as close to a culture-driven business as possible. Exactly how to go about doing that will be the subject of future articles, but you can start right now by asking yourself, "Am I ready to give up some of my control?" It's a tough question for many entrepreneurs, but it's impossible to move your business up the value pyramid without addressing it. Once you're comfortable, however, you may be surprised at how quickly the value of your business will grow.

How to find the help you need to grow your business
When environmentally-minded Scott Bryk joined his brother T.J. in 2005 as co-owner of Jemev Waste Recycling, www.jemev.ca, he was convinced that their eco-friendly wood processing firm was on the verge of a major market breakthrough.
A series of factors tipped him off, including Ontario's desperate need for solutions to its landfill crisis. Most of that province's garbage was-and still is-being hauled over the border to Michigan. The Walkerton water disaster and an increase in public concern about climate change were other telling signs that a market breakthrough in waste-recycling was at hand.
But what Jemev's co-owners didn't know was how to effectively evolve their wood grinding services into a broader offering. To meet the emerging market need, they would need to venture into organics processing and biofuel development. The necessary developments would be complicated.
They needed a team of senior-level advisors who could guide them through technical and engineering problems, confusing regulatory approval processes, and finding access to new financial resources. They also needed to know how to distinguish between companies in their potential market space that were "green-washing" (a term used to describe insincere environmental efforts) and those actually willing to implement change (i.e. their target market).
Two years later, Scott admits the process of finding and putting in place the right type of working advisory board wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it. Before 2006, Jemev's revenues were in the $430,000 range. By the end of 2007, business had soared to nearly $800,000.
If you find yourself at a similar crossroads, and are looking to install a committed group of advisors to help your business through a critical transition, chances are an advisory board could be a good solution for you, too. But first you must...
1. Admit you need help.
During their "Eureka" moment of 2005, Scott & T.J. recognized they weren't reaching their market potential and they needed direction on all fronts.
For a proud entrepreneur, admitting you need help can be a tough pill to swallow. But once you do, you may be surprised at the quality of people who are willing to step forward and offer their support.
If you know you need help, it's likely because you have a picture of what you want your business to look like but you can't get there on your own.
Scott, for example, recognized his tremendous need for technical assistance. To get an organic processing facility up and running, he faced challenges from a project management perspective, in addition to the numerous regulatory hurdles he would need to overcome. These challenges were further complicated by, as he calls it, "the difficulties involved in being a company capable of generating greenhouse gas credits in an environment where various levels of government are still unwilling to aggressively deal with climate change issues."
Jemev's advisory board provided the expertise that reshaped the company's service offering. Most significantly, the board advised Jemev to focus its services on core business activities, rather than following industry trends and trying to offer a broader recycling focus.
In Scott's words, "They guided us to use existing wood waste as an input to products and services with a greater profit margin."
Combining the wood they processed with organic material from grocery stores, food processing plants and other industries, Jemev has harnessed a powerful, much-needed waste processing capacity in a province that is in desperate need of waste diversion. As a result, the company has enjoyed greater operational efficiencies and increased profit. Thanks to its advisors, Jemev is on-track to reach $2.0 million in annual revenues by the end of 2008.
2. Consider your options
An advisory board may be a good option for your business. But how do you go about finding one and how do you know they will actually provide the careful, helpful advice you are looking for?
For Scott, the process was much longer and more convoluted than he anticipated. And, this is what you can expect as well. Don't let that stop you, though. I've guided many business owners through this process and the benefits are always worth the effort.
Start by writing a list of dream advisor candidates. These could be industry celebrities, local experts, or even unknown geniuses. They might be people you've known about, come across at an event, read about in an industry paper, or met personally at some point.
Once you have a list of potential candidates, pick up the phone and start talking. In Scott's case, he shared his dreams and goals with his prospective advisors. He told them what he was trying to achieve (mission, vision, values) and gauged their reactions. Were they also committed to the environment? What were their experiences personally and professionally regarding the environment? Were they excited about what he was planning to do?
As a general rule, it's important to get a good feeling that you'll have a few things in common with these people outside of their professional competencies, as well. Because your goal is to build a trusted team you will work with for as long as you need advice, which, lets face it, is likely going to be a long time!
3. Find people you trust
The most valuable advice you'll receive from your advisory board will probably be in response to questions that you won't really want to ask.
That's because questions regarding competencies, expertise, and finances make most business owners feel a bit uncomfortable, maybe even embarrassed. We feel we should already know these things.
At an advisory level, you need to find people whom you can really trust, so that in spite of any embarrassment, you can rest assured they will keep your confidence and provide you with the most honest and valuable advice they have to give.
Scott decided to develop a combination of paid and volunteer advisors. Choosing to hire a financial team, Toronto-based Quest Partners Ltd., has helped him feel freer to discuss some of the more confidential financial aspects of his development.
4. Listen
As a group, entrepreneurs tend to be an opinionated bunch. After all, it's their company and they can do whatever they like. The problem with this type of attitude, of course, is that it diminishes the board's value to the company it is trying to serve, causing members to eventually loose interest.
So the best advice I have for someone considering setting up an advisory board is to make sure you are ready to hear what your board has to say. Advisory boards can be enormously helpful to those with an open mind. They can help you see trouble before it hits you, they can open otherwise locked doors, they can bring credibility to an emerging business, and they can help resolve issues with which you have limited experience. But all of this only matters if you are ready to listen.
5. Do it now!
If you know you need advice, find it now. Don't delay.
Begin the process with one or two advisors and build your "dream team" from there. You'll make a few mistakes along the way and not all of your advisors will work out the way you planned, but if you persevere, you'll end up with a powerful resource for taking your business places you once only dreamed of.

Turning personal goodwill into professional profits
Description: When a business owner begins to feel like they have bought themselves a job, something isn't right. That's what the owner of Globe Printers, Ken Giesbrecht, determined in May, 2003 when he realized the non-stop demands of owning his small Vancouver-based commercial printing business were more than he had bargained for. After nine years and many self-described "near fatalities" as the owner-operator, Giesbrecht decided to seek out professional help. His motivation for change came mostly, he says, from fatigue. He was tired of being at the constant beck and call of his business and wondered how "real business owners" were doing things differently.
What's confusing to most business owners is that, in the vast majority of cases, the company's financials paint only a partial picture when it comes to demonstrating true business value. They are important of course, but the main difference between someone who is self-employed and someone who owns a sellable business is not net profit; it is the distribution of goodwill.
Goodwill is a major component of the value of a typical business and forms the better part of its owner's "profit" when it's time to sell. Personal goodwill is the portion of that value that is associated with the owner's name, reputation, contacts, skills and abilities. Personal goodwill, however, is not transferable. And unfortunately, it is extremely common to find that the majority of a business's goodwill value is linked directly to the owner and therefore tied up in un-sellable, personal goodwill.
When I first met Ken back in the fall of 2003, he had two basic goals.
1. He wanted to take more time off in the near future so he and his wife could start a family.
2. He wanted to transform his business into a vehicle for his eventual retirement. At this point it wasn't clear to him whether that meant selling the business or simply using it as an income source.
In the real world, not everything goes according to plan and Ken still has a ways to go if he wants to be completely free of his business. But as the before-and-after stats listed below illustrate, he has made some measurable progress towards his goals and is clearly on the right track.
Globe Printers Vital Stats (over 3-year period)
Revenue Growth: From 1.5 to 3 Million
Net Margin Growth: From 10% to 15%
Number of Employees: Increased from 10 to 21
Number of Managers employed: Increased from 0 Managers to 4
Ken's weekly hours running the business: Reduced from 60 to 30 hours/week
Following is an outline of the main steps necessary for transferring your personal goodwill to your business goodwill.
Step One: Begin with the end in mind
A healthy business is made up of two main things... people and processes. So the challenge of transferring goodwill value is really the challenge of transferring your business skills, contacts, reputation and so forth, from yourself to these two important assets.
If you're like most business owners, you likely already know this intuitively but have struggled with implementation. After several years of owning a business, it's common for an entrepreneur to get caught up in the daily running of the business, and thus lose track of the bigger picture.
The best way I know to get past this is to take a short trip into the future. Get a picture in your mind of what your business will look like once it is running like a Swiss watch, and write it down. Not only will this help motivate you into action, it will form a measurable target that you and your team can shoot for.
How big a company do you want? How profitable do you want to be? How many locations would you like to have? What type of service offering would you like to develop? What will your corporate culture be like? These types of questions can be extremely powerful.
For example, Giesbrecht wanted Globe Printers to become the Fraser Valley's largest commercial printer, without sacrificing his family life. It was a simple goal, but by clearly articulating it, he took the first step towards building the business he'd always wanted.
Step Two: Get the right people in the right seats on the bus
Dr. Anthony Williams, VP Corporate Learning for Coast Capital Savings, once told me that "people eat process for breakfast". What he meant, was that your people have a greater impact on the success of your business than anything else, including your systems. And I agree.
So once you're clear on where your business is going, take a good look at the people on your team. Are they the right people to take your business to the next level? If you're not sure, ask yourself this question honestly about each of your employees.
"Given the chance to start over, would I hire them again?"
If the answer is "no", then make plans to replace them as quickly as possible. If the answer is "yes", then make sure they are all working in the right positions and that they have all of the support and training they need.
With Globe, for example, we developed an organizational chart with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This process then led to several personnel adjustments including the exiting of some employees and the redeployment of others. Some changes, such as the development of new management positions, had to be carefully timed so as not to cause cash-flow problems. Personnel changes are never easy, but if they are made for the right reasons and if they are made in a respectful, open and honest environment, the results can be spectacular.
Step Three: Document your processes
As important as it is to build a company of great people, every once in a while one of those great people is going to leave. And if Mr. Murphy has anything to do with it, it will happen just as you're about to take your first vacation in 10 years.
The only way to ensure that a business will continue to run independently, in spite of the inevitable comings and goings of employees is to systemize it. In other words, to take the knowledge stored inside your head, and inside the heads of your key employees, and to write it all down.
First, develop a picture of the operational workflow of your business from start to finish. This picture will be used to help you analyze your infrastructure in order to determine what systems, strategies and infrastructure will need to be changed or implemented in order to get your business running more efficiently.
Next, begin designing and implementing your individual systems. I suggest beginning with the areas of your business that will give you the "biggest bang for our buck". In Ken's case, we started with his hiring process. It was a labour intensive and overly expensive procedure that was not giving him the results he needed. So we knew any improvement here would have a big impact on the business right away.
Once you develop a clear overview of what it will take to turn your business into a well oiled machine, it's only a matter of diligently putting aside some time each week toward making the transformation happen.
Previous Case Study: How to introduce a brand new service
Description: In the ever-changing world of SEO (search engine optimization), gone are the days when you could fool the search engines into giving your site a high ranking simply by repeating key words over and over again in hidden text. Search engines, especially Google, have advanced to the point where they now look for legitimate content and even penalize sites for cheating to get past the system.
For Rick Sloboda, this smelled like an opportunity. So in early 2006, he left his position as communications specialist and managing editor with Air Canada and took the entrepreneurial plunge to start Webcopyplus, a Vancouver-based business specializing in writing website content designed to appeal to both humans and search engines at the same time, or as they say in the biz, they write for both "humans and spiders".
Sloboda is now facing his key challenge-to make his market position known to the right type of customers. A challenge compounded by the fact that his industry is still relatively new. In response, Sloboda has taken a personalized, targeted approach to networking and resource-sharing. And it seems to be working, as this company is fast becoming recognized as a leader in its on-line world.
Vital Stats:
1. Location: Vancouver
2. Website: www.webcopyplus.com
3. Launch date: 2006
4. Revenue growth rate: average of 10% per month since inception
5. Customer breakdown: 56% in Canada, 25% US, 13% Europe, 6% Asia.
From the beginning, Sloboda has utilized networking, both on and off-line, as his primary business building tool. He has dedicated a great deal of time and energy to connecting with copywriting experts, SEO experts, and marketing experts, in an effort to piece together the knowledge he needed to enter into his newly chosen field.
In my opinion, one of the most important attributes for successful networking is the ability to focus one's efforts. And this is especially true for businesses that pursue untested markets. Not trying to tap every resource available frees a business owner to focus more thoroughly on the researched options that are a good fit. For example, on-line, Sloboda has focused exclusively on Facebook, LinkedIn and Digg to effectively find many partners, employees and clients, leaving MySpace, YouTube, and others to one side for now. And he's taken a similarly targeted approach to networking offline as well.
For example, whenever Rick meets someone who is working with his target market in a complementary manner (i.e. a great web designer or programmer), he learns as much about them as he can. He then looks carefully through his own list of contacts to see who might be a good fit for this person, and makes an introduction. The result is the development of a finite number of "networking cells" made up of complementary businesses and individuals, who are all comfortable working with each other on various projects. Rick then introduces his clients into whichever "networking cell" is most appropriate for their particular needs. In return, of course, Webcopyplus is often automatically included in his networking partners' projects and kept top of mind for referrals.
Following are four (and a half) business networking lessons, drawn from the case of Webcopyplus.
1. Your reputation precedes you: Your reputation is the reason people choose to do business with you-or don't. So, even though you may feel anonymous when you're online, you really aren't.
Being an effective resource-builder means starting with the knowledge that everything you do is a reflection of your business. Or in other words, your reputation never sleeps. Ask yourself, is your business a good representation of your message? Webcopyplus, for example, specializes in SEO. If they didn't turn up on Google's top rankings, that would be a major red flag to their business colleagues and customers.
2. Start by giving Networking, as a form of prospecting, is a relatively ineffective approach to lead generation. Pitching people in a social environment can work occasionally, but the medium simply doesn't lend itself well to being used for direct marketing. That doesn't mean it can't be a great source of new business, however. It's all in how you approach it.
Networking works best when you approach it with an attitude of helping others build their own networks first. In other words, your job is to connect great people to other great people. When you develop a reputation for helping others, people will slowly but surely turn to you as their "go-to" person... someone who always knows the right person for the job. And when the job calls for someone with your expertise, it's highly likely you'll be the first who gets that call as well.
3. Don't waste your time As Sloboda quickly discovered, it's impossible to stay on top of every trend that comes along. Save yourself time and energy by developing a list of experts in every industry you work with, who you can refer to as needed. For example, do you know a great lawyer with industry experience? Do you know a skilled marketer who's earned your trust? Do you know an experienced accountant who understands more than just the numbers? Contacts like these are an invaluable resource for you, your network, and your clients. The trick is to make a list of the types of individuals you are looking for first. That way, when you meet them, you'll recognize them right away as someone you want to get to know.
4. Be systematic and stay organized While networking groups are a great way to get started, long-term success will come from nurturing your own networks. As I alluded to above, the best way to achieve your goals is to invest your time in fostering a referral system that offers real value to all involved. This means connecting with people having mutually beneficial goals and, whenever possible, becoming the go-to person in your network.
At Wardell, we use the term CIA (Centers of Influence Advocates) as a fun way to describe the key people and organizations we're surrounded by or work alongside. These are also the people who can introduce us to potential new clients. Take the time to create a system that leverages your CIA's in the most effective and mutually beneficial way possible. This can be as simple as scheduling that person's name to show up on your contact management software at regular intervals, say quarterly, to remind you to contact them. Then, each time their name shows up, find some small way to do something for them. For example, you might send them an interesting article, you might send them a referral, or you might invite them out to an upcoming networking event.
Another great tool is something we call a referral tracking tree. This is an organizational chart that plots your clients back to their original referral sources. For example, you may meet Bob, an accountant, at a networking event. Bob then refers you to two of his clients who become clients of yours. One of these clients then sends you two referrals, while the other sends you none. In a referral tracking tree, you'd show Bob at the top, connected to his two referrals below him. One of these referrals would be connected to her two referrals directly below her. And so forth. A tool like this makes it easy to see that Bob is either a direct or an indirect source of four clients... and someone you might want to invite out for lunch sometime soon.
4.5 And finally, don't forget your manners Webcopyplus automatically sends a note to say "it was nice to meet you" after meeting a new business contact. It's a nice touch. Recently, the owner of a graphic design firm was so impressed by this gesture that they hired Webcopyplus to assist with a project the very next day.
Previous Case Study: Tilano Fresco
Vancouver-based Tilano Fresco, manufacturer of a diverse line of decorative tile-making kits, offers artsy craftsy people a new play on the old-world art of "fresco". Each kit provides buyers with all the supplies and instructions needed to personalize their project by transferring their photos onto a decorative fresco tile, marble coaster, glass, or canvas (depending on which type of kit is purchased). Because Tilano Fresco's products are not quick and easy to describe to customers, the company has had to figure out less traditional, creative marketing strategies to engage their target audience. www.tilanofresco.com
Vital Statistics:
Location: Vancouver, BC
Number of employees: 7 full time, one part time
Retail stores carrying products: 3,500 in North America, 85% of these are in the US
Years in operation: since 2002
Annual revenue growth since inception: The business quadrupled in size in its first three years. The company then experienced a plateau - in part because it stopped being progressive. The owners are now focused on taking the business to the next level.
Product line description: Currently there are six core products. The company is releasing its largest number of new products this fall, including five new products.
Many unique businesses have discovered the hard way that, in the marketplace, the flip side of being innovative is that people don't understand what you're selling.
For a unique business like this, the million dollar question is: how can I explain my products or services when they are outside of most people's realm of conceptualization?
The answer is not that complicated. As I've seen in my experience working with many companies like this, the most effective approach is to find and nurture a community of enthusiasts who are proponents of what you're selling. You need to identify exactly who these people are and to let them know how much they need what you're selling.
Assuming you have something people need and want, finding the first batch of influential enthusiasts will lead to a chain reaction, well described in Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling, . Gladwell does a great job of showing how the most effective way to promote a new business, product or brand is to become adopted by a group of trend-setting influencers who become fans of your business, and essentially are able to do your marketing for you. Of course the theory is easy. The real challenge is in its practical application.
Case in point - Vancouver-based Tilano Fresco, manufacturer of a unique line of decorative tile-making kits, quickly discovered at it's inception in 2002 that it was selling a product line the mass market didn't really understand or relate to. Based on this realization, the company decided to investigate and leverage its early market adaptors to determine exactly where it should be marketing and how it should be marketing.
Explains Randy Orr, Founder, Tilano Fresco, "We knew we needed to focus on people who did get what we were doing, so we honed in on a community of creative individuals already engaged in "arts and crafts" in various forms. There already were enthusiasts out there who shared our values. We tapped into the community of scrap bookers/designers- people who essentially are looking for creative ways to create art that incorporates their personal lives, and adds to their dÃ©cor. Over the past several years, this initial group of adaptors has been the leverage that has introduced us to and helped us discover new communities of people who are looking for products like ours."
Finding innovative ways to leverage the creativity of enthusiasts has become the foundation for this company's marketing plan. Its initial product enthusiasts have developed into a cult-like following; these people sign up for product updates online and share anecdotes and pictures of their fresco creations. Tilano Fresco has developed marketing strategies that offers these VIP customers free products in exchange for rights to use the pictures/images of exceptional creations (judged by staff). The results of this competition demonstrate to potential customers the extent of what can be done with Tilano Fresco products. Consciously or otherwise, by personally engaging with its customers, the company has strengthened its brand loyalty as well.
Tilano Fresco has also successfully "personalized" its marketing approach with large-scale buyers.
Explains Orr, "Because our product starts out essentially as a blank kit, people need to see a personal connection to visualize just how effective the end results can be. When we introduce the product to buyers, we personalize the kits with corporate logos. And we do the same things with product demos at trade shows and on interviews. Like on , I created a decorative tile with a picture of her Labrador Retriever. She loved the result and was touched at the sentiment behind it. The emotion and surprise viewers saw on air demonstrates exactly what people value about this product and why they would want to give it as a gift."
The case of Tilano Fresco illustrates several lessons that any business should consider, when trying to generate interest in atypical products or services:
Investigate unique marketing channels that connect with your niche market
If you're trying to identify and reach a unique target market, ask yourself: where are your customers? Do they go to fitness clubs? Do they read industry journals? Are they part of any on-line communities?
Your objective here is to catch your potential customers in a location where they will be receptive to your message and recognize the ways you could enhance their personal interests.
When you find appropriate niche communities, get creative about ways to help them recognize the ways your product will enhance their special interests. Nowadays there are discussion groups and clubs, and corresponding magazines/publications, for every type of niche interest group.
The internet has become the great enabler in this regard, with its seemingly ever-expanding set of communication tools, such as Blogger, YouTube, Facebook, and so forth, not to mention a plethora of on-line special interest groups.
In my experience, nothing helps you establish credibility more than an honest exchange of ideas. So make your customers feel important by communicating directly with them, and most importantly, giving them a chance to communicate with you as well.
Develop as clear a message as you possibly can
Part of reaching your market involves developing your product messaging as clearly as possible. This can be a bit of a process, so ask for critical feedback and expect some fine-tuning to be needed.
During this process, remain receptive to any part of your message that confuses people. Use language that is simple and encompassing and fosters key elements that people will find personally relevant. If you have a product like Tilano Fresco, which requires explanation, the challenge is to come up with a succinct marketing message.
Pictures are a great way to help get your message across when a product line isn't simple to explain. They really are worth a thousand words. Throughout this process, continuously ask yourself why you are the best choice for your potential customers. Even when they don't have any obviously direct competitors, we find our clients benefit tremendously by understanding what sets their businesses apart from other similar options.
Once you've developed your main product message, you can then expand on this original statement, apply creativity to get your message noticed, make your message memorable, and drive home your message by hitting the emotional triggers uncovered by your customer feedback mechanisms.
Engage with customers based on your core values
How this is done varies depending upon the company.
Tilano Fresco has learned how to play upon elements of its products that most reflect the core values of the company- creative, artistic, decorative, and quality/history. The company has learned that the personal element of the product must appear relevant and tangible to the customer. It wasn't until they made this connection that sales really started to take off.
Previous Case Study: Dinner Works
Description: Vancouver-based Dinner Works provides a place where busy people can prepare quality, home cooked meals without the hassle and mess of grocery shopping and cooking at home. Customers choose from an assortment of dinner choices, prepare their meals, and take them home to heat and serve later. A wealth of market research along with a business-finding trip to the United States inspired the owners to open shop in Vancouver's trendy Kitsilano in February 2006. They face a slippery challenge as they try to determine how to reach out to an elusive target market and capitalize upon what appears to be an emerging industry trend.
Vital Stats:
Location: One corporate location in Kitsilano, Vancouver; one franchise in Abbotsford, B.C.
Number of Employees: Three full time owner/operators; one part-time owner operator; two on call casual labor.
Revenue Growth: A rocketing start - the company broke even in their second month Revenues have doubled since then.
Primary Market: The primary market has been the US, but Canada is now rapidly growing. The first easy meal preparation store has opened in Australia. Stores are expected to open in the UK and other parts of Europe in the near future.
The ever-important question of "what's for dinner?" has inspired yet another new trend. Dinner preparation businesses are popping up at break-neck speed across North America. But unlike fast food, take-out, or frozen entrees, specialty dinner preparation centres provide quality, gourmet, home-cooked meals prepared on-site by customers themselves who aren't interested in shopping for groceries or messing up their own kitchens.
When the owners of Vancouver-based Dinner Works, first discovered the idea back in July, 2005 there were approximately 250 of these new outlets in the U.S. and only four in Canada. The door was wide open for entrepreneurs seeking to capitalize on this new trend. Today there are approximately 1,420 of these businesses worldwide, 39 located in Canada.
Like any new trend explored by daring entrepreneurs, it's important to determine if the trend will last and to clearly identify the factors involved in reaching and engaging market demographics, likely not yet even familiar with the trend. Canada has been accused of being slow on the uptake, and in the dinner prep industry, this appears to be no less true.
But Chris Roscoe, Owner/Operator of Dinner Works is convinced that the dinner prep industry is a promising trend: "The reason for our initial confidence in this came down to practicalities. My wife and I were visiting a busy mom in California who had great meals on the table every night- even though she was run off her feet. Her secret was that she and her girlfriends went to a large U.S. franchise dinner prep centre called Dream Dinners, to make 12 meals each every month.
"At the time, we were looking for a new business to start and this seemed like a potentially very profitable industry with high consumer demand. We began the market research process and developed our business from there. We chose to open on the West side of Vancouver where we knew we would have a large and affluent customer base."
Some might wonder at first, who would want to pay to go somewhere outside of their home to prepare dinners, package them up and then take them back home to cook fresh and serve. Why not just visit the frozen dinner aisle at Safeway? Or pick up sushi?
According to the Easy Meal Preparation Company of Cheyenne, Wyoming, "Customers who are drawn to dinner preparation centers live a busy lifestyle, often with little time or energy to commit to the evening meal. They must often make last-minute dinner decisions that minimize nutritional value and all but eliminate quality time at the table. While income is a factor, the premium that these customers place on time makes it less so. These customers also appreciate the high cost of labour, as well as the benefits of wholesale buying."
Statistics estimate that approximately 70% of families represent potential customers for this industry. From an income perspective, this provides a huge and impressive market to entrepreneurs like the Roscoes.
"We have a wide variety of customers but the vast majority are working professionals with children. Our customers share the common element of being time starved and they want to have good food that is easy to prepare. We get the full spectrum of people that cannot cook to people who are very good cooks, the latter are even more "insulted" by fast and take out food. Some people use our food for entertaining and most use our meals for every day of the week eating."
The main obstacle Roscoe faces is finding a way to explain the concept to people.
"Because this still a new industry, and quite different from anything else out there, we've found conventional marketing like advertising has been almost useless for our business. Instead we have a PR person who promotes us to the media. PR has brought in the majority of our business, as well as word of mouth referrals and incentives offered to individuals seeking to host private parties at our facility."
Every new business venture is a risk. But the risk is perhaps amplified for those who decide to pursue ideas not yet readily grasped by the mass market. If you are considering a trendy new business opportunity, the following are a few ideas to consider before you get started.
1. Clarify your target market.
A clear understanding of your target market is important for marketing any business, but it is absolutely critical if your business is in a trendsetting category. Start by getting to know your "early adopters". Who are they? Where do they live? Where do they work? Your early adopters are the people who are ready to try something new and who love to tell others about it. They are the key to getting your new business off the ground. Dinner Works is no exception. Roscoe confirms that the success his business has enjoyed so far is largely attributed to referrals and word of mouth traveling rapidly among groups of trendy, like-minded people in Vancouver.
2. What will the masses think?
You need to take some time to imagine what your business will look like as it grows. When your trendy new business category is adopted by the mainstream, what will your expanded customer base look like? How might they be different from your early adopters? Will they use your products or services in the same way? This type of strategic thinking will help prepare you to stay on top of your industry as your market begins to expand.
3. Focus on the media.
When a business concept is new to the marketplace, advertising can loose much of it's effectiveness as a marketing strategy. A big reason for this is that you are asking people to take your word for something they know very little about. Unfortunately, consumers don't typically see advertising as a trusted source of new information.
On the other hand, new trends make for interesting news stories. So the press is often quite happy to tell your story for you. The bonus here is the tremendous inherent value of the third party endorsement, not to mention the fact that it is essentially free.
4. Be financially prepared.
Because they are untested in the marketplace, growth patterns of trendsetting businesses can be somewhat unpredictable. A trend-focused business can take a little longer to catch on, or it can take off like a rocket as you ride the wave to success. Either scenario, however, has the potential to hurt your cash-flow. For this reason, it's important to have fairly strong cash reserves when embarking on a venture of this nature.
Previous Case Study: Kin's Farm Markets
Description: Vancouver-based Kin's Farm Markets, retailers of fresh and specialty produce, have used a variety of growth strategies to grow their business from one to over 20 locations over the past twenty years. Armed with the guidance of a strategic advisory team and tons of first hand experience, the company is now venturing into the world of franchising as a tool for taking their business model national.
Vital Stats:
1. Location: West Coast, expanding to Toronto 2. Launch date: 1987 3. Number of Locations: 22 4. Number of Employees: 600 5. Annual Sales: $55 Million
Kin's Farm Markets is a household name in Vancouver, with annual sales of over $55 million, a network of more than 20 stores throughout the Lower Mainland, and plans to expand across the country. But this wasn't always the case.
The company began as a one-table produce stand at the Granville Island Public Market in 1983. The owners, two brothers recently moved from China, didn't speak English and had no business network to leverage. Yet their dream for a successful business grew into a reality. So what sets Kin's apart from the scores of other business that start small and dream big?
According to President, Kin's Farm Markets, Kin Wah Leung, a commitment to learning has been a big factor in Kin's success. "We had the objective of getting our business to a place where it would not only be successful, but would pretty much run itself. We wanted to grow and we needed to learn how."
When Kin's signed on as a client of ours in 2004, they were remarkable from many other clients we've worked with in that the owners didn't shy away from the substantial amount of work required to get their business in the shape they wanted it to be. They were enthusiastic about the strategic roadmap we created together and they continuously met targeted objectives. Their plan is to expand to 50 stores by 2010 and develop a fully functional franchise model.
"We are now at a point where we feel ready to take our business to the next level and we believe franchising is the logical next step for us," says Leung.
For many businesses seeking growth, franchising can be a good option, but as I tell many of the businesses I work with, it's not a simple solution. The process of turning a business into a franchise requires careful consideration of several key factors. Typically, a business decides to franchise when they reach a point like Kin's Farm Markets where they have experienced success in more than one location and are looking for a systemized method of growth. Franchising can indeed be an effective growth strategy, with fewer of the typical cash-flow challenges associated with rapid growth, once you are up and running. However, several factors need to be carefully considered before determining if it's the right growth model for your business.
Factor One: Consider Your Growth Model Options
To determine whether franchising is a good growth model for your business - or if there are other more suitable options- start by considering the following:
- Is your business duplicable? Can it be packaged into a duplicable model? This is best assessed if you already have more than one location in place. - Is your business unique? - How much direct control will you need over your business processes? - How much of your business relies on your personal expertise? If your business works only when you are there, it's not likely ready for franchising. - What type of individuals will you need in leadership positions as your business grows? - What kind of cash requirements would rapid growth place on you?
Other growth models to consider include licensing, partnering, adding corporate branches, or simply growth-in-place, to name just a few. Depending upon the type of business you have, you might even consider using a mix of growth strategies, as opposed to just one. In fact, Kin's did this by opening a combination of corporate locations, partnership locations, and more recently, their first two franchise locations.
The decision to use one strategy over another will be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your cash position, the pace at which you wish to grow, the type of people you want to attract, and the amount of control you want to have over your organization as a whole.
Factor Two: Capacity for Documentation and Systems Implementation
To be effective, a franchise business should have all of its systems and processes documented in a franchise manual. Essentially, a franchise manual becomes the operating manual for your business and it's a big part of what your franchisees will be paying for. This manual is usually developed to include detailed instructions for running all aspects of the business, including human resources, accounting, production, marketing, sales and everything in-between.
According to Joseph Adler of Hoffer Adler LLP, a Toronto based franchise lawyer, "Franchise Manuals are critical to the success of any franchise system as they serve as a hands-on instruction guide for franchisees and provide franchisors with an easy way to adapt the franchise agreement to the current needs of the system."
Factor Three: Training and Support
Franchise manuals are one thing, but consistent implementation is another. Therefore it's important to have a comprehensive training program coupled with ongoing support. In the case of Kin's, they provide their franchisees with a one month training course, two months worth of hands-on training, and thee months worth of on-site coaching and support.
The amount of training provided to franchisees will vary with the complexity of the business model, of course, but almost never can a franchisor provide too much.
Factor Four: Able to do Homework
Part of owning a successful franchise is related to the franchisor's ability to do some homework- in other words, to be resourceful. It's important to get to know other franchisors and franchisees to get a clear understanding of what the process of franchising will look like for a business like yours.
For example, the Leung brothers spent considerable time getting to know the owners of Cobs Breads, a rapidly growing franchise that's been opening locations in Canada at a rate of nearly one a week. "As a result", says Leung "we have spent considerable time streamlining our operating procedures, making them as simple as possible for our workers to follow."
Joining the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA) is another way to stay abreast of relevant, franchise-related information.
Factor Five: Get Professional Help
Franchising brings with it its own unique set of challenges, so you may need to change up your professional help a bit. Start by getting in touch with a recommended Franchise Lawyer, consult a Business Advisor with franchise expertise, and make sure your Accountant has experience working with franchisors. Most importantly, introduce your new team of professional advisors to each other, because you'll definitely want them all working together for you.
And finally, if you do become a franchise, you'll need a paradigm shift. You no longer sell widgets; you sell businesses that sell widgets. As you proceed with a new understanding of how to market your franchise, consider strategies that can incorporate and benefit all the franchises you represent.
Case Study: Spectrum Skatepark Creations
Description: Vancouver-based Spectrum Skatepark Creations Ltd. specializes in designing and building innovative concrete skateboard parks. Spectrum's reputation for creativity and uniqueness is what sets this company apart from its main competitor, New Line, a larger company with a longer track record and a more traditional approach to designing parks.
According to landscape architect Jeff Cutler of Vancouver based space2place, skatepark development is a five to seven million dollar per year industry in Canada. And in this tightly competitive industry, Spectrum is struggling to compete against a more established competitor while staying true to a vision for creativity in skateboard park development.
Vital Stats:
1. Location: North Vancouver, B.C.
2. Launch date: 1997
3. Number of employees: Three in the office, plus their construction team of roughly 20 (one outsourced company they work with on all projects)
4. Number of skate parks built to date: 60
5. Revenue Growth: Has doubled over the past year
When a business services a niche industry like skatepark building, there are bound to be some specific challenges.
Jim Barnum, owner of Vancouver-based Spectrum Skatepark is all too familiar with unique challenges. The hurdles began the moment he pitched the vision for his first community skatepark to a municipality in Vancouver, BC. While communities tended to resist skateparks at that time, they have since become almost ubiquitous recreational sites across Canada. Barnum no longer needs to sell the idea of community skateparks. The issue now is to demonstrate how his particular designs are set apart from the competition. Especially because almost 100% of the projects Barnum bids on are also being pursued by New Line.
"My challenge is to differentiate our work through the actual project bid. It's a tough challenge for us because New Line has more projects completed- which means a better track record. Because we're working with municipalities, which by nature tend to be conservative, we have a disadvantage in that we aren't the most normal and mainstream choice. When we win bids it's often because the community values something unique."
Metro Skatepark in Burnaby, BC, for example, has three distinct signature features that act as identifiers; the "Rock Gap", which consists of two boulders excavated onsite, the "18-foot Bonsor Pipeline" fullpipe, with its cantilevered roof deck and access stairs, and the "dual steel Sunshades" between the street and bowl sections. Together, these signature features ensure that the park is unique to its community, and is readily identifiable as Burnaby, B.C, Canada when featured in the media. This helps instill pride in the local skateboard community.
Popular skatepark internet message boards testify that Spectrum has indeed developed a solid reputation among skateboarders for unique, creative parks and pushing the design envelope. These same boards note that the designs of Spectrum's competitor appear sometimes to be very similar or "cookie cutter".
Spectrum and New Line both base their design fees on Architectural fee guidelines: a percentage of construction costs, so competitions are based on the quality of their proposals, their track record, methodology and past projects. A standard community skatepark might be around 10,000 sq. ft and cost around $300,000 to $350,000.
Expansion planning is a big part of the skatepark building business. Spectrum says there is at least 10 years of work left in Ontario, estimating that BC is getting closer to a saturation point, though there is still room for many parks in the GVRD. When a "saturation point" approaches, the company will focus more on the maintenance of completed projects and additions needed.
Spectrum has chosen not to work on projects in the US, on the advice of their legal team, North Shore Law, cautioning that the high possibility of devastating personal injury lawsuits is not worth the financial risk. However, the company has recently been approached by teams overseas including France, Dubai, and Israel. Barnum is in the process of pursuing these opportunities with the advice of a strategic advisor. He is looking to partner with a financial backer and go international.
A company like Spectrum provides an illustrative example of several key factors that every business needs to consider in order to effectively set itself apart from the competition. When the competition is close, as Barnum has described above, attention to these details is critical.
Lesson One: Differentiate
Every business needs to have a clear understanding of why and how its products and/or services are different from the competition. If you can't answer the following questions, you most likely aren't competing as effectively as possible.
1. Why should my customer buy from me, rather than my competitors?
2. Operationally, what can I do better than any of my competitors?
3. How can I make my unique market position obvious to the marketplace?
4. How can I maintain my position as a market leader well into the future?
To remain competitive, it's important to periodically review the answers to these questions. The goal is to continuously understand the unique place your business holds in the market and what sets it apart from the ever-changing competition.
Lesson 2: Have a plan B
Having a Plan B offers protection against the impact of economic shifts in the marketplace. And these can be particularly devastating when the market niche is particularly limited, as seen in the case of Spectrum.
For example, in the skatepark industry, a well publicized injury and/or a serious lawsuit has the potential to significantly impact the willingness of municipalities across the country to build skateparks at all. If this were to become a negative trend, it could drastically impact the future of Spectrum's business. Exploring the globalization of his business (plan B) reduces Barnum's risk of being dependent upon one market.
Being competitive requires that a business project well into the future and develop a plan that looks ahead to potential business markets and expansion opportunities.
Lesson 3: Act fast
When the competition is stiff, the importance of moving quickly on opportunities and development cannot be overstated.
For example, when partnership options come up, get advice quickly and move on it. When a request for proposal (RFP) is available, act on it immediately. If your design team suggests something innovative, be the first to try it.
Acting fast is one of the ways Spectrum has grown successfully and stayed true to its mandate for building the most innovative skate parks.
The best way for every business to do this is to develop a strong network of business experts, before you need them. Surround yourself with the best of the best. So that when you need to make a critical decision or take advantage of an opportunity you have a go-to person already lined up and ready to help.
Niche businesses can be risky. But with the right strategy, the risk can be mitigated, leaving you with a fast, exciting business. Or, like Spectrum, a half-pipe dream come true.
Previous Case Study: Babylicious
Description: Vancouver-based Babylicious specializes in hip, modern baby gear collections ranging from bedding to bibs. Rapid growth over the past two and a half years has challenged this small business to expedite significant structural changes and to quickly raise a substantial amount of financing in order to meet retailer demands for Babylicous products.
Vital Stats:
1. Location: Vancouver, BC; manufactured in China, warehouses in BC and the US. 2. Launch date: January 2005 3. Number of employees: 8; currently looking for 4 additional staff 4. Number of Retailers: 350 in North America 5. Revenue Growth since inception: 400%
Rapid growth sounds like a good thing for any small business. But when a small company finds itself in hot pursuit of the mass market, the results are usually sink or swim. According to Stats Canada, approximately 20% of new businesses fail within their first year of operations. This number increases to 45% within the first three years of operations. Why so bleak? Typical culprits are weak management skills and an inability to manage finances. And these factors become amplified when a small business suddenly finds itself needing to grow quickly to meet product demands.
Vancouver-based Babylicious launched its line of colourful baby gear just over two years ago. Within its first year of operations, owner Tina Barkley found the demand for her company's products almost more than she bargained for. Barkley expected $75,000 in her first year, but got $250,000- these figures more than quadrupled in her second year. Suddenly, she was faced with immediate financial pressures related to massive increases in inventory needs. She also needed to find an appropriate warehousing facility and to streamline her shipping system to meet the demands of a growing list of customers.
It sounds like a dream come true, but the sudden influx of business also put a lot of pressure on this small business.
"We hoped for success and expected people to like our products, but we didn't anticipate the ripple effect that sudden popularity would have on the structure of our business. Suddenly we found ourselves face to face with two main challenges: A whole new level of financial pressure and a sudden need to warehouse our growing inventory and find a way to ship our orders more effectively."
As a privately funded company, Barkley sourced some urgently needed cash by approaching a personally-recommended venture capitalist, Brent Holliday of Greenstone Partners, who Barkley touts as "realistic, incredibly smart, and knows corporate fundraising inside and out." This particular VC's experience as a businessman and his knowledge of market values and investor personalities gave Barkley the assurance and guidance she needed to work with interested financiers. Barkley used her personal network of business contacts in a similar way to locate a warehouse that would agree to work with a business of her size.
"This was something I had no clue about. My sales manager Jamie Hampson and I initially started fulfilling orders ourselves out of a small space located in Vancouver. Within four months, we realized our only solution was to outsource to a warehouse. But finding a warehouse that would agree to work with a company of our size turned out to be a major challenge."
Two and a half years later, Babylicious has already beaten the odds and is well on its way to becoming an institution in the world of baby gear. Here are several lessons learned that apply to any small business facing rapid growth.
Lesson One: Join a 12-step Group
Just kidding, but you do need to have a solid understanding of the support group you'll need to take your business to the next level. Your supporters- your advisory team, financiers, Board of Directors, management team, as well as your business and personal networks- will help you ride the challenges you'll face, especially during times of growth.
When you develop your strategic growth plan you must take the time to ensure you have buy-in from key stakeholders. In the case of Babylicious, Barkley continuously consulted with her investors and her advisory team in this capacity. As a result, she was better equipped to meet unexpected challenges like sudden financial needs. Her support group was on board.
Unprepared business owners can find themselves in perilous situations that could have been avoided, such as an influx of orders threatening to outpace the company's ability to fulfill them, or not enough cash on hand to maintain a rapidly diminishing inventory. It's much harder to address situations like these after the fact than it is to invest a little time into your strategy up front. Recent technologies such as on-line shopping mean that a business can literally become an overnight success, but only if it's properly equipped to meet the challenges that come with instant popularity.
It's also very important to know who you can leverage for resources. Time and time again I meet business owners who have found their solutions through their personal and business networks. Babylicious owner Tina Barkley is no exception, her networks served to provide her with the answers to her two most pressing issues- financing and warehousing.
Lesson 2: Know your business and prepare for the occasional "bounce back"
To effectively manage growth, you need to understand your business thoroughly yet remain flexible to required changes.
It's important as a small business owner that you are rigorous about understanding every aspect of your businesses operations, finances and key accounts. You should be able to answer the tough questions, such as what kind of culture are you trying to develop? Who is your target market? How much cash do you need in order to grow? How are your sales systems functioning? What is the turnaround time for orders? And so forth. Questions like these will help you sort out the areas of your business you may need help with.
As a manager, your objective should be to focus on what you're good at, and then delegate or outsource everything else. For example, even if you have a handle on your finances, you'll likely still want to hire a good accountant. You may have creative flair, but decide hiring a graphic designer to design your marketing materials is more effective. No matter how you decide to outsource, continue to keep a firm understanding of the systems upon which the foundation of your business is operating. Especially during times of growth because you'll likely need to access or change these core systems rapidly to meet challenges.
Remaining flexible to change was critical to the growth of Babylicious. Like every business, Babylicious needed to try a few different approaches which required some "bouncing back". For example, in its early stages the company split its inventory between two warehouses in both Canada and the US, quickly discovered this was a premature move, and went back to a Canadian warehouse only. Quick recovery ensured minimal loss. Another key to flexibility is systemization. This may sound a little contradictory at first, but only when things are done according to a plan, can they be altered with any certainty. In other words, a lack of organization does not lead to flexibility, it leads to chaos. And if a business is allowed to grow too rapidly in a chaotic state, it cannot adapt and ultimately collapses. On the other hand, systemization makes it possible for a growing company to "turn on a dime".
Lesson 3: Remain an optimist
There will be great times and there will be tough times, but through it all, the winners never give up. That's what makes them winners. So if you've got a tiger by the tail, as the owners of Babylicious appear to have, hold on tight and don't let go. The ride may get bumpy, but you'll get there in one piece.
Previous Case Study: Lug Canada Inc.
Description: Lug is a small Toronto-based manufacturer that supplies retailers nationwide with innovative travel accessories including handbags and gym bags. Owners Ami Davie and Jason Richter merged their creative backgrounds to develop the Lug travel product line. The company has rapidly grown their sales across North America by working with outsourced sales reps. ( www.lugtravel.com)
Vital Stats: 1. Location: Head offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Dallas, Texas. Products are manufactured overseas. 2. Launch date: 2004 3. Number of employees: 9 4. Number of Retailers: 500 plus in North America 5. Number of Sales Reps: 17 in Canada, 50 in the US 6. Years outsourcing sales: Since inception
The goal of every manufacturer is to develop an excellent product or product line and sell it like crazy. But getting a new product line out to the mass market can be daunting, especially for a small business learning how to deal with the daily challenges of launching a new company.
In a short three-year time span, Toronto-based Lug Inc. has successfully launched its line of travel accessories into 500 plus retail locations across North America. How did they do it? According to Ami Davie, co-owner of Lug with partner Jason Richter, "Using outsourced sales reps has been the only way for us to quickly get our products into retailers across North America and develop a nationwide presence."
Davie explains, "As a small business, there is no other way we would have had the time or resources to grow our sales as quickly as we have. Working with sales reps has been a critical part of our sales, and we've also relied on our reps as consultants for important sales-related information and to help ensure our products land in the right type of stores."
Admittedly, the process of finding and developing rep groups has been time consuming for this small company. Co-owner Jason Richter elaborates, "Finding the right reps has required that we go out and visit show rooms, ask around to other manufacturers to help us better understand the product lines it makes sense to align with, and actually talk to our retailers to find who they like working with. Those referrals have pointed us to the best rep groups to work with."
Typically, when a manufacturer decides to outsource their sales, they look for established, reputable sales teams/agencies usually who already have relationships with the types of retailers they want selling their products. Because sales agents carry multiple product lines, the main challenge faced by manufacturers is getting reps to promote their products above or on par with the other lines they are carrying.
According to Davie, "With every rep group we come across, there are strong agents and not so strong agents so we do what we can to help make their sales presentations as effective as possible by providing a solid sales rep kit, consisting of the product, press, catalogues, etc. The key here is to build a relationship with each individual rep and make a personal connection while supplying the most up-to-date product information. This serves to establish clear lines of communication and equip reps to sell the product."
A brief case study of Lug's three-year journey down the outsourced sales rep path reveals there are several things that every manufacturer should note when choosing to outsource sales.
Lesson One: Take the time to consider your options
Determine whether your business will be best served by a sales force that is focused exclusively on your products or one that already carries multiple product lines to your target buyers. While exclusive reps can rapidly become experts in your field and offer a high level of energy and focus, established sales teams have the potential to put your products in front of a group of qualified buyers almost instantly.
If you decide to work with established teams, like Lug did (most manufacturers chose this route), you'll need to carefully consider the types of sales agencies that are best aligned with your particular product/product line. For example, Lug found that their travel accessories aligned well with reps specializing in the gift industry, as well as those carrying other complimentary product lines such as stationery or jewelry.
And while you're considering the types of product lines you fit best with, make sure you find out which groups have the best professional reputation, and which are already selling to or have the capacity to sell to the buyers you want to reach. Lug has found it strategic to work with the same rep groups as their competitors, since they're targeting similar retailers.
With each new territory you decide to expand into, expect some trial and error with respect to the relationships and types of new reps you work with. The turnover rate within rep groups is a telling sign here. If reps have generally been with their group for a steady amount of time, that's a good sign. They'll better understand the needs of retailers and likely have a better success rate selling your products.
Lesson 2: Outline your expectations
Once you've found a suitable rep group to work with, it's a good idea to develop a contract, establish a three month trial period and outline exactly what your expectations are during that time. Include things like your minimum sales expectations, reporting schedules, and compensation details. Because reps are based on commission, they can be a very cost effective way to grow sales. Industry standard in the gift industry, for example, is 15-17.5% of sales. However, you need to be careful you don't waste a lot of time managing your relationships with unprofitable reps, a trap many fall into that can be avoided up front by clear communications.
One unnamed Vancouver-based clothing manufacturer ended up spending thousands of dollars and resources trying to nurture a relationship with a Quebec-based sales agent who ended up opening only two accounts in one year. The time spent flying across the country to meet the rep, training and sending products, not to mention lost business that could have been developed during that year, was a financial strain that this small, company really couldn't afford at that time.
Lesson 3: Motivate your reps
A sales agent can only sell a product successfully if they know and hopefully have an appreciation for the product they represent. It's up to you as the business owner to motivate your reps to believe in and sell your products as long as they are working for you.
You can do this by providing materials that will educate your reps - such as product news or updates; supplying reps with an ample stock of demos; and offering incentives such as a strong commission structure. Of course you also need to make sure your reps know the features that determine why retailers will want to buy your products in the first place. So take the time to educate them and answer their questions. Remember, it's a two-way street. The more support you can provide reps for selling your products, the better job they'll do when selling your products to others.

Vital Stats: 1. Location: Vancouver, BC 2. Launch date: 1998 3. Revenues: Sales have almost tripled over the past six years. 4. Number of locations: 1 5. Number of employees: 4 6. Recent media attention: Growing strong
Sustainability is no longer the little brother of mainstream business. In fact, sustainable businesses are popping up all over the place; a movement due in part to the fact that sustainability itself is gaining broad appeal among the mainstream population.
Witness the launch of environmentally friendly clothing lines by companies like Levis and H&M, and eco-friendly makeup by designers like Stella McCartney. Clearly, Hippies and tree huggers aren't the only ones who care about the ways sustainability factors into our daily purchases.
While some say the popularity of sustainability is more about perception than ethics, the fact that CEO's everywhere have the phrase "triple bottom line" on the tip of their tongues tells us that sustainability can indeed be profitable. This phrase indicates that a broader spectrum of corporate values is taking shape. Measuring the success of a business means considering social and environmental impacts, as well as economic profitability.
Vancouver-based Industrial Artifacts (IA) is an interesting case study of a small, sustainable-minded pioneer on the eco-friendly front.
Launched in 1988, owner/designer Ross McMillan set out with a simple goal: to create innovative designer furniture and home accents without damaging the environment.
McMillan's business plan proceeded with a commitment to making designer products using solely wasted materials. He began by actively researching the possible avenues he could explore to acquire quality, free production materials. Networking was (and still is) an important part of his plan. McMillan developed a network of production resources, such as construction site contacts, who call him when they have appropriate materials available. He also developed a business network of like-minded artisans to encourage one another to remain innovative on the sustainability front. It helps that McMillan is also the manager and curator of an art gallery.
Industrial Artifacts has successfully incorporated sustainable ethics into its marketing by providing a story with each purchase, that lets people know how recycled materials are (and can be) used in every creation.
Business planning and goal setting, McMillan admits, have not been the strongest area of his business development. Since developing a more strategic plan six years ago, the overall profitability of this small company has increased, as evidenced by a tripling of revenues over the past six years.
Consider the following lessons drawn from the growth of Industrial Artifacts. These lessons can be applied to any business seeking to be both sustainable and profitable.
LESSON 1: Develop a clear corporate vision that weighs all costs.
Any business that chooses to operate on principles of sustainability instantly has the advantage of a built-in mission statement, and one that will likely resonate well in today's increasingly image conscious, mass marketplace.
But because your sustainable products are likely more costly than the non-sustainable alternatives, it's essential that you understand how much more people will actually be willing to spend to make that eco-friendly purchase. Develop your vision from this place. You need to identify where your market is shopping and then clearly and specifically articulate to this group why they should feel good about buying from you in particular.
Industrial Artifacts has found that people will pay on average 15-20% extra for their environmentally sensitive products. Over the past two years especially, they have noticed that people are willing to spend more on a piece of their furniture if they know it's made responsibly and locally.
LESSON 2: Be consistent (don't try to fool the hippies).
If your business really is about sustainability, you need to ensure all aspects of your operations, like your packaging and production methods, are consistent with your mission statement.
For example, if you're selling organic frozen food, don't make it microwaveable. This will conflict with the "natural" image you're trying to achieve. More importantly, make sure you are using recycled packaging produced in environmentally friendly ways. These are the details that eco-conscious consumers will notice and weigh when deciding which types of products to buy. Make sure they have every reason to feel good about yours.
Industrial Artifacts has effectively incorporated its vision into every aspect of production and marketing. "With each design, we include a First-Life Description that preserves the story of its former industrial use. We all need to be better educated on how easy it is to make small changes in our life which can create very positive changes for the whole world, especially when others choose to make more sustainable choices with us."
LESSON 3: Plan for the long-term (run your business like a pro).
Many sustainable minded businesses begin with a great idea and proceed with production. Industrial Artifacts was one of them. McMillan acknowledges that a lack of planning was his weak point, "A 'creative' by nature, I needed to turn to professionals to put the systems in place that have better equipped me to run the business efficiently. Being better organized has allowed me to focus more on the creative aspects, which is what I wanted to do from the beginning." It took him a few years to gain this realization and put an effective system in place. Profitability followed suit.
It's very typical for a business owner to specialize in his or her trade or service, but not in business management. As a business owner, you need to remind yourself that you can't afford not to take the time to create a long-term strategic plan for your business. You need to develop a roadmap that will ensure you reach your goals. So take the time to research the market, identify niche marketing groups, plan for a longer sales cycle (sometime sustainable products take longer to be reused) and whatever other elements of your business require planning and consideration.
As a result of better planning, McMillan now has more time to focus on his designs and increase his distribution to large urban markets in the United States
LESSON 4: If you want to help the world, then let the world know.
If you're a sustainable business, you shouldn't be operating in a bubble. You're already making a difference, so it's important you let the eco-friendly community and everyone else know about it.
Industrial Artifacts did several things right in this regard. First, McMillan was instrumental in bringing the first Sustainable living Expo in North America to Vancouver. As a sustainable business, you too should be researching and leveraging the networks of sustainable-based coalitions and groups you can join to let people know what you're doing.
The internet is a big tool in this regard. McMillan leveraged the web by creating an interactive online network to promote sustainability and educate people about ways to buy sustainable products (www.betterwaytolive.net), like a Craigslist for sustainable living. It's important to align your business with a sustainable community.
There are a growing numbers of consumers using the internet to find ways to make more environmentally friendly choices, so make sure they know where to find you.
There are many steps any business can take to have a positive social and environmental impact while at the same time becoming a profitable enterprise. But it's important to remember that sustainability should be an addition to the overall goal your business has of creating top quality products or services, not an end in itself. Done right, social capitalism can be a winning strategy for all of us.
PREVIOUS CASE STUDY
Capers Community Market
Description: A specialty grocery store focused on organic, natural and local products.
Vital Stats:
1. Location: Vancouver, BC
2. Number of locations: Four
3. Newest location: Cambie Street
4. Number of employees: 480
5. Amount spent on grand opening campaign: Not disclosed
Opening a new location can be a harrowing undertaking. You hope your new customers will flock to your store like Starbucks, but as a small business, your branding budget is usually less than a cafe's petty cash.
Fortunately, opening a new location successfully isn't just about your budget.
Capers Community Market in Vancouver is an interesting case study of the ways a business can use creativity to gain the respect, loyalty and buying power of a new neighbourhood. If you're planning to open a new location, here are three good lessons.
Lesson # 1: Let people know you're coming
According to Aron Bjornson, Capers' marketing manager, the success of the company's newest location on Cambie Street had a lot to do with pre-opening initiatives, "We chose initiatives that helped our business build personal relationships with our new community." Capers strategy exemplifies creative marketing steps any business can take.
Be a giver. Capers introduced itself to its new community by giving a (well-publicized) donation to a local inner-city school. Choosing a good deed, vs. advertising alone, helped Capers leverage community loyalty in addition to publicity.
Send a note. A promotional mail-out is essential. Capers maximized their mail-out by advertising product specials at their new location while promoting the specials at their existing four locations, so all would benefit.
Make a personal introduction. Send a friendly 'street team' out to meet your new neighbours and give out free water, coupons and other premiums, like Capers did. This is an economical way for your business to promote its brand and place featured products literally and physically in the hands of potential shoppers.
Lesson #2: Consider all the potential partners you can involve in promoting your grand opening.
As a small business, the limitations of your budget will inevitably determine just how much you can do to promote yourself. Capers made the most of their marketing budget by creating joint marketing opportunities designed to include partners like their suppliers and other community groups. Any business can do this, by considering the following points.
Understand yourself. The Capers brand is all about local, natural and organic products. A solid understanding of its brand was the springboard for each of Capers marketing initiatives. Based on a clear brand vision, Capers successfully identified appropriate niche groups to partner with to achieve their marketing goals- including local artisans, celebrity chefs, and the arts community.
Be creative. Not only did Capers identify appropriate groups to partner with for their grand opening, they brought people together collaboratively to build events that were good for the community. One of these events was a fashion show hosted at their new location challenging local design students to incorporate food into fashion designs. Capers invited local Celebrity chefs to further attract media, foodies, and target shoppers.
Leverage your give-aways. Capers dramatically reduced the costs of marketing their new location by inviting suppliers to provide promotional product give-aways. Activities like the street teams, fashion show, and grand opening events were presented to suppliers as distinctive marketing opportunities. Suppliers sponsored catering as a way to promote new products, featured at the store. Every business can learn from this by simply considering the needs and goals of new or local suppliers.
Lesson # 3: Don't forget your post-opening.
Since we're talking about how to make a big splash when opening a new location, keep in mind your plans to continue attracting publicity even after the grand opening festivities are over.
Leverage the publicity of your opening like Capers did, by putting pictures of the opening festivities on your website, and make sure to showcase everyone involved. Media and the general public will be particularly interested in images that demonstrate how your business is helping build up or bring together your new community.
Over 450 people lined up around the block at Capers Grand Opening- even Starbucks would be jealous of that!

Full text: ? - Quebec's powerful provincial pension fund is raising questions about the planned $1.3-billion takeover of the Montreal derivatives exchange by the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The Caisse de dÃ©pot et placement du QuÃ©bec, which owns nearly 8 per cent of the Montreal Exchange, said Monday morning that there should be a "public debate" on the proposed deal, unveiled earlier in the day. It wants the debate to cover a variety of topics, from the ultimate viability of the combined entity the transaction would create to the roles Quebec-based representatives will have on its board of directors and executive committee.
"It is essential that these questions be answered before we take a definitive stand on the proposal," Caisse chief executive officer Henri-Paul Rousseau said in a news release issued about four hours after Montreal Exchange Inc. and TSX Group Inc. confirmed that they plan to combine forces.
The agreement to create a new entity named TMX Group Inc. comes after months of on-again, off-again talks over the politically contentious issue of a tie-up to create a stronger bourse better able to compete in a rapidly consolidating industry.
Mr. Rousseau said the Caisse wants to know whether the combined exchanges would remain viable given the emergence of many competing platforms in the equity markets and the increasing number of Canadian companies that are inter-listing their shares for trading on U.S. exchanges.
"This is especially important since the market for standardized derivatives is quite likely to grow significantly in the years to come," he said.
He also asked "where the decision-making centre will be" and what will happen to the operations in Montreal where, he said, the MX has developed "leading-edge" expertise in derivatives.
"We would like to know what the Toronto Stock Exchange's intentions are in this regard before we take our analysis further. A public debate is needed," Mr. Rousseau concluded.
The two exchanges said that the combined company will have an 18-member board of directors, 25 per cent of whom must be Quebec residents, and will include five MX-designated directors, including MX CEO Luc Bertrand, who will serve as deputy-CEO of the new entity.
Under the deal unveiled a little after 7:30 a.m. (EST) Monday, MX shareholders are to receive 0.5 of a TSX Group share and $13.95 in cash for each of the shares in the Montreal derivatives exchange.
The companies are valuing the price at $39 per MX share, based on the $50.10 closing price of TSX group shares Nov. 28 , before the latest spate of speculation about a deal began, and at $42.56 based on their Friday close of $57.22, when rumblings of an imminent deal were overwhelming.
MX shareholders will own 18 per cent of the new exchange, while TSX investors will hold 81 per cent.
At $42.56, the offer represents a premium of $5.36, or 14.4 per cent, for each MX share over the Friday closing price of $37.20.
News of the planned merger pushed MX shares up $2.98 or 8 per cent to $40.18 as midday approached, while TSX shares were off $3.38 or 5.9 per cent to $53.84.
The combination of Canada's two largest exchanges will make for a stronger global market player with improved expansion opportunities, particularly in the U.S., investors were told Monday morning.
"Today, we are building a made-in-Canada exchange," Richard Nesbitt, CEO of TSX Group, said on a conference call. Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Nesbitt will serve as CEO of the merged entity, The new entity is "uniquely positioned" for growth opportunities, Mr. Bertrand said.
MX already has a significant stake in the Boston Options Exchange (BOX) and there are "strong prospects" for growth in the U.S., he added.
"This combination grows out of a common vision for the future of the Canadian capital markets," Mr. Nesbitt said in the news release announcing the merger. "Customers in Canada and internationally will benefit from increased liquidity levels, accelerated product development, a fully diversified product suite, and superior technology."
Mr. Bertrand said in the release that the combination will "redefine the Canadian capital markets and strengthen its global positioning."
"We are creating a new exchange group that builds on the respective strengths and successes of both organizations," said Mr. Bertrand, who emphasized that Montreal will remain the centre of Canada's derivatives markets.
The companies said they have targeted cost synergies of $25-million. That's the equivalent of about 14 per cent of their $176-million combined operating expenses in the first nine months of this year.
They said they plan to generate savings by optimizing their technology platforms, rationalizing premises and data centres and reducing corporate costs.
The companies said that TMX Group's head office will be located in Toronto, while MX's head office will remain in Montreal. As well, the MX will continue to manage the MontrÃ©al Climate Exchange. The combined company will be chaired by TSX Group's current chairman, Wayne Fox.
No single shareholder will be allowed to own more than 10 per cent of the combined TMX Group, unless amendments to this restriction are approved by both the Ontario Securities Commission and Quebec's AutoritÃ© des MarchÃ©s Financiers (AMF).
Sources had said that the Quebec government supported the merger. Quebec had insisted on the importance of Montreal being the derivatives specialist for Canada.
Under terms of a 10-year agreement, Toronto is barred from getting into the fast-growing derivatives trading sector until March, 2009. Montreal was granted the exclusivity on derivatives trading after Canada's exchanges agreed to a realignment about 10 years ago.
The agreement also requires MX to pay TSX Group a termination fee of $46-million if it ultimately accepts a competing takeover offer, although TSX Group would have the right to match a rival bid.
Sources have said that the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, and the Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE, both put forward takeover proposals for the MX, but that Toronto was keen to best those offers. Toronto had also been putting heat on Montreal, threatening to build a competing - and potentially damaging - derivatives business starting in 2009.
However, analyst John Aiken at Dundee Securities Inc. told clients in a note Monday morning that he thinks it is "unlikely" a competing offer will emerge.
Mr. Aiken also argued that although the combination will make TSX Group more attractive to international exchange acquirers, he thinks there is only a "remote" chance this will occur, "given the protectionism that has historically been shown regarding Canadian financial institutions."
The deal must be approved by holders of two-thirds of MX's shares at a meeting set to be held Feb. 13, the companies said.
The MX board is recommending shareholders vote in favour of the transaction and have committed to tendering the 7 per cent stake in the company they own.
The talks between Montreal and Toronto had broken down over the summer.
After renewed talks between the two became tense recently, Quebec Finance Minister Monique JÃ©rÃ´me-Forget slammed Toronto for allegedly walking away from a proposed merger because of a reluctance to give a prominent role to a management team based in Montreal.
Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty called on the two companies in September to set aside their differences and join forces, saying it would be in the national interest to do so.
Many observers have argued that it makes sense for the two relatively tiny exchanges to get together rather than try to weaken each other by fighting over the derivatives turf.
Mr. Aiken at Dundee said he views the merger announcement "positively, even though we believe that the acquisition will be dilutive to TSX Group's earnings in 2008."
He also said that keeping Mr. Bertrand on in a key role "will likely be critical in selling the deal to Quebec's regulators and political machine.
"While a transaction could likely be done more economically efficiently by reducing the level of activity in Montreal, we note that this is critical in winning political acceptance for the deal, as . . . Quebec's financial regulator, needs to approve any single interest in MX above 10 per cent.
Toronto money manager Thomas Caldwell, who has made a specialty of investing in exchanges around the world to profit from the rolling wave of consolidation, has been a vociferous advocate of a TSX-MX marriage and welcomed the deal Monday.
"As I've said before, my biggest fear if I were a director of Toronto, or indeed a shareholder, would be to wake up one day and find Montreal had been taken out by someone else," he said when reached by telephone at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. "It was a bit bumpy to get there. . .but it had to be done. I don't think the parties had much choice at the end of the day."
Caldwell Securities owns about $20-million in TSX shares and $20-million in MX shares for itself and its clients. Urbana Corp., a separate public company set up and controlled by Caldwell to invest in financial exchanges, holds about $7.5-million in MX shares and $8.5 million in TSX stock, Mr. Caldwell said.
Ian Bandeen, who heads would-be TSX rival Pure Trading and its corporate parent Canadian Trading and Quotation System Inc., which operates a market for small-cap stocks, also said the TSX-MX merger makes plenty of sense.
Mr. Bandeen also suggested that in some ways, the TSX may have more to gain from the deal. "The MX corporate culture is newer and more forward looking," he said in a telephone interview from his Toronto office. "They're a little bit leaner and more hungry, and that's a culture that I think you'd want to embrace or respect."
Citing Montreal's successful acquisition of its BOX stake, he also said it has had more success than the TSX on the acquisitions front and that Toronto may be able to learn from the MX on this score.
"They lost out on Winnipeg, if they were ever in the running," he said, alluding to the acquisition of the Winnipeg Commodities Exchange by Intercontinental Exchange Inc. of Atlanta.
Mr. Bandeen also said nothing seems to have come of "serious talks" the TSX has had with the Philadelphia and Amex exchanges.
The TSX launched a lawsuit against Pure Trading earlier this year alleging breach of copyright, but Mr. Bandeen has dismissed the action as baseless.

Quebeckers vote today in an election that could change the political landscape of the province and cost at least one party leader his job, as well as influence when Prime Minister Stephen Harper calls a federal election.
Polls put the governing Liberals, the Opposition Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois and the Action DÃ©mocratique du QuÃ©bec in a statistical dead heat, meaning there could be a long night of vote-counting and possibly Quebec's first minority government since 1878.
Will the governing Liberals or the opposition PQ make an eleventh-hour rebound? Are one or the other of the mainline parties going to be buried? Or will Quebec voters flirt with the ADQ but leave it waiting at the altar?
Earlier today, Globe reporters RhÃ©al SÃ©guin, Tu Thanh Ha and Konrad Yakabuski provided their analysis of the campaign and answered these and other questions from the readers of globeandmail.com. Your questions and their answers appear at the bottom of this page.
Please note that this was a question-and-answer session, not one of our regular one-hour live discussions.
Mr. SÃ©guin is a native of Ontario who has been covering the Quebec National Assembly for almost 20 years. Prior to joining The Globe and Mail, he worked for CBC radio in Quebec and was a radio and television reporter for SociÃ©tÃ© Radio-Canada in Toronto where he covered provincial politics. He has been a journalist since 1979 and is a graduate from York University. He has a Masters degree in political science from UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã¨ MontrÃ©al.
Mr. Ha joined The Globe and Mail nearly 12 years ago. He started at The Globe as a parliamentary reporter in the Ottawa bureau. Before that, he was assigned to the Quebec legislature for The Montreal Gazette from 1991-94.
He has covered two referendums (1992 and 1995), and multiple federal and provincial elections.
Mr. Yakabuski has covered business, politics and culture in Quebec for more than a decade.
Prior to joining the Globe in 1996, he worked as a political reporter at the French-language Le Devoir, following Quebec through the election of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois in 1994, the 1995 referendum on sovereignty and the arrival of Lucien Bouchard as premier in early 1996.
Jim Sheppard, Executive Editor, globeandmail.com: Welcome, gentlemen, to globeandmail.com and thanks for taking some questions today from our readers. Let me start by asking you the big question: The weekend polls seem to suggest a tight race and a possible minority government. Do you sense any last-minute shifts in public opinion? Or are we in for a nail-biter tonight?
Konrad Yakabuski: The weekend LÃ©ger and CROP polls each had the Liberals with a six-point lead over the PQ, and the ADQ down a bit from previous polls. (Remeber, the Liberals dominate the non-francophone vote, so their overall number needs to be much higher than the ADQ's or PQ's to actually win.) Couple this with the traditional "ballot box bonus" in favour of the Liberals, and things might not look so bleak for Jean Charest tonight. All that said, this is a three-way race in francophone Quebec and the Liberals are generally in third place. CROP polls in 21 key francophone ridings have shown the PQ's support to be suprising resilient and the ADQ positioned to take ridings that are currently Liberal. Only a true gambler would bet on tonight's final seat count.
RhÃ©al SÃ©guin: It would be difficult to imagine a last-minute shift that would give Jean Charest a majority government.
Some would even argue that the campaign has done little to shift public opinion. In a LÃ©ger poll conducted at the end of January, the Liberals were at 34 per cent, the PQ at 32 per cent and the ADQ at 24 per cent. We saw similar numbers in surveys conducted by Quebec polling firms over the weekend.
This confirms that little will change and that we are in a one of the tightest three-way races ever. Nobody can predict whether the Liberals or the PQ will come up with the most seats to form a minority government.
What is certain is that the ADQ cannot by any stretch of the imagination win enough seats to take power this time.
Mario Dumont's party is not a factor on the island of Montreal. Nor is it player in a number of other regions such as the Abitibi, the Outaouais or Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.
It's strength is based in Eastern Quebec regions such as Quebec City and ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches and stretches along the shores of the Saint Lawrence westbound into many rural communities before picking up some strength in the middle-class suburban belt around Montreal.
This gives the ADQ the potential to win enough seats to stop either one of the other two parties from forming a majority.
The outcome will largely depend on how the vote splits and to whose advantage. There is no modern historical precedent upon which to base any conclusive analysis. The last minority government dates back to 1878 and Quebec has never witnessed so many three-way races in so many ridings.
So we are in for a real nail-biter that may not even have a winner at the end of tonight's vote. We may have to wait for judicial recounts to determine who can form the government.
Tu Thanh Ha: Despite the claims of the Liberals and the PQ campaigns that they were regaining momentum, I noticed no significant change this weekend in the public mood.
Some people might have a final-moment reluctance about voting for a party other than the two leading ones. But the main dynamic of the electorate hasn't changed - we have a population that isn't keen on either Jean Charest or AndrÃ© Boisclair.
There are some factors that don't show up in the polling.
One is the so-called "ballot-box bonus," the historic fact that Liberal support is usually a bit higher than polling figures because it isn't fashionable to admit to a pollster that you vote Liberal. I also wonder too if the ADQ electorate is similarly under-represented in polling.
The other factor is that a high number of people did cast ballots in the advance voting days a week ago. Thanks to their well-oiled organization, the Liberals tend to fare better among those voters and this could have an impact in such a close election.
Despite all of that, it will be a tight, unpredictable contest. Lots of are harder than usual to call because of three-way races, less of the usual federalist-separatist polarization, more impact from regional issues.
Jasmine Francis, Halifax: I would be interested in your analysis of the campaigns run by each of the three main party leaders. Who did well? Who did poorly?
RhÃ©al SÃ©guin: Charest designed his campaign in anticipation of a polarization along the old sovereignist-federalist lines by using his record on health care and economic development as the springboard towards another victory against the PQ's commitment to hold another referendum on sovereignty.
He realized too late that the ADQ support was much more solid than he anticipated and he had to change strategy and begin targeting Mario Dumont. But his attitude was often contemptuous towards the fledgling ADQ leader and that didn't go over well with many voters.
He lacked the combativeness that had characterized his style of campaigning in the past. He did not perform well in the leader's debate and was taken aback by Dumont's surprise attack where he revealed documents showing the government was aware with problems with the Concorde overpass in Laval that collapsed last September killing five people.
By the time Stephen Harper tabled his budget, giving Quebec $700-million more than it expected, it was too late.
Mr. Charest had difficulty defending the federalist cause against an adversary like the ADQ which is also fighting for more autonomy for the province.
The Liberals panicked and tried to make-up for their broken promise in 2003 to cut income taxes by $1-billion a year by announcing they would use the extra $700-million to reduce income taxes. The move fuelled cynicism towards the government and the move was seen as too little too late for many disgruntled voters.
AndrÃ© Boisclair had a serious leadership problem to contend with. He had criticized his own party's close ties with the labour movement and appeared hesitant on wanting to clearly outline his plan on how a sovereign Quebec could benefit Quebec. By the time the campaign started, his leadership credentials were seriously undermined.
And he had to contend with voter mistrust sparked by his past use of cocaine when he was a cabinet minister. The issue was never raised during the campaign but still appeared to haunt him.
The expectations were low and most PQ members feared the worst. But when the ADQ support started weakening the Liberals' hold on power, it breathed new life into the PQ campaign.
Also, the party attracted 500,000 fewer voters in 2003 than in 1998. If Mr. Boislair could give those voters a reason to come back to the party fold, rather than stay home as they did in 2003, he would have a fighting chance to form at least a minority government. That's when he began to promote the progressive elements of his platform, make amends with labour leaders and emphasize the need to hold a referendum and achieve sovereignty in order to bring back sovereignists to the party.
The PQ needs to get every possible vote in order to win the close three-way races, especially in predominantly francophone ridings. The PQ and ADQ were splitting the francophone vote with the Liberals way back in third place with only 24-per cent of francophones saying they would support Mr. Charest.
To the surprise of a lot of people, Mr. Boisclair fought a strong campaign in the hope that he could beat the Liberals in the fight to form a majority government. If he fails, that could spell the end of his brief tenure as PQ leader.
Mario Dumont ran the most effective campaign, touching on the issues that concerned Quebeckers living outside of Montreal.
He appealed to the middle class with promises to pay $5,200 a year for each child under school age. He promised to abolish costly school boards. He promoted privatized health care and appealed to fundamental Quebec values by arguing that the province should not have to bend over backwards to satisfy all demands from minority religious groups.
More importantly, he attacked the other two parties for failing to take bold measures to help average Quebeckers. He accused the PQ of being too obsessed with holding a referendum on sovereignty and blasted the Liberals for catering to big business interests and bowing to the whim of the rest of Canada.
The strategy worked. The ADQ attracted disgruntled federalists and disillusioned nationalists, becoming a lighting rod for all the grievances that average Quebeckers hold against the Montreal-dominated Liberals and PQ.
Tu Thanh Ha: Some commentators said they didn't recognized Jean Charest, who failed to live up to his reputation as a formidable campaigner. I thought I recognized him as the Charest of the 1998 election, who lacked passion, who struggled to connect with the francophone electorate and who only roused himself too late in campaign and lost to Lucien Bouchard.
AndrÃ© Boisclair's campaign was relatively glitch-free and he was a fast-learner, as he softened up his image as a cold, haughty man. But while expectations were low, he can't escape the fact that he is a gay Montrealer at a time when the key outside-Montreal electorate is turning more conservative. And he was no match for this election's Teflon-campaigner, Mario Dumont.
Dumont was embarrassed by several of his candidates' boorish remarks. He was also at a loss on a TV talk show when the hosts rolled out a blackboard and challenged him to put figures on his platform the way the other two did. He was accused of demagoguery and his platform was mocked. But the man was perfectly positioned. He reflected a certain weariness of an electorate that had seen three decades of alternating Liberal/PQ power and hankered for changes.
Konrad Yakabuski: Mr. Charest ran an uninspired campaign, but it would be wrong to suggest he erred in doing so. The Liberals have a formidable organization and if their internal polls and focus groups told them that a large enough portion of voters were looking for stability or continuity, it's not surprising they would go with a kind of "The Land is Strong" campaign. Remember that was Pierre Trudeau's slogan in the 1972 campaign. Turns out he did err and barely eked out a minority.
Mr. Boisclair ran the most consisent campaign, and in that sense he earned a lot of respect and probably quite a few second looks from voters who may have earlier written him off.
Mr. Dumont, what can you say, was the undisputed star of the campaign. For better or worse, he's the kind of politician some voters can get excited about. The same cannot be said of the other two.
Donalda Williams Clogg of Hudson, Que. , and Dennis Choptiany of Markham, Ont. have questions on the same theme. First, what do you expect will be the impact of Mr. Harper's intervention in the Quebec election? Will it possibly giving the PQ an advantage? Second, what are the implications at the federal level of his actions? Will Harper most likely gain or lose support in Quebec?
Tu Thanh Ha: One of the one hand, I would say that Mr. Harper's direct, short-term influence has been minimal.
The federal budget did shove a big wad of money towards Quebec but Mr. Charest's proposal to turn that windfall into a tax cut undermined the whole claim that it was a necessary step to help provincial needs in health and education. It made the whole exercise look cynical.
On the other hand, Mr. Harper is coming out of this with a big plus.
Mario Dumont has made it OK again to be publicly conservative in Quebec. For the last three decades, a lot of rural, small-town nationalists have voted for the PQ and, since the 1990s, for the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois. They voted for those two separatist parties because of their views on the national-unity issue.
But they felt constrained by the social-democrat orthodoxy that ruled the PQ and the BQ. Mr. Dumont has broken that mold and opened broad opportunities for the federal Conservatives.
Konrad Yakabuski: Mr. Harper's intervention will have a marginal impact in my view. The overwhelming reaction to his declaration that he wants a federalist government in Quebec City is this: What else do you expect the Prime Minister of Canada to say? If there is outrage, it is mostly feigned (as in Mr. Charest's case) or same-old, same-old (as in Mr. Boisclair's case). Blackmail? After 40 years of this kind of debate, I'm not sure Quebeckers pay much attention to the hyperbole.
RhÃ©al SÃ©guin: Stephen Harper's name won't be on the ballot box. But his presence in this campaign has dominated the agenda.
Whether by giving Quebec a voice at UNESCO, recognzing Quebec as a nation within Canada or his latest attempt to solve the fiscal imbalance, the Conservatives have driven Mr. Charest's national unity agenda from the beginning. Charest's gamble was that Quebeckers would be seduced by the new open federalism in Ottawa and re-elect the Liberals to continue to promote that change.
But Harper's move also reinforced Mario Dumont's call for greater provincial autonomy, allowing the ADQ to project Mr. Charest as a man with no vision for Quebec's role within Canada.
As the ADQ grew in strength, this gave the PQ the outside chance of forming a minority government - with Mr. Harper's intervention accomplishing just the opposite of what he had set out to do.
But in the end the Conservatives may be the big winners. Their base of support in Quebec is similar to the ADQ's The Conservatives won eight of their 10 seats in a region that will likely be swept by the ADQ and Harper can hope to ride the coattails of the ADQ's success by working in the same ridings Mr. Dumont has a chance of winning.
Even if the PQ forms a minority government, Harper knows that it cannot hold a referendum unless the ADQ supports it and Mr. Dumont has said from the outset he has no interest in supporting another vote on sovereignty.
So Mr. Harper may see tonight's result as a major boost to the Conservatives' chances of undermining the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois by focusing on the same social conservative vote that will have allowed the ADQ to make a major breakthrough in tonight's election.
R.M., Regina: I am very concerned about the pattern of both the former federal Liberal government and now the Harper Conservative government who seem to feel that the best way to secure support from the people of Quebec is through giving them more federal money. More money won't stop Quebeckers from voting "yes" in a referendum and simply walking away with the cheque and the victory. Will it?
Konrad Yakabuski: To the extent that an increase in federal transfers further increases Quebec's dependence on the rest of Canada, then, yes, Mr. Harper's approach will prevent some of Quebeckers from voting Yes if there is another referendum. The last time around, in 1995, the federal government was on the verge of bankruptcy and transfers to the provinces were being slashed by then Finance Minister Paul Martin. Sovereigntists could use Ottawa's financial straits as an argument in favour of separation. Now, Quebeckers are faced with a very rich federal government, so it is a disincentive to separate.
Tu Thanh Ha: In the short term, this election is a victory for federalism.
The PQ is in danger of sinking down to historical lows it hasn't touched in three decades. The party no longer has a monopoly on the francophone nationalist vote because more people are turning to Mario Dumont's ADQ.
There is a perception that there is a government in Ottawa that is more sensitive to Quebec. It doesn't have to give large amounts of money. Even symbolic gestures by Mr. Harper have garnered him goodwill in Quebec.
The danger is further down the road. The PQ is convinced that eventually people will realize that the ADQ's third-way approach leads to a dead end, that Ottawa can't deliver and that the people of Quebec will eventually have to choose between the status quo and secession.
Craig Scott, the "Republic of Newfoundland": If Charest loses this election and the PQ gains control, don't you think it is time to change tactics in Ottawa? I believe that it is time to take the gloves off and tell Quebeckers how it is going to be if they decide to have a referendum and choose to separate. I think that kind of approach would be a rude awakening for the people of Quebec and a refreshing change for the rest of the country, which is getting tired of having the separation gun held to our heads all the time. Rob B. from Milton, Ont., asks a variant on that question: Is there any other civilized Western nation that has been so obsessed with one portion of its country for the past 40 years as Canada has been with Quebec?
Tu Thanh Ha: I believe your tough-love approach has already taken place.
Many nationalist francophones will reel off a list of purported grievances that unfolded in the post-referendum years after StÃ©phane Dion became Jean ChrÃ©tien's Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Ã© the Plan B, the Clarity Act, etc.
It drove in the idea that Quebec secession would be a messy process and could explain why there is no rush by the population to engage in a referendum.
But if a lot of Quebeckers don't feel in a rush to head into another referendum, it doesn't mean this has extinguished their sense of nationhood.
People here speak another language. This means they listen to other opinion-makers. They feel different - both from anglophones but also from France. And as long as they form a minority amid a sea of English-speakers, they will feel that their identity and culture is threatened and can be preserved only by obtaining more control, more power - whether by seeking them from Ottawa or through secession.
Konrad Yakabuski: To Craig Scott: Federalist leaders have been "taking the gloves off" forever and it has only made Quebeckers more determined to demand more -- more recognition, more money, more power. Pierre Trudeau threatened Quebeckers they'd lose their pensions if they voted Yes, and no one has forgotten or forgiven him for that. Jean ChrÃ©tien took a similar tough-love approach in the 1995 referendum and almost lost. Standing up to Quebec makes a politician popular in the rest of Canada. Not so much, here.
To Rob B : Ask JosÃ© Luis Zapatero, the prime minister of Spain. He's been bending over backwards to accomodate Catalonians with more decentralization and autonomy. Ask Tony Blair, who gave Scotland more autonomy and now risks seeing the separatists win at least a plurality of seats in the Scotish Parliament. Look at Belgium,where "two nations" have shared a state with lots of conflict. Quebec's place within Canada has been a dominant theme in Canadian politics, but we're not the only country to go through this. And although it is sometimes frustrating for Canadians who wonder if it will ever end (it won't), we have always dealt our differences in ways that generally earn us respect on the world stage.
Philip Van Bergen, Hashima, Japan: Two questions: Has the Quebec public gotten over the sponsorship scandal? Why is Quebec so worried about multiculturalism and the changing face of the Rest of Canada?
Tu Thanh Ha: Yes, the sponsorship scandal is history as the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois learned the hard way in last year's federal election when it not longer got traction on that issue.
The sponsorship scandal artificially boosted the popularity of both the BQ and the PQ and I got a sense that [Bloc Leader Gilles]Duceppe's campaign in 2006 was blindsided when the Conservatives made a breakthrough.
Mr. Duceppe spent a lot of time in Montreal trying to make inroads by courting the ethnic vote and fielding minority candidates. But in fact, the battle was in the hinterland where the Bloc had taken the francophone vote for granted. The voters punished the Liberals - but by voting Conservative.
As for your second question, you might be alluding to either of two issues.
If you asking about the criticism that the Quebec separatist/nationalist movement often makes about Canadian multiculturalism, yes indeed such criticism exists. There is a perception that, by emphasizing other minorities, the rest of Canada has diluted the importance of francophone Quebeckers as a key, historical player in Canadian history, denying them their special status as members of one of Canada's founding nations.
Diversity has also been a factor in this election. Like other Western societies, Quebec is facing challenges trying to manage an increasingly diverse wave of immigration.
There has been an influx of newcomers since the 1970s and it has mostly been free of major frictions. The so-called Children of Bill 101, who went to French school but also speak English and their parents' native language, are pretty well integrated.
But Quebec, which underwent the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, is still trying to figure out exactly where religion fits in the public space - which is why there has been controversy over how to accommodate more recent waves of newcomers, especially devout Muslims and Hassidic Jews whose religious practices are more unbending and public.
The backlash over some isolated cases of accommodation for those religious minorities has played into the increase in popularity of Mario Dumont and the ADQ, and has forced Mr. Charest and Mr. Boisclair to adopt tougher stands against accommodations too.
Konrad Yakabuski: Sponsorship scandal? What sponsorship scandal? There are still those in Quebec who consider "official multiculturalism" was a policy adopted by Pierre Trudeau in order to reduce the QuÃ©bÃ©cois to just another cultural minority in the Canadian mosaic.
Quebeckers have always had a preference for a melting pot model of integration, since they form a French-speaking minority in North America.
RhÃ©al SÃ©guin: The sponsorship scandal will continue to linger in Quebeckers mind for years to come. Events keep popping up to remind them of the sorry episode in the country's history.
In a few days, the Chief Electoral Officer will release a report on the lobby group Options Canada and the alleged illegal use of federal funds to defeat the separatists in the 1995 referendum. The report will likely awaken the ghost of the Gomery Commission and fuel PQ arguments that the last referendum was not won fair-and-square by the federalists. ,/P>
This is one issue that will continue to overshadow the Liberal party of Canada's attempts at rebuilding its base in Quebec.
As for multiculturalism, Quebeckers have shown that when immigrants arrive in Quebec and adapt to the French language, the level of integration is no different here then elsewhere in the country.
However, francophone Quebeckers constitute a minority in North America and the survival of their language and culture remains a constant concern. And this can often lead to tensions when the cultural minorities follow their natural instinct to integrate the North American-dominated English language.
In Montreal, the integration into an increasingly multicultural society has been met with success. But as you head into regions where few cultural communities are present, then the lack of contact and integration has often led to misunderstandings, which have become an issue in this campaign and will likely to continue to dominate debate over the coming years.
Jim Sheppard, Executive Editor, globeandmail.com: Gentlemen, thank you again for taking the time today to share your analysis of the campaign and your insights into what might happen today and in the future. Much appreciated.

Full text: The first two planeloads of exhausted and sometimes angry Canadians fleeing violence in Lebanon landed Friday morning in Ottawa and Montreal.
The first two planeloads of exhausted and sometimes angry Canadians fleeing violence in Lebanon landed Friday morning in Ottawa and Montreal.
"We are very happy to be back in Canada," Prime Minister Stephen Harper said after saying goodbye to the refugees as they got off his government jet in Ottawa about 4 a.m. EDT.
The Prime Minister described the long flight from Cyprus, where the Canadians had been taken by boat from Beirut, as "very quiet." Mr. Harper had diverted his government jet from Paris to pick up the trapped Canadians.
The return to Ottawa and Montreal capped the first phase of the enormous operation to rescue thousands of Canadians from war-torn Beirut.
A third flight was expected to land in Montreal around midday. Two more flights destined for Toronto were also expected later Friday, according to reports.
About 600 other Canadians were put on planes in Turkey early today for the long journey home while chartered boats ferried hundreds of others by sea from Beirut as - after days of delay and embarrassment - the operation finally seemed to kick into gear.
Some of those who returned to Ottawa this morning with the Prime Minister praised the Canadian government, the Foreign Affairs Department and the staff of the PMO. Others complained they were treated like "animals" during parts of the 30-hour rescue operation.
"It was almost hell but, thank God, there were a lot of people who helped out," said Rima Saab, who was travelling with her two infant children.
The Prime Minister's staff "were so sweet," Ms. Saab said. "They didn't leave me for one bit. I always had one kid and a member of the staff had the other one. So they helped me to feed them and to change them and they carried them around for me."
But Liliane El-Helou, who had travelled to Lebanon with her two children to attend her brother's wedding, told of many people being left outside in Beirut for six hours in 30-degree heat.
"There were people who fainted. Then we went inside of a pavilion waiting to be shipped, like animals I felt," she said.
The passengers who accompanied Mr. Harper were mostly women with babies, children with backpacks and older Canadians, some of whom hobbled down the stairs to touch the ground.
Amal Younes, who is five months pregnant and was travelling with her daughter Yasmina, 3, said in Montreal she is "very angry" about the way they were treated on the trip.
"I was crying all the way."
"A lot of [these]people are very grateful," the Prime Minister said on the dark pre-dawn tarmac at the Ottawa airport. "A lot of [these]people are very frustrated. They had a long and difficult trip."
Mr. Harper praised Foreign Affairs Department staff, who he said had been working extremely hard, trying to cope with the massive number of Canadians trying to flee the fighting in Beirut.
He noted that the department was originally short of manpower in region but quickly pooled its resources.
The Prime Minister said he is concerned about the number of department staff working round the clock in Beirut, Cyprus and Turkey, where other refugees are being taken.
"I'm concerned that they are going to burn out before this is over," he said.
Confusion dominated the morning at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport as waiting families complained about a lack of information.
Fadi Azar said he had not been told when his wife Amal Younes, who is five months pregnant, and their three-year-old daughter Yasmina were due to arrive.
"It was confusion until the last minute," Mr. Azar said as he hugged Yasmina to his chest minutes after the family was reunited.
"Nobody wanted to give us any information for security reasons. They [his family]were coming from a war zone, and we couldn't be told."
People were waiting at the airport from 5 a.m., unsure of when their relatives were due to arrive.
Abbas Haggali had expected his wife Mona Fadel their children Diana, 17, Maged, 11, and Mohammed, 10, to arrive Thursday and spent last night waiting at the airport, only to return this morning for another stint in the arrivals lounge.
"I don't know what's going on," said Mr. Haggali, whose father and four brothers died during battles in Lebanon. "They were in Beirut, in the bombing area. She left on the first day. I don't sleep. Nobody sleeps."
His eldest son Ayman, 21, had been on holiday with the rest of the family but came home early for work and study. The fighting broke out 10 hours after he left Lebanon, he said.
"It's been very difficult," Ayman Haggalisaid. "My mom waited from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. to get on the boat, and then they weren't going to take them. When they saw she had small children, they said okay."
Mrs. Fadel and the children were the first people to walk through the arrival gates, where they were welcomed by tearful family and a blaze of media
Also in Montreal, Seventeen-year-old Samy Kaidbey said he watched the first morning of bombings hit Beirut from his balcony vantage-point outside the city.
"I was sleeping to the sound of bombs, waking to the sound of bombs. We could see the airport fully. I saw the explosions - it looked like in the movies," Mr. Kaidbey said.
Mr. Kaidbey had travelled alone to Lebanon to visit relatives after graduating from Saint Lambert du Rocher.
His worried parents watched television reports in their Montreal home, and his father Ihsan yesterday waited anxiously in Pierre Elliott Trudeau , unsure if his son would arrive with the first passengers.
As the pair was swamped by a media scrum that scurried from one family to the next, Samy said there were just two things he wanted: to get home to his mother, and to have a smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz's Delicatessen.
Earlier, more than 600 other Canadians from Beirut were put on two 757 jets in Turkey for the journey to Canada.
Canadian officials in Adana, Turkey, said the evacuees had arrived in the military port of Mersin in the early hours of the morning local time [Thursday evening EDT]aboard three catamarans after spending at least 10 hours at sea.
They were joined by 24 Americans, who were given spaces on the flights by Canada as part of an agreement for mutual assistance. Processing them through the basketball stadium-turned-reception centre went smoothly. While some were furious with the Canadian government, most seemed pleased and grateful to be out.
The next wave of vessels, these ones led by two large ferries carrying 800 people each, are expected to arrive in Mersin, Turkey, in the late afternoon and early evening local time [late morning or early afternoon EDT] likely allowing that wave of Canadians to take the 10-hour flight home by midnight local time [late afternoon or early evening EDT]
On Thursday, six boats left Beirut heading for Turkey, filled with hundreds of Canadians who had been stranded in the shattered city. The sense of order on the docks was in stark contrast to Wednesday's debacle, when a paucity of boats and the excess of promises had created a minor riot among Canadians, some of whom had been waiting in the harbour area for days, enduring terrifying bombing.
Evacuees arrived at the port in Beirut in buses chartered by the Canadian embassy and then filed onto the boats in polite, orderly, very Canadian lines. "That was quite a feat, quite extraordinary," said Canada's ambassador to Lebanon, Louis de Lorimier.
The ships that left Thursday were Turkish island-cruising ferries with 250 red-and-blue seats on two levels and even well-stocked snack bars. But most pleasing of all to evacuees who had spent the night in cramped conditions with overflowing toilets were the clean washrooms. A seventh ship, which travelled to Cyprus Wednesday night with the first load of evacuees, was unable to make a return journey Thursday.
After a long wait on the tarmac in Cyprus, Mr. Harper welcomed the beleaguered guests - some of whom were critical of the government's slow response to the crisis in Lebanon - onto his plane. They complained of dehydration, widespread vomiting from sea sickness, cramped quarters and a lack of medical care on the trip over from Beirut.
While the operation ran more smoothly Thursday, it wasn't fast enough for many desperate Canadians who may be forced to wait for days to get out on a ship. An angry crowd of Canadian passport-holders gathered outside the port, demanding to be put on the ships.
Lina Diyab, a Halifax lawyer, complained that after being told to come to the port, she had been left to stand in the sweltering heat for seven hours without any further word from the embassy despite the fact she is allergic to the sun.
"Somebody is going to answer for this. We deserve better treatment," she said to cheers from a crowd of several hundred people with similar complaints.
Despite the anger expressed by some at the embassy's disorganization, their mood seemed to improve the moment they were finally put on boats. "I was a little cranky last night after being in the sun for seven hours, but now I'm just glad to be going," said Janet Jacobsen, a 61-year-old physiotherapist from Crofton, B.C.
She had been in Lebanon for a friend's wedding, which took place last Friday despite the fact many guests were unable to attend because of the bombing.
"This was the adventure tour of Lebanon," she said as she settled into her seat for the ride out.
The embassy has spoken with just a third of those registered, and has yet to come up with a figure for how many people want to leave, or how long the evacuation might last.
Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay declared Thursday's evacuation a success.
Ottawa, which announced a $1-million aid package for Lebanon Thursday, has not been able to put a price tag on the massive rescue.
There is much concern for people still trapped in the southern part of the country where the danger is greatest, and where a family of eight Canadians was killed on the weekend.
Mr. MacKay said again Thursday that there is a plan to get citizens out but he refused to elaborate.
The government reacted angrily to a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail that micromanagement by the Prime Minister's Office contributed to confusion and delays surrounding the evacuation of Canadians from Beirut.
Mr. MacKay leaped to the defence of the PMO and strongly criticized the story in a letter to the editor that he released to other media.
The report said there were not enough staff at the Canadian embassy in Beirut to cope with the thousands of frantic Canadians seeking help and described the difficulties in organizing an evacuation by water when there were no Canadian naval vessels in the area and many countries were bidding for the same commercial ships.
Federal sources said the situation was exacerbated by the Prime Minister's centralized command and communications policies and an edict from Sandra Buckler, the Prime Minister's communications director, that no information be released on the evacuation efforts.
"The very serious allegations you printed are completely untrue and without merit," Mr. MacKay stated.
Edward Greenspon, The Globe and Mail's editor-in-chief, said he appreciates the pressure the government is feeling in the current crisis, but that the story was well-sourced and stands up to scrutiny. "We have complete confidence in our story," he said.

The Canadians who arrived Thursday at the Turkish port of Mersin were greeted by Turkish and Canadian officials, and seemed in good spirits despite the long journey.
Turkey has become a major focus of the rescue operation.
Canadian Ambassador Yves Brodeur arrived in Mersin with a team of 75 diplomats and Foreign Affairs officials to set up a huge processing centre in the nearby city of Adana.
Ottawa dramatically increased its investment in the rescue effort Thursday. As well as the two 800-passenger ferries and four 250-passenger small ferries it rented Thursday, officials in Cyprus said they will be supplementing the single boat that has delivered a few Canadians to Larnaca with several more rented boats.
Turkey has provided a large, air-conditioned basketball stadium that will serve as a processing centre for the Canadians. Last night, it was full of small children and exhausted parents, eagerly receiving food, diapers and phone cards from Canadian officials. Ottawa has chartered one Boeing 757 jet, and plans to add at least four more to provide free passage.
In Ontario, the provincial government said Friday Canadians returning to the province from Lebanon will have immediate access to public health care.
The province said it will exempt those people from the mandatory three-month waiting period for OHIP coverage.
Health Minister George Smitherman says the evacuees have undergone strain and stress and will have access to the "health care they need when they need it the most."

The Prime Minister described the long flight from Cyprus, where the Canadians had been taken by boat from Beirut, as "very quiet." Mr. Harper had diverted his government jet from Paris to pick up the trapped Canadians.
The return to Ottawa and Montreal capped the first phase of the enormous operation to rescue thousands of Canadians from war-torn Beirut.
The pace of evacuations from Lebanon slowed Friday, however, partly because some of the ships chartered by the Canadian government earlier in the week were scooped up by other countries.
Foreign Affairs Department officials told a background briefing that 747 people were taken out of Lebanon on Friday, far short of the number awaiting departure.
Officials said they managed to secure two big boats for service on Saturday, with a combined capacity of almost 1,700 passengers. Still, the operation is hampered by congestion in Beirut harbour and the need to get through an Israeli naval blockade pf the coast.
"There are so many things beyong our control," said Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Kim Girtel. "It depends on how the blockade is working, how nervous the blockaders are, and the situation at the port."
The total number of persons taken out of Beirut rose to 2,413 on Friday, while the number of Lebanese-Canadians who had registered with the Canadian Embassy rose to 38,000, a sharp increase from the beginning of the week. It's not known how many of those want to leave the country.
Foreign Affairs officials acknowledged that a desire to save money may have hampered the evacuation.
"When this operation began we took a decision to contract ships for a certain number of days because we have no way of predicting out how long the crisis is going to last, how much demand were going to have," an official told a background briefing.
"Looking at the taxpayer's dollar, we dont want to contract ships for a week or two weeks without knowing the extent of the crisis so were being cautious in that respect.
"That means that some of the ships we may have used may have been picked up by others. It's not like we have a flotilla on standby."
About 600 other Canadians were put on planes in Turkey early today for the long journey home while chartered boats ferried hundreds of others by sea from Beirut as - after days of delay and embarrassment - the operation finally seemed to kick into gear.
Some of those who returned to Ottawa this morning with the Prime Minister praised the Canadian government, the Foreign Affairs Department and the staff of the PMO. Others complained they were treated like "animals" during parts of the 30-hour rescue operation.

Earlier, more than 600 other Canadians from Beirut were put on two 757 jets in Turkey for the journey to Canada.
Meanwhile, while it will still be an arduous and terrifying journey taking several exhausting days for as many as 30,000 Canadians, the evacuation of Lebanon has turned into an efficient process, Canadian officials and escapees in Turkey declared today.
The second wave of as many as 2100 Canadians fleeing the war-torn country arrived starting just before sunset Friday in Turkey.
"It went smoothly - we were more or less testing the whole process, and we found that it's a lot of work, it's pretty intense, but it works," said Yves Brodeur, who as Canada's ambassador to Cyprus is head of the Turkish side of the operation to evacuate Canadians from Lebanon.
The Turkish officials who handle passport checks after the Canadians leave the boats were able to process about 300 people per hour, Mr. Brodeur said.
And while they are provided with a gymnasium filled with hundreds of mattresses should they need a lengthy stay, the longest anyone had to stay before being shuttled onto a flight was three hours, Mr. Brodeur said.
"It's been good, but it's taxing for these families. It's taxing for our staff and volunteers, too - people get very tired, they're working 24, 36 hours without a break. It's very tiring and in fact it's emotionally draining - these families have been through an awful lot and they're very frustrated and in some cases sick. You help them as best as you can."
He said that it would be impossible to add more ships to the Turkish side of the operation without forcing ships to idle in the harbour for inhumane lengths of time.
However, Canadian officials said they will be adding ships to the evacuation in Cyprus.
About 700 soldiers from Canadian Forces Base Trenton in Ontario will also be added to Cyprus. Mr. Brodeur said that the Turkish operation is badly in need of more staff, though the assistance of Turkish officials has kept it from getting bogged down the way the Cyprus operation was two days ago.
"All our security, medical support and transportation is provided by the Turks - they're being very generous."
On Thursday, six boats left Beirut heading for Turkey, filled with hundreds of Canadians who had been stranded in the shattered city. The sense of order on the docks was in stark contrast to Wednesday's debacle, when a paucity of boats and the excess of promises had created a minor riot among Canadians, some of whom had been waiting in the harbour area for days, enduring terrifying bombing.

In Ontario, the provincial government said Friday Canadians returning to the province from Lebanon will have immediate access to public health care.
The province said it will exempt those people from the mandatory three-month waiting period for OHIP coverage.
Health Minister George Smitherman says the evacuees have undergone strain and stress and will have access to the "health care they need when they need it the most."

The Canadian dollar sprinted past 90 cents for the first time in nearly 30 years Tuesday, leading economists to speculate on when the loonie might match the U.S. dollar , sparking cautionary comments from one provincial premier and providing ample discussion fodder for Globe readers.
Will inflation become and issue? Will the Bank of Canada send interest rates higher? Can Canadian manufacturers, which have shed almost 200,000 jobs since the end of 2002, tolerate the upswing? Make sense of it all with Heather Scoffield, The Globe and Mail's economy reporter, who was on-line earlier Wednesday to discuss the surge and what it means for Canada. Questions and responses appear below.
Heather Scoffield covered fiscal and monetary policy for The Globe and Mail's Ottawa Bureau before becoming the newspaper's economics reporter in Toronto last year. She has written extensively about how public policy affects business and the economy.
Sorry for the delay getting started - we had some technical problems just as the discussion was beginning.
Michael Snider, globeandmail.com: Hello Heather, thanks for being with us today. I know you've got a loaded to-do list, so let's wade right in. It's taken four years, but the dollar has risen from about 64 US cents to more than 90, but recently, as in this spring, it seems the buck has picked up speed - like increased 4 1/2 per cent in April. What's behind the spring surge?
Heather Scoffield: Hi Mike. Thanks for having me. Things are developing so quickly for the Canadian dollar that I'm probably going to have to change all my answers before this chat is over...
The "spring surge", as you call it, is linked to a confluence of factors, and they're all feeding on each other. Rising oil and gas prices, of course, are pulling the Loonie up all the time. But there's more to it than that. We've seen the Loonie rise when oil and gas are flat. So part of the strength has to do with the state of the Canadian economy itself. Our economy is running flat-out, at least by the Bank of Canada's measurements. So more rate hikes may be on the horizon, at a time when it looks like the U.S. Federal Reserve is about to put rate hikes on hold. So the prospect of the two central banks heading in opposite directions makes the Canadian dollar even more attractive than it already was.
Plus, the U.S. dollar has taken a beating lately, and that makes the Canadian dollar stronger too. But part of the Canadian dollar story is just pure speculation, especially in the past few days. There is a bit of a bandwagon effect going on, with traders piling into Canada just because they see momentum there.
Hugh Clarke from Montreal writes: When the dollar falls, economists tell us that this is bad for the Canadian economy, because imports will cost more. When the dollar rises, economists tell us that this is bad for the Canadian economy, because our exports will cost more. Could I ask the economists to help the rest of us understand, by taking a consistent position?
Heather Scoffield: I don't think you'll find many economists who would uncategorically say a low or high dollar is bad for the Canadian economy. I think economists are alarmed at the speed of the appreciation. A high loonie makes our exports more expensive, but even companies that depend on exports for their profits can hope to benefit from a rising dollar by importing relatively cheaper machinery and parts for their production. And in this case, Canada's terms of trade have improved immensely, along with the rising dollar, because the world can't get enough of Canada's oil and gas. So that makes us all feel richer. The trouble comes for companies having to change their business decisions based on the rapidly changing exchange rate. If an exporting company, especially a manufacturer, can't cut costs through cheaper imports fast enough to keep up with the higher dollar, then profits will take a hit.
Mary Smith from Toronto writes: Is our dollar really appreciating because our exports are increasing or is it because the U.S. dollar is depreciating?
Heather Scoffield: The Canadian dollar is appreciating partly because of our oil and gas exports. But the rest of our export sector is not faring nearly as well, since Canadian goods are now much more expensive to the rest of the world than they were just a couple of years ago. And the U.S. dollar depreciation is also a major reason for the Canadian dollar's appreciation. The U.S. dollar has probably been due for a correction for a long time. But it's difficult to point to a single factor for the Canadian dollar's rise.
Robert Palmer from Montreal writes: I guess maybe I may have not listened fully to my macro-economics courses, but is not the rise in our dollar suppose to make imports cheaper. I guess my question is why does the same Porsche Boxster (or any car for that fact) costs over 30 per cent more in Canada than the U.S. (even though our dollar has risen over 30%). This is the same even for those cars made in Canada. Are car companies just trying to make more money of us or are afraid of lowering the price of new cars to the point that it decreases the value of cars already on the market?
Heather Scoffield: I'm a bit out of my comfort zone when it comes to the auto industry, so I asked my colleague Greg Keenan , the auto industry reporter, to take that question. He says: One reason may be that for years, prices in Canada were lower than they should have been given the exchange rate. So they may be trying to catch up from that period. I'm pretty sure that most cars don't carry a 30 per cent premium.
Sean Miller from Kamloops writes: The neo-classical economic perspective assumes that a change in the real exchange rate is a result of a change in savings and investment. This shift may be caused by an increase in investment or a decrease in saving. Because savings minus investment equals net exports the exchange rate is then directly related to trade. Given that the high Loonie will cause Canadian goods to be expensive on the international market further resulting in a trade deficit, will the benefits of having a strong currency out weigh the trade imbalance later on?
Heather Scoffield: I think you have to look past the economic theory to oil and gas. Yes, the high Loonie makes Canadian goods more expensive on the international market, but no one seems to care about that when it comes to oil and gas. People buy it anyway, and don't seem to want to cut back no matter how high the price goes. So we're not even flirting with a trade deficit. But we do have to wonder whether the strong dollar will do more harm than good in the long run. At some point, manufacturers, which are already laying off workers in droves, will feel the heat and start to go belly up. For now, at a macro-economic level, they are holding their own, but we don't know how long that can last.
Gabriel Vitus from Port Moody, BC writes: If the strengthening of the loonie against the dollar is dampening the 'exporter' market, why does Canada not increase exports to Europe? The euro/loonie exchange is still good for the 'exporters'. I think the biggest problem here is the quasi dominance of trade with the US. We were told in business school 'don't put all your eggs in the same basket' yet Canada is storing most of its eggs in a basket called US. We are loosing good opportunities to expand trade with the rest of the world. And, Marc D from Canada writes: The recent 'surge' is only compared to the U.S. dollar, which is itself dropping against other currencies. The Canadian dollar is actually dropping against other currencies. When is Canada going to learn to look beyond our southern neighbour?
Heather Scoffield: I'll take these questions together, since they are similar. The Canadian dollar has actually appreciated against other currencies too, over the past few months. That can change day to day, but when it comes to pricing exports, it's better to look at the long-term trend.
But you do put your finger on something that has confounded policy makers and Corporate Canada for decades: a dependence on the U.S. market. There have been many attempts by politicians to encourage Canadian companies to turn to the rest of the world and diversify, for their own sake as well as the country's. But in the end, the U.S. market is the biggest and richest in the world, it's right next door, and Canadian companies understand better than anyone how that market works and what it needs. We're addicted.
Sue K. Bradsteen from Bradenton, FL writes: Its very easy to stop the Canadian dollar from rising relative to the U.S. dollar. If Canada runs a Federal budget deficit, provincial budget deficits, a trade deficit, gives away its abundant natural recourses, starts a war in violation of the UN charter, fails to pass taxes to cover that war, then your Canadian dollar rise will fall. Also, it will aid in stopping that rise to get an unlimited amount of corporate control of the Canadian government. Corporations are imminently successful in draining government treasuries. Lastly, get rid of your national health program and go to HMO's. If all of this fails have your government operate in secrecy and pass a Homeland Security Act that allows the government to enter any home without a warrant. When your national debt reaches one entire year of your GDP if you haven't stopped the rise of your currency then you should consider abolishing all taxes on the very wealthiest and corporations. P.S. Hopefully one day our countries will again enjoy the commaradery we once knew.
Heather Scoffield: Thanks for reminding us that a high Canadian dollar is partly the result of doing some things right in our country. It was pretty depressing when we were at 62, despite having eliminated the deficit, getting inflation down, cutting taxes and so forth.
Al Forone from Toronto writes: It appears to me there are two issues re the surging C$: the obvious is the direct relationship to the U$, which is something like the sparrow that flits around but never wants to get too far from the rhinoceros, but the larger question is whether the U$ is going to fall relative to the other major currency rhinos when its interest rates level off, seriously affecting the trade and debt saw-off that has been keeping the US economy going strong. On this, I was surprised that Mr. Dodge, who has been campaigning for action on the global issue, sounds so hawkish about raising Canadian interest rates and lifting the C$ above and beyond the effects of the commodity spike. What is the Bank of Canada contingency for a serious weakening of the U$.
Heather Scoffield: You have obviously been studying the most recent edition of the central bank's Monetary Policy Report. Yes, Mr. Dodge did seem to have a shift in his thinking about the prospects of a disorderly resolution of the U.S. current account deficit. Until last week, Mr. Dodge was quite alarmist about the possibility that 2007 could bring big trouble for the Canadian economy if the world were to suddenly lose confidence in the ability of the United States to bankroll its massive deficits. But he has backed away from that fear, and says he is less pessimistic than before, mainly because the other major economies of the world - Asia and Europe - seem to be picking up some speed.
The central bank believes that even if the U.S. dollar continues to weaken significantly, the Canadian dollar has already finished most of its adjustment and would only move a few more cents as a result. That belief looks a bit questionable given the rise in the Canadian dollar in the past few days. Mr. Dodge will answer questions this afternoon from the Senate in Ottawa, and I'm sure he'll have something to say about this.
Editor's note: you can tune into Mr. Dodge's Senate meeting via the Internet. The meeting will be Webcast at 4 p.m. EDT.
Andrew Addison from Taiwan writes: Hi, I'm currently living and working in Taiwan. I have been here for a couple of years and have managed to save a decent amount of cash over that time. In Taiwanese currency I have maintained a consistent salary; however with the strengthening Canadian dollar my wage, after conversion, has dropped significantly. I plan to permanently return to Canada in mid august and will bring my saving with me. Do you foresee any potential for the dollar to drop to the .85US range we saw a month or so ago? Thanks for your time.
Heather Scoffield: I suggest you ask for a raise! As for the future of the Canadian dollar, there seems to be a rush among forecasters to call for an ever-stronger loonie, but I'm not going to get caught on that bandwagon. Markets are fluctuating rapidly these days, and I think we'd be better off to wait for a few days, at least, to see how our currency develops, and then see what the forecasters say. And keep your eye on the U.S. economy. If it falters, as many say it will, then Canada will pay a price, and it could trickle down to the exchange rate. So while currency traders don't see a huge downside to the loonie right now, that could change quickly.
Sonny L from Toronto writes: Why isn't the rising Canadian dollar having the calming effect on interest rates it's supposed to have? Some say inflationary pressures are greater than the BoC and Fed are letting on. Finally, is the new Harper budget going to feed inflationary pressures?
Heather Scoffield: I think the rising Canadian dollar has actually had a huge effect on inflationary pressure. The central bank thinks the Canadian economy is operating at full capacity and has been for some time. Normally, this is a sure recipe for a rising inflation rate. But the core inflation rate has been well below the bank's target of 2 per cent for more than two years now. Part of that is because the strong Canadian dollar has made imports really cheap, keeping the overall level of prices down despite the strength of our economy. As for the budget, there is a debate right now about whether it is unduly stimulative, but the upshot of the debate is that yes, it is simulative, but not to the point where the Bank of Canada is going to get really worried.
Jill Paylor from Gravenhurst writes: Are all signs are leading to a recession in today's economy?
Heather Scoffield: No. Some signs point to trouble in some sectors. Manufacturing is struggling, although output is still increasing -- contrary to what has happened in past recessions. The forestry industry has had a tough time, partly because of the exchange rate. But unemployment is at a 30-year low, corporate profits are flying high, and growth is steady and strong. Those trends won't change in a big hurry.
Robert Palmer from Montreal writes: In terms of large-ticket consumer items (i.e. cars, appliances, etc.), should we not see a decrease in the costs of these goods from last year?
Heather Scoffield: Yes, especially if those items are imported, or contain lots of imported parts. We've seen major decreases in the prices of electronics and computerized products, partly because of the currency and partly because global competition is keeping those prices low.
Jerry King from Toronto writes: Hi Heather, are you aware of any sectors of the Canadian manufacturing landscape that are experiencing, or have the potential to experience, productivity increases of a magnitude that can withstand the appreciation in the Canadian dollar?
Heather Scoffield: The manufacturing sector has actually made astounding progress on the productivity front, and it's probably a large part of the reason why there's not more carnage in that sector. Statscan just revised its productivity numbers for last year, and we don't yet have a breakdown for manufacturing, but it looks like productivity gains were well over five per cent for the sector. That's really high. But the effects of a high dollar are notoriously slow to kick in, so it looks like manufacturers have, overall, adapted to earlier rises in the loonie. I'm not sure how well they will fare adapting to the most recent wave. There are no doubt massive layoffs still in the works. Manufacturing output has been on the increase, but I don't know if that will continue once the effects of the 90-cent loonie begin to be felt.
Elias Peter from Toronto writes: We have seen the housing prices tumbling in some US Markets. Will the rise in dollar affect house prices in Ontario, since the Ontario economy depend on the manufacturing sector?
Heather Scoffield: Housing prices in Canada have surprised most forecasters lately. There were many predictions late last year for a cooling off in the market this year, but so far, it has not materialized. The Ontario economy, however, is indeed facing some major challenges because of the high dollar. Rates have risen and may continue to rise, while the Ontario economy is bumbling along at a sub-par rate. So housing could react to that. But it's not that straightforward, because the Ontario unemployment rate is really low, wages are rising, and corporate profits are booming. So that could feed into higher housing prices.
Gerry Harrington from Ottawa writes: I'm not sure I understand why inflation is such a concern with respect to the rising Loonie. It seems to me that a rising Loonie tempers export growth and reduces import costs, both deflationary pressures. Increasing nominal interest rates to guard against inflation would also only drive the Loonie higher, taking even more steam out of inflationary pressures. Am I missing something?
Heather Scoffield: No, I don't think you're missing anything. That's why the Bank of Canada is in a delicate position right now. Does the bank continue to raise rates to fight off potential inflationary pressure, and risk overdoing it because higher rates will drive the loonie higher? The central bank's commentary lately seems conflicted, and probably reflects a huge internal debate they're having on this topic. We'll see what David Dodge has to say about it all this afternoon.
Michael Snider, globeandmail.com: Heather, thanks very much for being with us today. Readers, we're sorry if we didn't get to your questions/comments. Please feel free to add your two cents by clicking on the "comment" link below.
If you have any thoughts about the Discussion format or would like to see a particular reporter/columnist invited on or a particular subject covered, let us know. You can email your thoughts to msnider@globeandmail.com
Heather Scoffield: Thanks for all your insightful questions. It's great to see some women engage in some public debate on economics. It's a fascinating time to be watching the currency markets, the inflation rate, the unemployment rate and housing prices. They all seem full of surprises, making business decisions and monetary policy quite tricky. So far, Canada is faring well, but stay tuned to see if that can last.

Lorne Abony, 36
Chief executive officer, Fun Technologies PLC, Toronto
BY KATHY ENGLISH
As chief executive officer and co-founder of one of the world's most successful on-line gaming companies, Lorne Abony's work is all about fun with a capital F.
Mr. Abony heads Fun Technologies PLC, a market-leading developer of on-line gaming technologies. Traded on the TSX and the London Stock Exchange, the company has built an on-line community of more than 16 million gamers who pay to play games of skill on-line. Among Fun Technologies' games are the popular Bejeweled as well as solitaire, checkers and spelling quizzes. They are played on some of the busiest websites on the planet including AOL, Disney, Virgin Games, MSN and NASCAR.com.
Last November, Liberty Media Corp., controlled by U.S. billionaire John Malone, paid about $194-million (U.S.) for a 51-per-cent stake in the company, giving it a market value of about $480-million. Mr. Abony remains at the helm of this new gaming empire now set to expand into television and wireless hand-held devices.
Mr. Abony puts much stock in the value of hard work. "I'm the hardest working human being I know," he says. "I slept in a hotel room 207 nights last year. I'm a high-energy individual. My mind never stops and I'm constantly thinking of new ideas and new ways to build my businesses."
Mr. Abony, who earned a BA from McGill University in 1991 and a law degree from the University of Windsor in 1994, is an "absolute entrepreneur at heart." He briefly practised law with Aird & Berlis but left in 1998 to launch his first on-line venture: Petopia, a pet supplies company. He sold that to Petco in 2000, just prior to its IPO. In 2002, while working on his MBA at Columbia Business School, Mr. Abony and lifelong friend Andrew Rivkin became fascinated by on-line skill gaming and launched CES Software. The name was changed in 2004 when the company went public and could not obtain the CES symbol on the TSX.
But building the company has not been all fun and games. Like most Internet start-ups the company has gone through trying times -- in April, 2003, it nearly ran out of operating cash. But hard work and perseverance won out.
"You must never give up even when things are excruciatingly difficult and it would be easy to do so."
Linda McCurdy, 37
President and CEO, K-Bro Linen Systems Inc., Toronto
BY LISA STEPHENS
Changing a hotel or hospital's fresh linen may be one thing, but changing the culture of the company that delivers those linens is another.
Linda McCurdy is up to the challenge. She has transformed K-Bro Linen Systems, the supplier of linen services to the hospitality and health-care sectors, from a privately held company into an income trust traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
With the financially savvy Ms. McCurdy at the helm -- she holds both an MBA and CGA -- K-Bro has shown annual revenue growth of 10 per cent over the past five years, with earnings growth of 75 per cent over the same period. The company has successfully entered major new health-care markets by constructing a new $10-million facility in Vancouver to serve the burgeoning market there.
But although the company's financial performance has been, well, spotless, Ms. McCurdy's real satisfaction has come from what she describes as "driving through a culture of excellence" among the company's staff.
"We all have a comfort zone," she says, "and it's wonderful to move people beyond theirs into a zone of excellence."
In developing the corporate culture, Ms. McCurdy notes the importance of letting people feel free to make mistakes.
"Stuff happens," she says, "but [corporate change]is not about laying blame or retribution."
Having fun in your job is crucial, in Ms. McCurdy's view. "If you don't [enjoy your job]you'll just get burnt out."
Ms. McCurdy is sharpening K-Bro's competitive edge for what she sees as the growing challenge of containing the tremendous cost pressures that hospitals are facing.
"They're increasingly focusing on the core strength, which is patient care, and contracting out other services," she says.
Ms. McCurdy's career has taken her from accounting at the Overwaitea Food Group in B.C. to controller of Buy-Low Foods for the Jim Pattison Group there. She moved to Canadian Innovatech, a biochemical, egg and dairy processing operation with seven plants in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and Europe as chief financial officer in 1996 and came aboard K-Bro as chief financial officer based in Edmonton in 1998.
Karen Radford, 37
Executive vice-president and president, Telus Quebec and Telus Partner Solutions, Montreal
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
The challenge presented by Karen Radford stems from the fact that both her work and her outside activities sound equally interesting. Freshly arrived in Montreal, where she deals with both TELUS Quebec and TELUS's Partner Solutions wing, she works with wholesale partners across North America, providing carrier and operator services, buying and selling technology.
"It's not traditional wholesale," she points out, "but everything from consulting services to smaller telcos, hiring and recruiting -- you name it. And then I do all of Quebec which is the best example of fractal geometry in the world."
For Ms. Radford, it means providing leadership to two groups of "very strong people, talent that has grown up within the organization. It's almost like finding a way to just let these people step into their own greatness, to do what they want to do." Her challenge, she says, is how to honour that history "at the same time challenging every single thought process to say, 'how do we grow more out of territory, and how do you do that with focus?' "
On a personal note, she is just settling into a new home with husband, Jason, and two small boys. "So the opportunity I have," she says, "is to get embedded in a whole new very dynamic culture, to make a new set of contacts and friends and community involvement and board involvement."
The latter is important to a woman who is full of broader ideas about what she wants from life. Originally from Moncton, N.B, she believes that being from a small city and from Atlantic Canada has taught her a great deal "about the values of and being part of your community."
Ms. Radford sits on a number of boards, including the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary. Last year, she gathered a group of like-minded friends and set up the Woman's Leadership Forum, a project that has her tremendously excited. In a matter of a few months, they organized and did fund-raising for a conference on what she calls the ABC's of leadership -- "awakening to your dreams, balance and career" -- that attracted more than 750 women from across Canada. This year, she's working to have the forum expanded to three more cities across the country.
"As a woman in business," she says, "I believe that sometimes we need someone to talk to who's living in the same world and that we can just bounce ideas off of, to ask things like, if we had the courage to act, what would we do with our lives."
While in Calgary, Ms. Radford also got involved with Women in Motion and Youth in Motion, which also mentor and promote leadership among women, youth and new immigrants.
"I really believe that the best way to make Canada a stronger country is to invest in having better leaders, stronger leaders, more and better programs for youth," she says. "It's about how to make Canada a better place, and if I look at the richness of that, it is, of course, in our children. That's where a lot of my outside activity comes from."
David Ceolin, 39
President, Digital Cement Inc.,
Toronto
BY KATHY ENGLISH
David Ceolin was 28 and working as an investment banker when he wrote .
Not surprisingly, Mr. Ceolin's future did not lie in investment banking but rather in the business of ideas and innovation. After writing his book, he began working as a consultant specializing in marketing strategy. In 2000, Mr. Ceolin launched Digital Cement, a marketing services firm in the business of helping companies build long-term customized relationships with their customers. With 100 employees, Digital Cement is now one of Canada's larger marketing-services companies with an impressive roster of global Fortune 500 clients.
"I knew I could not accept the status quo of working within a large corporation. I needed to get out and start something innovative," Mr. Ceolin says. "I saw a huge gap in the market and I didn't just look at the Canadian market. This service is needed globally. If you want to be happy, never accept the status quo. Believe that the status quo can always be improved upon, and push to change it."
As president of Digital Cement -- a name chosen to represent the future (the digital) and the traditional (the cement that holds it all together) -- Mr. Ceolin has built a company that brings together creative, technical and business types to help customers innovate.
The company's core values -- progress, passion and performance -- are those that Mr. Ceolin strives to exemplify. "There are opportunities everywhere for those that have both integrity and passion."
Mr. Ceolin, a graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University's honours business program, believes in the power of people working together and "the karma" of creating a circle of people who help one another in business. "My own philosophy is to help others that approach me for help, since I often ask others," he says. "The resulting network of like-minded souls who help one another can become the greatest asset you possess and help yourself and others achieve anything."
As he looks ahead, Mr. Ceolin, the father of two young daughters, believes this power can be harnessed to build a better world.
"We have a world that is still in imbalance in many ways -- economically, ecologically. We have the talented minds with the collective ability to help solve these issues. That's what I am interested in."

staff neurologist, director of Pediatric MS Clinic, associate scientist, Research Institute,

BY KATHY ENGLISH
Pediatric neurologist Dr. Brenda Banwell directs a world-class research program in childhood multiple sclerosis, provides ongoing care to MS patients at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and teaches neurology classes to students at the University of Toronto's medical school.
And somehow, Dr. Banwell, the mother of three busy daughters, also finds time and energy to teach aerobics classes.
"For me, success is defined as enthusiastic involvement in life," says Dr. Banwell, a world expert in pediatric multiple sclerosis. "I also believe that success in life requires a small degree of selfishness -- you must do something for 'me' otherwise there is no me left. Teaching aerobics and maintaining physical fitness is my way of achieving personal success."
Dr. Banwell received her MD from the University of Western Ontario in 1991 and went on to complete pediatric residencies at the Children's Hospital of Western Ontario and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. She then completed a neuromuscular clinical and research fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
When she returned to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children to specialize in pediatric neurology, she was assigned to care for several children with multiple sclerosis, a disease of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves that can cause problems with muscle control, strength, balance, vision and sensation.
"I decided that if I was going to look after these children with MS, I had to prepare what I thought was a world-class program, and I was given the green light to create a pediatric MS clinic."
Dr. Banwell now directs both research and clinical work within the Toronto pediatric MS program. In 2004, her team published groundbreaking research in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicating that the Epstein-Barr virus may play a key role in triggering MS. "I feel that what we're doing in research is critically important if we're going to find out what causes this disease," she says. "But I also love the time I spend with my patients.
"I really do love my job and feel privileged to play a role in the lives of children with multiple sclerosis and other diseases," she says. "There is nothing more rewarding than feeling like what you do makes a difference."
Christopher Alexander, 37
Deputy special representative of the secretary-general for Afghanistan, United Nations
BY KATHY ENGLISH
For diplomat Christopher Alexander, now serving with the United Nations in Afghanistan, public service is indeed a higher calling.
Mr. Alexander, Canada's former ambassador to Afghanistan, was appointed last year as the deputy special representative of the secretary-general of the UN. He sought the position because of his conviction that the future of Afghanistan has great geopolitical importance.
"This, for me, was a challenge not to be missed. The UN has a central and impartial role in implementing the Afghanistan Compact -- the ambitious blueprint for the next five years of international engagement in Afghanistan," he said.
"Afghanistan is a long way from home, but the issues we are addressing here -- building democracy, reducing poverty, fighting terrorism, celebrating pluralism -- matter for the entire world."
Toronto-born Mr. Alexander earned a BA from McGill University and went on to complete a master's degree at Oxford University. He joined Canada's Foreign Affairs department in 1991 and spent much of the 1990s in Moscow.
He was appointed to Afghanistan in 2003.
While Canada continues to debate the deployment of our military in Afghanistan, for Mr. Alexander, there is absolutely no ambiguity about our country's role, or his own decision to serve there.
"Few countries in the world are as receptive to international support and to change as Afghanistan today," he says.
"To work in Afghanistan today is to be part of a partnership on a grand scale between the international community and one of the world's least-developed countries; that is its own reward."
Mr. Alexander defines success as "cleaving to the unambiguously enjoyable." For him, public service is such a vocation.
"I would like to see more Canadians recognize public service as the huge challenge and high calling that it has always been," he says. "Little quickens the spirit like serving one's country."
While public service involves decisions that engage the interests of society as a whole, he believes the formula for success is the same as in business and other walks of life -- "hard work, integrity, teamwork, breadth of spirit, openness to new ideas, indomitability.
"You know you have been successful if you change people's lives and leave stronger institutions behind you."
Scott McCrea, 39
President, Armour Group Ltd., and president and CEO, Overland Realty Ltd., HalifaxBY LISA STEPHENS
'The great joy of my profession is to create things. You may never see your manufactured stuff again, but the buildings -- the places you create -- transcend your business," says Scott McCrea, president of the Armour Group Ltd., a real estate development company in Nova Scotia.
Born and raised in Halifax, Mr. McCrea's grasp of the enduring impact of real estate development on a community comes naturally to him. He is the second generation to manage Armour, a family-held company whose roots in Halifax are anchored to the integration of the ownership, construction and management of their properties, which incorporate many of the city's historic and traditional spaces.
To these enterprises Mr. McCrea has recently added his own venture, the publicly traded Overland Realty Limited, designed to leverage his Armour experience and community development savvy into the acquisition and development of commercial real estate in secondary markets across Canada.
With his experience in developing and managing historic assets, he brings a knowledgeable eye to opportunities that others may miss. "There are secondary markets like Niagara, Brandon or Fredericksburg where the return opportunities are just so great," he says, "they far outweigh the perceived risks."
Mr. McCrea says his best personal contribution to the creation of these properties is his conceptual creativity, his gift for lateral thinking.
"As a developer, you're constantly being told 'no,' 'it can't be done' and 'we don't want it' " he says. "You need real perseverance here, the ability to move around continual obstacles and focus on your goals."
His personal goal in life is to be able to look back "on the quality of the work we've done, the communities we've built. I want to be able to take my grandkids around some day and show them how we've positively developed the region."
Mr. McCrea derives particular satisfaction from the job opportunities Armour has created in Atlantic Canada. "We've built interesting and positive workplaces here that have a real sense of community. We are proud of never having laid any of our employees off; we are deeply sensitive to the Maritimes culture and sense of community"
Poonam Puri, 34
Associate professor of law, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Toronto
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
It was on a family trip back to her parents' homeland during summer holidays that Poonam Puri discovered her calling in law.
She'd asked a favourite professor at the University of Toronto, Martin Friedland, whether she could bring him anything from India. "You know, a book, or some kind of food he liked," she recalls. "And he said, 'Yeah, sure, bring me back a couple of murder cases from the turn of the century, involving not only law but politics, the British, and I'll see if I can put together a book.'"
Ms. Puri, already a high achieving second-year student, went to work in the Indian Law Institute and the Supreme Court Library in Delhi. By getting involved in a research project, she says, "I was able to see how you can take an important public policy issue, or legal issue, work it through the process of research and come to recommendations that are useful and meaningful, taken up by policy-makers and regulators, and moved forward."
More than a decade later, Mr. Friedland is still working on his book, but his former student has earned an LLM from Harvard and gone into academia herself.
Joining the Osgoode Hall Law School at age 25, she is not only a star professor but also a meticulous researcher into issues of securities regulation and public capital markets governance. She's currently part of an Investment Dealers Association-sponsored task force to modernize securities regulation, and a member of the OSC Investor Advisory Committee. Previous projects include recommendations for rejuvenating the local bond market in Nigeria and the preparation of a bill on securities law to be tabled in the Canadian Senate.
Ms. Puri admits that she "takes on a lot," including articles, books and committee work such as helping organize Toronto's annual Brazilian Ball. But she finds it hard to say no when a particular project resonates with her.
"The projects I'm working on right now are extremely significant, not in a narrow sense to issuers and investors, but in the broader sense," she says. "I feel these issues are extremely important in the context of our entire Canadian society, in fact."
Her days, she admits, can be hectic, a balancing act between her teaching and research commitments and her family, not to mention a daily visit to the gym. She's up at the crack of dawn to make breakfast for her two little girls, Amaris and Jaidan, and she heads back up to her office when they are finally asleep to work into the night.
Sometimes that balancing act can bring about moments of almost touching incongruity. Last year, just two weeks after giving birth to her younger daughter, Ms. Puri found herself heading to the offices of Ogilvie Renault to make a presentation to the IDA-sponsored task force -- baby and nanny in tow. Unwilling to interrupt her nursing schedule, she had the baby waiting in a side room, as blissfully unaware of the task force members as they were of her. "I think Amaris has got to be the only two-week-old who's been on Bay Street," she says, laughing.
Roma Khanna, 36
Senior vice-president of content, CHUM Television, Toronto
BY SALEM ALATON
It was while toiling in the legal and business affairs department of Sony Music Canada that Roma Khanna got caught up in the revolution.
German engineering had created a way to compress enormous amounts of audio data into readily transferable computer files. That might have made MP3 sound like a police technology, but young people had other things in mind. And so did Ms. Khanna.
"It wasn't something that everyone really understood, but it just really clicked with me," says Ms. Khanna, who came to CHUM in 2003 as vice-president of interactive media after producing cross-media editions of television programs such as and at Toronto's Snap Media.
The MP3 revelation didn't send Ms. Khanna scurrying to download Metallica but it did underline that entertainment industry products were about to start ricocheting around the known universe on fast-changing, multiple-access platforms. In jumping to Snap she netted three Gemini awards for http://www.Degrassi.tv, winning over adolescent eyeballs as well as hard hearts sheathed in Hugo Boss.
The Toronto-raised daughter of parents who came from India in 1965, Ms. Khanna brought a daunting level of drive to the table, with law degrees in Canada and the U.S. to complement her MBA from York University's Schulich School of Business. Fret about having to watch Stanley Kubrick films on a cellphone and she gets impatient.
"The content needs to adapt for the media," says Ms. Khanna, named last year by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter as one of the top female executives to watch in the entertainment industry. "You make content mobile [if]there's something about it that's better mobile."
CHUM Television -- with CityTV as the name leading its dozen local television stations and MuchMusic among its 21 specialty channels -- saw a kindred soul in Ms. Khanna, not to mention someone still young enough to qualify as a wunderkind.
"We're the most progressive broadcaster in North America, hands down," Ms. Khanna declares. "They hired me -- that's not a traditional choice."
Her responsibilities range from program acquisition and licensing to overseeing independent production, in-house production and, of course, the interactive division. She also manages to sit on boards for the Telefilm Canada New Media Fund, NextMedia, Canadian Women in Communications, the National Association of Television Program Executives and the Canadian Film Centre, among others.
And there's nothing like a good upbringing: "I have very strong, smart, supportive, loving parents who have always expected me to do my best, not someone else's best."
They could scarcely have known how much they were asking.
James Dean, 39
President and chief executive officer, DPoint Technologies Inc., VancouverBY MICHAEL RYVAL
James Dean had his first exposure to the fuel cell industry in 1998 when he moved to Vancouver to run KPMG's consulting practice and landed Ballard Power Systems Inc. as a client.
"What excited me was the social good it could bring by introducing environmentally friendly technologies to the world," says Mr. Dean, a Toronto native who has a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Waterloo and an MBA from the University of Western Ontario. "You can not only be socially responsible but also successful from a business perspective."
And so began an association with fuel cells that has seen Mr. Dean involved in three different companies. He got his feet wet when he and business partner David Chapman, an investment banker, took a stake in Greenlight Power Technologies Inc., a firm based in Sydney, B.C.
But in January, 2001, his career took another twist when the company was acquired by its closest rival, Hydrogenics Corp of Mississauga, Ont. In the process, it moved to Vancouver and was responsible for making test equipment. Annual sales grew to $27-million as auto manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan flocked to the division.
In 2004, bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, Mr. Dean went on his own and set up DPoint. He focused on an aspect of fuel cell technology known as humidification, as many industry players complained that the existing products were too large, too expensive or performed poorly. DPoint's products humidify the air stream that is passed through a fuel cell to improve its performance and reliability.
Mr. Dean ended up back at Ballard, which had the technology, and last March signed a licensing agreement for the patents, designs and manufacturing equipment. DPoint's products are used in telecom power systems and forklifts.
Mr. Dean is a new father and active in Social Venture Partners. Through this network of 70 entrepreneurs, he is involved in Starworks Packaging and Assembly, which provides light manufacturing and assembly employment for people with mental disabilities.
"We're helping them bring in new customers," Mr. Dean says, "because we want them to be sustainable so they don't have to look to governments for funding and can plow profits back into growing their organization.
Jonathan Carroll, 38
President, itravel2000.com Inc., Mississauga, Ont.
BY KATHY ENGLISH
When Jonathan Carroll decided to follow in the footsteps of his father in the travel industry, little did he know his journey would take him into the whole new world of cyberspace.
Mr. Carroll is president of itravel2000.com Inc., Canada's largest on-line travel company. He was 26 when he launched his own travel company in 1993 to sell vacations over the telephone. He quickly moved to the Web when he realized it would become the first stop for Canadians heading away on vacation.
"I grew up in the travel industry, and I saw the market change with people moving away from travel agents and feeling comfortable buying vacations over the telephone," says Mr. Carroll, who was 17 when he became a regional sales manager with Sunquest Vacations, where his father, Edward, worked in the executive ranks.
"The Internet changed things dramatically and gave us another opportunity to communicate with our customers," he says. "A substantial part of our business is now delivered through the Internet."
But Mr. Carroll is adamant that technology is no substitute for customer service and competitive prices. "We didn't reinvent the wheel," he says.
"On-line or offline, we have to give our customers a sense of security and trust. We're selling an experience, we're selling dreams, and we're selling medicine. People are so stressed these days and they are saying, 'It's my God-given right to go on vacation.' "
Mr. Carroll's company employs 170 people. On its 10th anniversary, he flew every one of them to the Bahamas for a long weekend.
And though Mr. Carroll is the public voice of itravel2000 -- he can be heard on radio ads across Canada -- he gives large credit for the company's success to the team he's built. That includes his father, now 67, who is chairman of the company, his brother and his best friend.
"You dream of building a great company where everyone around you is happy and successful and we're doing it," the father of three says.
"I believed we could do something different in the travel industry, and if you believe in something you can't just talk about it, you have to do it."
Mr. Carroll's best career advice?
"Treat your career as a dream. Believe in yourself and never abandon your dream.
"There will be obstacles and challenges, but keep believing in yourself and your dream and it will become a reality."
Philip Zelazo, 39
Canada research chair and professor of neuropsychology, University of Toronto
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Armed with a degree from McGill University and a PhD from Yale, Philip Zelazo is exploring an area that has until recently been the domain mostly of philosophers.
"I'm interested in consciousness and how people come to control their behaviour consciously," he says. "Quite a lot of what we do, we do for reasons that aren't entirely clear; there are genetic influences, and the environment has contingencies in it that require us to behave in certain ways and not in others."
Sometimes, however, we make a deliberate decision to do something, like break a habit.
"It's that sort of choice point I am particularly interested in: How it is that human beings are able to exercise conscious control over their thoughts and their actions and so forth?"
It's a topic "that, until fairly recently, has not been considered amenable to scientific analysis or investigation," says Dr. Zelazo, who recently finished co-editing the first comprehensive handbook on the subject.
"It was considered more a philosophical problem. But what we're starting to do in developmental cognitive neuroscience is study consciousness scientifically, using the techniques, tools and theories that scientists use."
At this stage, he has been examining how consciousness develops early in childhood.
"By looking at how this really quite mysterious and complex ability unfolds gradually in the course of childhood, we can begin to dissect it into its constituent pieces," he says.
What has him particularly excited is his study of cultural effects on this process. Together with a colleague in China, he has set up the Sino-Canadian Centre for Childhood Research and Development. Its branch at Southwest University in China carries out the same experiments with children as at the University of Toronto.
And though he wasn't expecting it, they have found "really remarkable differences," he says, "suggesting that culture plays an important role in cognitive development, and probably in neural development, from the earliest ages. There is this huge opportunity in China to look at these questions that no one's had before."
Dr. Zelazo is married to a behavioural psychologist, Laurel Bidwell Zelazo, who is finishing her doctorate at New York's Columbia University.
Their little boy, Sam, probably can't avoid being the subject of rather more personal observation.
"When you're spending a fair bit of time with one 18-month-old," his father says, "it adds a whole other kind of dimension to the picture. It rounds out the story, so it has been enlightening for me."
Erifili Morfidis, 34
President and CEO, Teleperformance Canada, TorontoBY LISA STEPHENS
'I fell into this business -- and I'm glad I did," says Erifili Morfidis, the president and CEO of Teleperformance Canada. "It provides me an outlet to deal with people in so many ways. I love the variety and the fast pace."
If beating out more than 250 candidates for the position of CEO at the company at age 23 can be described as falling into something, then Erifili Morfidis certainly landed on her feet.
Since then, she has grown Teleperformance Canada from interviewing prospective employees in a restaurant because she didn't have an office to employing more than 2,000 people in a state-of-the-art telephone contact centre that has shown double-digit growth every year since its inception in 1995. The company has become one of the world's leading suppliers of help-desk and billing call services for major international telecommunications, banking and insurance companies.
Over the past decade, Ms. Morfidis has turned the traditional call-centre concept inside out, transforming the bulk of Teleperformance's business from outbound solicitation calls for not-for-profit fundraising and market prospecting to providing Fortune 100 companies with dedicated customer services for inbound inquiries. She has created an almost unbeatable turnaround time for establishing new client call-response centres, moving the industry benchmark start-up time to within 23 business days from two months.
Ms. Morfidis says her mind works compulsively even into the wee hours of the morning, when she awakens with an idea and reaches for the phone to leave herself a voicemail message. "My poor husband has taken to batting the phone out of my hand at that hour."
Ms. Morfidis paid her way through university, earning her degrees in criminology and sociology by working at call centres. That entry-level experience evolved into her becoming the director of call services and senior trainer for Responsive Marketing Group Inc. while still in school. She describes herself as someone with real empathy for the person on the "other end" of a telemarketing phone line.
Today, Ms. Morfidis has her strategic antenna tuned to the competitive prospects of offshore call centres, even as her parent corporation, SR Teleperformance, dominates that market. "In the end, it's the people aspect of taking your call centre offshore," she notes. "And that usually means the exhausting travel time required for your senior executives to travel halfway around the world for a face to face meeting with your service suppliers."
Karim Nader, 39
Associate professor, department of psychology, McGill University, Montreal
BY LISA STEPHENS
Karim Nader sees beauty where others might see only data. His groundbreaking medical research has opened up a field of therapeutic, philosophical and artistic possibilities that are only beginning to be explored.
Dr. Nader's breakthrough discovery -- that fear-induced memories could be chemically modified or erased -- was prompted by a slideshow presented by Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel of photos of brain synapses that showed the physical connections formed by emotion and memory. The findings had been first demonstrated in 1968 but were largely ignored by researchers.
"I put the idea into my memory file as a really fun idea. When we eventually ran the experiment, I thought it was really beautiful, since the data went completely against the present field," says Dr. Nader, who is based at McGill University. "I thought: This is impossible!"
As a medical researcher, Dr. Nader later recalled the slideshow and built upon it to discover that recalled memories are not necessarily stable but can be chemically modified to reduce their traumatic emotional qualities. He's now working, as he describes it, to "turn down the gain control" on memories, so that truly traumatic experiences can be remembered and experienced with real feeling but without triggering the full emotional pandemonium of the original incident.
Dr. Nader's research could make it possible for people suffering from otherwise untreatable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to respond to conventional treatments or therapy. He stresses that his work is directed at reducing the intensity of PTSD emotions, not at removing them entirely. "That would be spooky," he says.
In the future, though, Dr. Nader's discoveries could lead to treatments for drug addiction, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
"I'm amazed at how fast we've moved -- we went from snails to humans in just three years," he says. "And now we're testing, 'Can you therapeutically treat with this?' in just six years. So many people are getting into this field now, it's so much bigger and better than I ever could have imagined."
Born in Cairo, Dr. Nader recalls his early fascination with human physiology.
"I'd walk home from school and wiggle my finger and wonder: How does this happen?" He pursued scientific research, he says, because science is "only about the data. You can be anyone; it's about the evidence." He thinks of good scientific research as "a fun, creative way of testing things."
Dr. Nader did his undergraduate and graduate training in neuroscience at the University of Toronto, then at New York University. He joined the department of psychology at McGill University in 2001.
Dr. Nader is an avid reader of fiction, especially magical realism. On a recent trip to Prague he took only black and white film since "in my imagination the city was all about Kafka: black and grey. Instead it was brilliant colour!" he says, waxing enthusiastic at the city's beauty. "The stained glass windows . . . the blues were so rich."
Mark Cohon, 40
President and chief executive officer, AudienceView Software Corp., Toronto BY MICHAEL RYVAL
When Mark Cohon returned to Canada three years ago after a lengthy stint in the U.S. and Europe, he met two entrepreneurs who had set up AudienceView.
The company was a natural fit for Mr. Cohon. It was trying to establish itself in the ticketing business, and Mr. Cohon had roots in the sports and entertainment industries. After about three months as an adviser, he became president. Last year, he became CEO of the 70-employee company.
A graduate of Chicago's Northwestern University, where he received a Bachelors of Science and majored in communication studies, Mr. Cohon has always been one for a challenge. In 1990, he set up a charity called Youth Challenge International and led an expedition to the Arctic and Siberia with 30 Canadian and then-Soviet students. Later, he worked for Major League Baseball International as director of game development; he was charged with promoting the brand in such countries as Japan and Venezuela.
In 1994, he met David Stern, the head of the National Basketball Association, and he joined the organization as head of international marketing. During his stint he set up an office in London, U.K., where he sold television rights and licensed products throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Later, he ran the association's business-development branch and set up the NBA City restaurant in Orlando, Fla.
Mr. Cohon was drawn to AudienceView. "I had seen the dominance of TicketMaster. The only way to buy tickets was through them," Mr. Cohon says. "But this company had the idea that with more and more people buying tickets on-line, we could eliminate the middle man and offer a solution where theatres and sports teams could get into the ticket business themselves."
"People can call the Blue Jays call centre, or go to http://www.bluejays.com, or go to the box office and buy tickets directly," Mr. Cohon says. "The team's management keeps all the data on the sales, and the incremental service charges."
About 60 clients, representing 85 venues in Canada, the U.S. and U.K., have agreements with AudienceView. Clients include Wynn Las Vegas Resorts, Churchill Downs, Southampton Football Club and Mirvish Productions.
"It's not just about selling tickets," Mr. Cohon says. The software includes business intelligence tools that promote greater revenue. "It's about eventually selling a parking pass, or merchandise, or a podcast to see the highlights of the game that spectators went to. That's what we're enabling our customers to do."
When he's not busy selling the merits of AudienceView, the son of Susan and George Cohon (founder and former head of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada) has taken a page from his parents and is active in the community. In January, he was appointed chair of the Ontario Science Centre. With his long-standing interest in wildlife and the environment, he had previously served two-and-a-half years as a member of the board of trustees.
"It's a great place and it is going through a transformation," Mr. Cohon says of the centre, which has completed a $45-million capital campaign. "My objective is to take the Ontario Science Centre outside the four walls and promote science and technology to our community."
Jordan Banks, 37
Managing director, eBay Canada, Toronto
BY KATHY ENGLISH
Jordan Banks abandoned his dream job as legal counsel to the National Hockey League Players' Association to join eBay Canada as employee No. 2.
Now, as managing director of the Canadian operation, Mr. Banks has overall responsibility for the ongoing development of eBay.ca, the popular Internet shopping site.
When Mr. Jordan was initially approached about joining the California-based on-line auction website at its Canadian launch in 2000, he knew little about the eBay phenomenon and was reluctant to leave the NHLPA. But then his wife, Faith, a veterinarian, browsed eBay and discovered a ready cache of the antique veterinary tins she collects. Then Mr. Banks visited the sports memorabilia section and was "blown away" by the breadth and depth of product available. He decided to take the risk of joining the Canadian start-up.
"It was the best calculated risk I ever took," he says. "If it wasn't for my wife, I'm not sure I would have made the jump, though. When I looked at eBay through her eyes, I could see its potential."
Now, no matter where Mr. Banks goes in his business or personal life, people tell him their stories about buying and selling on eBay. Not surprisingly, many tell him they are addicted to the thrill of their eBay discoveries.
"eBay is part of the Canadian social fabric now, part of popular culture. It's a community like no other," Mr. Banks says. "No matter where you look, eBay now touches people's lives."
A graduate of the University of Western Ontario and Osgoode Hall Law School, Mr. Banks practised corporate finance law at Goodman, Phillips & Vineberg before he was lured away to the NHLPA to head up its licensing and international business operations.
Mr. Banks is also an active member of community and charitable organizations. He is the founder and chairman of Sportsfest, a non-profit group that raises funds for Alzheimer's research and care, and a board member of the Baycrest Foundation. One of his proudest accomplishments at eBay is waiving the listing fees for charitable organizations to sell their items on-line.
"Success in business means working with talented people to reach challenging goals without ever compromising my integrity or commitment to my family or community," says the father of two young children.
Anthony Lacavera, 32
Chair and chief executive officer, Globalive Communications Corp., Toronto
BY SALEM ALATON
Slapping the puck between the skates of hulking defencemen proved excellent business training for Anthony Lacavera, whose enterprise thrives on scoring through strategic gaps that telecom giants can't close.
Junior B hockey landed Mr. Lacavera scholarships at U.S. colleges after he finished high school in Welland, Ont., but computer engineering at the University of Toronto won out. "I do not have any business training from a formal aspect," says Mr. Lacavera, whose firm was ranked the No. 1 fastest growing company in Canada by Profit magazine in 2004. "Everything I've learned has been on the fly."
There's been much flying since Mr. Lacavera co-founded the company in 1998 as a niche telecom service largely for small and medium businesses. Globalive's portfolio of conventional and VoIP services now includes a wholesale audio and Web conferencing provider (Assemble), voice and data services for the hospitality industry (Canopco), a public courtesy phone network (Freefone), a billing and collections service (InterClear) and the country's largest pay-phone service provider (Canada Payphone).
"I have the benefit of not being afraid to not hesitate," says Mr. Lacavera, whose revenue on the Globalive side alone grew to $60-million in 2005 from $35-million in 2003. Sixty per cent of that comes from U.S. clients, he says. "No matter how radical it is, I do it."
Buying pay phones in an era of mobile communications certainly seemed radical, if not foolhardy, to some. But Mr. Lacavera is quick to note he's not taking all the risks or generating all the ideas himself. Globalive's strategy has put other entrepreneurs in charge of new services. "I'm quite prepared to partner with an entrepreneur rather than have an employee who is entrepreneurial," says Mr. Lacavera, who has more than 80 employees. "If they could build that business alone, why would they want to work for me?"
Given the sinkhole the telecom sector descended into soon after Globalive's birth, it's good to have such choices.
"From 1999 to 2001, ten of our first twelve customers either went into receivership or liquidated into bankruptcy," recalls Mr. Lacavera. "There were days I woke up and said, 'this can't possibly get worse' -- and then it did."
But Globalive was built on the concentrated customer service its larger competitors couldn't provide, and clients have returned the favours. "We don't have the brand equity of a Telus or a Bell, [but]we have virtually no customer turnover at all and I'm very proud of that. There's really not a lot of loyalty in the Canadian telecom market."
Sean Murray, 37
President and chief executive officer, Advocate Printing and Publishing Co., Pictou, N.S. BY LISA STEPHENS
Sean Murray's philosophy is a straightforward one: the only thing standing between yourself and success is you.
To hear the CEO tell it, "nothing is impossible." Then he adds helpfully, "Some things are expensive and may take a lot of time, but there's nothing that can't be done."
Mr. Murray's attitude has been put to the test more than once since he graduated from university in 1990 to rejoin his family's printing and newspaper publishing business, which is based in the tiny Nova Scotia hamlet of Pictou (population 3,800).
The small, traditional enterprise was growing smaller. Mr. Murray dug in and transformed the company from a small regional publisher whose most noteworthy enterprise had been the weekly Pictou newspaper into Atlantic Canada's largest and most dynamic print communications company. He led Advocate to take a pioneering role in electronic data transfer, digital proofing and commercial printing on heat-set web. The company reached out to take advantage of distance-shrinking technologies while promoting its small town values and stability.
Disaster struck in 1996 when a fire swept through Advocate's newspaper offices, photo studio and warehouse. Undaunted, Mr. Murray published a paper the very next day and processed clients' film in the company parking lot.
The unanticipated showed its hand again in 2003 when Bruce Murray, Advocate's president and Mr. Murray's father, partner and mentor, died suddenly. "I had to become an instant expert in succession planning," he says. "I give talks about it now to groups."
While dealing with the grief, Mr. Murray had to act quickly to restore client and public confidence in the viability of Advocate.
"The rumours were saying we were bankrupt, for sale, falling apart," Mr. Murray says. The company was, in fact, debt-free and rock solid, but long-time clients were hesitant. "We had to advance what was to have been a 'reasonable' business expansion into a 'major' expansion," he says.
"My father had always been the public face of the company, the clients' man. I had to promote our entire management team."
Recognizing that a regional printing enterprise would not fare well in an increasingly commoditized marketplace, Mr. Murray focused his team on choosing clients who could benefit from Advocate's consultative approach.
A source of great personal satisfaction to Mr. Murray has been Advocate's ability to provide stable employment and opportunity for his hometown community. "The opportunity to 'give back' to the way you grew up is wonderful. It's unbelievable how it changes you and your local community" when you can play a role in its development, he says. "But," he adds, "there's always more to do."
Neil Hetherington, 32
Chief executive officer, Habitat for Humanity, Toronto
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
Her name is unknown to him, but her sense of pride left an indelible mark on Neil Hetherington. While working as a volunteer in Uganda for Habitat for Humanity in the summer of 1995, Mr. Hetherington attended a dedication service in which a house was formally handed over to a widow with four children.
"That was a pivotal moment in her life," Mr. Hetherington recalls. "Her family moved out of a mud hut into a simple, decent home, one they could afford to be proud of. It was a great feeling."
From then on, Mr. Hetherington acquired "habititus" -- something he has yet to shake off. A political science graduate from the University of Western Ontario who wielded a hammer doing summertime home renovations, Mr. Hetherington returned from his African stint and worked for four years as a project manager for Tridel Corp., a major condo builder. But he felt a need to return to the cause of building homes for low-income families, and he worked for the organization as a volunteer in Toronto.
In 2000, to his own surprise, he was offered the job of heading the chapter, which at the time was little-known and completed one home every two years. "That moment in Africa was phenomenal, and considering the need in this country for affordable housing, I wanted to be part of the movement that would change that."
At 26, and with no experience in running an organization, Mr. Hetherington embarked on a path that would change it dramatically. Today, with a staff of 29 people and an army of construction volunteers, it is building 50 homes a year.
"We are helping more families than ever, and engaging more volunteers. How cool is that?"
Mr. Hetherington credits Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat for Humanity in the United States, who coaxed him into raising the annual output. "He said, 'You should be doing 50.' From letters and personal calls, he really inspired me."
Finding volunteers is becoming less of a challenge, but Mr. Hetherington says it is still difficult to get land and lumber. Still, he manages to get parcels of land here and there, and companies willing to donate materials. "When you donate a door, you can see it. People want to see the tangible result of their donations. Habitat for Humanity is the best vehicle to do that."
With a target of 100 homes a year by 2010, he is looking more to corporations to supply volunteers. "We're saying, 'Why don't you get strategically philanthropic with Habitat for Humanity? You get to team-build, see the results and change the lives of families.' "
Steven J.M. Jones, 38
Head of bioinformatics and associate director, Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver
BY SALEM ALATON
Growing up on a sheep farm in Wales was a nascent education in biology for Steven J.M. Jones, although he scarcely realized it at the time.
"We were very interested in agriculture, selective breeding, how you could improve your blood lines," he recounts. "Of course, the process that underlies all that was completely invisible to me."
Indeed, much of what is now known of genetics was everywhere invisible and nameless then. Today, it is the emergent science of genomics, the study of DNA sequencing and gene behaviour, and bioinformatics, also known as computational biology, that is bringing a vast interior world into view, where medicine labours to learn about things that go wrong.
The endeavour is one at which Dr. Jones has already earned international prominence, serving as the key participant in a genetics investigation at Cambridge's Sanger Institute, which resulted in the computational derivation of the first-ever complete genomic sequence of a multi-cellular organism.
That was in the late 1990s, and among the attentive onlookers across the ocean was Canada's Dr. Michael Smith, co-founder of the Genome Sciences Centre.
"Dr. Smith wanted to set up a genomics centre in Vancouver which would focus the power of genomics on cancer itself," says Dr. Jones, who had previously taken a graduate degree at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. "It didn't take a huge amount of convincing."
While genomics and bioinformatics have created a surge of new science efforts globally, GSC offered Dr. Jones a context in which basic research and computational analysis on gene expression would be geared to medical applications.
"In cancer, there's a large number of changes that occur and accumulate over a number of years, and we don't really know that much about this yet," Dr. Jones says. "What makes your tumour different than someone else's? Does that allow us to infer a therapeutic approach that's going to be more effective? It all comes down to a movement toward a more personalized therapy, and clearly this is a very potent technology we have."
Dr. Jones pursues such questions with a staff of more than 180 at the centre, which is deemed "high throughput," meaning in part a lot of rapid sequencing via computational tools and algorithms.
And Dr. Jones always prefers to talk about what's next rather than what's been done: "We've only just scratched the surface on what genomics can do for all cancers and human diseases."
JosÃ©e Dykun, 37
Vice-president, human resources, Yellow Pages Group Co., Montreal
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
One of the toughest challenges JosÃ©e Dykun faced in a 17-year human resources career was in 2003 when she helped Yellow Pages Group Co. redefine its corporate culture and make it more performance-driven.
"We had to take this organization with almost 100 years of history and make it a best-in-class culture and very dynamic -- which was not the case before," says Ms. Dykun, who came to Yellow Pages Group (YPG) from Bell Mobility Inc., based in Mississauga, Ont., after a three-year stint as senior director of HR.
Canada's largest publisher of telephone directories, YPG was formerly known as Bell ActiMedia Inc., part of the Bell Canada family. It has been part of Yellow Pages Income Fund since the income trust went public in August, 2003.
In March of that year, Ms. Dykun stepped into her post and brought the company's 12-person executive team together to define the vision and values that would guide the organization. The team took into consideration earlier findings from employee focus groups. Out of that exercise emerged six key values: customer focus, compete to win, teamwork, passion, respect, and open and honest communications.
As well, Ms. Dykun helped to identify human resource programs that would raise the bar on talent.
"As we broke away from Bell, it created a great opportunity. We had to rebuild some corporate functions. But we wanted to make sure we had the best-of-the-best around the table," says Ms. Dykun, who grew up in Drummondville, Que., and later moved to Toronto where she graduated with a human resources management certificate from Seneca College.
YPG had 1,400 employees at the time of the strategic redesign. It was part of Ms. Dykun's role to communicate the company's vision, mission and values. "Those three key elements have to be lived on a daily basis throughout the organization. If all the employees are pulling in the same direction it will drive our success."
Three years later, Ms. Dykun is proud that the company has created a best-in-class culture. "But most important, we have a retention rate of 94 per cent of the management team that we recruited over the last few years."
Indeed, as testament to the transformation of the company -- which has grown to 2,700 employees -- it was honoured last year by Canadian Business magazine. "We were ranked seventh in the top ten most admired corporate cultures in Canada," she says.
A mother of two boys, she is also a hockey mom and team manager.
Jean-Francois Courville, 37
President and chief executive officer, State Street Canada, TorontoBY MICHAEL RYVAL
Jean-Francois Courville had the proverbial baptism by fire as a currency trader. Fresh out of McGill University, with a bachelor of commerce in 1991, he joined National Bank in Montreal and traded products such as currency forwards and options. Among other crises he had deal with was the European exchange rate mechanism debacle that caused global currencies to gyrate and the gradual decline of the Canadian dollar.
"It was an interesting time with a lot of tensions in the market," says Mr. Courville, who hadn't considered a career in financial markets until a personal invitation allowed him to see a trader in action.
"Back then, everybody was screaming and shouting. It was messy and noisy -- but a great adrenalin rush."
It's been all that and more over the past decade and a half. Mr. Courville has worked his way up through a succession of industry postings to the point where he is chief executive officer of State Street Canada, a branch of Boston-based State Street Corp., the world's leading provider of financial services to institutional investors.
While the parent company may be unknown to the average Canadian, it is one of the largest custodial firms and boasts $10-trillion (U.S.), or about 15 per cent of the world's investable assets. It is also the world's largest institutional money manager and oversees $1.6-trillion in assets.
Mr. Courville joined the organization in 1996 after a four-and-a-half-year spell at National Bank. At State Street, he began as an executive in Montreal responsible for building its foreign exchange trading and management capability. He met Stanley Shelton, executive vice-president at State Street Global Markets (SSGM), who persuaded Mr. Courville that participating in State Street's growth in Canada was an obvious choice.
"The mission was to radically improve investor access to financial markets and provide better tools to manage portfolios," he says. "It was all about sharing intelligence more openly. In ten minutes, I was convinced this was it for me."
In 2000, Mr. Courville moved to Toronto, where he became managing director responsible for the Canadian unit of State Street's Global Markets division. He was particularly successful in positioning the firm as a major currency trader. "That was our biggest milestone: establishing ourselves as a 'go-to' services provider for Canadian institutions."
After a five month stay in Boston as a senior vice-president and global head of client development for SSGM, he was promoted to head of the Canadian operations in January, 2005.
Overseeing 1,100 employees in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, Mr. Courville is responsible for managing the integration of all the company's activities under one co-ordinated strategy. A father of two and an avid cyclist and skier, Mr. Courville spends his off-hours with his family or volunteering for organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and Homes First. "Toronto has a real homeless and affordable housing issue," he says. "These organizations are key to providing real solutions."

Vice-president of operations, Acadia University, Wolfville, N.S.
BY KATHY ENGLISH
Dov Bercovici has often been described as "the quintessential people person," a leadership quality he puts to good use in striving to bring a spirit of entrepreneurship to academia.
Mr. Bercovici is in charge of leveraging Acadia University's assets to generate revenue. That can mean anything from selling conference planners on the school's location in the beautiful Annapolis Valley to persuading faculty to sell their ideas.
With so many diverse stakeholders within the academy, Mr. Bercovici relies heavily on his people skills to bring together resources and opportunities.
"I can get along with almost anyone," he says.
"I try to find common ground with every person I meet and I truly believe you are selling people, not projects.
"Interpersonal acumen has helped me sell ideas, products and services very effectively."
Indeed, Mr. Bercovici has sold some faculty members on the concept of marketing their mastery.
He is now also the president of MusicPath Inc., a faculty-owned software company that enables interactive on-line master music class instruction. The MusicPath software was developed by Acadia faculty members Christoph Both and Jim Diamond, who turned to Mr. Bercovici to market their innovation to schools and conservatories across Canada.
"Innovation is the successful implementation of an idea -- it's not just the idea," Mr. Bercovici says.
Previous to joining Acadia in 2001, Mr. Bercovici was general manager of the World Trade Centre in Halifax. He holds a BA in economics from McGill University and an MBA in international marketing from Dalhousie University and is also one of the first of 40 individuals in Canada to receive the Certified International Trade Professionals designation.
Married with two children, Mr. Bercovici has long given back to his community through charitable endeavours.
As a result of finding cost savings for the university in energy conservation, he has grown increasingly interested in the challenge of sustainable development and the environment.

Brian Scudamore, 36
Founder and CEO, 1-800-Got Junk?, Vancouver
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Okay, let's get the first question out of the way. What was it like appearing on Oprah?
"Pretty cool," Brian Scudamore says. "And I'm someone who, when I give a speech or do an interview, there's a little bit of nervousness, and, you know, with Oprah, I thought I was going to be crazy nervous. But I was just going, wow, is this unreal."
In fact, it had always been one of Mr. Scudamore's goals to give Ms. Winfrey, someone he's long admired, a hug. It was up there on the head office's "Can You Imagine?" wall, along with "Can you imagine us hitting a billion in sales?"
Mr. Scudamore founded his company at age 18, hoping to earn some cash to pay for university. But he soon realized he was learning more about business with his junk-hauling service than he was in the University of British Columbia's commerce course -- and having more fun to boot.
Today, 1-800-Got-Junk?'s growth -- from $1-million in revenue in 1999 to $66-million last year -- is almost as mind-boggling as some of the items the company has been hired to cart away: prosthetic legs, a defused Second World War bomb, 18,000 cans of expired sardines and an entire McDonald's McHappy Land play set.
What's more, only about 40 per cent of that goes to landfill; the rest is recycled and donated to charities.
"I'll sit back and look at the growth for about two seconds, then go, okay, so how do we get it bigger?" he says.
"For me, business is a game, and is all about growth."
With 246 franchises and a current earnings trend of $119-million, Mr. Scudamore's ambition is to build what he calls "the Fed-Ex of junk removal. Clean, shiny trucks, friendly, uniformed drivers, and service upfront."
Among the many highlights of Mr. Scudamore's life has been the Birthing of Giants course he took at Boston's prestigious MIT. With a 10-per-cent acceptance rate and entrepreneurs the average age of 35 doing a minimum $3-million a year in sales, "it was the best course I've ever taken," he says, "almost like a university for all these ADHD, high-growth, don't-follow-the-rules, don't-pay-attention-type students. We came together and the bond was unbelievable, the networking and learning among ourselves even better."
The kind of boss who eschews a private office to hijack vacant desks around what employees call the Junktion, close rapport with his staff is a high priority.
"I feel I'm doing a good job if I can help everyone in this company grow to the point where one day we're looked at not for what we built, but how we built it," Mr. Scudamore says.
His goals include transforming 1-800-Got-Junk? into a globally admired brand, and, of course, hitting that billion a year in sales, something he's targeted for 2012.

Craig Kielburger, 23
Chair and founder, Free the Children, Toronto
BY SALEM ALATON
Some people thought he'd surely peaked at age 13.
By then, Craig Kielburger of Thornhill, Ont., was one of the most famous children in the world, profiled internationally in the press and on such major TV journals as .
He'd met with Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien and Mother Teresa and addressed a gathering of U.S. congressional leaders.
It all sprang from reading a newspaper article about a Pakistani boy of 12 -- Mr. Kielburger's age at the time -- who spoke out about his forced-labour plight and was murdered in retaliation. Mr. Kielburger gathered some classmates to form Free the Children to protest such atrocities and became an overnight media sensation when he staged a press conference during a seven-week tour of Southeast Asia (with an adult chaperone) to demand that the Prime Minister increase Canada's attention to human rights.
Staffed largely by youth and as much as 70 per cent funded by donations from schoolchildren, Free the Children has to date built some 420 schools in the developing world, provided $9-million (U.S.) in medical supplies and been nominated three times since 2002 for the Nobel Peace Prize.
The phenomenon, in a word, continues today through a professional development agency that has helped create programs for such heavy hitters as Oprah Winfrey's charity.
"I think my parents were teachers both inside and outside the classroom," says Mr. Kielburger, just back from a month-long tour of some of the 40-plus countries where Free the Children has been active. "We'd walk by a homeless person and my mom would actually stop and talk to him or her, ask their name. My mom was nurturing the idea that that's a person. When you look into their eyes and know their name, you have to acknowledge them."
Mr. Kielburger also has an influential sibling. Older brother Marc, chief executive director of the charity and a past Top 40 Under 40 honouree, is a lawyer and Rhodes Scholar who eschewed lucrative private-sector offers to be Mr. Kielburger's co-pilot.
"Every CEO wishes she or he could clone themselves, and we have done that," says Mr. Kielburger, who co-wrote the bestselling paean to volunteerism with his brother. In 1999, the pair formed Leaders Today, a youth leadership training organization that now claims to reach 350,000 youth annually.
Mr. Kielburger was last month awarded the 2006 World Children's Prize for the Rights of the Child, also known as the Children's Nobel Prize.
Previous winners include former South African president Nelson Mandela and Iqbal Masih, the child slave whose death sparked Mr. Kielburger's campaign.
Not everyone was enamoured of Mr. Kielburger when he was a kid making headlines, and some may still criticize Free the Children for always claiming to have the answers to the world's most difficult problems.
Yet when he speaks of illiterate parents who witlessly sell their children into bondage, Mr. Kielburger is a hard man to deny.
Free the Children builds and supports all those schools, after all, "because when you're talking about child poverty, every issue fundamentally comes back to education."
Stephen Segal, 36
Vice-president of marketing and sales, Loewen, Steinbach, Man.
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Stephen Segal admits he's hard to pin down.
"People ask me, 'What are you? Are you an architect? A computer guy? An IT guy? Are you a marketer, a salesperson?'
"And I guess," he pauses, "I'm all of that."
A Winnipegger by birth and inclination, Mr. Segal studied to be an architect, which "provides good didactic, problem-solving methodology I can apply to business and personal life."
But he went on to take positions that veered from the course, quite consciously, he admits -- and one of the reasons behind his success.
"I didn't at 18 or 19 say, 'At 40, this is what I want to be.' I sort of looked, kept my mind open at every stage of the process to new opportunities, to not be afraid to challenge and think outside of the areas I've been trained in."
Since graduating he has taught computer graphics and animation, started his own company, sold it and worked for the financial services software company that bought it.
He has also done marketing and sales, and he designed and built a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing plant for EH Price Ltd.
From there, he went to Loewen, a company with interesting roots of its own.
Originally begun by a Mennonite family that made church pews and bee boxes, Loewen now designs gorgeous, luxury-end wooden doors and windows for an increasingly discerning international market yet maintains its commitment to ethical business practice.
"That definitely attracted me," Mr. Segal says. "I was very excited about the way the Loewen family and everyone who works here treats our business -- its very high degree of ethics, the importance of culture and customer service, and hard work."
Obviously the design element of the business also attracts. Mr. Segal reads architectural periodicals and attends design shows in his spare time; he also designed the home he shares with his wife and two children.
Remaining spare time goes to charity work, such as the Manitoba Theatre Centre and a group of entrepreneurs younger than 40 called the Young Associates.
As for his goals, Mr. Segal says, "We obviously want to continue to grow and to dominate the luxury segment; we see lots of opportunity to continue to broaden our service and product offering, to attract new dealers and gain more market share in North America and abroad."
Personally, he wants to continue learning and sharpening his many skills.
"I always want to continue to add value to the organizations I am within, and to do so in new ways that are a benefit both to the organization and to myself personally," he says.
"I think that my history is evidence of my ability to get very quickly up to speed in new areas."
What's more, he adds, "I love the variation. Variation drives the mind."
Patrick P.W. Luke, 36
Associate professor of surgery, University of Western Ontario; surgical director of renal/pancreas transplantation, attending surgeon, London Health Sciences Centre, London
BY SALEM ALATON
If you wouldn't want to be the first patient to try a new medical procedure, you probably don't need it badly enough.
Many of Dr. Patrick P.W. Luke's patients -- who suffer advanced kidney or pancreatic failure, and sometimes both -- do. Also inspiring confidence is the long list of scientific awards, prizes and scholarships that is attached to him, not only since emerging in 1993 from the University of Toronto Medical School but from being an adolescent science star at Upper Canada College.
The upshot has been the opportunity in 2003 to conduct Canada's first robotic surgery in urology, followed the next year by the first combined kidney-pancreas transplant to be performed at London Health Sciences Centre, a site of the Canadian Surgical Technologies & Advanced Robotics research program.
Dr. Luke also scored a North American first in 2004 when he removed a renal aneurysm aided by a surgical robot.
And a medical conference featured him conducting from the convention floor in Toronto a robotic surgery 200 kilometres away on a training model on the operating table at LHSC.
"I've been very fortunate," says Dr. Luke, who also does basic research on the antibodies involved in transplants. "It's amazing to be able to walk into work one day and know we're doing organ transplantation, [and]the next day, robotic surgery."
The good fortune cuts both ways; having done clinical and research fellowships at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Toronto native Dr. Luke had more than enough woo pitched his way to keep him from setting foot in Ontario again.
"U.S. transplant physicians and surgeons travel from one institution to the next as they build their careers. I can't imagine moving my family four or five times," says Dr. Luke, who has three children younger than age 10. "My family and I have decided to stay in Canada."
Dr. Luke's hunger to see advances in his field -- where there is an increasing effort to enlist living donors while even available organs from cadavers are agonizingly few -- means taking no premature bows.
"These are just second- or third-generation robots that we're using," he says. "We're going to see whole new lines to come."
Robotics is still challenging for many surgeons, disrupting the usual continuum of hand-eye co-ordination, and it hasn't won everyone over. Dr. Luke believes robotics improves precision and dexterity, along with greatly reducing the invasiveness of surgery.
"Even some of our mentors and senior surgeons are among our strongest proponents," he notes.
Philip Smith, 39
Managing director and head of investment banking, Scotia Capital Inc., Toronto
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Heading a department that does hundreds of transactions underwriting billions of dollars for companies throughout North America every year, Philip Smith seems comfortable with big challenges.
The business of investment banking, he says, "is very, very competitive, highly so, and if you're a competitive person and you thrive off that, it's very enjoyable."
With a degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University and an MBA in analytical finance from the University of Chicago, his work isn't the only place where he likes to meet a challenge.
A fan of road biking, Mr. Smith rode with seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong two years ago on a mounting, 4,000-foot gradient from Longview, Alta., over the Highland Pass to Kananaskis to raise money for cancer research.
"It was pretty tough," he says. "But if you're a cyclist, it's kind of like the ultimate."
Mr. Smith considers himself fortunate to have built a solid 12-year career at Scotia Capital, the investment arm of Canada's fourth largest bank.
A key to his success, he believes, is an ability to identify the company's competitive advantages and weaknesses "and to focus on building the former and addressing the latter. And out of that," he says, "to focus on the business we should be doing, based on our abilities.
The danger in this business, which is very broad, is "to spread out and pretend to be something you're not. And in all the roles I've had, it's been to clarify what the mandate is and to focus on that. That's allowed us to be pretty successful."
With two young children and a third on the way, Mr. Smith devotes spare time to the board of the Investment Dealers Association as well as the board of the Toronto Zoo Foundation.
His involvement with the zoo stems from a strong sense of place -- "I could have worked in New York, but didn't really want to," he says -- and real affection for the city where he grew up. "I'm very passionate about Toronto and its neighbourhoods and things that make Toronto different and interesting, like the zoo, which is a world class organization."
To that end, he takes on more than many Torontonians do and certainly more than many bankers, organizing his neighbours to clean up litter and paint over graffiti.
"Nothing drives me crazier than garbage and graffiti. I just put up placards and did a mail drop and got people of like mind to come out and clean up the ravines and encourage a stewardship program," he says. "That's your park, that's your alley, that's your ravine. If you see something, pick it up. Don't just assume someone else will do it."
C.J. Lovett Lewis, 38
President, Cansel Survey Equipment Ltd.
Burnaby, B.C.
BY SALEM ALATON
Sales through the Internet? Not really. Out to conquer the U.S. market? No need. Snazzy personal transportation? Prefers tramping in the bush.
C.J. Lovett Lewis never did set out to be an executive entrepreneur, and he's still not much like most others of that breed. Nonetheless, sales more than tripled to more than $50-million at Cansel Survey Equipment within three years of Mr. Lewis buying in 2002 the firm he had joined as a sales rep a decade earlier.
"I started in sales with what I'd say is a typical engineer's output," says Mr. Lewis, who holds a graduate degree in geodesy and global positioning systems from the University of New Brunswick in his boyhood province. "People bought products when they needed products. I wasn't sure how I was going to influence that."
He found out, increasing Cansel's sales of emergent GPS technology tenfold in his first year, employing both his passion for surveying -- sparked at age 15 when his parents had a property survey done and Mr. Lewis was riveted by the process -- and a customer-centred approach low on the usual hustle.
"At the end of the day, if it's not to be, let's not waste each other's time," he says of his sales philosophy.
Simple enough, and it seems to work.
"Our expectations for the next three years is continuous growth at 25 to 30 per cent, kind of like what we've been experiencing the last four years or so."
It hasn't hurt that such traditional client sectors for surveying services as construction, forestry, mining and municipal-infrastructure development have been robust. The technology boom in GPS has also kept the flow of innovations high. In addition to selling the equipment, Cansel services and repairs it and offers professional data packages for surveying firms.
The technology may be cutting edge, but the sales -- half of them to companies with five employees or fewer -- are old school.
"A lot of the customers who buy our products are changing their business," Mr. Lewis says. "They want to see it, touch it, feel it out. The level of acceptance has been much lower than we would have expected for using the Internet to purchase our products."
Moreover, the surveying business is too different in the U.S. to bother with for now, says Mr. Lewis, who sees more potential in Canada than the sector can handle. Keith Mullet, 35

The guy who keeps the world's largest helicopter fleet flying throughout Europe concedes he doesn't have a pilot's license. Keith Mullet says he's never actually had the time -- he's been too busy building one of Canada's great international success stories on the ground.
CHC Helicopter provides airlift services for the global offshore oil-and-gas industry.
It is also pioneering the private contracting of search and rescue services for European civil governments.
Mr. Mullet, a chartered accountant by training, has a very simple explanation for his success: "I'm surrounded by people who know more than I do. They're very highly skilled at what they do."
"You are always learning here," he adds. "We're not just selling widgets. What we do is very technical and constantly changing. Our oil and gas clients have very fast-paced needs that change from day to day."
The St. John's native, now based in Aberdeen, Scotland, has moved quickly since arriving in Europe. Mr. Mullet consolidated CHC's European business units into a single integrated operation that created the first cross-national structure of its kind in the industry, resulting in more than $20-million in savings. A radical restructuring of the company's U.K. pension plan led to the longest term union agreements ever achieved in that jurisdiction, creating improved employee satisfaction and attracting scarce skilled labour to the operation.
Mr. Mullet's current challenge is one of implementing a major change in the technology of his helicopter fleet. CHC is transforming its aircraft from the state-of-the art of the present day into the helicopter fleet of the future, bringing new types of aircraft on-line.
"These are helicopters no one has ever seen before," Mr. Mullet says. "The last time this was done was 20 years ago."
Another major initiative has been Mr. Mullet's spearheading of CHC's move into privately contracted search and rescue services for European governments.
Until recently, most air rescue was provided by military services, but European governments are looking to the private sector for cost effectiveness and more consistent staff support.
At the moment, though, Mr. Mullet is expecting another imminent airlift: from the stork. His third child is due any day, so he's sticking close to home base in Scotland.
Antoine Nohra, 36
Chairman,
Credico Marketing Inc., Montreal
BY LISA STEPHENS
To discern the secret of Antoine Nohra's success, you need only ask the personable chairman of Credico Marketing to talk about himself.
The interviewer will discover that somehow the tables have been turned, and the subject of the conversation has unaccountably become the interviewer's interests, not Mr. Nohra's.
That he naturally shifts his focus onto his guest is evidence of the strong relationship-building skills that have propelled Mr. Nohra's companies, Credico Marketing and Cardex, into the top rank of international face-to-face credit card acquisition companies.
They dominate 70 per cent of the market in Canada alone and deliver the privately held venture more than $80-million in revenue annually. Clients include major banks and retailers worldwide.
"I do love people," he says. "It can be anyone; I always establish a relationship with everyone in the room. I have no problem going through the receptionist, the assistants, the advisers before I meet the person I want to see.
"I like to bring out the best in others: that's my real pleasure in life," he adds.
Complimented about his award, he quickly demurs.
"You know, I should cut this Top 40 [award]into pieces and give it to so many people in my company."
His proudest boast?
"I like to think that I offer every new employee a chance to succeed equal to the one I had when I began."
Mr. Nohra's first opportunity in Canada wasn't obviously fraught with promise. Arriving from Beirut with a degree in business administration, he chose Montreal because he could speak only French. But he quickly discovered that without "Canadian experience" his employment opportunities were fairly limited.
Mr. Nohra finally applied to a credit card marketing organization and said he'd be willing to work "out of town" instead of the Montreal territory that everyone else coveted.
"They said, 'Okay, you've got Corner Brook,' " on the west coast of Newfoundland.
"I didn't even know where it was. I thought it was a suburb," he says, laughing.
Nevertheless, he quickly became the company's top salesman. "It was like a dream to get promoted to Halifax."
Beginning at home 14 years ago with a $5,000 loan and a commitment to grow beyond the mom-and-pop model that was the norm among credit card recruitment companies at the time, Mr. Nohra now employs more than 1,400 people worldwide.
Rudyard Griffiths, 35
Executive director, Dominion Institute, Toronto
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
When Canada went to the brink in the Quebec referendum in 1995, Rudyard Griffiths resolved to bridge a widening gap in the country's sense of identity. On Canada Day, 1997, he and two friends, Eric Penz and Michael Chong, launched the Dominion Institute, a non-government organization dedicated to making Canadians, young and old, care about their own country.
"The near-separation of Quebec wasn't driven by economic reasons or geopolitical issues. It was driven by a loss of shared memory on the part of English and French Canada in terms of what they had accomplished together since the country's founding," recalls Mr. Griffiths, a former policy analyst at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, who has a masters degree in Philosophy from Cambridge University. "The institute was created with the idea that a strong sense of identity had to be based on an equally strong sense of memory. And commitment to the ideals of responsible citizenship, such as voter participation."
Mr. Griffiths and his colleagues caused a stir when they published a survey of Canadians' knowledge of their own history. Only one-third of 18- to 24-year-olds, for instance, knew that Confederation occurred in 1867. "We got a lot of attention and brought to light the erosion of common memory and the collective amnesia on the part of many people when it comes to an awareness of their history," he says.
Launched with a $150,000 start-up grant from the Donner Canadian Foundation, the institute hasn't looked back since. With a staff of 14 and a budget of $2-million, the institute boasts a rich collection of programs that have touched hundreds of thousands of Canadians. To date, the organization has raised $11-million.
Among its initiatives is Youth Vote, which has sought to engage disaffected young voters.
The institute boasts a speakers' bureau of about 1,500 veterans who share their stories with students.
"We are also proud of our ability to draw together people from different parts of the political spectrum and bring them together around the common cause of promoting Canadian history and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship," he says.
Mr. Griffiths is also an adviser to the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington, D.C. Recently, he helped the organization launch a new institute for Canada-U.S. relations.
Mr. Griffiths would like other young people to follow his example. "We've created a different model for an NGO," he says. "One which is run more like a production company than a traditional charity." Jason Clemens, 35
Director of fiscal studies, the Fraser Institute, Vancouver
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
Being open to workplace opportunities is a virtue, as Jason Clemens learned early on.
In 1996, Mr. Clemens had an opportunity to work as a summer intern at the Fraser Institute, a leading public-policy think tank.
"I was on a path to corporate and commercial banking; that's where my schooling was aimed," recalls Mr. Clemens, who was then completing an MBA at the University of Windsor. "But, unlike a lot of other internship programs, this one was actually about research and you were able to work closely with senior staff."
That four-month experience, combined with research that he did for Betty Jane Punnett, a business professor at the university, opened doors that he had not considered. "There was a fork in the road and I took a path I hadn't expected to take. I really enjoyed research."
A full-time member of the institute since September, 1997, a father of two and a competitive soccer player, Mr. Clemens has written or co-written 27 major studies and more than 160 articles for Fraser Forum, the institute's monthly magazine. He has also appeared as an expert witness before the Senate and House of Commons on issues ranging from government budgets to small business finance, not to mention published articles in the Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail and other newspapers.
As director of fiscal studies, Mr. Clemens oversees four research departments with a total budget of more than $800,000 and three full-time and one part-time staff members. His department uses a team approach, Mr. Clemens says. One person is a project leader who is supported by other team members. In some cases, he assigns a team leader and does not get involved in a project until the end when he reviews it and gets feedback. In other cases, he acts as the team leader and is involved from start to finish.
The institute, which is non-partisan, regularly criticizes governments of all stripes on issues such as high taxes. As a result, it's been the butt of many a barb. For instance, former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Clyde Wells called the institute "the intellectual wing of the KKK."
Nevertheless, Mr. Clemens shrugs off jibes and says that many of the institute's proposals have been implemented over the years.
"We're seeing improvements in almost all of the areas we actively engage: taxes, the size of government, entrepreneurship, health care, and education," Mr. Clemens says. "That's not to say we don't need more improvement. But we are moving in the right direction."
Steven Douglas, 38
Executive vice-president and CFO, Falconbridge Ltd., Toronto
BY LISA STEPHENS
As the financial point man who co-ordinated the recent massive Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Corp. merger, creating the largest base metals mining company in North America and the fifth largest in the world, Steven Douglas doesn't look like the sort who'd need much mentoring from minds better than his.
But he'd be the first to disagree.
"You can never stop self-assessing your work," he says. "You've got to be continually getting feedback from your colleagues and being brutally honest with yourself about what you need to improve."
Even the most prime athlete is never without a good coach, and Mr. Douglas relies on his teammates to keep him on track. "You can't lose yourself or hide behind titles and responsibilities," he says. "You have to have the ability to open your ears and listen."
As CFO of Brookfield Properties Corp. of Toronto, Canada's largest publicly traded real estate company, from 1996 to 2003, he saw the company's asset base grow from $4-billion to more than $12-billion. He steered the company onto the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and saw total shareholder returns increase 30 per cent compounded annually during his tenure.
He joined Noranda Inc. in time to lead a team initiative to refinance bank credit agreements following the merger of Noranda and Falconbridge, acquiring $780-million (U.S.) in bank credit facilities to fund future growth and placing the restructured mining organization in a position to be acquired by Inco.
The key to his industry is riding out economic cycles, Mr. Douglas says. "It's vital that we not forget [economic]history in what we do. Anybody who thinks they can wave a magic wand and make business cycles disappear" probably won't be around for the next one.
What does he find most rewarding about his career?
"As corny as it sounds, it's really more fulfilling to see people around you succeed with you," he says. "Nothing you can really achieve is without support from others."
Isabelle Hudon, 39
President and CEO, Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal
BY SALEM ALATON
The largest chamber of commerce in the country hardly knew what hit it when Isabelle Hudon blew in as communications director in January, 2002, hardly three years before being handed the entire shop.
Hopscotching from communication roles in the Mulroney government to a fast series of private-sector posts, the telegenic tempest brought a new unorthodoxy to the 180-year-old Montreal Board of Trade: Montreal was as important to business as business was to Montreal.
"There is no good economic development without a good social climate," says Ms. Hudon, who reached out to academe and the arts while creating a fast makeover in the board's image, not least by lending it her image.
Separate English and French boards of trade had finally merged in Montreal in 1993, and even allophones were appearing among the roughly 7,000 members. But the contemporary-minded Ms. Hudon was far from sure the Board looked like home when it first called.
"Nothing sounded like me," she declares. "I had an image of not a very jazzy place."
Still, having snagged PR management roles at Bell Global Solutions, the Canadian Space Agency, Bombardier Aerospace and BCE Media in a period of less than three years after a brief executive assistant stint with Mila Mulroney, Ms. Hudon didn't sweat the move.
"In all the jobs I had, I reacted very quickly, love the job or not love the job. I did not ask too many questions."
Even Ms. Hudon's education trajectory had been a restless one, bouncing from University of Montreal to University of Ottawa to complete a degree in business administration: "I was not a good student at the university level. It was too slow for me and I got bored very easily."
The real education began right after school with Ms. Hudon following her political instincts -- centre-right with a nod to social protections, she says -- into the Quebec wing of the Progressive Conservative Party as a regional organizer for fundraising and membership. That led to a press secretary spot with Minister for External Relations Monique Landry.
"Politics is a great place to learn if you know how to deal with power and not be overwhelmed with power," Ms. Hudon says.
No chance. When it was her turn to wield power at the Board of Trade, Ms. Hudon simply invoked to herself all the advice she had given the politicos as their media manager: "I now have to act the way I trained them to act."
Paul Clark, 39
Senior vice-president of small business banking and merchant services, TD Canada Trust, Toronto
BY KATHY ENGLISH
Paul Clark began working as a part-time bank teller when he was 17 and still in high school.
"My mother was a banker so I grew up in a family that talked about banking at the dinner table," Mr. Clark said. "Banking was always a natural interest for me."
Mr. Clark was recently named senior vice-president of small business banking and merchant services for TD Canada Trust, where he has worked since 1989 in a number of positions across Canada.
"I thought that banking was a part-time job, but it turned into a career," said Mr. Clark, who also worked part-time for the bank while studying for his BA at the University of Western Ontario. "Building a successful career doesn't have a specific start date. It begins the first time you start a part-time job or volunteer for an organization. I really do believe that whatever you do, at whatever stage of your career, it's important to commit yourself fully and really learn."
As head of small business banking, responsible for building the "strategy, structure and products" to serve TD's clients, Mr. Clark now has ample opportunity to learn about the many small businesses that drive Canada's economy.
"Each individual business has its own needs, and I love learning about how they operate and their passion for what they do," he says.
A father of two, he strives for some semblance of balance between work and family life, carving out time to coach his son's soccer team and being available for family dinners and his children's bedtime.
Mr. Clark, who took on board responsibilities with Halifax's United Way and a local food bank in his previous posting in the Maritimes, is looking for ways to serve now that he's based in Toronto.
Dennis Kavelman, 35
Chief financial officer, Research in Motion Ltd., Waterloo, Ont.
BY SALEM ALATON
If it weren't for a patent-holding company called NTP Inc., Dennis Kavelman may have been compelled to keep going through life without anything going wrong.
A Waterloo hometown boy, he excelled in business administration studies at Wilfred Laurier University; took chartered accounting and won a gold medal as the nation's top performer in the Uniform Final Examination; and had hardly gotten his feet wet in the working world in 1995 when old friend Jim Balsillie, co-chief executive officer of high-tech startup Research in Motion, invited him to join the team.
The company then had about two dozen employees and a co-founder named Mike Lazaridis, the brainy tech side of the operation: "Jim and I would raise money and Mike would go out and spend it," Mr. Kavelman recounts.
One fine day after years of hard work, Mike completed a nifty little mobile e-mail device and "we knew we had invented something very special with BlackBerry."
How special?
"Right now, we've been just getting to five million users," says Mr. Kavelman, whose company has some 2,000 employees and had sales in the last quarter of 2005 of $560.1-million (U.S.). "That's about double where we were last year, which is about double where we were the year before. There literally isn't a place you can go now where you can't get service."
Lurking in the weeds, however, was NTP, claiming patent precedence on BlackBerry technology, hampering RIM in the courts and creating uncertainty among customers. This past March, RIM paid $612.5-million to make the dispute go away.
"You learn a real lesson that the world's not always about right and wrong," Mr. Kavelman says. "There are so many good things happening in our company. I think people have put it in the rear-view mirror."
Having presided over such milestones as the company's $100-million (CDN) IPO and its listing on the NASDAQ and TSE, Mr. Kavelman figures to continue ensuring those good things occur.
Gold medal or not, however, did all this really come from excellence in . . . accounting?
"Everybody thinks it's about memorizing accounting rules and all this very bland stuff," he responds. "But once you get to that UFE, it's very much more like problem solving and case analysis, which Laurier was very strong at."
Robert Palter, 36
Principal,
McKinsey and Co., Toronto
BY LISA STEPHENS
Robert Palter's roster of accomplishments almost invariably begins with the word "helped." As principal and co-leader of corporate finance, private equity and institutional investment practices for McKinsey and Co. in Toronto, Mr. Palter finds his greatest personal rewards in working with a team.
And he's certainly played a key role in an exceptional number of complex private-equity placements in amounts up to $2-billion in industries ranging from oil and chemicals to media, retailing and food processing. He has also developed new strategies for leading U.S. and Canadian buyout funds, hedge funds and pension plans. His most satisfying accomplishment has been building from scratch McKinsey's private equity practice in Canada. Six years ago, he notes, McKinsey Canada had almost no presence in that market. Mr. Palter sold his colleagues on the concept, put together a team and grew the business into a major portion of McKinsey's practice and a dominant player in the market.
Along the way, Mr. Palter saw a need in Toronto for a Jewish Chamber of Commerce for young entrepreneurs, and in 2003 he became a founding member of a group that now has 500 members.
When his infant son was born profoundly deaf, Mr. Palter began consulting with experts at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. With them and his family onside, he approved the difficult decision to do experimental bilateral cochlear implants in both of his son's ears.
In the year since the procedure was completed, giving his son normal-range hearing, the operation has become a new standard for medical treatment. "It's amazing how far the technology for this has advanced in just a year," he says.
Mr. Palter now sits on the board of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, based in Washington, D.C. Last year, he also created a private endowment fund for cochlear implant research at the Hospital for Sick Children.
Alain Raquepas, 39
Vice-president of finance and CFO,
CAE Inc., Montreal
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Equipped with a commerce degree from HEC and a law degree from the University of Montreal, Alain Raquepas didn't hesitate when a job came along at CAE for a tax manager specializing in research and development filings.
"I was really very, very thrilled," he recalls. "I knew they were doing a lot of R&D and there was a lot of potential, a Canadian company doing business around the world."
That was 13 years ago. Today he manages a multinational team of professionals, with 100 finance and IT people reporting to him in Montreal and an additional 200 people from 17 nations on five different continents.
"It requires a lot of co-ordination," he admits, "making sure that everyone is building in the same direction."
Ninety per cent of the $1-billion in annual revenue at CAE, which employs 4,800 worldwide, is based on exports. Founded just after World War II as Canadian Aviation Electronics Ltd., the company is the world's top supplier of civil aviation simulation devices. It also participates substantially in the global military defence industry and the training of commercial pilots. For Mr. Raquepas, that means his "routine is never routine. You always have to reinvent yourself and motivate the team to continue to deliver value to our shareholders," he says.
"It's a bit strange, because I thought when I started my career that I'd earn my stripes with my education," he says, "with what I knew, starting with tax and moving to structured finance. For sure these helped me to deliver on many mandates, but right now it's more my management skills that make a difference."
Yet the job, like the industry itself, is not without its challenges, from the downturn in aerospace after the terrorist attacks of September 11 to the rising Canadian dollar and its corresponding productivity issues.
"Now that it's relatively stable and we're getting past the restructuring period, the challenge in front of us is to refocus on growth and leverage these technologies we have," Mr. Raquepas says. "I'm really excited about that."
Mr. Raquepas grew up on Montreal's South Shore and still lives there today with his wife, Marie-Claude, and two children. In his spare time, he likes to ski and chill out in his Eastern Townships country house. He does enough foreign travelling, he says, for the job.
Ian Wilson, 36
President, Wilson Fuel Co., Halifax
BY AUGUSTA DWYER
Mr. Wilson grew up in the city that his family company helped rebuild after the Halifax Explosion of 1914. Back then, the Wilsons were in the construction business; before that, they were merchant traders based in Colchester County in the early 1800s.
Today, along with affiliated businesses in heating-appliance manufacturing and the distribution of heating and refrigeration equipment, Wilson Fuel is Atlantic Canada's largest independent marketer of petroleum products, and the eighth generation is in charge.
The firm has also been rated for the second year in a row as one of Canada's 50 best-managed companies, which, Mr. Wilson says, is a "reflection of the performance of the company as a whole, as a result of the collective effort of everyone working at the business."
It wasn't a sure thing he'd take over, says Mr. Wilson, who studied sciences at Queens University. He earned a masters in environmental technology at the University of London's Imperial College in England.
But with his father's sudden death in 1999, Mr. Wilson took the helm as president of Wilson Fuel after seven years in sales and management of the automotive petroleum side of the business, along with environmental management.
Working for a cleaner environment is one of his extra-curricular activities; he's on the board of Clean Nova Scotia, which educates the public about green issues.
When asked about his goals, Mr. Wilson laughs and recounts how he tells people that some day he'd like to be president of a larger, more successful organization. "And they say, 'Oh, well, what organization?' And I say, 'This one,' " he jokes. In a more serious tone, he adds, "I'd like to concentrate on making this a better place to work, and a better company, more productive, more profitable and more successful."
Away from the office, he spends time sailing and skiing with his wife and their two children.

Souray back in familiar surroundings

Full text: ? The dressing-room foyer in the Lofbergs Lila Arena is different in one important way. Steps away from where Sheldon Souray is holding court, there is a panel of windows, stretching from one end of the building to the other. On a Sunday afternoon in the middle of Swedish spring, there is sunshine streaming in and the sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu is palpable.
Almost a year ago, Souray was in a similar surrounding. His Montreal Canadiens were playing the Lightning in the second game of the Stanley Cup final on a muggy Sunday in Tampa and just before the end of the second period, a puck skipped past Souray on the left point and seconds later, ended up in the Canadiens' net.
After the game, Souray stood by his locker still, patiently answering questions about the play, as wave after wave of reporters dutifully trekked to him wanting to know how? And why? Days later, the Canadiens were eliminated and now, after all this time, Souray is back in the heat of playoff competition, in this most unlikely of settings.
Souray is the last Canadian left standing in Sweden, a member of Farjestads BK, which leads the Elitserien final 1-0 over Vastra Frolunda, Daniel Alfredsson's team.
The opening game of the series, played Sunday, must have seemed like old times for Souray, the way he was hacking and whacking away at Alfredsson, the Ottawa Senators' captain.
"Yeah, we've got the old Northeast Division rivalry going," said Souray, with a smile. "But he's probably the best player playing here right now, so we want to be hard on him. If you're not, he's going to hurt you. I've seen enough of him to know what a great player he is. We respect him, but we have a job to do.
"At this time of year, you leave friendship behind in the corridor and whatever happens on the ice is what happens on the ice. Everyone's worked so hard to get to this point, that if you start letting up on guys at all, you're letting your teammates down."
Souray is taking his participation in the final seriously. That was the thrust of the guest column he wrote for the Swedish tabloid Expressen: that while some might think that locked-out NHL players have little regard to how their temporary teams fare in the playoffs, this does not apply to him or to his teammates. He has been here long enough - almost six months and counting - to be engaged in the task at hand, which is trying to win.
Farjestads came in as underdogs to Alfredsson's team, even though they won the championship in 1998, 1999 and 2002 and their manager, Hakan Loob, is rapidly becoming the Swedish league's answer to Sam Pollock, guiding his club to seven Elitserien final appearances in his nine years on the job, an extraordinary accomplishment. Moreover, Loob - because of his extensive North American ties - knew that he needed to create a familiar environment to help his NHL recruits adjust.
"Really, they made it so easy for me," said Souray. "I mean, I wish I were in Montreal, but the truth is, once everything got settled there and you could really focus on being here, I really liked it.
"I like the fact that there's not so much press around. It reminds me of being back in Alberta. You can live your life and be your own person and just blend in."
Souray came over in November, along with the Phoenix Coyotes' Mike Comrie. Both signed with Farjestads during the first transfer window in the Swedish season. Comrie lasted only about 10 games and left at the beginning of December. Souray was the only North American to stick it out, but because he'd crossed paths with many of the team's Europeans somewhere along the way, he felt right at home. More importantly, he did not believe at this stage of his career - after missing so much time the past few years, recovering from wrist surgery - that he could afford to miss another year.
"Everyone had different reasons for coming," said Souray. "I'm not the kind of guy who would come over here and then quit on the guys - take someone else's spot for a while, make someone else suffer and then, 'OK, I don't like it, I'm going home.'
"I made a commitment to come here. Before I made that commitment, I talked to my family about it. It was something I was prepared to do - to come here for the year. If you have the right mindset, it doesn't really bother you.
"It's not as if you go home every day and mark an X on the calendar until you can go home. I never thought I'd be here this long, but I never thought of leaving either.
"Besides, if I was in Edmonton or Montreal or even L.A., everyone would have been coming up to me, all the time, asking, 'hey, what's going on?' You'd have gotten tired of answering those questions, all the time. Even calling my dad at home once a week, I got my fill just from that. When they re-, re-, re-cancelled the season, I said that was it. Thankfully, I've got something else to focus on."
That something, believe it or not, is an Elitserien championship - and while it's not Montreal and it's not the Stanley Cup, it seems to matter to him and maybe that's why he's here, in a place he'd never heard of until last year, playing for a championship that means something to others, as a result, has come to mean something to him too.

Full text: As the sun sets on this lively Spanish city, SIMONA RABINOVITCH finds that physical journeys often inspire spiritual ones
? 'But I don't like beer," I protested vainly as my new Barcelona friends handed me a warm can spontaneously purchased from one of the kind-looking bums hocking the stuff out of duffel bags. The four of us made our way down Las Ramblas, the mile-long pedestrian walkway in the heart of the old city that connects Catalunya Square with the waterfront of Port Vell. Just before four in the morning, the boulevard was still peppered with skaters, tourists, bar-hoppers, junkies and vendors selling flowers, candy and magazines.
"Rock 'n' roll in Barcelona!" joked one of the guys in our motley crew, taunting me to live a little, what the hell. They spoke virtually no English, we spoke no Spanish, but the universal language of liquor, laughter and humanity was enough to cement ties for the evening.
We had met in a shiny, new club near the Port OlÃ­mpic called Razzmatazz, recognizing potential new friends through cultural signifiers that transcend nationality: a shared taste in clothes and music; honest eyes, crooked smiles; curiosity.
"Que tal?" one of had them asked. "What's up?" Sipping the cheap but authentic froth, we piled into a cab, then climbed seven flights to the roof of their modest apartment building and stood there, overlooking other rooftops beneath which so many people slept and dreamed.
The vastness was a relief. Although I claimed to be looking for adventure, the truth was I had come to Barcelona in search of something else: an elusive sense of purpose, of history, of self, or some overdue sort of epiphanyto add meaning to life and put it life neatly into perspective.
As devout travellers have long believedsince the beginning of time, a physical journey can perhaps sometimes lead to a spiritual one. And what better maze in which to hunt for revelation -- however clichÃ©d a search this might be by cynical North American standards -- than the dark streets of a strange city? What tormented insomniac hasn't prowled strange cities at night, honoured by the powerful intimacy suddenly shared with foreign soil?
As jet-lagged voyagers can attest, a compelling difference defines the day and night personalities of any living metropolis. At night, a city is cooler, transparent, more sincere. while the masses slumber, oblivious, a city reveals its honest, undressed pulse, from the richness thickening its air to the inspiration lurking in its alleyways.
That is especially true of Barcelona, which tends to wake up after the sun goes down. when the sun goes down. Overcome by afternoon heat, the city shuts down for siesta. Supper doesn't start before 10 or 11 p.m. As revealed during the 1992 Olympics, Barcelona is one of the Mediterranean's most cosmopolitan and culturally dense cities. Renowned for its cuisine, opera, theatre and countless modern bars and old-world cafÃ©s, it draws much of its character from the juxtaposition of modernity is juxtaposed with remnants of the city's dramatic history.
Barcelona is also the capital of Catalunya, an autonomous region with its own mysterious language and customs, which came under Spanish rule in 1714. Everywhere are stunning examples -- both functional and aesthetic beautiful -- of late-19th and early-20th-century Modernista architecture, a movement led by brilliant Catalan architect Antonio GaudÃ­.
At the time of our visit, Barcelona was hosting the 10th edition of the SONAR music and multimedia festival, which attracts thousands of musicians, DJs and fans. Led by our makeshift tour guides, we avoided the massive main events (featuring performances by BjÃ¶rk and Underworld), heading instead to local bars. Most cool Barcelona dives are hidden in a maze of narrow cobblestone streets on either side of Las Ramblas. (The area to the West is called El Raval, while the medieval Gothic Quarter is to the East).
We scampered through alleyways in search of trouble. They took us to Benidorm, a hip hangout playing '80s new wave and Britpop. We sipped from tall glasses at La Macarena and sweated up a storm at the tiny Moog club, where Montreal DJ Tiga shared the decks with Berlin's Miss Kittin and DJ Hell. Just beside the Gothic Quarter is Plaza Real, a hostel and restaurant-lined town square where teenagers hang while couples dine on tapas and wine.
Other must-sees include the CafÃ© de l'Opera, where opera-goers congregate after a show, and Els Quatre Gas, a turn-of-the-century artist hangout, whose menu design was reportedly Picasso's first paid commission.The proximity of one spot to another is convenient, especially considering the challenge of snagging a cab. (Maybe that's why the moped seems to be the preferred mode of transport; in the clubs, cute boys carry helmets as casually as women carry purses.) Off the beaten track is after-hours dance club Apolo, which serves past 5 a.m. Good luck finding a taxi at that hour, though.
Hitchhiking is common, though not recommended. Barcelona might be a creative town, but it's also a dangerous one. Dark corners may indeed hold ideas, but they also hide drug addicts and pickpockets -- keep tabs on your wallet. (And, although it's masked by the musky ocean scent, the seedier parts of town smell of urine.)
Night owls not into partying will find action just by roaming around. Take a walk down the Passeig de GrÃ cia; a vast, magnificent boulevard that houses expensive shops, banks, restaurants, hotels, and some of GaudÃ­'s masterpieces: La Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera (also known as Casa Mila).
True to the Modernista commitment to innovation, the buildings don't have corners so much as curves -- lines that melt together so as to suggest a swirling motion reminiscent of the underwater castles of a child's dreams. At night, the otherworldly sheen cast by wrought-iron street lamps makes the buildings appear even more surreal. Continue down Las Ramblas toward the port, passing such landmarks as the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house; the Palau Moja classical palace; and Eglisia del Pi, a 15th-century Gothic church. Wherever you go, history echoes beneath your feet. each carved tile becomes a conspirator of time. This density is everywhere, enhancing everything: flavours are stronger, air is thicker, even eye contact seems more intense, loaded with passion, promise and a little bit of pain, as if it's been building up over centuries of anticipation, expectation and regret. Fortunately, darkness forgives such melodrama, allowing me to indulge in thoughts that by day seem contrived.
The sky was already beginning to blush as I reviewed the evening's events. We began in a bar and ended on a rooftop. It had been a good night. As I wondered why similar evenings spent back home in Montreal usually make me cringe with boredom and ache to hop on the next plane to anywhere, the epiphany I had been seeking crept up on me. my spine with a foreboding tingle. Perhaps the joy I felt was really the thrill of the unknown, and my sense of peace was simply a result of the blind trust exchanged between strangers who hadn't yet let each other down.
Unfamiliar surroundings had heightened my emotions. I had forgotten that, despite variations in habit, dialect, temperature and temptation, human nature is the same in all time zones; new scenery gets old fast; and friends who haven't yet disappointed will probably do so sooner or later.
Staring at all those quiet rooftops, I realized that maybe forgetting could be a good thing. Maybe it's this temporary amnesia about rules of conduct and convention and preconceptions about human nature that allows even the most jaded traveller to revisit the senses of innocence, hope and wonder that make travel so spiritually rejuvenating-- and to remember the experience as a slice of time independent of reality. (Or maybe it's just another behavioural paradox, like our habit of seeking freedom in the constraining environment of bars. the most constraining of environments; or clarity in beer, the most numbing of brews)
Surrounded by the living remnants of Barcelona's ongoing history, both past and future, I understood then what it was that had thickened the air and echoed beneath my feet. It was a real revelation that the city's artists, warriors and gypsies must have felt in their very cells.
That an essential part of memory's creation is, simply, forgetting.

Full text: GAME UPDATE
GAME UPDATE
Boston 5 Montreal 4 (in third period)
By ERIC DUHATSCHEK Boston Globe and Mail Update Montreal is fighting back after falling into a huge playoff hole Sunday at the Fleet Center.
It was one of the wildest first periods in memory, with the Bruins racing off to a four-goal lead less than 12 minutes in play, only to see the Canadiens come back with two goals of their own to make it interesting.
Things began well for Boston when Brian Rolston scored his first of the night only 2:12 into play. Rolston hit a seam between the Canadiens' defence, right at the Canadiens blueline and, after accepting a pass from Rob Zamuner, raced to the middle of the faceoff circle and beat Theodore with a shot between the pads.
Glen Murray followed at the 9:34 mark with something of a lucky goal. On the play, the Bruins' Sergei Samsonov carried the puck into the Canadiens' zone and, spotting Nick Boynton following the play up, gave him the puck. Boynton's shot hit Craig Rivet's skate, then bounced off Murray's leg and crazily ricocheted behind Canadiens goaltender JosÃ© ThÃ©odore.
That goal appeared to temporarily deflate Montreal because the Bruins scored twice more in the next 135 seconds to open up what appeared to be an insurmountable lead. With the teams playing four-on-four, Richard Zednik turned the puck over in the Bruins' zone on a rush, leaving the Canadiens' defence trapped.
The Bruins' Sean O'Donnell moved it ahead quickly to Bill Guerin, who had a breakaway from centre. Coming in hard off the right wing a stride in front of the pursuing defencemen, Guerin deked Theodore and slipped the puck along the ice into the net.
Seconds later, Joe Juneau was whistled down for goaltender interference and, with the Bruins on a four-on-three advantage, Rolston scored his second goal of the night, a slapshot from 20 feet inside the Canadiens' blueline that overpowered ThÃ©odore.
The Bruins scored four goals on 12 shots and there was some question as to whether coach Michel Therrien might pull ThÃ©odore at that juncture. He didn't - and the Canadiens managed to get two goals back before the period ended. The first came at 14:22 on a Zednik shot that rifled off the inside crossbar, jostled Dafoe's water bottle loose and then ricochted out again.
For the second time in two games, the goal light didn't go on at that end of the ice, forcing referees Mick McGeough and Brad Watson to wait for the next stoppage in play to ask for a review. The video evidence was clear - Zednik's shot was in, making it 4-1 Boston.
The rest of the period belonged to Zednik, who was stopped on a partial breakaway at the 17:10 mark after receiving a long headmanning pass from behind the Canadiens' goal line.
No matter. Zednik scored his second of the night 29 seconds later, after centre Doug Gilmour won a faceoff from Thornton back to Rivet. Rivet came down the left boards and banked a pass off O'Donnell's skate that went right to Zednik, who swept the puck past Dafoe.
Just before the buzzer sounded, Zednik almost produced a natural hat trick after the Bruins' Axelsson was sent off for hooking. Zednik had a chance for a tip-in by the side of the net, but couldn't get his stick on the shot. As time expired, Bruins' defenceman Kyle McLaren bumped Zednik, causing Zednik to slash him back and putting the Bruins on the power play to start the second.
They didn't score on that advantage, but the Bruins held a decisive territorial edge for the first half of the second period. They held a 10-1 edge in shots after 6:59 had been played. They bumped their lead in shots to 13-2 through the first 10:36 of play. Theodore made a series of good saves in that span, none better than one on Axelsson from the top of the crease just after the midpoint of the period. Boston had upped its edge on the shot clock to 14-3 when Zednik scored his third of the night at the 14:01 mark, deflecting Patrice Brisebois's shot from the right point, after Oleg Petrov had chipped it back to him.
Martin Lapointe had a chance to restore the Bruins' two-goal margin a few minutes later, but he shot the puck miles high on a breakaway.
Just when it looked as if the Canadiens would go into the third down by just a goal though, Axelsson finally connected for Boston again, beating Theodore over the shoulder with a hard slapper after a drop pass from Guerin. Theodore, who had stopped 19 shots in a row to that point, appeared to be screened by Stephane Quintal on the play.
PREVIEW
By ERIC DUHATSCHEK Boston Globe and Mail Update
The Montreal Canadiens needed to deviate from the norm in preparing for Sunday's second game of their Stanley Cup playoff game against the Boston Bruins, thanks to the crowded event schedule at the Fleet Center.
Because the Boston Celtics opened their National Basketball Association playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers this afternoon, the Canadiens had a choice: Either bring their team, en masse, out to suburban Merrimack College and endure a 45-minute bus ride. Or cancel the morning skate altogether.
Coach Michel Therrien opted for the latter. Accordingly, only the players not scheduled to play tonight - primarily Sergei Berezin, Jan Bulis, Arron Asham, Stephane Robidas and a handful of others - accompanied assistant coach Rick Green to Merrimack. The others stayed in the hotel for a meeting and then dispersed until late afternoon.
The Canadiens and Bruins will be the last teams to play Game 2 of their series and it was largely because of scheduling conflicts at the Fleet Center. The series couldn't begin on a Wednesday because the Celtics played their regular-season finale that night. On Friday night, the Paul McCartney tour passed through town, followed by a skating show that filled the building twice Saturday, once in the afternoon, once in the evening.
Provided the basketball game doesn't go in overtime, the event staff will have roughly three hours to turn the building over from hoops to hockey, usually time enough in this day and age. The problem often is that the ice underneath the basketball floor gets soft and thus chips far too readily.
The only good news is that the heat wave that rolled through New England towards the end of last week is over. Cooler temperatures will make it easier for the air conditioning system to keep the temperature of the building down.
With two days between games, the Canadiens practised just the once - on Saturday morning, out at Merrimack. There were no line-up - or for that matter, strategy - changes expected, after the Canadiens won the series opener 5-2 over the favored Bruins, the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference.
The Bruins, by contrast, vowed to produce a more disciplined overall effort. The two primary adjustments they'll try to make: To be better in the faceoff circle; and to spend less time chasing around the Canadiens' crafty forwards around the zone.
The Canadiens boast the league's top faceoff man in Yanic Perreault and had a good night, winning 10 of 15. Doug Gilmour, centre of the second line, was even better, winning nine of 11 draws. By contrast, Brian Rolston, centre of Boston's checking line, managed just six wins of 17 and Jozef Stumpel, who was out against Gilmour most of the night, won just four of 15.
"It always helps when you start with the puck," said the Canadiens' Donald Audette.
Faceoffs were a Bruins' shortcoming all season, coach Robbie Ftorek conceded, but just how quickly can they turn that around in 48 hours?
As for their defensive zone coverage, left winger Sergei Samsonov suggested the Bruins' players were often guilty of trying to do much and thus sometimes missed their own assignments. The Canadiens were especially effective in hitting the trailer coming late on the play. It was how Oleg Petrov managed to score his goal, which was eventually disallowed.
"In the defensive zone, we were just trying to chase guys and not playing up to our positions," said Samsonov. "That allowed them to get their momentum and to get things rolling."
Like a lot of the Bruins' players, Samsonov wasn't thrilled by having so much time between games. It helped, among others, Canadiens' captain Saku Koivu, who is recovering from cancer, but it just forced the Bruins to endlessly answer questions about what went wrong in the opener.
"It's a little too much time to think about it," said Samsonov, "but we'll get over it."

Or it can store up to 20 minutes of digital music on the included 16 MB CompactFlash memory card (a microphone and speaker are built into the camera). The mc3 is to be released in Canada in April, at a retail cost of $359.
Smaller is better for office computers, Hewlett Packard believes, and so has introduced the low-maintenance e-PC, a "re-invented desktop PC." The sealed-box HP e-PC is about the size of a large reference book (8.9 by 24.0 by 27.2 centimetres) and weighs only 3.5 kilograms, and is designed to fit into any office environment. Its smaller size also means that the system is much quieter. The modular design, which includes a hard-disk drive, a system chassis and a power supply, decreases the failure risk by 25 per cent, lowering service charges HP says. The e-PC comes with either a Pentium III 866 MHz or a Celeron 633 MHz processor, 64, 128, 256 or 512 MB SDRAM, 10 GB or 20 GB hard disk , fast Etherlink connection, CD drive, Cirrus Logic sound card and either Windows 98 SE or Windows 2000 Professional.

Digital imaging specialist PhotoChannel Networks Inc. says it has made major progress on the management reorganization announced March 19, including a 50-per-cent reduction in its staff. "We have eliminated or re-tasked all aspects of the company to allow all resources to be committed to implementing The PhotoChannel Network," Peter Scarth, PhotoChannel's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "We continue to negotiate with key photo retailers and strategic partners." The company said it has negotiated a bridge loan from senior management and prominent shareholders to help it meet short-term financial obligations. It added that further financing is necessary in order to meet its long-term obligations, although it has discontinued the $3-million debenture offering announced Feb. 9. The PhotoChannel Network is a global and secure digital imaging network linking consumers directly, or through syndicated sites at retailers, on-line portals and communities, to the retail members of The PhotoChannel Network who operate digital minilabs and digital photo kiosks.
AT&T Canada has opened an Internet data centre in Montreal, its third in Canada. The centre provides a secure facility for hosting business Web sites and server operations, or for setting up operations for application service providers (ASPs), the company said. The facility is a carrier-class data centre with full environmental controls, uninterruptible power, back-up diesel generators, controlled access, video surveillance, multiple broadband fibre ring access, raised floors with anti-static tiles, two-stage, zoned fire/smoke/heat protection, high-speed Internet connectivity and full-time monitoring. The Internet Data Centre's services are aimed at small to large businesses that have high bandwidth requirements for e-business.
Kodak has returned to the CMOS-based image-sensor technology to produce a camera that offers digital video, MP3 and VGA-quality still images. The CMOS sensor, which requires much less power to run than the CCD sensor, is powers by three AAA-size batteries. The Kodak mc3 captures pictures in 640 x 480 (VGA) resolution, about 150 of which can be stored on the included 16 MB CompactFlash memory card. Or it can record five minutes of digital video in QuickTime format at the rate of 10 frames per second, or one minute of video at 20 frames per second. Or it can store up to 20 minutes of digital music on the included 16 MB CompactFlash memory card (a microphone and speaker are built into the camera). The mc3 is to be released in Canada in April, at a retail cost of $359.
Smaller is better for office computers, Hewlett Packard believes, and so has introduced the low-maintenance e-PC, a "re-invented desktop PC." The sealed-box HP e-PC is about the size of a large reference book (8.9 by 24.0 by 27.2 centimetres) and weighs only 3.5 kilograms, and is designed to fit into any office environment. Its smaller size also means that the system is much quieter. The modular design, which includes a hard-disk drive, a system chassis and a power supply, decreases the failure risk by 25 per cent, lowering service charges HP says. The e-PC comes with either a Pentium III 866 MHz or a Celeron 633 MHz processor, 64, 128, 256 or 512 MB SDRAM, 10 GB or 20 GB hard disk , fast Etherlink connection, CD drive, Cirrus Logic sound card and either Windows 98 SE or Windows 2000 Professional.
Montreal-based Matrox Graphics announced on Thursday the release of the Millennium G450 PCI i, a version of its Millennium G450 AGP graphics card made for older computers whose motherboards are not equipped with accelerated graphics port (AGP) slots.

The DualHead technology allows end users to select eight possible display combinations and five operational modes without having to upgrade the motherboard. The Millennium G450 PCI will be available at the Matrox Store (www.shopmatrox.com) and sell for $115 (U.S.).
Front Logic Inc. of Saskatoon has unveiled a monolithic digital selection and delivery system called the Mstation M1 Kiosk, which it has unveiled at Canadian Music Week at the Westin Harbour Castle hotel in Toronto.

It uses an acoustic-wave sensing touch screen interface, which uses phonetic encoding to return relevant search results.
A Comedy Network special called That Canadian Guy by Glen Foster , a 20-year veteran of stand-up comedy, was so successful in its attack on Canadian style that Foster has created a Web site dedicated to his brand of humour. "People will stop me in the street and say, 'You're That Canadian Guy!' I always answer, 'That's not really my name. ... It's That Canadian Guy Dot Com." After mentioning his Web site in the TV special, the site was inundated with thousands of hits and hundreds of e-mails, and the network announced plans to rerun the show April 1.

A Comedy Network special called That Canadian Guy by Glen Foster , a 20-year veteran of stand-up comedy, was so successful in its attack on Canadian style that Foster has created a Web site dedicated to his brand of humour. "People will stop me in the street and say, 'You're That Canadian Guy!' I always answer, 'That's not really my name. ... It's That Canadian Guy Dot Com." After mentioning his Web site in the TV special, the site was inundated with thousands of hits and hundreds of e-mails, and the network announced plans to rerun the show April 1.
