Full text: With lowered revenue, ongoing expenses and government subsidies dwindling, you won't hear a lot of restaurants say they're doing wonderfully these days. And yet, plenty of places are innovating, offering everything from heat-and-serve tasting menus to comfort food classics for takeout and delivery. (There are undoubtedly sociologists studying the correlation between COVID lockdowns and fried chicken as we speak.) Then there are multi-brand ghost kitchens, chefs launching meal kits, online marketplaces and a number of new Quebec-born contactless payment startups, which tend to cost less for restaurants than larger delivery apps.
At Le Diplomate in Mile Ex, Chef Aaron Langille's $13 to $15 Korean-spiced pork, duck and onion confit and tempeh asada sandwiches on homemade chewy and crunchy pan-fried bread are seeing steady lunchtime traffic. But with fewer people buying wine to go this lockdown than last, he's looking to extend his dinner menu. "Someone getting food at night, they're more inclined to get a bottle of wine than somebody getting a couple of sandwiches at lunch," he says.
He's also hoping the government will start allowing restaurants to sell wine with delivery through third-party apps like Quebec startup Eva. For now, they can only offer alcohol with delivery if they deliver it themselves. "I could hop into a Communauto and drive a case of wine over to somebody, and I'm very happy to do that!" Langille said half-jokingly.

His expanded menu paired with wine delivery would be a tiny pivot, but he doesn't see the point in wasting money on more elaborate changes, since restaurants don't know if they'll be welcoming guests inside again anytime soon.
Devon DeSousa of Mile End all-day breakfast spot Fabergé is also holding out hope for a return to in-restaurant dining. "We're not trying to create a new concept and put in all the work to switch it back again," he says. But he's hedging his bet by adding a $6 pickup-only menu (breakfast sandwiches, cheeseburgers and smoothies), offering free coffee (BYO-mug) and slowly onboarding multiple delivery and online ordering services with the hopes of adding five to 10 orders a day. "If we just sell a couple hundred dollars more (per week), we're going to stay afloat," he says.
Meanwhile, John Zamptoulakis, co-owner of mom-and-pop shop Kokkino Café in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, says he's too small for delivery. He's not sure what will happen come winter. "I'm waiting to see what Justin (Trudeau) can do for me. I'd love to close down for three months, because there's no point in staying open when there's no one walking in the street because it's too cold."
For now, he's planning to add roasted vegetables and frittatas to the menu for the colder months and they'll always come with a smile and a hello.
Here's what else is happening on the Montreal restaurant scene:
Local online ordering and delivery companies
Some local delivery options have expanded to food delivery, while a number of Quebec-born startups are offering better deals to restaurants on delivery, takeout and contactless payments than some of the bigger players.
Eva is a co-op ride-sharing delivery service that restaurants can contact when needed. CHK PLZ works with Eva for delivery and is an online ordering service like UEAT, Resto Loco, Pizzli and Cluster. Radish is a delivery co-op of restaurants, drivers and consumers that returns profits to members. And La Roue Libre is an electric bike service that charges a flat $5 fee per delivery.
Food courts and food halls
Food courts have it especially tough, as mall and office patronage have declined, but the most successful restaurants have switched to delivery, like Sukiyaki in the Place Montreal Trust with its perfect 5.0 rating on UberEats.
For now, family-owned South Shore Chinese restaurant DollarBouffe is getting by on takeout. Chef and co-owner Jin Song Zhu's homemade Taishanese savoury rice noodle rolls come steamed, stuffed and bathed in soy sauce, for a dish that's warm, salty, soft and completely slurpable.
Family-owned Le Wok in the foodcourt at 1250 René-Lévesque W. closed in March, but recently reopened. Steve Quan, who's operated the counter since 1997, says he saw 80 per cent fewer customers in his first week back than this time last year. He's hoping more people come for his General Tao chicken and salt and pepper shrimp now that his helpful landlord has let the building's tenants and remaining office workers know that he's reopened.
The city's gourmet food halls, meanwhile, have created their own apps and joined online ordering systems, so you can get your crispy fried chicken (or faux chicken) with maple sriracha from Ho Lee Chix in Le Central to go.
Ghost kitchens
As with food halls, companies with enough capital are leading the way in ghost kitchens, RD3 Restaurant Group, the group behind Reubens and Deville DinerBar has launched ONE KITCHEN out of the Deville space downtown, combining eight restaurant concepts with no actual dining room. Reubens and the revamped Deville have been open for delivery from the space since early November. The remaining six concepts (burgers, pizza, desserts, salads, chicken and Greek street food) are opening over the course of the month. According to Anthony Tzemopoulos of RD3, the plan is to expand to Brossard, Laval and elsewhere in 2021.
Meanwhile, up in St-Laurent, the Q-ZN kitchen that Gazette columnist Bill Brownstein has written about is uniting separately owned restaurants - rather than multiple brands from the same company - under one ghostly roof.
New Restaurants
Undeterred by the pandemic (or not in a position to wait), some restaurants have recently opened, including:
Rubie's, former Chefs! - la revanche winner Hakim Chajar's restaurant serving gluten-free fried chicken out of Miel in Pointe-St-Charles
Le Canting, a Chinese, Taiwanese, Shanghainese and Malaysian comfort food place, also in Pointe-St-Charles, from a former Bouillon Bilk chef
Le Mariachi, vegan Southern Californian/Mexican cuisine from Masterchef winner Dino Angelo Luciano
Mastard from Simon Mathys, formerly of Manitoba, which should open in December
Fleurs et Cadeaux, a Japanese snack bar and sake shop with Chef Tetsuya Shimizu 's bento boxes, chirashi and curries that come with QR code playlists
Manoubia, a Tunisian/Spanish from the owners of Le Dépanneur Café
Chung Chun, a Korean hot dog chain with sausages and mozzarella dogs dipped in rice flour batter and fried like pogos. It's set to open Nov. 25.
Parliament Pub and Parlour chef Chanthy Yen opened Touk, a Cambodian popup, in May. It was supposed to last only until November, but has proven so popular, Yen hopes to open a permanent location if Montreal returns to indoor dining soon.
Special mention goes to Touk, the Cambodian popup from Parliament Pub and Parlour chef Chanthy Yen that opened in May. It was supposed to last only until November, but his Khmer curry with hand-crushed kroeung spice paste and Mee Kola steamed rice noodles with soy-pickled egg, marinated vegetables and Nordic shrimp have proven so popular that Yen hopes to open a permanent location if Montreal returns to indoor dining soon.
Fine Dining at Home
A lot of Montreal restaurants have adapted to be more travel friendly or casual, like Pastel on UberEats with its $50 table d'hôte and $15 cubano sandwiches, and Danny St-Pierre with his Detroit-style pizza in St-Lambert. Others require customers to prep, plate or reheat each dish themselves, like the $175 takeaway tasting menu for two from Le Mousso or the à la carte options from Hoogan et Beaufort and L'Express. (Don't worry, there are instructions.)
Many have launched their own online marketplaces of appetizers, mains, desserts, pantry staples and discovery boxes, like Chez Victoire with its $65 four-course boxed set menus for two - think celery remoulade with truffle, pear and foccaccia; tuna tataki; risotto; and vanilla pannacotta. It's also selling T-shirts, hats and litres of homemade Bolognese and chilli in its online boutique. Wine lovers will appreciate the 30 per cent discount on bottles, which drops a 2014 Philippe Pacalet chardonnay from $225 to $157.50. For more budget-friendly imbibing, the fizzy red bubbles of the $42 Cinque Campi lambrusco will add ebullience to your takeout $10 sous vide steak.
Chef-Driven Food Boxes and Meal Kits
What do chefs do with time on their hands? They contribute to Les Weekendeurs' custom food boxes, which include affordable dishes from reputable restaurants and chefs, along with honey, maple syrup and spice blends from local companies. They also start their own chef-prepped meal kit boxes, like Mise en Place, the brainchild of Chef Danny Smiles, where subscribers follow along with videos of Danny preparing each high-quality meal himself, from salmon puttanesca with sautéed rapini to vegan shepherd's pie with watercress and endive dijonnaise. Delivery is included for both.
Sweet Endings
Juliette et Chocolat owner Juliette Brun didn't expect to spent the first COVID lockdown doing Instagram and Facebook live events. But when the promotional tour for her cookbook was cancelled, that's what she did. If you don't feel like making her decadent brownies at home, you can order her hot chocolate, crêpes and even gourmet fondue - complete with waffles, brownies, homemade marshmallows and fresh fruit -for delivery via the Juliette et Chocolat website or third-party apps.

Province's back-to-school operation is a 'mess,' Québec solidaire charges

Full text: This week's return to school for thousands of young Quebecers is a disaster, Québec solidaire charged on Wednesday, with one party MNA going so far to describe the operation as "a mess."
Quebec solidaire MNA Vincent Marissal, himself the father of four children, severely criticized Education Minister Jean-François Roberge's performance, saying the government's indecision on its back-to-school operation was causing parents undue stress because of a lack of information on how it will unfold
Marissal also compared the government's recent recruitment drive for teachers to the last-minute installation of air conditioners in long-term care facilities
"It took a heat wave for somebody to finally wake up," he said. "Enough with the 'don't worry, be happy.' This return to school is a mess."

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a heat wave warning for the Montreal region starting this weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach or exceed 30 degrees on Saturday, Sunday and Monday in Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil. The weather conditions will be particularly "moist" on Sunday and Monday, Environment Canada is warning, with humidex values hovering between 38 and 42. A cold front is expected to bring some relief by Tuesday or Wednesday. In the meantime, the federal government suggests rescheduling or planning outdoor activities during the coolest time of day.

#ICYMI: Mask law, heat wave, Habs camp, more

Full text: Friday, July 17, 2020: Here are some of the stories we've been following today.
FAQ: What you need to know about mask law
It will be mandatory to wear masks in indoor public venues in Quebec, starting Saturday. The new law will require citizens (age 12 and over) to wear a mask or face covering that covers the nose and mouth in enclosed or partially enclosed public places. We have some answers from government sources to frequently asked questions about the new mask law.
Mask law will hurt bars, restaurants: poll
More than one Quebecer in four plans to avoid going out for a drink or a meal after a new law that makes masks compulsory takes effect Saturday, a new poll has found.
Close bars to open schools?
A new rise in coronavirus cases has fuelled worries that, if the current trend continues in Quebec, the province will face community transmission levels that are too high to safely open schools in the fall.
A lack of transparency?
In another troubling sign of a lack of transparency during the pandemic, Montreal's public health department has declined to provide the latest data on COVID-19 cases linked to bars after releasing statistics for most of the week.

The heat is on - again
Yet another heat wave is expected to wash over Montreal this weekend. In a special weather warning issued Friday afternoon, Environment Canada said highs will be near 30 degrees Celsius during the day with humidex values ranging from 35 to 39 on Saturday and possibly exceeding 40 on Sunday.
Fired museum head speaks out
"You bug me." That's what Nathalie Bondil says Michel de la Chenelière, chairman of the board of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, told her when she asked why she was being fired as director general of the museum.
Free transit, other options suggested
The Mercier Bridge will be reduced to one lane only in both directions this weekend and will remain that way until Aug. 17. Transport Quebec is enacting certain measures to try to limit the impact the closure will have on motorists during the next month, including free public transit next week.
Quebec vedettes facing allegations
Sexual harassment remains a problem in the local entertainment milieu. Over the past two weeks, there has been a wave of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment levelled at well-known Quebec entertainment figures.
Canadiens defencemen Noah Juulsen (centre) and Josh Brook listen to assistant coach Luke Richardson during practice at the Bell Sports Complex in Brossard on Wednesday.
Kotkaniemi has learned to stay tight-lipped
We won't know whether Jesperi Kotkaniemi's career is back on track until the NHL postseason begins on Aug. 1 in Toronto with the Canadiens playing the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the 20-year-old Finn displayed a mastery of one veteran skill when he talked to the media Friday on a video conference call.

Fariha Naqvi-Mohamed: We must do more than paint a slogan on the street

Full text: Something big happened in Montreal this week, and it was a ray of sunshine for many members of Montreal's Black community, along with their allies. Not everyone is smiling, though.
"La vie des Noir.e.s compte" - and below that, in smaller font, "Black Lives Matter" - was painted across an entire block of Ste-Catherine St. between St-Hubert and St-André Sts. as Montreal joined the ranks of other major cities in making a bold statement in support of the global movement against systemic racism and discrimination.
While many see the giant artwork as a big step forward for the cause, some anglophones have taken to social media to complain. The slogan is known universally as "Black Lives Matter." Why the French translation?
It turns out that to get permission from the City of Montreal, organizers had to agree to make the message mostly in French, with smaller English lettering underneath.
My view, after reading through many online comments, is that the message ideally would be translated around the world into French, Arabic, Mandarin, Greek, Yiddish, Swahili and so on. I see nothing wrong with bringing this message to people in whatever language they speak. The point is the Black Lives Matter movement is predicated on unifying for a common cause.
It is reassuring to see this step being taken in our city. One hopes that this action - along with the peaceful protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police - will help create waves of change that reverberate throughout the systems that have oppressed members of the Black community for far too long.
Now that we have a giant slogan painted on a city block, what next?
We need to build a society with equal opportunities for all - Black people, Indigenous people, the racialized and marginalized. Our diverse communities must be represented at all levels of government and essential institutions. The era of white, middle-aged men leading the way must come to an end. If we are to commit to creating change, we must make sure it permeates the fabric of every board of directors, board of governors, oversight committees and levels of leadership.
If this is to happen, all of us must speak up. The next time you attend a conference or other event, or see one being promoted, take a look at whether it reflects the diversity of the community outside the room or conference hall. If you don't like what you see, say so. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done any differently; I assure you that it can. But it takes all of us to question, call out and demand. We must collectively speak up in support of more diversity at events, on boards, in organizations - at every opportunity.
When I was growing up, I saw no one who looked like me in positions of authority, in leadership roles or on television. It is hard enough to grow up in an environment where you look different from everyone else. But to feel that the only people who can ever be in charge are those who are white - well, that adds insult to injury. I am blessed with parents who dared me to dream big dreams and encouraged me to shatter glass ceilings. Not everyone is so fortunate.
Our actions today will have an impact on future generations. When children see people who look like them in positions of authority, it gives them permission to dream big dreams.
So yes, La vie des Noir.e.s compte, absolument. But our efforts must not stop with a slogan, however big it's painted and whatever the language. Let's use this moment as a stepping stone to create waves of change throughout society.

Our actions today will have an impact on future generations. When children see people who look like them in positions of authority, it gives them permission to dream big dreams.
So yes, La vie des Noirs comptent, absolument. But our efforts must not stop with a slogan, however big it's painted and whatever the language. Let's use this moment as a stepping stone to create waves of change throughout society.

Full text: Mayor Valérie Plante is proud so many Montrealers have gone to get tested for COVID-19 in recent days, but says the long wait times at testing sites in the city are "unacceptable."
The number of people trying to get tested in Montreal exploded after the city's public health department called on anyone who has been to a bar since July 1 to be tested.
But Plante said Wednesday she doesn't understand how that call could be issued without the proper resources first being in place. The mayor said the city has offered to find new testing sites and even deploy mobile testing clinics again, but added there isn't much more it can do from there.
"There needs to be personnel, nurses and doctors, to operate the clinics," she said. "The city of Montreal can't do that. When you put out a call for testing, you need to be able to test."
The city's public health department announced Wednesday a new walk-in testing clinic will open at Outremont's borough offices Thursday afternoon. The clinic will be open to everyone, but is mainly for people between the ages of 15 and 29 who have been to a bar.
The hope is the clinic could help shorten wait times experienced over the weekend, especially at the Hôtel Dieu testing site, where people stood in line for several hours to get tested.
Speaking to reporters in Rivièredu-Loup on Wednesday, Premier François Legault also denounced the long wait times. The premier said he has spoken to public health officials about the problem and expects the situation to be corrected. He said the province has the capacity to test 16,000 people daily, but is only at about 10,000 per day.
Legault also called on people to be "more disciplined" in bars. Dr. Richard Massé, of Quebec's public health department, said there are delays because some of the people working at the testing centres were sent back to their regular jobs when fewer people were showing up for tests. But local health authorities are working to get them back to the testing centres to be able to increase the number of people tested each day, he added.
"It takes some time to mobilize nurses and other technicians to support the screening activities," Massé said.
The first priority is to increase testing at Montreal's Hôtel Dieu site, he added. But as Plante alluded to, mobile testing clinics - specially outfitted city buses deployed at the height of the crisis - could also be brought back into service if needed.
Massé said there has been an increase in cases connected to indoor and outdoor gatherings and people going to bars and restaurants, mainly adults in their midto-late 30s.
According to Montreal's public health department, about three per cent of the 3,000 tests done over the weekend came back positive.
Earlier this month, the percentage of positive cases on the island was less than one per cent.
"It shows us that there is an increase in transmission and we have to intervene quickly," Massé said, adding that the percentage of positive tests is one of several indicators that public health officials are monitoring.
Earlier in the pandemic, the percentage of positive tests was higher, in the 15-to 20-per-cent range, he added.
Asked Wednesday whether she is worried about the uptick in cases in Montreal, Plante said the city has been discussing with the provincial government to make sure everything is in place to handle a potential second wave.
She said the province should be ready to focus on Montreal, seeing how badly the city has been hit during the pandemic.
"We've had it hard here in Montreal," Plante said. "It's still very difficult for merchants. (Thousands of) people have died. We were the epicentre. I do not want to live that again, and clearly Montrealers don't, either."

Amber Alert: Bodies of missing girls, 6 and 11, found in wooded area
The search for two missing girls came to a tragic end Saturday when searchers found the girls' lifeless bodies in a wooded area of St-Apollinaire. Authorities are still searching for the girls' father, 44-year-old Martin Carpentier, who is believed to have abducted his daughters, Romy Carpentier, six, and Norah Carpentier, 11.

Been to a bar drinking this month? Better get tested for COVID-19
Montreal public health officials are asking people who have frequented a bar since July 1 to be tested for COVID-19 because of an outbreak of cases in several drinking establishments. At least five bars in the past 11 days on the island of Montreal have reported customers or employees were carrying the coronavirus, health officials said.

Oka Crisis, 30 years later: Kanesatake's long struggle for land rights
The Kanesatake land claim has been described as "perhaps the most difficult" of any dating from before Confederation. Unlike its sister communities of Kahnawake and Akwesasne, Kanesatake is not an official reserve but a checkerboard of Crown lands, totalling 828 hectares in 1990. Here are some milestones in Kanesatake's long struggle for land rights. Read more here.( /news/local-news/oka-crisis-30-years-later-kanesatakes-long-struggle-for-land-rights )
The Pines that set off the Oka Crisis: 'Once that's gone, what's left?'
Settlers won't need an army to take what's left of the land. They won't need to disperse protesters with tear gas, to dig trenches and lay barbed wire around the settlement in Kanesatake as they did 30 years ago. They won't have to equip thousands of soldiers with rifles, tanks and helicopters to besiege the community of 1,700. In the end, all it will take to cut the Mohawks off from their 689-square-kilometre land claim is the slow, brutal passage of time. Read more here( /news/the-land-in-the-pines ).
Mohawks take PM to task over unanswered land claims on 30th anniversary of Oka crisis
Mohawks from Kanesatake to Kahnawake took Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to task Saturday for failing to answer their centuries-old land claims( /news/local-news/oka-crisis-30-years-later-kanesatakes-long-struggle-for-land-rights/wcm/699dd766-183f-43c6-ba8c-0f434546a080/ ) on the 30(th)anniversary of the start of the Oka crisis. A convoy of about 100 vehicles carrying Kahnawake residents - many of them sporting Mohawk flags - crossed the Mercier Bridge into LaSalle and back Saturday morning as part of a "rolling blockade" to commemorate the event.

Opinion: 30 years after Oka, let's not allow history to repeat itself
Thirty years ago, on July 11, 1990, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from that July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving Sûreté du Québec officer.

Josh Freed: Montreal divided between the masked and the maskless
They kept telling us the second wave was coming, but who knew it would be a heat wave?

Full text: They kept telling us the second wave was coming, but who knew it would be a heat wave?
The sweltering temperatures have made COVID-coping even more tricky, as many people are sweating and gasping through their masks.
It's also sent crowds off to the beach, especially since we're told it's safer outdoors. But that's overloaded beaches in the countryside and caused COV-irritation in those still living in near-isolation.
It's all part of our confusing, contradictory new world where fast-changing events, science and personal attitudes have people living in vastly different worlds.
On one hand, Montreal is opening huge pedestrian street corridors( /news/local-news/sections-of-montreal-downtown-streets-to-become-pedestrian-corridors ) to give everyone a full six-feet of walking space. Meanwhile, our parks, bars and streets are filled with crowds, totally ignoring any distancing at all.
In Jeanne-Mance Park near my home, crowds of 10 to 20 people routinely gather, often only a foot apart, sharing picnic food and sometimes embracing.
They seem to think the pandemic is over. But it's hard to blame them since police are often only metres away paying no attention - as if distancing no longer matters since COVID cases have plummeted.
What's the public message here? Is this a health buffet where you choose your own rules?
"Hmmm ... I'll have the six-foot distance-walking corridor with an N95 mask, please, while my friend will take the extra-large intimate gathering special with handshakes, hugs and double-cheek kiss?"
Masks are another area with a huge contradictory divide.
I was lined up at a busy Westmount ice cream shop where the staff were all masked, as was every last customer. So were a surprising number of people on the street, obviously still living on high COVID alert.
That's because Westmount has an older, more vulnerable population where plenty of people are still living in semi-lockdown, quarantining their groceries and mail for days. So wearing masks everywhere naturally makes them feel more safe.
But shortly after, I was in the younger Plateau at a boutique where no clerks or customers were masked - except me. Afterwards I picked up a falafel at a nearby fast food place where nobody wore masks, including the young customers relaxing at indoor tables.
But when the server started to dish out my food, the owner suddenly spotted me and theatrically ordered the server to wash his hands. All the server was doing was ladling out a take-out salad - hardly a hand-washing emergency - but the owner apologized profusely to me.
Given my age he probably thought I was an undercover health inspector there to bust him on a "no-handwashing" offence.
Everyone's making up their own buffet-style rules. At a third Plateau shop I frequent, the staff dons masks for customers wearing them and removes them for customers who don't.
It's a "customer is always right" approach to public health.
The difference between districts is a tale of two cities. In fairness, many clerks in the Plateau do wear masks, as do some young people in stores and even the streets.
But many in Westmount are living as cautiously as at the height of the pandemic, while some in the Plateau seem to think COVID has left town for good.
It's symbolic of a broader divide in society as a whole. Many people are now having 10-people patio gatherings, while others are scared to gather with anyone but their spouse - if that.
Some Covidiots are stupidly hosting large indoor house parties. Others wouldn't let firemen into their house in a five-alarm blaze. And with Quebec's mixed messages, who can blame them?
It's time for authorities and police to politely enforce some rules. Quebec's been overly-hesitant to make masks mandatory indoors, province-wide - even for restaurant staff who handle food.
Mayor Plante has promised to enforce mask-wearing in enclosed Montreal public spaces( /news/local-news/montreal-will-require-masks-in-indoor-spaces-plante ), but not until July 27th. Why wait till then? Perhaps it's because the calendar says that's "National Crème Brûlée Day?"
Part of our overall confusion is because science is confused, too. For months health experts shrilly warned us not to wear masks - or touch elevator buttons, groceries, mail or money without instantly washing our hands.
Now many experts say touching things is the least likely way to get COVID, so chill - but wear a mask.
The latest big theory is that microscopic virus particles linger in stagnant air, infecting people nearby, which 239 global infectious disease experts just collectively announced( /pmn/business-pmn/who-reviewing-report-urging-new-guidance-over-airborne-spread-of-coronavirus/wcm/8340aae4-a04a-4a8c-b83f-7fa0a1ad7a15/amp/ ).
So while we're all pretty safe outdoors where COVID disperses instantly, it's much more contagious at indoor public places. So movies and especially crowded indoor bars are probably for those with a higher tolerance for risk.
We are likely to live in COVID's two solitudes for the rest of summer. But whether you're overly-cautious or not overly concerned, remember: we're all connected.
If the virus returns, we will wind up back in lockdown, and then we'll all be living in the same tiny world again.
Meanwhile, here's some good news for over-heated mask wearers: the weather forecast calls for rain.

Full text: Aaron Derfel: Young people and regions are driving Quebec's COVID-19 spread
After being overshadowed by Montreal and its soaring rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths for most of the pandemic, Quebec's regions are now reporting a disturbing number of cases - with nearly all of them resulting from community transmission.
Josh Freed: Montreal divided between the masked and the maskless
They kept telling us the second wave was coming, but who knew it would be a heat wave?
The sweltering temperatures have made COVID-coping even more tricky, as many people are sweating and gasping through their masks.
Opinion: 30 years after Oka, let's not allow history to repeat itself
Thirty years ago, on July 11, 1990, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from that July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving Sûreté du Québec officer.
The Oka Crisis has, sadly, left an indelible mark in our minds. And it still serves as a point of reference, because nothing has really changed in 30 years.
Canadiens and Penguins scheduled to start playoff series on Aug. 1
The NHL and the NHLPA ratified a four-year extension to the collective bargaining agreement on Friday, taking it through the 2025-26 season, and a Return to Play Plan for this season after the league was shut down on March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Montreal will require masks in indoor spaces: Plante
The city of Montreal intends to pass a bylaw making face coverings mandatory in enclosed public places by July 27, Mayor Valérie Plante announced Monday afternoon. In a social media post, Plante said the city has come to the decision after witnessing outbreaks in surrounding suburbs in recent days, which could "undermine the efforts" the city has made since the beginning of the pandemic. "A setback would be a disaster for human lives and for our economy," the mayor wrote.
Close bars and enforce public health guidelines on terrasses, expert says
A spike in COVID-19 cases on the South Shore that's being blamed on two house parties and on patrons who flouted physical distancing guidelines at a crowded bar in late June should serve as a warning that it's too soon to reopen bars and too soon for Quebecers to let their guard down, says an expert on community disease transmission. "From an epidemiological perspective, there's no question about it - I would not open bars," said David Buckeridge, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at McGill University's school of population and global health.
REM construction ramps up amid parking and graffiti concerns
Construction of the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) is ramping up across Montreal, including the West Island, where two giant launching gantries - dubbed Anne and Marie - are altering the suburban landscape one chunk of elevated concrete at a time. A massive new span installed over St-Charles Blvd. in Kirkland last week caught the attention of drivers and the mayor, who called it "an unbelievable sight" - even if some citizens were less impressed. "Maybe some people think it's ugly," said Kirkland Mayor Michel Gibson, a proponent of the 67-kilometre light-rail network and its 26 stations linking downtown Montreal with the suburbs. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down construction of the REM, but work gradually resumed on May 11.
Health officials battle COVID-19 and already deadly extreme heat
As a cushion of hot air smothers southern Quebec for the third time in as many months, public health officials who have already seen heat-related deaths this year worry about managing the extreme heat and coronavirus at the same time. As temperatures rose above 30 C this week - prompting yet another heat warning from Environment Canada - Dr. David Kaiser, the physician responsible for the environmental health unit at Montreal public health, grew concerned. He and his colleagues had scrambled in late May when an unseasonable heat wave struck the city amid the height of the COVID-19 crisis. A few weeks later, a June heat wave claimed several lives.
Aaron Derfel: Young people and regions are driving Quebec's COVID-19 spread
After being overshadowed by Montreal and its soaring rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths for most of the pandemic, Quebec's regions are now reporting a disturbing number of cases - with nearly all of them resulting from community transmission. On Friday, the public health director of the Outaouais region expressed concern her investigators are unable to retrace all the contacts of those who have become infected with the pandemic illness. "Unfortunately, since the beginning of July, the number of cases has started to go back up," Dr. Brigitte Pinard told reporters at a news conference in Gatineau.

Josh Freed: Montreal divided between the masked and the maskless

Full text: They kept telling us the second wave was coming, but who knew it would be a heat wave?
The sweltering temperatures have made COVID-coping even more tricky, as many people are sweating and gasping through their masks.
It's also sent crowds off to the beach, especially since we're told it's safer outdoors. But that's overloaded beaches in the countryside and caused COV-irritation in those still living in near-isolation.
It's all part of our confusing, contradictory new world where fast-changing events, science and personal attitudes have people living in vastly different worlds.
On one hand, Montreal is opening huge pedestrian street corridors to give everyone a full six-feet of walking space. Meanwhile, our parks, bars and streets are filled with crowds, totally ignoring any distancing at all.
In Jeanne-Mance Park near my home, crowds of 10 to 20 people routinely gather, often only a foot apart, sharing picnic food and sometimes embracing.
They seem to think the pandemic is over. But it's hard to blame them since police are often only metres away paying no attention - as if distancing no longer matters since COVID cases have plummeted.
What's the public message here? Is this a health buffet where you choose your own rules?
"Hmmm ... I'll have the six-foot distance-walking corridor with an N95 mask, please, while my friend will take the extra-large intimate gathering special with handshakes, hugs and double-cheek kiss?"
Masks are another area with a huge contradictory divide.
I was lined up at a busy Westmount ice cream shop where the staff were all masked, as was every last customer. So were a surprising number of people on the street, obviously still living on high COVID alert.
That's because Westmount has an older, more vulnerable population where plenty of people are still living in semi-lockdown, quarantining their groceries and mail for days. So wearing masks everywhere naturally makes them feel more safe.
But shortly after, I was in the younger Plateau at a boutique where no clerks or customers were masked - except me. Afterwards I picked up a falafel at a nearby fast food place where nobody wore masks, including the young customers relaxing at indoor tables.
But when the server started to dish out my food, the owner suddenly spotted me and theatrically ordered the server to wash his hands. All the server was doing was ladling out a take-out salad - hardly a hand-washing emergency - but the owner apologized profusely to me.
Given my age he probably thought I was an undercover health inspector there to bust him on a "no-handwashing" offence.
Everyone's making up their own buffet-style rules. At a third Plateau shop I frequent, the staff dons masks for customers wearing them and removes them for customers who don't.
It's a "customer is always right" approach to public health.
The difference between districts is a tale of two cities. In fairness, many clerks in the Plateau do wear masks, as do some young people in stores and even the streets.
But many in Westmount are living as cautiously as at the height of the pandemic, while some in the Plateau seem to think COVID has left town for good.
It's symbolic of a broader divide in society as a whole. Many people are now having 10-people patio gatherings, while others are scared to gather with anyone but their spouse - if that.
Some Covidiots are stupidly hosting large indoor house parties. Others wouldn't let firemen into their house in a five-alarm blaze. And with Quebec's mixed messages, who can blame them?
It's time for authorities and police to politely enforce some rules. Quebec's been overly-hesitant to make masks mandatory indoors, province-wide - even for restaurant staff who handle food.
Mayor Plante has promised to enforce mask-wearing in enclosed Montreal public spaces, but not until July 27th. Why wait till then? Perhaps it's because the calendar says that's "National Crème Brûlée Day?"
Part of our overall confusion is because science is confused, too. For months health experts shrilly warned us not to wear masks - or touch elevator buttons, groceries, mail or money without instantly washing our hands.
Now many experts say touching things is the least likely way to get COVID, so chill - but wear a mask.
The latest big theory is that microscopic virus particles linger in stagnant air, infecting people nearby, which 239 global infectious disease experts just collectively announced
So while we're all pretty safe outdoors where COVID disperses instantly, it's much more contagious at indoor public places. So movies and especially crowded indoor bars are probably for those with a higher tolerance for risk.
We are likely to live in COVID's two solitudes for the rest of summer. But whether you're overly-cautious or not overly concerned, remember: we're all connected.
If the virus returns, we will wind up back in lockdown, and then we'll all be living in the same tiny world again.
Meanwhile, here's some good news for over-heated mask wearers: the weather forecast calls for rain.

COVID, heat cause perfect storm; Health officials walk a fine line in managing two crises

Full text: As a cushion of hot air smothers southern Quebec for the third time in as many months, public health officials who have already seen heat-related deaths this year worry about managing the extreme heat and coronavirus at the same time.
As temperatures rose above 30 C this week - prompting yet another heat warning from Environment Canada - Dr. David Kaiser, the physician responsible for the environmental health unit at Montreal public health, grew concerned.
He and his colleagues had scrambled in late May when an unseasonable heat wave struck the city amid the height of the COVID-19 crisis.
A few weeks later, a June heat wave claimed several lives.
Kaiser said the hot weather in May and June prepared them for this week's stifling conditions. Protocols are now in place that help officials manage the threat of the virus and the weather, but it has been a challenge.
"There can sometimes be issues in trying to respect isolation and the measures that we want people to keep following in terms of preventing COVID, and what we know to be effective and important in the context of heat," Kaiser said. "It's easier today than it was two weeks ago."
Both the heat and the virus target vulnerable people: the elderly and those with chronic diseases. Isolated people also tend to be more susceptible to heat, but isolation is a condition imposed on some to prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding to the challenge officials face.
Montreal public health diligently counts heat-related deaths. During last month's heat wave, paramedics and hospital staff began to signal deaths they believed to be tied to the heat. But the final death tally has not yet come, Kaiser said, because the pandemic has disrupted some of the indicators officials use to determine how many people have died during a heat wave.
Usually, they look at mortality data and other indicators, checking for differences between normal periods and periods of extreme heat. This year, they can't rely on those metrics.
"We had a lot of excess deaths, unfortunately, in Montreal (this year) but also completely different patterns of use of hospitalizations, emergency rooms and outpatient visits," Kaiser said.
Right now, Kaiser thinks there have been less than 10 heat-related deaths this year in the city. He expects the final death toll to be lower than in 2018, when a heat wave killed 66 people in Montreal.
That year, the weather scorched dense urban areas, turning some into "heat islands." At the time, health officials went door to door checking on people where census data showed a higher concentration of the elderly, but the process was slow. Now, Kaiser said, they target specific buildings whose residents are more likely to be affected.
The 2018 heat wave saw temperatures hover around 34 C for six days. So far this year, the mercury has hit 30 C on eight out of nine July days. The average maximum temperature in July is just above 26 C.
Jean-Philippe Bégin, a meteorologist at Environment Canada, said temperatures will likely drop over the course of July when a new weather pattern settles over Montreal.
Though the number of persistent heat events over the past years could tempt people to connect them to climate change, he cautioned against doing so until all the data could be gathered.
"We had cool summers in the past years and people forget about it pretty easily," he said. "We need time to analyze the data to put it into context."
John Gyakum, a professor in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at McGill University, said that while individual weather events may not provide a broader understanding of where the climate is going, there is a connection between the noticeable increase in the number of heat waves and climate change.
"The climate itself is changing, and what that really means is that the larger-scale global environment is acting to improve the odds for more and more of these heat waves," he said.
"With a warming climate, we should be expecting more in the way of extreme heat."
The days ahead are likely to stay hot and become even stickier. A brewing tropical storm is forcing humid air our way, bringing moisture-laden air over Montreal this weekend. Local Journalism Initiative Reporter

Full text: COVID-19 has heightened the impact of the hot, humid weather on some of the most vulnerable among us.
I remember what a staple splash pads and swimming pools were when my kids were younger. A hot, summer day would mean packing a picnic lunch of goldfish crackers, sandwiches, fruit and chips and spending the day at the splash pad with friends. I'd catch up on the latest with friends while the kids would gleefully run around until they wore themselves out. We'd happily bring them back home to shower and nap and get a chance to put our own feet up for a minute or two.
All that has changed this summer due to COVID-19. Many splash pads are closed in my neck of the woods, and parents may think twice about bringing their children to those that are open.
As for going to a public swimming pool, that's complicated, what with limits placed on the number of users because of social distancing and restrictions in some places barring non-residents.
This adds up to a particularly challenging situation, given that public pools and splash pads, which are inexpensive ways to cool off, are typically most used by those of limited means. Not everyone has air conditioning, and even fans are blowing hot air at almost 42 degrees with humidex.
Meanwhile, the elderly, who were hardest hit by COVID-19, are also at grave risk from the heat. I worry about people like like my dad, who practise social distancing and are cooped up at home. Many older people, especially those of more modest means, would normally flock to malls or municipal buildings during heat waves to avail themselves of air-conditioned spaces. While malls have reopened, for the most part, it is still risky to congregate in large numbers in closed-off areas due to the threat of the virus. A lot of folks who would otherwise be cooling off in these venues are now stuck at home.
This heat wave, like the pandemic, will reveal some of the cracks in our society that are otherwise covered by a thin veneer. COVID-19 showed us how poorly we care for our elderly. This heat wave during COVID-19 will show us how poorly we care for our marginalized and less well to do members of our society. My concern is that we will see more infected cases in the coming weeks from individuals seeking some form of air conditioning during this week.
If you have a roof over your head, food to eat and air conditioning, consider yourself blessed. I've seen an increasing number of people taking to local Facebook community groups, asking for help with groceries or a meal because they are struggling to make ends meet. While there are great community groups put in place for precisely this purpose, they continue to need support. Many of us think of helping food banks and shelters in the winter months, particularly around Christmas, but poverty is year round. Those most vulnerable are feeling the pinch, given mass unemployment, the increased cost of groceries and the general economic slowdown.
I know of several food banks on the West Island that encourage members of the community to "grow a row." This means growing an extra row of produce in their gardens and then donating the fruits of their labour. This can make the difference between forcing some people to rely on canned produce rather than fresh fruits and vegetables.
If you are blessed with food, shelter and air conditioning, please think of those who are not. Check in on your loved ones, stay cool and give back however you can. It may only take a few minutes of your time to do so, but can make all the difference for those suffering alone.

Full text: The humidex had hit 31 degrees Celsius by late Tuesday morning on its way into the 40s.
Environment Canada renewed its weather warning, calling it an "oppressive heat wave" in its 4:30 a.m. notice. Excluding the humidex, the temperature is expected to hit 35 C and will remain in the 30s until at least the weekend.
Drink plenty, but hold the alcohol, and wear light clothing, Environment Canada advises. Stay in air-conditioned spaces where possible.
The heat warning covers Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and Châteauguay, but separate warnings were issued for much of southern Quebec and parts of eastern Ontario. Farther north, severe thunderstorms are a possibility.

Is it safe to swim near Montreal?

Full text: As the sun scorched the city and the temperature reached 35 C last month, Montrealers cooled off in the river.
Children played with inflatable toys in Lac St-Louis near Pointe-Claire village. Along the lakeshore in Dorval, couples dipped their toes in the water and lay on towels near the rocky shore.
Montrealers used to avoid submerging themselves in the waters surrounding the city because of pollution, but the coronavirus pandemic has limited access to pools, pushing greater numbers of people to seek relief from the heat in Lac St-Louis and the St. Lawrence River.
The city of Montreal says the water is usually safe for swimming and is tested frequently. But chemicals from an industrial past linger in the sediment and heavy rains flush raw sewage into the river.
The lake water at one time was clear and popular with swimmers. Crowds of beachgoers in the 1940s and '50s converged on Pine Beach in Dorval and at other spots along the waterfront. Tourists from Montreal stayed in hotels dotted along Lakeshore Rd. They came to the West Island, which was effectively the countryside, to relax and to swim.

Michel Hébert, the president of the Dorval Historical Society, said the water was clean at the time. "In the '40s and '50s, the beach was very popular," he said. "On Saturday and Sunday it was full, full of people."
Then waste made its way downriver from the timber industry, among others, Hébert said. Chemicals, pesticides and metals like mercury contaminated the sediment; sewage dumped directly into the St. Lawrence built up.
The lake began to smell. Testing in the '60s and '70s revealed the extent of the pollution and areas that had been popular with weekend bathers were sealed off.
"You couldn't swim there," Hébert said. "It was too polluted."
Industrial contaminants had settled in the silt at the bottom of the lake. Environment Canada found in 2003 that the amount of contaminants in the sediment around the island was beginning to decline. But more recent research has flagged the buildup of new chemicals. Several studies are being conducted into the effects of higher concentrations of these contaminants.
Experts suggested to the Montreal Gazette that swimmers should avoid kicking up sediment lest they ingest potentially harmful contaminants lurking on the lake floor.
The water itself is usually clean, a city of Montreal spokesperson said last month. Samples taken at 25 stations along the shoreline during a June heat wave revealed low concentrations of fecal coliform, a type of bacteria associated with sewage and animal waste. Fecal coliform levels are the standard measurement used to determine whether a body of water is safe for swimming.
The city posts water testing results online. As citizens took to the water to cool off last month, bright or dark green dots on the interactive map (found at bit.ly/2D8LEL2) marked most testing locations - indicating good or excellent water quality.
But the heat wave broke in spectacular fashion. A storm on June 23 whipped through the Montreal area, dumping rain onto steaming roads and into storm drains and sewers. The water quality in some West Island areas where swimmers had flocked days earlier were suddenly considered "polluted," meaning that fecal coliform levels had climbed as much as tenfold in some cases.
Water from Lac St-Louis crashes over a break wall in Lachine on March 17, 2020.
The sudden change in water quality happened because many sections of the Montreal sewage system are old and operate on a "combined" system - rainwater flows into the same pipes that carry raw sanitary waste. Susan Gaskin, a professor of engineering at McGill University who specializes in environmental hydraulics and water resources, said such a system is not designed to handle heavy rainfalls. During storms, she said, excess water overwhelms it, flushing sewage into the St. Lawrence and Lac St-Louis.
"As a general rule for a citizen," Gaskin said, "I would say I wouldn't swim two or three days after a heavy rainfall, because then the water definitely isn't going to be as good."
A key takeaway for swimmers wanting to dip into the waters around Montreal is to check the city's website before you swim. The quality fluctuates drastically at some sites around the island depending on the weather.
"Good" swimming-quality water has fewer than 100 colonies of fecal coliform per 100 ml. At the Pine Beach site in Dorval on Friday, after Thursday's rain, fecal coliform levels soared to 1,400 colonies per 100 ml, considered well above "polluted" levels.
But generally, Gaskin said, the quality of the water surrounding Montreal has been getting better since the mid-1990s, when the city began treating all its wastewater in a plant on the eastern tip of the island, providing favourable conditions for the steady return of wildlife to the shores around the island.
"If you start seeing herons on the edge of the water, then that means you've got amphibians," she said, "and amphibians are the most sensitive to all of these pollutants. So when you see the wildlife start coming back, you know that your water quality, in general, is improving."

Full text: A heat warning was issued by Environment Canada early Thursday morning for the Montreal area and much of southern Quebec.
Just before noon, the meteorological agency added a severe thunderstorm watch.
Temperatures in the Montreal area hit 30 degrees Celsius on Thursday with humidex values up to 37. The next few days will feature heat in the high 20s and low 30s.
During the heat wave in June, officials offered advice including: - Drink six to eight glasses of water per day. - Avoid alcohol.
When possible, spend at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places. - Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool skin several times per day with wet towels. - Limit physical activities. - Wear light clothes.
The city of Montreal has an interactive map (bit.ly/3dPVkGN) showing pools and air-conditioned spaces that are open and subject to physical-distancing measures.
The hottest spot in Canada Thursday was Toronto at 31.7 C, and it was a cool 1.6 C at Nakiska Ridgetop, Alta. Postmedia News

Full text: A heat warning was issued by Environment Canada early Thursday morning for the Montreal area and much of southern Quebec.
Just before noon, the meteorological agency added a severe thunderstorm watch, saying "Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that are likely to produce very strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy downpours this afternoon and early this evening."
Temperatures in the Montreal area are expected to hit 33 degrees Celsius with humidex values up to 41 C. The next few days will feature heat in the high 20s and low 30s.
During the heat wave in June, officials offered advice including:
- Drink six to eight glasses of water per day.
- Avoid alcohol.
- When possible, spend at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places.
- Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool skin several times per day with wet towels.
- Limit physical activities.
- Wear light clothes.
The city of Montreal has an interactive map showing pools and air-conditioned spaces that are open and subject to physical-distancing measures.
The hottest spot in Canada Thursday was Toronto at 31.7 C, and it was a cool 1.6 C at Nakiska Ridgetop, Alta.

Emergency response poorly coordinated in Montreal Marathon death: coroner

Full text: The city, police and organizers of the Montreal Marathon need to better coordinate emergency procedures, a Quebec coroner says in a report on the death of 24-year-old runner Patrick Neely on Sept. 22.
The engineer from Beaconsfield, who suffered from congenital heart disease, died after collapsing during the half-marathon in the International Oasis Rock 'N' Roll Montreal Marathon.
Paramedics arrived at 10:03 a.m., about 11 minutes after a first call from a police officer who tended to Neely after he collapsed on the last kilometre from the finish line, coroner Ge?hane Kamel says.
"We believe that the lack of communication in the organization of the marathon had consequences in terms of concerted planning with the city of Montreal by not having on site the necessary personnel for such a large deployment, nor clear instructions as to the deployment of aid to marathon runners," Kamel wrote in the seven-page report.
Neely died of multi-organ failure after suffering cardiac arrest, he found.
To prevent such a situation from happening again, the coroner recommended that:
Marathon organizers ensure that the location of defibrillators be known to all, including police officers.
Urgences-santé personnel ensure they know the position of its vehicles and paramedics and guarantees its services.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training be mandatory for all Montreal police officers.
The provincial health department issue instructions that cardiac patients be taken to a hospital centre that offers hemodynamic services rather to the closest hospital.
Montreal ensures, during sporting events, that the medical and organizational infrastructures comply with standards and not authorize the event if these standards are not met.

Allison Hanes: What's the holdup on making masks mandatory in Quebec?

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/allison-hanes-whats-holdup-on-making-masks/docview/2418547768/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Let's face it: wearing a mask outdoors in a heat wave isn't much fun. It can slip down if it doesn't fit right. It's hot. It's hard to breathe. And it muffles speech.
Yet donning these swatches of colourful fabric - at least indoors and in crowded public spaces - may be the key to maintaining something resembling normal life as the coronavirus lingers.
The thinking in Quebec on wearing masks to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 has evolved almost as much as the pandemic since March.
At first, Dr. Horacio Arruda, the national director of public health, was against any such requirement, fearing it would provide a false sense of security.
Then it was awaste of precious resources best reserved for front-line health workers.
In May, both Arruda and Premier François Legault started showing up at their daily press briefing wearing masks and were "strongly encouraging" Quebecers to don them while shopping or taking public transit. Legault even started showing off his collection of handmade face coverings and giving a shout-out to the citizens who sent them to him.
Despite the emergence of a homegrown cottage industry in mask manufacturing, Quebec has stopped short of making them mandatory, despite a growing list of organizations, businesses and jurisdictions that have done so, from Côte-St-Luc to California
Arruda's most recent position is that he prefers to "convince rather than constrain" mask-wearing.
Quebec's lack of official rules on when masks must be worn translates into ambivalence among the general public. Anecdotally, only a fraction of people actually put one on to go about their business. A recent poll showed just 42 per cent of Quebecers wear masks regularly, versus 70 per cent who socially distance.
Now that summer has arrived, Quebec is deconfining, and the number of COVID-19 cases are dropping. Perhaps people don't see the urgency. Wearing a mask - and remembering to bring it - does take some getting used to. But where required, people manage fine.
Getting a desperately needed trim at recently reopened hairdressers necessitates it. Air Canada and Via Rail now require passengers to cover their faces. Ottawa's OC Transpo became the first public transit system in Canada to make masks mandatory, and the Toronto Transit Commission is following suit
Quebec seems to be coming up with every excuse in the book to avoid making masks compulsory. No one wants to punish the disadvantaged people who can't access or afford protection. But Legault coughed up $6 million to help transit agencies, including the Société de transport de Montréal, purchase and distribute masks. That operation has been completed, but masks still aren't compulsory. What's the holdup now?
Mask-wearing has become politicized, an identity marker dividing those taking COVID-19 seriously versus those who think the pandemic was overblown.The the government's laissez-faire attitude only fuels phenomena like "mask shaming" - by both the pro- and the anti-camps.
It's true, there is still no scientific consensus on the effectiveness of masks. But there is a preponderance of evidence showing they are a useful tool to curb transmission. A group of local doctors have called for them to be compulsory in indoor public settings.
Masks don't replace handwashing or keeping a safe social distance. They don't protect the wearer from contagion so much as others from the wearer.
Yet, however imperfect, requiring them in places like supermarkets and on buses is a low-risk way to lower transmission of COVID-19. It's certainly preferable to draconian alternatives like shuttering the economy, closing schools and confining citizens.
It's also an easily reversible measure if we discover a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. In the meantime, it's a small sacrifice to make.
It also makes more sense to get people accustomed to wearing them while the rates of infection are low, not once a second wave hits.
Leaving mask-wearing to common sense doesn't generate compliance. Only clearly defined rules change behaviour and attitudes.
At this point, the question is not should we make masks mandatory, but why shouldn't we?

"It's not a political decision, it's not a decision to hide anything," Quebec's public health director Horacio Arruda told reporters at Thursday's pandemic briefing in Montreal. "It's a decision to ensure a stability in the data."

2:40 p.m. Quebec reopens almost all activities, sectors
Quebec announced it is reopening all services and sectors today, with the exception of sleep-away camps, combat fighting and festivals that include large gatherings.
Bars, casinos, waterparks, spas and tourist accommodations all have the green light to reopen their doors, but will have to maintain two-metre social distancing rules.
Bar patrons will have to remain seated to limit people from circulating. No dancing will be allowed, and only people from the same households are supposed to sit together.
"You must make sure you will keep distance of two metres, keep hand hygiene and use a mask when you cannot maintain social distancing," public health director Horacio Arruda said. "This is very good news for Quebec."
Clubs can reopen as well, Arruda said, including strip clubs.
"But everyone has to keep a distance of two metres," he said.
Results in sectors like retail and schools where Quebec reopened already has been positive in terms of spreading of the virus, and the summer season is a good time to reopen, Arruda said. But he stressed that it's a conditional deconfinement.
"People must respect the two-metre rule. ... If not, we might pay dearly. Either this fall, or even before."
Large festivals or shows are at higher risk due to the singing, drinking and dancing they evoke. Sleep-away camps tend to have children living in close quarters and have been shown to spur outbreaks, he said.
On Quebec's decision to no longer publish daily updates on COVID-19 figures, Arruda said the drop in cases, deaths and hospitalizations allows the province to move to weekly updates, a practice he said was common in epidemiology because it gives a more realistic picture of how a pandemic is evolving is evolving in society.
Day-to-day data often includes an inflated number of cases or deaths because they sometimes bring in figures from previous weeks, causing false spikes, Arruda said.
If data shows an increase in cases "it's sure we will start posting daily numbers again."
"It's not a question of politics, its not a question of hiding anything, it's a question of giving more reliable figures," Arruda said.
Testing has fallen far below Quebec's stated goal of 14,000 a day in part because there are far fewer cases, so less people going to get tested. The health ministry is recalibrating its protocols regarding testing, looking at testing in hospitals and residents of institutions.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin said public health officials are focussing on putting out "small fires," working quickly to detect outbreaks and quickly perform contact tracing to find anyone who might have been infected.
Asked if the reopenings could cause a surge, Drouin said it's likely there will be more cases, but "we won't go back to where we were in February." With lower figures, health officials are better able to control the situation, she said. If the government sees ominous signs, it won't hesitate to shut sectors.
Arruda said he is "very preoccupied" by the idea of reopening the border with the United States, given the conditions there, particularly on the east coast, where are flocking to beaches to escape the heat, and in Florida, where Quebecers like to go. Quebec would be hesitant to allow travel there, he said.
In response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement that certain provinces failed at caring for their elderly, Arruda said: "It's clear, I cannot say there was not a certain failure regarding the number of people who have died." The causes are complex, and included a "bombardment" of travellers before the borders closed, how services for the elderly were organized, a labour and equipment shortage.
"No one can saw we are happy with what happened in our seniors centres," he said. But work has been done to improve staffing and safety.
2:15 p.m. Montreal reports 75 new cases since Tuesday
Montreal's public health department reported on Thursday that the city has seen a total of 27,149 COVID-19 cases, a rise of 75 since Tuesday.
The total death toll for the city now stands at 3,342, a rise of 11 from Tuesday.
There are 39 CHSLDs and seniors' homes with at least one case of COVID-19.
12:50 p.m. Major incident declared as people flock to England's south coast
More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
"Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday."

11:20 a.m. Quebec reports 142 new cases, 7 more deaths
Quebec registered 142 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people infected to 55,079.
The health ministry noted seven new deaths, six that occurred in the last 24 hours and one that came before June 17. It brings the death toll to 5,448.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19-related illnesses dropped by 13, to 487. Of those, 50 are in intensive care, a reduction of two.
The ministry noted that this will be its last daily update of numbers. As of next week, the government will give figures on a weekly basis. The next will come on July 2.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
The decision to end the daily updates has been met with vocal opposition, with critics saying they are necessary for epidemiologists to be able to track the disease as the threat of a second wave hovers.

11:10 a.m. Why some cities get ravaged and others don't
Canada's COVID-19 crisis has been mostly confined to its two largest cities, with two-thirds of confirmed cases in Toronto and Montreal.
New research suggests that certain drivers, such as density and the percentage of population living in nursing homes, predict which cities are the hardest hit.
"What we find is that large metropolis are vulnerable mainly for two reasons. First, they are places with a dense way of life. Second, in large urban areas it is very hard to create a disease-free bubble because there is always inflow and outflow," said Klaus Desmet, an economist at Southern Methodist University, Texas.

11:00 a.m. Selley: Why are we giving Canadian politicians a free pass on COVID-19?
"It is one of the strangest aspects of Ontario's and Quebec's COVID-19 nightmares that politicians have seemed almost entirely immune from criticism," columnist Chris Selley writes.
Were it not for Quebec, Ontario would be Canada's worst performer, with almost three times as many deaths as the next-worst provinces. Were it not for Andorra, Belgium and San Marino, Quebec's COVID-19 death rate would be higher than any nation state in the world.
Despite that, approval ratings for the premiers of Quebec and Ontario have soared.

10:35 a.m. IMF predicts deep recession, slow recovery
Having already warned of the biggest slump since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for the world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago.
It now expects global GDP to shrink 4.9 per cent this year, more than the 3 per cent it predicted in April. For 2021, it forecasts growth of 5.4 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent.

10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.
"The government must reverse this decision!"

4:45 p.m. Decision to end daily COVID-19 updates not a coverup: Arruda
"It's not a political decision, it's not a decision to hide anything," Quebec's public health director Horacio Arruda told reporters at Thursday's pandemic briefing in Montreal. "It's a decision to ensure a stability in the data."

2:40 p.m. Quebec reopens almost all activities, sectors
Quebec announced it is reopening all services and sectors today, with the exception of sleep-away camps, combat fighting and festivals that include large gatherings.
Bars, casinos, waterparks, spas and tourist accommodations all have the green light to reopen their doors, but will have to maintain two-metre social distancing rules.
Bar patrons will have to remain seated to limit people from circulating. No dancing will be allowed, and only people from the same households are supposed to sit together.
"You must make sure you will keep distance of two metres, keep hand hygiene and use a mask when you cannot maintain social distancing," public health director Horacio Arruda said. "This is very good news for Quebec."
Clubs can reopen as well, Arruda said, including strip clubs.
"But everyone has to keep a distance of two metres," he said.
Results in sectors like retail and schools where Quebec reopened already has been positive in terms of spreading of the virus, and the summer season is a good time to reopen, Arruda said. But he stressed that it's a conditional deconfinement.
"People must respect the two-metre rule. ... If not, we might pay dearly. Either this fall, or even before."
Large festivals or shows are at higher risk due to the singing, drinking and dancing they evoke. Sleep-away camps tend to have children living in close quarters and have been shown to spur outbreaks, he said.
On Quebec's decision to no longer publish daily updates on COVID-19 figures, Arruda said the drop in cases, deaths and hospitalizations allows the province to move to weekly updates, a practice he said was common in epidemiology because it gives a more realistic picture of how a pandemic is evolving is evolving in society.
Day-to-day data often includes an inflated number of cases or deaths because they sometimes bring in figures from previous weeks, causing false spikes, Arruda said.
If data shows an increase in cases "it's sure we will start posting daily numbers again."
"It's not a question of politics, its not a question of hiding anything, it's a question of giving more reliable figures," Arruda said.
Testing has fallen far below Quebec's stated goal of 14,000 a day in part because there are far fewer cases, so less people going to get tested. The health ministry is recalibrating its protocols regarding testing, looking at testing in hospitals and residents of institutions.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin said public health officials are focussing on putting out "small fires," working quickly to detect outbreaks and quickly perform contact tracing to find anyone who might have been infected.
Asked if the reopenings could cause a surge, Drouin said it's likely there will be more cases, but "we won't go back to where we were in February." With lower figures, health officials are better able to control the situation, she said. If the government sees ominous signs, it won't hesitate to shut sectors.
Arruda said he is "very preoccupied" by the idea of reopening the border with the United States, given the conditions there, particularly on the east coast, where are flocking to beaches to escape the heat, and in Florida, where Quebecers like to go. Quebec would be hesitant to allow travel there, he said.
In response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement that certain provinces failed at caring for their elderly, Arruda said: "It's clear, I cannot say there was not a certain failure regarding the number of people who have died." The causes are complex, and included a "bombardment" of travellers before the borders closed, how services for the elderly were organized, a labour and equipment shortage.
"No one can saw we are happy with what happened in our seniors centres," he said. But work has been done to improve staffing and safety.
2:15 p.m. Montreal reports 75 new cases since Tuesday
Montreal's public health department reported on Thursday that the city has seen a total of 27,149 COVID-19 cases, a rise of 75 since Tuesday.
The total death toll for the city now stands at 3,342, a rise of 11 from Tuesday.
There are 39 CHSLDs and seniors' homes with at least one case of COVID-19.
12:50 p.m. Major incident declared as people flock to England's south coast
More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
"Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday."

4:45 p.m. Decision to end daily COVID-19 updates not a coverup: Arruda
"It's not a political decision, it's not a decision to hide anything," Quebec's public health director Horacio Arruda told reporters at Thursday's pandemic briefing in Montreal. "It's a decision to ensure a stability in the data."

4:40 p.m. Canada Post working to deliver COVID-19 backlog
A bottleneck causing delays in mail delivery is on the verge of getting much better, according to the union representing 50,000 Canada Post workers.
The COVID-19 pandemic and physical-distancing measures created a surge in online purchases and packages being delivered directly to people's homes.

2:40 p.m. Quebec reopens almost all activities, sectors
Quebec announced it is reopening all services and sectors today, with the exception of sleep-away camps, combat fighting and festivals that include large gatherings.
Bars, casinos, waterparks, spas and tourist accommodations all have the green light to reopen their doors, but will have to maintain two-metres social distancing rules.
Bar patrons will have to remain seated to limit people from circulating. No dancing will be allowed, and only people from the same households are supposed to sit together.
"You must make sure you will keep distance of two metres, keep hand hygiene and use a mask when you cannot maintain social distancing," public health director Horacio Arruda said. "This is very good news for Quebec."
Clubs can reopen as well, Arruda said, including strip clubs.
"But everyone has to keep a distance of two metres," he said.
Results in sectors like retail and schools where Quebec reopened already has been positive in terms of spreading of the virus, and the summer season is a good time to reopen, Arruda said. But he stressed that it's a conditional deconfinement.
"People must respect the two-metre rule. ... If not, we might pay dearly. Either this fall, or even before."
Large festivals or shows are at higher risk due to the singing, drinking and dancing they evoke. Sleep-away camps tend to have children living in close quarters and have been shown to spur outbreaks, he said.
On Quebec's decision to no longer publish daily updates on COVID-19 figures, Arruda said the drop in cases, deaths and hospitalizations allows the province to move to weekly updates, a practice he said was common in epidemiology because it gives a more realistic picture of how a pandemic is evolving is evolving in society.
Day-to-day data often includes an inflated number of cases or deaths because they sometimes bring in figures from previous weeks, causing false spikes, Arruda said.
If data shows an increase in cases "it's sure we will start posting daily numbers again."
"It's not a question of politics, its not a question of hiding anything, it's a question of giving more reliable figures," Arruda said.
Testing has fallen far below Quebec's stated goal of 14,000 a day in part because there are far fewer cases, so less people going to get tested. The health ministry is recalibrating its protocols regarding testing, looking at testing in hospitals and residents of institutions.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin said public health officials are focussing on putting out "small fires," working quickly to detect outbreaks and quickly perform contact tracing to find anyone who might have been infected.
Asked if the reopenings could cause a surge, Drouin said it's likely there will be more cases, but "we won't go back to where we were in February." With lower figures, health officials are better able to control the situation, she said. If the government sees ominous signs, it won't hesitate to shut sectors.
Arruda said he is "very preoccupied" by the idea of reopening the border with the United States, given the conditions there, particularly on the east coast, where are flocking to beaches to escape the heat, and in Florida, where Quebecers like to go. Quebec would be hesitant to allow travel there, he said.
In response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement that certain provinces failed at caring for their elderly, Arruda said: "It's clear, I cannot say there was not a certain failure regarding the number of people who have died." The causes are complex, and included a "bombardment" of travellers before the borders closed, how services for the elderly were organized, a labour and equipment shortage.
"No one can saw we are happy with what happened in our seniors centres," he said. But work has been done to improve staffing and safety.
2:15 p.m. Montreal reports 75 new cases since Tuesday
Montreal's public health department reported on Thursday that the city has seen a total of 27,149 COVID-19 cases, a rise of 75 since Tuesday.
The total death toll for the city now stands at 3,342, a rise of 11 from Tuesday.
There are 39 CHSLDs and seniors homes with at least one case of COVID-19.
12:50 p.m. Major incident declared as people flock to England's south coast
More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast."
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams."
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday.

11:20 a.m. Quebec reports 142 new cases, 7 more deaths
Quebec registered 142 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people infected to 55,079.
The health ministry noted seven new deaths, six that occurred in the last 24 hours and one that came before June 17. It brings the death toll to 5,448.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19-related illnesses dropped by 13, to 487. Of those, 50 are in intensive care, a reduction of two.
The ministry noted that this will be its last daily update of numbers. As of next week, the government will give figures on a weekly basis. The next will come on July 2.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
The decision to end the daily updates has been met with vocal opposition, with critics saying they are necessary for epidemiologists to be able to track the disease as the threat of a second wave hovers.

11:10 a.m. Why some cities get ravaged and others don't
Canada's COVID-19 crisis has been mostly confined to its two largest cities, with two-thirds of confirmed cases in Toronto and Montreal.
New research suggests that certain drivers, such as density and the percentage of population living in nursing homes, predict which cities are the hardest hit.
"What we find is that large metropolis are vulnerable mainly for two reasons. First, they are places with a dense way of life. Second, in large urban areas it is very hard to create a disease-free bubble because there is always inflow and outflow," said Klaus Desmet, an economist at Southern Methodist University, Texas.

11:00 a.m. Selley: Why are we giving Canadian politicians a free pass on COVID-19?
"It is one of the strangest aspects of Ontario's and Quebec's COVID-19 nightmares that politicians have seemed almost entirely immune from criticism," columnist Chris Selley writes.
Were it not for Quebec, Ontario would be Canada's worst performer, with almost three times as many deaths as the next-worst provinces. Were it not for Andorra, Belgium and San Marino, Quebec's COVID-19 death rate would be higher than any nation state in the world.
Despite that, approval ratings for the premiers of Quebec and Ontario have soared.

10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.
"The government must reverse this decision!"

2:40 p.m. Quebec reopens almost all activities, sectors
As of today, all services and sectors with the exception of sleepaway camps, combat fighting and festivals are allowed to reopen in Quebec.
Bars, casinos, waterparks, spas, tourist accommodations are being given permission to start businesses, but will have to maintain social distancing rules. In bars, patrons will have to remain seated in order to limit people from circulating. No dancing will be allowed, and only people from the same households are to sit together.
"You must make sure you will keep distance of two metres, keep hand hygiene and use a mask when you cannot maintain social distancing," public health director Horacio Arruda said. "This is very good news for Quebec."
Clubs can reopen as well, Arruda said, including strip clubs.
"But everyone has to keep a distance of two metres," he said.
Large festivals or shows are at higher risk than a waterpark that is respecting two-metre rules due to the singing, drinking and dancing that they evoke. Sleepaway camps often have children living in close quarters and have been shown to spur outbreaks, he said.
On Quebec's decision to no longer put out daily updates on COVID-19 figures, Arruda said the drop in cases, deaths and hospitalizations allows the province to move to weekly updates.
The figures that have been given out thus far often included an inflated number of cases or deaths, as they included those that came days or weeks before.
If data shows an increase in cases "it's sure we will start posting daily numbers again."
Arruda said it was common in epidemiological practice to give a weekly update, because it gives a more realistic picture of how cases are evolving in society, as opposed to being distracted by daily spikes that are not reflective of the actual figures.
"It's not a question of politics, its not a question of hiding anything, it's a question of giving more reliable figures," Arruda said.
Arruda said testing has fallen far below Quebec's stated goal of 14,000 a day in part because there are far fewer cases, so less people going to get tested. The health ministry is recalibrating its protocols regarding testing, looking at the testing of health professionals and residents of institutions.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin said public health officials are focussing on putting out "small fires," working quickly to detect outbreaks, do contact tracing to find anyone who might have been infected.
Arruda said Quebec will still not impose masks on public transit as cities like Ottawa have done, and Toronto is reportedly moving toward, because the province prefers to recommend rather than force. Drouin said the question of social inequalities, in which some people don't have access to masks, is stopping authorities here from imposing them.
Asked if the new reopenings could cause a surge in cases, Arruda said no.
"I think as we open, since we cannot stay confined because there a lot of side effects in terms of kids and mental health ... I think if we open and check and readjust."
Drouin said there will be more cases, but we won't go back to where we were in February.
The approach is to reopen, but at the same time to make sure we don't have superspreaders," Drouin said, and authorities can do rapid contact tracing to quell outbreaks.
Arruda said he is "very preoccupied" by the idea of reopening the border with the United States, given the conditions there, particularly on the east coast, where it is very hot and people are congregating on the coast, and in Florida, where Quebecers like to go.
More details to come.
2:15 p.m. Montreal reports 75 new cases since Tuesday
Montreal's public health department reported on Thursday that the city has seen a total of 27,149 COVID-19 cases, a rise of 75 since Tuesday.
The total death toll for the city now stands at 3,342, a rise of 11 from Tuesday.
There are 39 CHSLDs and seniors homes with at least one case of COVID-19.
12:50 p.m. Major incident declared as people flock to England's south coast
More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast."
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams."
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday.

12:05 p.m. Opposition parties decry end of daily pandemic updates
Opposition politicians are criticizing the health ministry for its decision to end its daily updates on pandemic figures, saying it shows a lack of transparency at a time when the coronavirus is still lurking in the province.
"Totally incomprehensible," said Liberal leader Dominique Anglade.
Parti Québécois leader Pascal Bérubé called on the new health minister, Christian Dubé, to explain himself.

11:20 a.m. Quebec reports 142 new cases, 7 more deaths
Quebec registered 142 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people infected to 55,079.
The health ministry noted seven new deaths, six that occurred in the last 24 hours and one that came before June 17. It brings the death toll to 5,448.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19-related illnesses dropped by 13, to 487. Of those, 50 are in intensive care, a reduction of two.
The ministry noted that this will be its last daily update of numbers. As of next week, the government will give figures on a weekly basis. The next will come on July 2.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
The decision to end the daily updates has been met with vocal opposition, with critics saying they are necessary for epidemiologists to be able to track the disease as the threat of a second wave hovers.

11:10 a.m. Why some cities get ravaged and others don't
Canada's COVID-19 crisis has been mostly confined to its two largest cities, with two-thirds of confirmed cases in Toronto and Montreal.
New research suggests that certain drivers, such as density and the percentage of population living in nursing homes, predict which cities are the hardest hit.
"What we find is that large metropolis are vulnerable mainly for two reasons. First, they are places with a dense way of life. Second, in large urban areas it is very hard to create a disease-free bubble because there is always inflow and outflow," said Klaus Desmet, an economist at Southern Methodist University, Texas.

11:00 a.m. Selley: Why are we giving Canadian politicians a free pass on COVID-19?
"It is one of the strangest aspects of Ontario's and Quebec's COVID-19 nightmares that politicians have seemed almost entirely immune from criticism," columnist Chris Selley writes.
Were it not for Quebec, Ontario would be Canada's worst performer, with almost three times as many deaths as the next-worst provinces. Were it not for Andorra, Belgium and San Marino, Quebec's COVID-19 death rate would be higher than any nation state in the world.
Despite that, approval ratings for the premiers of Quebec and Ontario have soared.

10:55 a.m. Atlantic premiers agree to open regional 'bubble'

10:35 a.m. IMF predicts deep recession, slow recovery
Having already warned of the biggest slump since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for the world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago.
It now expects global GDP to shrink 4.9 per cent this year, more than the 3 per cent it predicted in April. For 2021, it forecasts growth of 5.4 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent.

10:30 a.m. Nurse infected with COVID-19 reflects on work at CHSLD
Else Leon volunteered to work at a CHSLD in Île-Bizard in May. In June, she tested positive. She spoke to the Montreal Gazette about her decision to sign up, her illness, and what it was like to work in an infected long-term care centre.
See the story here by Kathryn Greenaway.
"I noticed a slight cough at work," says nurse Else Leon, who tested positive for COVID-19 after volunteering to work at CHSLD Denis-Benjamin-Viger in Île-Bizard. "By the time I got home, I had a bad headache. The next morning, I was sneezing and coughing. The symptoms weren't typical. I didn't have a fever."
10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.

Having already warned of the biggest slump since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for the world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago.
It now expects global GDP to shrink 4.9 per cent this year, more than the 3 per cent it predicted in April. For 2021, it forecasts growth of 5.4 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent.

"I noticed a slight cough at work," says nurse Else Leon, who tested positive for COVID-19 after volunteering to work at CHSLD Denis-Benjamin-Viger in Île-Bizard. "By the time I got home, I had a bad headache. The next morning, I was sneezing and coughing. The symptoms weren't typical. I didn't have a fever."
10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.
"The government must reverse this decision!"

2:40 p.m. Quebec reopens almost all activities, sectors
As of today, all services and sectors with the exception of sleepaway camps, combat fighting and festivals are allowed to reopen in Quebec.
Bars, casinos, waterparks, spas, tourist accommodations are being given permission to start businesses, but will have to maintain social distancing rules. In bars, patrons will have to remain seated in order to limit people from circulating.
"You must make sure you will keep distance of two metres, keep hand hygiene and use a mask when you cannot maintain social distancing," public health director Horacio Arruda said. "This is very good news for Quebec."
On Quebec's decision to no longer put out daily updates on COVID-19 figures, Arruda said the drop in cases, deaths and hospitalizations allows the province to move to weekly updates.
The figures that have been given out thus far often included an inflated number of cases or deaths, as they included those that came days or weeks before.
If data shows an increase in cases "it's sure we will start posting daily numbers again."
Arruda said it was common in epidemiological practice to give a weekly update, because it gives a more realistic picture of how cases are evolving in society, as opposed to being distracted by daily spikes that are not reflective of the actual figures.
"It's not a question of politics, its not a question of hiding anything, it's a question of giving more reliable figures," Arruda said.
Arruda said testing has fallen far below Quebec's stated goal of 14,000 a day in part because there are far fewer cases, so less people going to get tested. The health ministry is recalibrating its protocols regarding testing, looking at the testing of health professionals and residents of institutions.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin said public health officials are focussing on putting out "small fires," working quickly to detect outbreaks, do contact tracing to find anyone who might have been infected.
Arruda said Quebec will still not impose masks on public transit as cities like Ottawa have done, and Toronto is reportedly moving toward, because the province prefers to recommend rather than force. Drouin said the question of social inequalities, in which some people don't have access to masks, is stopping authorities here from imposing them.
More details to come.
2:15 p.m. Montreal reports 75 new cases since Tuesday
Montreal's public health department reported on Thursday that the city has seen a total of 27,149 COVID-19 cases, a rise of 75 since Tuesday.
The total death toll for the city now stands at 3,342, a rise of 11 from Tuesday.
There are 39 CHSLDs and seniors homes with at least one case of COVID-19.
12:50 p.m. Major incident declared as people flock to England's south coast
More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast."
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams."
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday.

12:05 p.m. Opposition parties decry end of daily pandemic updates
Opposition politicians are criticizing the health ministry for its decision to end its daily updates on pandemic figures, saying it shows a lack of transparency at a time when the coronavirus is still lurking in the province.
"Totally incomprehensible," said Liberal leader Dominique Anglade.
Parti Québécois leader Pascal Bérubé called on the new health minister, Christian Dubé, to explain himself.

11:20 a.m. Quebec reports 142 new cases, 7 more deaths
Quebec registered 142 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people infected to 55,079.
The health ministry noted seven new deaths, six that occurred in the last 24 hours and one that came before June 17. It brings the death toll to 5,448.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19-related illnesses dropped by 13, to 487. Of those, 50 are in intensive care, a reduction of two.
The ministry noted that this will be its last daily update of numbers. As of next week, the government will give figures on a weekly basis. The next will come on July 2.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
The decision to end the daily updates has been met with vocal opposition, with critics saying they are necessary for epidemiologists to be able to track the disease as the threat of a second wave hovers.

11:10 a.m. Why some cities get ravaged and others don't
Canada's COVID-19 crisis has been mostly confined to its two largest cities, with two-thirds of confirmed cases in Toronto and Montreal.
New research suggests that certain drivers, such as density and the percentage of population living in nursing homes, predict which cities are the hardest hit.
"What we find is that large metropolis are vulnerable mainly for two reasons. First, they are places with a dense way of life. Second, in large urban areas it is very hard to create a disease-free bubble because there is always inflow and outflow," said Klaus Desmet, an economist at Southern Methodist University, Texas.
See the full story here.
11:00 a.m. Selley: Why are we giving Canadian politicians a free pass on COVID-19?
"It is one of the strangest aspects of Ontario's and Quebec's COVID-19 nightmares that politicians have seemed almost entirely immune from criticism," columnist Chris Selley writes.
Were it not for Quebec, Ontario would be Canada's worst performer, with almost three times as many deaths as the next-worst provinces. Were it not for Andorra, Belgium and San Marino, Quebec's COVID-19 death rate would be higher than any nation state in the world.
Despite that, approval ratings for the premiers of Quebec and Ontario have soared.

Were it not for Quebec, Ontario would be Canada's worst performer, with almost three times as many deaths as the next-worst provinces. Were it not for Andorra, Belgium and San Marino, Quebec's COVID-19 death rate would be higher than any nation state in the world.
Despite that, approval ratings for the premiers of Quebec and Ontario have soared.

10:35 a.m. IMF predicts deep recession, slow recovery
Having already warned of the biggest slump since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for the world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago.
It now expects global GDP to shrink 4.9 per cent this year, more than the 3 per cent it predicted in April. For 2021, it forecasts growth of 5.4 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent.

"I noticed a slight cough at work," says nurse Else Leon, who tested positive for COVID-19 after volunteering to work at CHSLD Denis-Benjamin-Viger in Île-Bizard.

10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.
"The government must reverse this decision!"
Pendant ce temps au Québec, on fait le choix de moins de transparence quand il faudrait faire tout le contraire.

More on the masses escaping the heat wave in England by driving to the beaches in the south, from the Guardian:
"A major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast."
"The local authority said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle over-crowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams."
"Visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.
Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9 a.m. on Thursday.

11:10 a.m. Why some cities get ravaged and others don't
Canada's COVID-19 crisis has been mostly confined to its two largest cities, with two-thirds of confirmed cases in Toronto and Montreal.
New research suggests that certain drivers, such as density and the percentage of population living in nursing homes, predict which cities are the hardest hit.
"What we find is that large metropolis are vulnerable mainly for two reasons. First, they are places with a dense way of life. Second, in large urban areas it is very hard to create a disease-free bubble because there is always inflow and outflow," said Klaus Desmet, an economist at Southern Methodist University, Texas.

"I noticed a slight cough at work," says nurse Else Leon, who tested positive for COVID-19 after volunteering to work at CHSLD Denis-Benjamin-Viger in Île-Bizard. "By the time I got home, I had a bad headache. The next morning, I was sneezing and coughing. The symptoms weren't typical. I didn't have a fever."
10:15 a.m. Anglade blasts CAQ for stopping daily publication of COVID-19 numbers
Liberal opposition leader Dominique Anglade took to Twitter to lambaste the Coalition Avenir Québec government for its decision to stop publishing daily numbers compiled by the health ministry on the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, a provincial holiday, the government announced in a press release it would publish its final daily tally of COVID-19 cases Thursday, moving to a weekly publication.
The province's public health research institute (INSPQ) had said it would continue to publish daily updates Monday to Friday.
But on Thursday morning, the INSPQ suddenly changed its message, saying in a press release that it, too, would only publish a weekly update.
"This decision to not inform the public on the pandemic situation is totally incomprehensible," Anglade writes. "Everywhere in the world, we are seeing a second wave. ... Meanwhile, in Quebec, we have made the choice for less transparency when we need the opposite.
"The government must reverse this decision!"
Pendant ce temps au Québec, on fait le choix de moins de transparence quand il faudrait faire tout le contraire.
Le gouvernement doit revenir sur cette décision ! (2/2)#PolQc #Assnat #PLQ

The Griffintown REM station has a name and should be ready by late 2023 At a press conference, Mayor Valérie Plante said she hoped calling it Griffintown-Bernard Landry would put a sometimes bitter name debate to rest. "I think this is a great way of honouring the memory not only of all the Irish people who came to Montreal and contributed so much into how it has evolved and continue to do so, but also honouring the memory of Bernard Landry, our premier who actually was behind the idea of Cité du Multimédia," Plante said. Harout Chitilian, executive director of corporate affairs and development with CDPQ Infra, said the loss of almost two months of construction time due to the COVID-19 pandemic has not necessarily delayed the completion of the REM, with engineering work being done at a distance during the shutdown.
Sticking with naming things, Route 139 in Granby will be renamed after Jean Lapierre The former Shefford MP and political analyst died in 2016. Transport Minister François Bonnardel announced the change Monday in Granby, along with members of Lapierre's family including his children Marie-Anne and Jean-Michel. The renaming was approved by the Commission de toponymie du Québec on June 18. The road was formerly called David-Bouchard Blvd. S., in honour of a former mayor of Granby. The road north of Route 112 will keep Bouchard's name. The city of Granby is also building a public square to be named after Lapierre.
Montreal says it will review its procedures on land repossessions The announcement comes after a Montreal Gazette article exposed the civil service's attempts to acquire lots in a field in Pointe-aux-Trembles without paying their owners. However, the Plante administration's review will be forward-looking and doesn't promise a remedy for the owners in Pointe-aux-Trembles. Asked whether the city would return the lots those lots or compensate their owners, Laurence Houde-Roy, a spokesperson for the city executive committee, said: "We won't redo the past but we'll ensure that the procedures are more clear in the future."

Full text: With Montreal under a heat warning, public health officials are advising residents to take the necessary precautions.
Temperatures soared above 30 C again on Monday, and the CIUSSS Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal has activated its intervention plan for extreme heat conditions.
The regional health network is setting up air-conditioned areas in health facilities where vulnerable individuals living at home can go to cool off.
"If needed, the Société de transport de Montréal is available to bring those individuals to these cooling-off spots," regional health officials said. "Cool zones are also available for people in health facilities. In the context of the current pandemic, various measures have been put in place to ensure safe access to the zones."
The city of Montreal has also set up public air-conditioned places and opened aquatic facilities and pools for the public.
At a news conference Monday, Mayor Valérie Plante said she is aware of the need for pools and beaches in the city to open up as quickly as possible to allow people to cool down.
"We are trying to go as fast as possible. ... We got the go-ahead from public health authorities quite late. We had been pushing to have it a while ago. I'm not saying that is their fault, but it's the reality. So when we got the go, we still had to clean the pools and hire the people and it's not an easy one."
The paramunicipal organization that runs Jean-Drapeau Park announced on Sunday that Jean Doré Beach on Île Notre Dame and the large pool on Île Ste-Hélène will open between the second and third week of July.
Asked about the delay, Plante said she will push to have them open in early July.
Health officials recommend people isolated at home because of COVID-19 go outdoors if they don't have air conditioning and it becomes too hot inside their homes or apartments. (But pandemic protocols must be followed such as wearing masks, hand-washing and physical distancing.)
"In the past few days, different measures have gradually been implemented, but the current meteorological conditions require us to boost the intensity of prevention and protection activities in place," said Dr. Mylène Drouin, regional director of public health for Montreal.
André Cantin, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, said temperatures are nearing record levels for June.
On Monday, Montreal reached 34.7 C, beating the previous June 22 record of 32.2 in 1957.
The normal high for Montreal is 24.1 on June 22, but Cantin said the current heat wave has seen sizzling temperatures.
"Sunday it was 33.4, the day before 33.2. Since June 18, we've been averaging 33, except the 19th it was 32.3.
"It's also getting more humid each day," he added. "The humidex index is close to 40 every day."
There is one more day of hot weather forecast for Tuesday before temperatures are expected to level off.
"They should return to more normal temperatures with a high of 26," Cantin said.
He said more hot weather is forecast for next week.
"After a break from Wednesday through Sunday, with temperatures closer to normal, starting next week temperatures will be around 30 for most of the week."
Cantin has some simple but sound advice to beat the heat: "Go in the pool, and drink a lot of water."

Good Samaritans bring cool comfort to seniors

Full text: Betty Esperanza took the first phone call at 8:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Over the next 12 hours, she processed 43 requests for air conditioners from vulnerable seniors who were sweltering during the second heat wave to hit Montreal in more than a month.
"The man was 85 and he was having a hard time breathing," Esperanza said. "He said the window only opened a little bit and there was no air circulating. He said he could die there."
After hearing about his health problems, Esperanza promised the man that an air conditioner would be delivered to his CHSLD (long-term-care home unit) within 48 hours.
She was able to keep her promise thanks to a group of Good Samaritans who have organized the purchase and installation of 189 air conditioners in CHSLDs and low-income and private apartments across Greater Montreal.
Since the grassroots campaign began in late May, Esperanza had fielded countless calls from elderly and sick seniors desperate to get some relief from the heat.
"One woman has leukemia, one has COPD and another is in a wheelchair," said Esperanza, the project manager. "Many are suffering and said no one cares about them. Some of the stories are heartbreaking."
Others are people like Evelyn, a 92-year-old shut-in from Côte-St-Luc who said the air conditioner has given her a reprieve from the heat.
"The humidity and the heat is very overwhelming - you have a feeling of lassitude," Evelyn said on Monday. "I felt rejuvenated. I am sitting here reading a 600-page book and it's cool and comfortable. It's a godsend."
Montreal businessman Ben Graur came up with the idea of providing air conditioners to seniors during the first heat wave at the end of May.
He feared a repeat of the summer of 2018, when an intense heat wave led to the death of at least 90 vulnerable seniors across the province.
Graur teamed up with Leah Lasry, a financial adviser, and the two eventually raised about $54,000 to buy the units. Graur and Lasry each pledged $10,000 and Lasry spent an additional $5,000 to provide units for 29 single mothers.
Applicants fill out a one-page questionnaire at acforseniors.ca and Esperanza contacts them to make sure they're eligible.
Priority is given to seniors who live in the Greater Montreal region and who have a pre-existing condition that's affected by excess heat.
"They're so grateful - they call back and you can hear the change in their voice," Esperanza said.
About 60 per cent of the air conditioners have been given to people residing in CHSLDs and low-income apartments. The other 40 per cent have been given to seniors who live in private apartments.
When Graur launched his initiative, fewer than one-third of rooms in Quebec's CHSLDs had air conditioning.
As part of his campaign, he emailed Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais saying seniors would not be able to be moved to cooler common areas during the pandemic.
The Quebec government announced last month that it would ensure that there is air conditioning in common areas in all CHSLDs.
"There was a lot of publicity and I think we raised awareness about the problem," Graur said.
The group has spent about $30,000 of the $54,000 raised and said they are seeking donations at acforseniors.ca to continue the service throughout the summer.
Most of the air conditioners have been delivered free of charge by QA Courier. Owner Peter Hansen said it's a worthy cause.
James MacLeod, 72, said he has been sleeping more comfortably since he received his air conditioner about two weeks ago.
"I have it at the foot of my bed," he said. "I'm sitting beside it right now. I will never forget these people. I am so grateful."
The campaign has been a lot of work, but Lasry said it has been worth it.
"We helped all these people," she said. "I can't think of anything more gratifying. "kwilton@postmedia.com

Unbearably hot inside? Go outside, officials say; Leaving sweltering dwellings can be 'life-saving'action

Full text: People who are quarantined at home with COVID-19 are supposed to stay there, say public health authorities - unless their place is unbearably hot, that is.
"The basic idea is, yes, we are asking people to quarantine," said Dr. Maxime Roy, a public-health physician with Montreal's public health department on Monday. But there are people affected by COVID-19 who live in apartments or dwellings with no air conditioning, and when the temperature climbs as high as it has been every day since last Thursday, the heat can be dangerous.
In that event, going to an outdoor space in the shade can be "a life-saving behaviour," he said. "If it's 38 in your apartment and 31 in the shade of a tree, it makes sense to be in the shade of the tree.
"We are balancing two risks here.
I understand we told them to stay home - but if the house caught fire, we would not tell them to stay inside," Roy said.
"They tried cold baths or cold showers. They drank fluids. They have a wet T-shirt on. But it's suffocating inside," he said. "We are not welding their doors shut."
It's important to get outside to cool down - but there's a protocol to follow, he said. People affected by COVID-19 should don a mask before leaving the house, wash their hands after donning it, go only to an outdoor space, say to a park in the shade, and keep two metres of distance between themselves and anyone.
"We are telling them to stay away from people," Roy said.
And as they prepare to re-enter their homes, they should disinfect their hands with an alcohol-based gel before opening a common door or pressing an elevator button. Once back in their apartment, they should remove their mask and immediately wash their hands.
On Monday, Santé Montréal announced that it was "enhancing its intervention" in the face of the extreme heat.
The threshold for declaring a heat alert is when the average maximum temperature reaches 33 C and the average minimum temperature doesn't drop below 20 C for three consecutive days.
Based on analyses of historical data, this run of hot weather "is associated with an excessive number of deaths in the Montreal population," Roy said.
A heat wave in Montreal during the summer of 2018 took the lives of 66 Montrealers.
Older people are more vulnerable to heat, he said, as are small children: Who can forget the tragic stories of children forgotten in cars by distracted parents? Also more vulnerable are those with chronic illnesses, such as heart and lung problems, and people with mental-health problems - particularly those dealing with addiction.
The judgment of people consuming alcohol or other substances is altered - "and that may affect your decision-making, in terms of drinking water and seeking a cool place," Roy said.
Alcohol also has a dehydrating effect. And substance addiction sometimes goes hand in hand with mental-health problems - and medication for mental health-issues can affect the body's thermostat, he said.
"With every extreme heat episode, we observe deaths in people dealing with addiction." sschwartz@postmedia.com

People vulnerable to heat include older adults, individuals with chronic illnesses or mental health problems (including drug or alcohol addiction) and children under four years old.
For health and prevention advice, call Info-Santé at 811. In case of an emergency, call 911.

Full text: People who are quarantined at home with COVID-19 are supposed to stay there, say public health authorities - unless their place is unbearably hot, that is.
"The basic idea is, yes, we are asking people to quarantine," said Dr. Maxime Roy, a public health physician with Montreal's public health department on Monday. But there are people affected by COVID-19 who live in apartments or dwellings with no air conditioning, and when the temperature climbs as high as it has been every day since last Thursday, the heat can be dangerous.
In that event, going to an outdoor space in the shade can be "a lifesaving behaviour," he said. "If it's 38 in your apartment and 31 in the shade of a tree, it makes sense to be in the shade of the tree.
"We are balancing two risks here. I understand we told them to stay home - but if the house caught fire, we would not tell them to stay inside," Roy said.
"They tried cold baths or cold showers. They drank fluids. They have a wet T-shirt on. But it's suffocating inside," he said. "We are not welding their doors shut."
It's important to get outside to cool down - but there's a protocol to follow, he said. People affected by COVID-19 should don a mask before leaving the house, wash their hands after donning it, go only to an outdoor space, say to a park in the shade, and keep two metres of distance between themselves and anyone.
"We are telling them to stay away from people," Roy said.
And as they prepare to re-enter their homes, they should disinfect their hands with an alcohol-based gel before opening a common door or pressing an elevator button. Once back in their apartment, they should remove their mask and immediately wash their hands.
On Monday, Santé Montréal announced that it was "enhancing its intervention" in the face of the extreme heat The threshold for declaring a heat alert is when the average maximum temperature reaches 33 degrees Celsius and the average minimum temperature doesn't drop below 20 degrees C for three consecutive days
Based on analyses of historical data, this run of hot weather "is associated with an excessive number of deaths in the Montreal population," Roy said.
A heat wave in Montreal during the summer of 2018 took the lives of 66 Montrealers
Older people are more vulnerable to heat, he said, as are small children: Who can forget the tragic stories of children forgotten in cars by distracted parents? Also more vulnerable are those with chronic illnesses, such as heart and lung problems, and people with mental-health problems - particularly those dealing with addiction.
The judgment of people consuming alcohol or other substances is altered - "and that may affect your decision-making, in terms of drinking water and seeking a cool place," Roy said.
Alcohol also has a dehydrating effect. And substance addiction sometimes goes hand in hand with mental-health problems - and medication for mental health-issues can affect the body's thermostat, he said.
"With every extreme heat episode, we observe deaths in people dealing with addiction."

Good Samaritans bringing cool comfort to Montreal seniors

Full text: Betty Esperanza took the first phone call at 8:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Over the next 12 hours, she processed 43 requests for air conditioners from vulnerable seniors who were sweltering during the second heat wave to hit Montreal in more than a month.
"The man was 85 and he was having a hard time breathing," Esperanza said. "He said the window only opened a little bit and there was no air circulating. He said he could die there."
After hearing about his health problems, Esperanza promised the man that an air conditioner would be delivered to his CHSLD within 48 hours.
She was able to keep her promise thanks to a group of Good Samaritans who have organized the purchase and installation of 189 air conditioners in CHSLDs and low-income and private apartments across Greater Montreal.
Since the grassroots campaign began in late May, Esperanza had fielded countless calls from elderly and sick seniors desperate to get some relief from the heat.
"One woman has leukemia, one has COPD and another is in a wheelchair," said Esperanza, the project manager. "Many are suffering and said no one cares about them. Some of the stories are heartbreaking."
Others are people like Evelyn, a 92-year-old shut-in from Côte-St-Luc who said the air conditioner has given her a reprieve from the heat.
"The humidity and the heat is very overwhelming - you have a feeling of lassitude," Evelyn said on Monday. "I felt rejuvenated. I am sitting here reading a 600-page book and it's cool and comfortable. It's a godsend."
Montreal businessman Ben Graur came up with the idea of providing air conditioners to seniors during the first heat wave at the end of May.
He feared a repeat of the summer of 2018, when an intense heat wave led to the death of at least 90 vulnerable seniors across the province.
Graur teamed up with Leah Lasry, a financial adviser, and the two eventually raised about $54,000 to buy the units. Graur and Lasry each pledged $10,000 and Lasry spent an additional $5,000 to provide units for 29 single mothers.
Applicants fill out a one-page questionnaire at acforseniors.ca and Esperanza contacts them to make sure they're eligible.
Priority is given to seniors who live in the Greater Montreal region and who have a pre-existing condition that's affected by excess heat.
"They're so grateful - they call back and you can hear the change in their voice," Esperanza said.
About 60 per cent of the air conditioners have been given to people residing in CHSLDs and low-income apartments. The other 40 per cent have been given to seniors who live in private apartments.
When Graur launched his initiative, fewer than one-third of rooms in Quebec's CHSLDs had air conditioning.
As part of his campaign, he emailed Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais saying seniors would not be able to be moved to cooler common areas during the pandemic.
The Quebec government announced last month that it would ensure that there is air conditioning in common areas in all CHSLDs.
"There was a lot of publicity and I think we raised awareness about the problem," Graur said.
The group has spent about $30,000 of the $54,000 raised and said they are seeking donations at acforseniors.ca to continue the service throughout the summer.
Most of the air conditioners have been delivered free of charge by QA Courier. Owner Peter Hansen said it's a worthy cause.
James MacLeod, 72, said he has been sleeping more comfortably since he received his air conditioner about two weeks ago.
"I have it at the foot of my bed," he said. "I'm sitting beside it right now. I will never forget these people. I am so grateful."
The campaign has been a lot of work, but Lasry said it has been worth it.
"We helped all these people," she said. "I can't think of anything more gratifying. "

Full text: With Montreal under a heat warning, public health officials are advising residents to take the necessary precautions.
Temperatures soared above 30 Celsius again on Monday, and the CIUSSS Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal has activated its intervention plan for extreme heat conditions.
The regional health network is setting up air-conditioned areas in health facilities where vulnerable individuals living at home can go to cool off.
"If needed, the Société de transport de Montréal is available to bring those individuals to these cooling-off spots," regional health officials said. "Cool zones are also available for people in health facilities. In the context of the current pandemic, various measures have been put in place to ensure safe access to the zones."
The city of Montreal has also set up public air-conditioned places and opened aquatic facilities and pools for the public.
Health officials also recommend that people isolated at home because of COVID-19 should go outdoors if they don't have air conditioning and it becomes too hot inside their homes or apartments. (But pandemic protocols must be followed such as wearing masks, hand-washing and physical distancing.)
"In the past few days, different measures have gradually been implemented, but the current meteorological conditions require us to boost the intensity of prevention and protection activities in place," said Dr. Mylène Drouin, regional director of public health for Montreal.
André Cantin, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, said temperatures are nearing record levels for June.
On Monday, Montreal reached 34.7 C, beating the previous June 22 record of 32.2 in 1957.
The normal high for Montreal is 24.1 on June 22, but Cantin said the current heat wave has seen sizzling temperatures.
"Sunday it was 33.4, the day before 33.2. Since June 18, we've been averaging 33, except the 19th it was 32.3.
"It's also getting more humid each day," he added. "The humidex index is close to 40 every day."
There is one more day of hot weather forecast for Tuesday before temperatures are expected to level off.
"They should return to more normal temperatures with a high of 26," Cantin said.
He said more hot weather is forecast for next week.
"After a break from Wednesday through Sunday, with temperatures closer to normal, starting next week temperatures will be around 30 for most of the week."
Cantin has some simple but sound advice to beat the heat: "Go in the pool, and drink a lot of water."
Montreal's health and social services network is also asking residents to check in on vulnerable family members and friends, and to call 811 if a person appears to be in distress.
People vulnerable to heat include older adults, individuals with chronic illnesses or mental health problems (including drug or alcohol addiction) and children under four years old.
For health and prevention advice, call Info-Santé at 811. In case of an emergency, call 911.

Full text: People who are quarantined at home with COVID-19 are supposed to stay there, say public health authorities - unless their place is unbearably hot, that is.
"The basic idea is, yes, we are asking people to quarantine," said Dr. Maxime Roy, a public health physician with Montreal's public health department on Monday. But there are people affected by COVID-19 who live in apartments or dwellings with no air conditioning, and when the temperature climbs as high as it has been every day since last Thursday, the heat can be dangerous.

"We are telling them to stay away from people," Roy said.
And as they prepare to re-enter their homes, they should disinfect their hands with an alcohol-based gel before opening a common door or pressing an elevator button. Once back in their apartment, they should remove their mask and immediately wash their hands.
On Monday, Santé Montréal announced that it was "enhancing its intervention" in the face of the extreme heat The threshold for declaring a heat alert is when the average maximum temperature reaches 33 degrees Celsius and the average minimum temperature doesn't drop below 20 degrees C for three consecutive days
Based on analyses of historical data, this run of hot weather "is associated with an excessive number of deaths in the Montreal population," Roy said.
A heat wave in Montreal during the summer of 2018 took the lives of 66 Montrealers
Older people are more vulnerable to heat, he said, as are small children: Who can forget the tragic stories of children forgotten in cars by distracted parents? Also more vulnerable are those with chronic illnesses, such as heart and lung problems, and people with mental-health problems - particularly those dealing with addiction.
The judgment of people consuming alcohol or other substances is altered - "and that may affect your decision-making, in terms of drinking water and seeking a cool place," Roy said.
Alcohol also has a dehydrating effect. And substance addiction sometimes goes hand in hand with mental-health problems - and medication for mental health-issues can affect the body's thermostat, he said.
"With every extreme heat episode, we observe deaths in people dealing with addiction."

Full text: People who are quarantined at home with COVID-19 are supposed to stay there, say public health authorities - unless their place is unbearably hot, that is.
"The basic idea is, yes, we are asking people to quarantine," said Dr. Maxime Roy, a public health physician with Montreal's public health department on Monday. But there are people affected by COVID-19 who live in apartments or dwellings with no air conditioning, and when the temperature climbs as high as it has been every day since last Thursday, the heat can be dangerous.
In that event, going to an outdoor space in the shade can be "a lifesaving behaviour," he said. "If it's 38 in your apartment and 31 in the shade of a tree, it makes sense to be in the shade of the tree.
"We are balancing two risks here. I understand we told them to stay home - but if the house caught fire, we would not tell them to stay inside," Roy said.
"They tried cold baths or cold showers. They drank fluids. They have a wet T-shirt on. But it's suffocating inside," he said. "We are not welding their doors shut."
It's important to get outside to cool down - but there's a protocol to follow, he said. People affected by COVID-19 should don a mask before leaving the house, wash their hands after donning it, go only to an outdoor space, say to a park in the shade, and keep two metres of distance between themselves and anyone.
"We are telling them to stay away from people," Roy said.
And as they prepare to re-enter their homes, they should disinfect their hands with an alcohol-based gel before opening a common door or pressing an elevator button. Once back in their apartment, they should remove their mask and immediately wash their hands.
On Monday, Santé Montréal announced that it was "enhancing its intervention" in the face of the extreme heat The threshold for declaring a heat alert is when the average maximum temperature reaches 33 degrees Celsius and the average minimum temperature doesn't drop below 20 degrees C for three consecutive days
Based on analyses of historical data, this run of hot weather "is associated with an excessive number of deaths in the Montreal population," Roy said.

Full text: With Montreal under a heat warning, public health officials are advising residents to take the necessary precautions.
Temperatures will soar above 30 Celsius again on Monday, and the CIUSSS Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal has activated its intervention plan for extreme heat conditions.
The regional health network is setting up air-conditioned areas in health facilities where vulnerable individuals living at home can come to cool off.
"If needed, the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) is available to bring those individuals to these cooling-off spots," regional health officials said. "Cool zones are also available for people in health facilities. In the context of the current pandemic, various measures have been put in place to ensure safe access to the zones."
The city of Montreal has also set up public air-conditioned places and opened aquatic facilities and pools for the public.
Health officials also recommend that people isolated at home because of COVID-19 should go outdoors if they don't have air conditioning and it becomes too hot inside their homes or apartments. (But pandemic protocols must be followed such as wearing masks, hand-washing and physical distancing.)
Montreal's health and social services network is also asking the citizens to check in on vulnerable family members and friends, and to call 811 if a person appears to be in distress.
People vulnerable to heat include older adults, individuals with chronic illnesses or mental health problems (including drug or alcohol addiction), and children under 4 years old.
For health and prevention advice, call Info-Santé at 811. In case of an emergency, call 911.

Restaurants, pools, gyms: a giant leap amid small steps of Montreal's reopening

Full text: Monday marks the biggest step yet in the slow reopening of the Montreal region, with restaurants now allowed to offer table service, gyms reopening, and indoor gatherings officially permitted in private homes, but public health authorities stress that many COVID-19 restrictions remain in place.
Movie theatres are also allowed to reopen as of Monday, as are day camps and houses of worship.
As of this past weekend, zoos, gardens, agro-tourism farms, tourist information centres and indoor sports facilities were allowed to open. Access to outdoor public exercise equipment and play structures in all public parks is now permitted. Daycares are no longer requiring physical distancing between children or between children and daycare staff. (However, the two-metre distancing rule between adults remains in effect.)
Many restaurateurs were scrambling Sunday, getting their dining rooms and terrasses ready for customers and getting ready to facilitate two-metre distancing between customers who don't live together. A maximum of 10 people is permitted at each table, but diners from different households must sit at least two metres apart - a requirement that greatly reduces seating capacity at most establishments.
Some restaurateurs, including Bruno Zarka, owner and chef of Le Déli du Vieux Port on St-Paul St., were so anxious to finally start seating customers again, they were planning to open their doors at one minute after midnight on Monday.
Zarka has been offering his takeout menu - smoked meat, meatballs, gravlax, salads, burgers, pizza, pasta and, of course, poutine - since May 1, but he estimates sales were down about 90 per cent. He hopes business will pick up this week once he can seat people in the dining room or on his terrasse, which he plans to expand. Distancing rules have forced him to reduce his indoor capacity to 29 customers, down from 45 before the pandemic.
"We've put in some Plexiglas walls to separate all the tables, so we've lost seating (capacity) for about 15 customers," he said.
"We don't know if the customers are going to come back," said Zarka, adding he has only rehired six of his 14 employees. "For example, I hear in Quebec (City) restaurants are empty for the moment, whereas in the Laurentians they are full. So we don't know. ... We are so dependent on tourism, particularly in the Old Port, and everything has been closed."
In the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, Félix Tremblay was making plans to reopen the dining area at his restaurant La Prunelle. Tremblay said the confinement period has forced him and his staff to be creative, coming up with new ideas to keep the business alive.
Early in the pandemic, Tremblay decided to throw open the huge picture windows of his Duluth Ave. restaurant to sell off pantry stock. Bags of flour were particularly popular when everyone was making homemade bread, he said.
Next, he and his staff began offering takeout. "For a while we were the only ones open in the neighbourhood and people really seemed to appreciate it. We started selling street food, stuff that people could eat while out walking, like lobster rolls, crab rolls and shrimp rolls."
He also started selling soft ice cream to go, and lately has been hosting events, bringing in guest chefs from other restaurants, with proceeds going to worthy causes. On Sunday, for example, the chef from the St-Zotique St. restaurant Pumpui was cooking up Thai fare to raise funds for Hoodstock, a Montreal North organization dedicated to fighting systemic inequalities.
Although his dining room will reopen Thursday, Tremblay has decided not to offer table service just yet.
"People will still order from outside, and then they can eat outside or bring their food in to the tables, which we will disinfect between uses," he said. "We decided not to provide table service because we find it difficult to serve wearing masks, safety glasses, etc."
Tremblay is waiting for a permit from the city to open a terrasse. Both he and Zarka said that process has been frustratingly slow.

Public pools opened on the weekend, to the delight of many Montrealers sweating through the second heat wave since the pandemic began.
Sophie Couture, co-ordinator at the Confederation Pool in Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, said roughly 140 people used the pool on Saturday. A maximum of 185 will be allowed into the pool area, down from 560, to facilitate distancing. So far, so good, she said.
"Everyone seemed to understand and tried to keep their distances," Couture said.
As the pool opened Sunday morning, a lineup had formed around the building, with markers indicating where people should stand in order to remain two metres apart. The locker rooms are still closed, so people are asked to shower at home before using the pool. The diving board area is closed, and residents may be asked to cut their pool time short if more than 60 people are waiting.
Joaquin Poundja and Karine Fortin were at the pool with their children, aged five and three. They felt comfortable using the pool and were pleased it had reopened, especially given the heat wave.
"Honestly, I'm not worried about it," Fortin said of using the pool. "As long as everyone respects the recommended distances, I don't see any problem."
The Montreal region had 26,937 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,298 people in the region have died, according to data posted Friday by Montreal public health.

We'll have to make the best of what promises to be a long, hot summer; Quebec deconfining as pandemic drags on, but many favourite pastimes are impossible

Full text: The end of the school year is usually a time of celebration, appreciation and anticipation.
It's a moment for students to pat themselves on the back for a job well done, thank their teachers and look ahead to summer fun.
But this year, as we know, is different. A lot different.
Thanks to COVID-19, the school year was interrupted, and the usual rites of passage, like year-end concerts, proms and graduation ceremonies, were cancelled or severely curtailed. While it was amazing to see how many schools creatively adapted to salvage these precious milestones, like hosting outdoor convocations and conducting online musical performances, the end of the 2020 school year is like no other.
And now it's time to move on to a summer like no other.
Although Quebec is finally deconfining after three long months - with the number of new COVID-19 cases declining and many activities resuming - life has not returned to normal. Many of our favourite summer pastimes are impossible this year, like sleepaway camp or international travel.
Many people will be staycationing, enjoying summer in their own backyards or on balconville. But even those escaping Montreal will likely be sticking close to home - either going to their chalets, if they're lucky enough to own one, renting a cottage, if they were lucky enough to snag one, camping or maybe touring in an RV.
For those staying put, day camps are allowed, but many decided not to operate because the government's initial social-distancing requirements and staff ratios made no sense. By the time Quebec eased the restrictions, it was too late for many to get up and running.
The list of organizations that have decided not to run day camps ranges from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts to many municipalities in the West Island. (All three of the ones my daughter was signed up for cancelled.)
Many groups are launching online sessions, to allow kids to pursue extracurricular interests like music and drama. This will help parents fill the void while working from home and trying to keep the kids occupied. But after months of virtual socializing and distance learning, kids could desperately use a break from screens.
So bring on the boredom. Many experts believe we should let kids get bored, that we shouldn't rush to fill their days with scheduled activities, that we should let them explore, invent, imagine and dream. There's something to be said for this philosophy in normal times. But kids have been without structure for months. Allowing them to be bored now would just prolong the agony, rather than offer respite from the usual frenzied pace of life.
Also, revelling in idleness works better when you have a backyard. Many urban children, including the most vulnerable, don't have private space to play outside. The city of Montreal has gone to great lengths to create pedestrian corridors and cycling routes, family streets and superblocks, to give people the elbow room they need to spend time outdoors safely.
Also, libraries are resuming services. Playgrounds are usable again, and to the great relief of all, splash pads and pools opened just in time for the heat wave.
The only problem is, these amenities are in such hot demand, kids have to practise patience. Social-distancing measures still apply, meaning long lineups to swim or run through the waterworks.
Sports are ramping up again, including soccer and baseball. But there won't be any actual games, just practice sessions. At least it will mean some physical activity.
As for entertainment, there won't be any festivals, concerts or fireworks displays - nothing that draws a crowd. After all, we're still on high alert for a resurgence or a second wave of the pandemic.
In a winter city that savours its summers, Montrealers will just have to make the best of what promises to be a long, hot summer. But much of the usual excitement has been tempered by uncertainty. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: The end of the school year is usually a time of celebration, appreciation and anticipation.
It's a moment for students to pat themselves on the back for a job well done, thank their teachers and look ahead to summer fun.
But this year, as we know, is different. A lot different.
Thanks to COVID-19, the school year was interrupted, and the usual rites of passage, like year-end concerts, proms and graduation ceremonies, were cancelled or severely curtailed. While it was amazing to see how many schools creatively adapted to salvage these precious milestones, like hosting outdoor convocations and conducting online musical performances, the end of the 2020 school year is like no other.
And now it's time to move on to a summer like no other.
Although Quebec is finally deconfining after three long months - with the number of new COVID-19 cases declining and many activities resuming - life has not returned to normal. Many of our favourite summer pastimes are impossible this year, like sleepaway camp or international travel.
Many people will be staycationing, enjoying summer in their own backyards or on balconville. But even those escaping Montreal will likely be sticking close to home - either going to their chalets, if they're lucky enough to own one, renting a cottage, if they were lucky enough to snag one, camping or maybe touring in an RV.
For those staying put, day camps are allowed, but many decided not to operate because the government's initial social distancing requirements and staff ratios made no sense. By the time Quebec eased the restrictions, it was too late for many to get up and running.
The list of organizations that have decided not to run day camps ranges from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts to many municipalities in the West Island (All three of the ones my daughter was signed up for cancelled.)
Many groups are launching online sessions, to allow kids to pursue extracurricular interests like music and drama. This will help parents fill the void while working from home and trying to keep the kids occupied. But after months of virtual socializing and distance learning, kids could desperately use a break from screens.
So bring on the boredom.
Many experts believe we should let kids get bored, that we shouldn't rush to fill their days with scheduled activities, that we should let them explore, invent, imagine and dream. There's something to be said for this philosophy in normal times. But kids have been without structure for months. Allowing them to be bored now would just prolong the agony, rather than offer respite from the usual frenzied pace of life.
Also, revelling in idleness works better when you have a backyard. Many urban children, including the most vulnerable, don't have private space to play outside. The city of Montreal has gone to great lengths to create pedestrian corridors and cycling routes, family streets and superblocks, to give people the elbow room they need to spend time outdoors safely.
Also, libraries are resuming services. Playgrounds are usable again, and to the great relief of all, splash pads and pools opened just in time for the heat wave.
The only problem is, these amenities are in such hot demand, kids have to practise patience. Social-distancing measures still apply, meaning long lineups to swim or run through the waterworks.
Sports are ramping up again, including soccer and baseball. But there won't be any actual games, just practice sessions. At least it will mean some physical activity.
As for entertainment, there won't be any festivals, concerts or fireworks displays - nothing that draws a crowd. After all, we're still on high alert for a resurgence or a second wave of the pandemic.
In a winter city that savours its summers, Montrealers will just have to make the best of what promises to be a long, hot summer. But much of the usual excitement has been tempered by uncertainty.

Measures will be taken to ensure that visitors comply with health guidelines on preventing the spread of COVID-19, the paramunicipal organization said in a statement.
Changing rooms will not be accessible, which means swimmers will have to arrive at the park wearing their swimsuits. Physical distancing measures will be implemented. At the Aquatic Complex, only the large recreational pool will be open.

Full text: Just in time for the latest heat wave, city of Montreal pools start gradually reopening on Saturday.
But the experience will be different due to public-health directives related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Physical-distancing measures are in place and pools may impose restrictions on the number of people allowed in at any given time, the city says.
Some boroughs may also restrict how long people are allowed to stay.
Washrooms are open but changing rooms are closed. Some boroughs may not allow access to shower areas.
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms or who is in voluntary or obligatory isolation is barred from using pools.

Some splash pads and wading pools had previously opened
The city of Montreal has posted an interactive map showing locations of pools, wading pools and splash pads, as well as their operating hours.
For more information on pool rules, visit this page on the city of Montreal website.
Environment Canada says the hot weather - humidex values near 40 - is expected to linger for several more days
Quebec's health department says people can protect themselves from the heat by:
Drinking six to eight glasses of water per day.
Avoiding alcohol.
When possible, spending at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places.
Taking at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cooling skin several times per day with wet towels.
Limiting physical activities.
Wearing light clothes.
It also advises the public to never leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle, even for a short period - and to check in on loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.
More tips: It may seem, counterproductive but keeping windows shut is advised because open windows allow heat in. Shades and blinds can help keep sunlight and heat out. When the temperature drops at night, re-open windows and to let in cooler air in, although there will not be much relief in the next couple of days, even at night. The low tonight is expected to be 22 C. The evening temperature is expected to drop to 17 or 18 C by Thursday.
Cool washcloths around the neck are helpful and you might even consider putting sheets in a fridge or freezer for help getting to sleep.

Full text: Just in time for the latest heat wave, city of Montreal pools start gradually reopening on Saturday.
But the experience will be different due to public-health directives related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Physical-distancing measures are in place and pools may impose restrictions on the number of people allowed in at any given time, the city says.
Some boroughs may also restrict how long people are allowed to stay.
Washrooms are open but changing rooms are closed. Some boroughs may not allow access to shower areas.
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms or who is in voluntary or obligatory isolation is barred from using pools.
Some splash pads and wading pools had previously opened
The city of Montreal has posted an interactive map showing locations of pools, wading pools and splash pads, as well as their operating hours.
For more information on pool rules, visit this page on the city of Montreal website.
Environment Canada says the hot weather - humidex values near 40 - is expected to linger for several more days
Quebec's health department says people can protect themselves from the heat by:
Drinking six to eight glasses of water per day.
Avoiding alcohol.
When possible, spending at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places.
Taking at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cooling skin several times per day with wet towels.
Limiting physical activities.
Wearing light clothes.
It also advises the public to never leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle, even for a short period - and to check in on loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.

Quebec gives cautious OK to pool openings; But it's crucial to maintain physical distancing, says health minister

Full text: Municipalities across Quebec were given the go-ahead on Saturday to open public pools during the summer despite the COVID-19 pandemic, provided people maintain physical distancing of two metres and wash their hands with soap and water before entering the facilities.
"The precautions that we've taken since the start of the crisis should not make us lose sight of the other essential health needs of our citizens, especially during hot weather," Health Minister Danielle McCann said in a statement.
"That is why opening these summer facilities is so necessary to ensure the comfort (in hot weather) of many people. Still, it's crucial to remain vigilant, maintain physical distancing and take other measures to limit the spread of the virus in the community."
Among the facilities that are authorized to open are public pools, wading pools and splash pads, which allow children to play in running water and spray their friends without the supervision of lifeguards. On Wednesday, the city of Montreal opened splash pads early to beat the heat wave.
City crews are also permitted to open water fountains, but the public is not encouraged to drink from them directly. People are being asked to bring water bottles to fill at the fountains.
The joint news release by Mc-Cann and Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest did not allude to private aquatic parks, which are often filled with thousands of people - environments where physical distancing is harder to maintain. Alexandre Lahaie, McCann's press attaché, said the government has not authorized the opening of such aquatic parks.
The government is also encouraging municipalities to clean their facilities more frequently, especially the push buttons of water fountains.
Saturday's announcement came as the government reported the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 68 to 1,197 - a sign the strict confinement measures put into place during the 11-week-old lockdown are beginning to pay off.
Laforest suggested had the government not authorized the use of public pools during the coronavirus crisis, more people would have suffered from heat exhaustion during the summer.
Saturday's announcement would appear to be creating a double standard: continuing to limit public gatherings outside of pools to 10 people, while potentially allowing bigger crowds in swimming facilities.
Some city pools are usually packed with hundreds of children and teens during the summer. It's often a challenge for lifeguards to warn children not to run around the pool. It was not clear from Saturday's announcement whether lifeguards will also be responsible for enforcing social distancing.
Geneviève Jutras, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante's press attaché, hinted that the city may have to hire more staff. She said the boroughs will reopen their public pools gradually, starting on June 20.
"This gradual opening of swimming pools will be based on the capacity to hire the necessary staff in each district to implement a public health protocol," Jutras added. "As for the hiring of lifeguards, that process was launched in February."
Health experts have noted the coronavirus is spread through the air, and not through water. Still, authorities are recommending the following precautions:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially when coming in from outside.
Keep a distance of two metres from other people. If that is not possible, wear a face covering.
Avoid indoor gatherings.

Heat amplifies nursing-home concerns

Full text: Families left portable fans for their parents at the doorsteps of nursing homes. Dehydrated medical workers staggered under their protective gear. Health officials scrambled to install air conditioners and worried about whether ventilation systems could spread the coronavirus.
The first week of the year with sweltering weather added to the misery in seniors' homes in Ontario and Quebec, underlining another weakness in the elder-care system: aging buildings without appropriate cooling equipment.
Past heat waves have been lethal in Quebec, with more than 90 dying two years ago, and there are concerns that the pandemic will make things worse this year for carehomes' residents and those without home cooling.
One man who is volunteering in several Montreal seniors' homes said the recent spell of hot weather had already caused a strain for residents and employees. Staffers became tired more quickly, moved more slowly and had to be careful not to drip sweat as they fed residents, the man said.
The Globe and Mail is not publishing the man's name because he is not authorized to speak with the media.
Conditions were also challenging in Ontario.
Jane Meadus, a lawyer with the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly legal clinic in Toronto, said the province's most recent design standards for new long-term care homes, last updated in 2015, still do not require rooms to be air conditioned, only common areas.
"I have been in rooms in new homes on a hot day, which is 30-plus, and I couldn't stand it," said Ms. Meadus, who fears many long-term care homes are now left without options if a heat wave strikes. "The plan [on hot days] is to take 40 people and stick them in the lounge, which is not something you are going to do, because of COVID."
The toll of hot weather on long-term care residents in Ontario will be harder to discern, as the province does not properly track heat deaths, she said.
Outside elder-care facilities, the pandemic is also challenging for people without home air conditioning while shopping malls, cinemas and swimming pools are still shuttered.
As temperatures spiked in Toronto early last week, municipal officials opened six temporary emergency cooling centres in community recreation facilities. The city stressed the spaces were meant as a "last resort," and pledged to release a broader strategy, adapted for the pandemic, for future heat waves.
The centres looked like classrooms, offering visitors only a chair, a bottle of water and a plea from the city to keep their stay short, said Cathy Crowe, a nurse and longtime advocate for Toronto's homeless.
"Imagine if you made your way all the way down there and you just get to sit there for half an hour."
City Councillor Joe Cressy, chairman of Toronto's board of health, said the city knows it has to do more as more hot weather approaches.
"COVID-19 has exposed and is taking advantage of our existing inequalities and failures as a society."
In Quebec, the government was on the defensive after Luc Despatie, the owner of an air-conditioning company, told Quebec media that he tried unsuccessfully in early April to warn health officials of the impending heat problem.
Premier François Legault and his ministers said Mr. Despatie didn't get a response because nursing homes are locked down and there were no public-health guidelines on the use of cooling equipment during the pandemic.
"We had no expert opinion, we didn't have approval from public health, we didn't know if the virus could be spread through ventilation systems," Minister for Elders Marguerite Blais said in the legislature Wednesday.
That afternoon, it was 35 C in Montreal, with a humidex reaching 40 C.
Some patients were in tears because of the heat, orderly Boguslawa Solski told Le Journal de Montréal as she headed in for her shift at the city's Grace Dart extended care centre.
The AQRP, an association of retired Quebec public servants, has long raised concerns before about the lack of cooling equipment in seniors' homes. "It's a recurring problem.
Governments come and go and the problems of elderly people isn't their main concern," AQRP president Rose-Mary Thonney said in an interview.
Only a third of long-term care rooms in Quebec have air conditioning, according to government data AQRP obtained through the access to information law.
Mr. Legault said nearly all Quebec care homes now have at least a common area with air conditioning. "Of course, we didn't expect at the time there would be COVID-19," he acknowledged.
"We got caught unawares. A heat wave in May is not very common," Health Minister Danielle McCann said last week, explaining that the government only expected to deal with the issue in June.
The Quebec National Public Health Institute said there was little literature about COVID-19 contagion from portable air conditioners or fans, but warned that "these devices can be hazardous due to the possibility of dispersion of airborne micro-organisms."
It said the air flow should be aimed away from residents' faces and exit doors, to avoid scattering infected droplets.

Full text: Municipalities across Quebec were given the go-ahead on Saturday to open public pools during the summer despite the COVID-19 pandemic, provided people maintain physical distancing of two metres and wash their hands with soap and water before entering the facilities.
"The precautions that we've taken since the start of the crisis should not make us lose sight of the other essential health needs of our citizens, especially during hot weather," Health Minister Danielle McCann said in a statement.
"That is why opening these summer facilities is so necessary to ensure the comfort (in hot weather) of many people. Still, it's crucial to remain vigilant, maintain physical distancing and take other measures to limit the spread of the virus in the community."
Among the facilities that are authorized to open are public pools, wading pools and splash pads, which allow children to play in running water and spray their friends without the supervision of lifeguards. On Wednesday, the city of Montreal opened splash pads early to beat the heat wave
City crews are also permitted to open water fountains, but the public is not encouraged to drink from them directly. People are being asked to bring water bottles to fill at the fountains.
The joint news release by McCann and Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest did not allude to private aquatic parks, which are often filled with thousands of people - environments where physical distancing is harder to maintain. Alexandre Lahaie, McCann's press attaché, said the government has not authorized the opening of such aquatic parks.
The government is also encouraging municipalities to clean their facilities more frequently, especially the push buttons of water fountains.
Saturday's announcement came as the government reported the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 68 to 1,197 - a sign the strict confinement measures put into place during the 11-week-old lockdown are beginning to pay off.
Laforest suggested had the government not authorized the use of public pools during the coronavirus crisis, more people would have suffered from heat exhaustion during the summer.
Saturday's announcement would appear to be creating a double standard: continuing to limit public gatherings outside of pools to 10 people, while potentially allowing bigger crowds in swimming facilities.
Some city pools are usually packed with hundreds of children and teens during the summer. It's often a challenge for lifeguards to warn children not to run around the pool. It was not clear from Saturday's announcement whether lifeguards will also be responsible for enforcing social distancing.
City officials were not immediately available to comment.
Health experts have noted the coronavirus is spread through the air, and not through water. Still, authorities are recommending the following precautions:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially when coming in from outside.
Keep a distance of two metres from other people. If that is not possible, wear a face covering.
Avoid indoor gatherings.
Cough into your elbow.

When given the green light, will West Island outdoor pools open this summer?

Full text: When and how a cool dip in a public pool will be possible this summer remains to be seen.
Quebec has yet to announce when its continuing relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions will allow for the opening of public pools and with what regulations in place.
How risky is it to swim in a public pool during a pandemic?
Jewish General Hospital medical microbiologist Dr. Leighanne Parkes told the Montreal Gazette the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 while swimming in a pool is very low because infectious droplets would be immediately be diluted. However, distancing must be maintained to avoid ending up within someone's spit radius and there should be no sharing of pool equipment.
A number of municipalities are waiting for public health details and government directives before making a decision.
The city of Montreal said all swimming pools and wading pools are closed until it receives new government directives, although many of the city's splash pads opened in time to offer some relief during this week's heat wave
In the West Island, Kirkland announced "constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic" resulted in its decision to not open Ecclestone Pool this summer.
Senneville has gone in another direction. Mayor Julie Brisebois said the pool is being prepared for an eventual opening. COVID-19 safety measures will include limiting the number of people in the pool so distancing measures can be enforced and residents will reserve a time slot to use the pool. All aquatic classes are cancelled.
Earlier this month, the Association of Lakeshore Pools announced all aquatic competitions will be cancelled because of the pandemic. ALPS has 22 member pools in the West Island, LaSalle, Hudson and Pincourt.
Pointe-Claire has not made a decision about opening either its splash pad or its pools. (However, it did announce this week its day camp has been cancelled.)
Dollard-des-Ormeaux Mayor Alex Bottausci said the opening of its splash pads and pools remains under review.
"It's easier not to open," he said in an email. "It's harder to open and actually provide a service to the community that is needed."
Dorval's splash pad at Walters Park is open, but the city is waiting for word from the government and public health before moving forward with opening its pools and aquatic and sports facility.
Beaconsfield director general Patrice Boileau said the city had heard pool capacity could be reduced up to 70 per cent, which would make it financially difficult for Beaconsfield's four community pools to operate. He said once the rules are clear, the various pool boards would meet to discuss options and then meet with the city.
The CRLO-WLRC pool in Lachine is waiting for the government green light and a decision by borough council on financial aid before making a decision. Dixie Pool in western Lachine said it has not made a decision on whether to open the pool, but it would follow all COVID-19 restrictions.
Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa said the plan is to open the pool, but the town is still studying how it can be done safely. Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting measures will be put in place.
The Baie-D'Urfé Acquatic Club is waiting for the government announcement. Like other pools in the West Island, it has sent a survey to members asking about their concerns and whether they would use the pool if it opens this season.
Off island, Pincourt's splash pad is open, but pools in both Pincourt and Hudson are closed until further notice.

Full text: Families left portable fans for their parents at the doorsteps of nursing homes. Dehydrated medical workers staggered under their protective gear. Health officials scrambled to install air conditioners and worried about whether ventilation systems could spread the coronavirus.
The first week of the year with sweltering weather has added to the misery in seniors' homes in Ontario and Quebec, underlining another weakness in the elder-care system: aging buildings without appropriate cooling equipment.
Past heat waves have been lethal in Quebec, with more than 90 dying two years ago, and there are concerns that the pandemic will make things worse this year for care-homes residents and those without home cooling.
One man who is volunteering in several Montreal seniors' homes said the recent spell of hot weather was already causing a strain for residents and employees. Staffers became tired more quickly, moved more slowly and had to be careful not to drip sweat as they fed residents, the man said.
The Globe is not publishing the man's name because he is not authorized to speak with the media.
In some homes, only those who are not infected can go to a cooler common room, the man said. He added that, in any case, the common rooms have an underpowered air-conditioning unit that just lowers the temperature a little.
Donning a protective gown felt like wearing a plastic bag, he said. He also had to deal with sweat trickling from his face shield.
Conditions were also challenging in Ontario. Jane Meadus, a lawyer with the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly legal clinic in Toronto, said the province's most recent design standards for new long-term care homes, last updated in 2015, still do not require rooms to be air conditioned, only common areas.
"I have been in rooms in new homes on a hot day, which is 30-plus, and I couldn't stand it," said Ms. Meadus, who fears many long-term care homes are now left without options if a heat wave strikes. "The plan [on hot days] is to take 40 people and stick them in the lounge, which is not something you are going to do, because of COVID."
The toll of hot weather on long-term care residents in Ontario will be harder to discern, as the province does not properly track heat deaths, she said.
Outside elder-care facilities, the pandemic is also challenging for people without home air conditioning while shopping malls, cinemas and swimming pools are still shuttered.
As temperatures spiked in Toronto earlier this week, municipal officials opened six temporary emergency cooling centres in community recreation facilities. The city stressed the spaces were meant as a "last resort," and pledged to release a broader strategy, adapted for the pandemic, for future heat waves.
The centres looked like classrooms, offering visitors only a chair, a bottle of water and a plea from the city to keep their stay short, said Cathy Crowe, a nurse and long-time advocate for Toronto's homeless. "Imagine if you made your way all the way down there and you just get to sit there for half an hour."
City Councillor Joe Cressy, chairman of Toronto's board of health, said the city knows it has to do more as more hot weather approaches. "COVID-19 has exposed and is taking advantage of our existing inequalities and failures as a society."
In Quebec, the government has been on the defensive after Luc Despatie, the owner of an air-conditioning company, told Quebec media that he tried unsuccessfully in early April to warn health officials of the impending heat problem.
Premier François Legault and his ministers said Mr. Despatie didn't get a response because nursing homes are locked down and there were no public-health guidelines on the use of cooling equipment during the pandemic.
"We had no expert opinion, we didn't have approval from Public Health, we didn't know if the virus could be spread through ventilation systems," Minister for Elders Marguerite Blais said in the legislature Wednesday.
That afternoon, it was 35 C in Montreal, with a humidex reaching 40 C.
Some patients were in tears because of the heat, orderly Boguslawa Solski told Le Journal de Montréal as she headed in for her shift at the city's Grace Dart extended care centre.
The AQRP, an association of retired Quebec public servants, has long raised concerns before about the lack of cooling equipment in seniors' homes. "It's a recurring problem. Governments come and go and the problems of elderly people isn't their main concern," AQRP president Rose-Mary Thonney said in an interview.
Only a third of long-term care rooms in Quebec have air conditioning, according to government data AQRP obtained through access-to-information law.
Mr. Legault said nearly all Quebec care homes now have at least a common area with air conditioning. "Of course, we didn't expect at the time there would be COVID-19," he acknowledged.
"We got caught unawares. A heat wave in May is not very common," Health Minister Danielle McCann said Monday, explaining that the government only expected to deal with the issue in June.
The Quebec National Public Health Institute said there was little literature about COVID-19 contagion from portable air conditioners or fans, but warned that "these devices can be hazardous due to the possibility of dispersion of airborne micro-organisms."
It said the air flow should be aimed away from residents' faces and exit doors, to avoid scattering infected droplets.

Full text: Here's what happened as the heat wave continued into the night.
Two new reports allege health and safety rules weren't followed at two of Montreal's hardest-hit seniors' residences A report prepared by Quebec's workplace safety board (CNESST) criticizes the CHSLD Vigi Dollard des Ormeaux for allowing staff to move between its so-called hot and cold zones without following the proper protocols. More than 60 people died of COVID-19 at the West Island seniors' residence. The other report, prepared by the Canadian Armed Forces, alleges staff at the Vigi Mont Royal did not follow rules designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus while its members were assigned there. According to the most recent information supplied by the minister of health and social services, 74 residents at the CHSLD died of COVID-19.
Valérie Plante says Montreal is working hard to find affordable housing for those who must move this summer "It is very important not to leave anyone behind," she said. Finding affordable rental housing in a market in which the vacancy rate is only about 1.5 per cent is challenging at the best of times - and the COVID-19 pandemic has made the experience even more stressful, Plante said. Eighty per cent of Quebec's residential leases expire on June 30 and 80,000 to 100,000 Montrealers will be moving on or around July 1. Anyone worried about finding affordable housing should call 311 and consider it a port of entry, Plante said.
West Island residents are being encouraged to grow vegetables to help food banks West Island Community Shares (WICS) is supporting the initiative through its Solidarity Fund, and Sophie McCann, executive director of WICS, is counting on West Islanders to "grow a row" of veggies in their own backyards to support a worthy cause. "If you're used to growing a vegetable garden, then grow an extra row and give that row of produce back to the food banks," McCann said.The goal of Solidarity Gardens is to help provide fresh produce for 750 West Island families who use food banks on a monthly basis.

Enjoy summer, but heed dark cloud; Though blue skies beckon, experts warn that a second wave of COVID-19 looms

Full text: Campgrounds have the green light to welcome visitors as of next week, the government announced Wednesday - the latest sign that Quebec is gradually returning to some semblance of normalcy just in time for summer.
Splash pads in Montreal were mercifully switched on to help city kids cool off during the first heat wave of the season.
Retail stores opened their doors for the first time in months Monday and eager shoppers came out in force, despite having to line up and keep their distance.
Last weekend, backyard barbecues and park meetups were allowed to resume - provided everyone keeps two metres apart and no more than 10 people from three households are present at any one gathering.
Golf courses are back in business. Tennis courts are occupied. The sun is out. The good times are ready to roll. Or so it seems.
Though blue skies beckon, they are also deceiving. There is a dark cloud on the not-so-distant horizon, and it is the second wave of COVID-19.
Preparations are already underway for Round 2 of the pandemic, Health Minister Danielle McCann acknowledged Wednesday. This means shoring up the health system, especially seniors'centres, where there is still a critical shortage of staff. An influenza vaccination campaign is in the works, to prevent a double whammy of COVID-19 and ordinary flu infections that could overwhelm hospitals and lead to confusion about symptoms.
And medical professionals, particularly nurses, must get two weeks off sometime this summer so they can rest up for a second wave, McCann said. (Which doesn't seem like much. Exhausted nurses were already protesting across Quebec Wednesday, saying they've been denied holidays or time off since March and are "dead tired.") Surveys sent home to parents suggest planning is taking place now for a new school year where social-distancing measures remain in place in September and classroom learning is likely to be suspended again at some point.
We are emerging from isolation, but we're not going back to the way things were before, Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda warned for the umpteenth time.
Acknowledging he may sound like a killjoy, Arruda said he understands people being excited to hang out with friends or go to a beach after a difficult spring of being cloistered. But we need to remain on guard. The precious privileges we have just been granted could be taken away if we fail to follow the rules of staying two metres apart, handwashing and mask-wearing, causing a surge of new COVID-19 cases.
"I will be the most disappointed if I have to recommend to the premier that we start closing things again," Arruda said, sounding like a permissive father offering us restless teenagers some freedom while trusting us to behave responsibly.
In dense Montreal, especially, the situation is improving but delicate. Community transmission seems to be on the wane, even in hot zones, but Arruda said even if 10 per cent of the public starts ignoring social-distancing directives, we could undermine all the sacrifices we have made in the last 2½ months and find ourselves on the verge of reconfinement.
The question is not so much if a second wave of COVID-19 is coming, but when. Until we have a vaccine or at least an effective treatment, this virus will be with us for some time and we must learn to live with it. Many experts expect the second round of the pandemic will hit sometime in the fall, perhaps coinciding with cold and flu season. But we could bring it on sooner if we throw caution to the wind and get carried away with our summer activities.
We will all be the big losers if we don't follow public-health instructions and the summer reprieve we have all been craving gets called off abruptly.
So get out there, grab a golf club, pitch a tent, call your friends. But please enjoy responsibly. ahanes@postmedia.com

Grassroots group buying air conditioners for CHSLDs; As temperatures rise, organizers won't wait for government to provide relief

Full text: Ben Graur was thinking about the horrific living conditions in seniors'residences during the COVID-19 pandemic when his mind harked back to the summer of 2018.
That July, an intense heat wave led to the death of at least 90 vulnerable seniors across the province.
With summer fast approaching, Graur feared that another heat wave - like the one this week - could result in more deaths in long-term care residences.
So last Friday, Graur spent $1,600 to buy four air conditioners that he plans to donate to CHSLDs.
"I'm a concerned citizen and there was nothing in the news about how we are going to protect seniors from the heat," said Graur, a businessman who lives in Dollard-des-Ormeaux.
Graur was worried the COVID-19 crisis would prevent staff from moving seniors to common areas that have air-conditioning units and feared they'd be left to swelter in their rooms. He has taken the initiative to start a grassroots campaign to provide air conditioners to as many seniors as possible, requesting help from family and friends and spreading the news on community Facebook pages in D.D.O. and Côte-St-Luc.
Graur then sought out Montreal businesswoman Leah Lasry, and within 24 hours they had raised at least $40,000.
"Forty-thousand dollars buys a lot of air conditioners," said Lasry, who has pledged $10,000 and has persuaded friends to do the same.
Graur is also planning to raise $10,000 and would like municipal, provincial and federal governments to help out.
Lasry knows the provincial health department is responsible for keeping seniors'residences cool, but said they can't depend on the government to act quickly. Less than one-third of rooms in Quebec's CHSLDs have air conditioning.
"I have learned that when you want to get something done, you have to do it yourself," said Lasry, who spearheaded a campaign last year to block the demolition of apartment buildings in Hampstead.
"Every air conditioner we place and every senior that gets relief in a heat wave like this will make a difference."
Air conditioners will be donated to seniors over 65 who live in a CHSLD or a private residence. Anyone with a severe health condition, like multiple sclerosis, can also apply. Applicants will have to fill out a one-page questionnaire at acforseniors.com.
"If you qualify, we will contact you and put in the air conditioner," Lasry said.
Seniors is CHSLDs and other residences must have permission from administrators to have a unit installed.
Extreme heat can be fatal for vulnerable seniors, Montreal's public health director Mylène Drouin said Tuesday when asked whether using air-conditioning units could spread the novel coronavirus in residences.
"(The heat) is an immediate risk that we judged prevailed when compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19," she added.
Lasry said that news reports of the appalling conditions in many residences, such as seniors being left in soiled diapers, have encouraged the campaign to make seniors more comfortable on sweltering summer days.
"We are going to do this one air conditioner at a time," she said. kwilton@postmedia.com

Legault puts focus on recruitment; Quebec to launch campaign aiming to boost staffing at seniors'homes by 10,000

Full text: QUEBEC Unable to shake its chronic labour problem, Quebec plans to launch a massive recruitment campaign to permanently fill vacant orderly positions in its CHSLD network.
But in the meantime, the province will continue cobbling together COVID-19 solutions, including making more use of Canadian Armed Forces personnel already lending a hand, Premier François Legault announced at his pandemic briefing Wednesday.
Legault made the remarks on the same day as Quebec continued with deconfinement announcements.
This time the government has authorized the reopening of hundreds of provincial campgrounds, outfitter lodges, marinas and summer cottages, starting Monday.
In the case of cottages, they have to be rented by one household unit or people who normally live together under one roof at a time, with a 24-hour gap between each group. Smaller chalets will have to be disinfected between customers.
Groups of friends can go camping together, but they will have to rent separate sites to ensure each group sleeps in different tents.
Auberges, motels and homes offered for rent will open outside of the greater Montreal and Joliette regions.
There are no real limits on inter-regional travel, which means a Montreal family suffering from the city heat could rent a cottage in another region. People have to limit their stops along the way, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said at a news conference.
"It's good news for vacationers and tourism businesses alike," Proulx said, conceding the rules are not exactly conducive for that 12-hour trip with the kids around the Gaspé coast.
The most well-off will be owners of recreational vehicles, which have their own sanitary facilities.
But the camping decision - which followed enormous pressure from ordinary Quebecers desperate for something to do this summer - was the only glimmer of good news Wednesday as the government continued to wrestle with labour issues in its CHSLD network and the fact many are not air-conditioned during the current heat wave.
A report issued by the Canadian Armed Forces based on their first-hand experience helping in the network highlighted the flaws in the system, from a lack of fulltime trained workers to shortages in protective equipment and deficient infection-control procedures.
More than 60 per cent of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have taken place in the centres.
Reacting to the report, Legault said he did not learn much that he did not know already, but he noted it's hard to apply specific directives with so many new, under-trained, part-time personnel.
Legault thanked the soldiers - there are 1,000 on the front lines in 25 residences - for their work. He then announced he has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to extend the mandate of the army in Quebec until Sept. 15.
In short, Quebec wants to make use of the extra hands until it is able to train more orderlies to take up the job.
"We hope, if it happens, that the second wave (of the virus) is not before Sept. 15," Legault said.
But later in Ottawa, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said it won't be possible to deploy troops in Quebec for another four months.
"We will not be able to go that duration just because we don't have the number of personnel," Sajjan said. "When you have our people working seven days a week, it's just not sustainable."
Legault, nevertheless, announced fresh plans to launch a massive recruitment campaign in the hopes of convincing 10,000 Quebecers to become orderlies in centres.
Quebec will offer three months of paid training to anyone interested in working in the field. The students will be paid $21 an hour, or $760 a week. If they are successful and get hired, their salaries will rise to $26 an hour, or $940 a week.
That would be the equivalent of $49,000 a year.
"I ask every Quebecer who can, to consider it seriously," Legault said. "We're talking about a rewarding job, which can make a real difference in people's lives."
Legault recognized recruiting 10,000 more people is a challenge - he has failed in the past - but said he hopes to convince some of the 10,000 temporary workers Quebec managed to recruit to stay.
"We may ask employees of the government to go and work in the CHSLDs for a few months," the premier added when asked what happens if the recruitment fails.
The government also responded to accusations by the opposition parties that it failed to foresee the current heat wave, which is making life miserable in CHSLDs.
Legault said a month ago that health officials did not want to take the risk of having workers enter the residences. It was also unclear whether air conditioners would spread the virus. pauthier@postmedia.com Twitter.com/philipauthier

Full text: Ben Graur was thinking about the horrific living conditions in seniors' residences during the COVID-19 pandemic when his mind harked back to the summer of 2018.
That July, an intense heat wave led to the death of at least 90 vulnerable seniors across the province.
With summer fast approaching, Graur feared that another heat wave - like the one this week - could result in more deaths in long-term care residences.
So last Friday, Graur spent $1,600 to buy four air conditioners that he plans to donate to CHSLDs.
"I'm a concerned citizen and there was nothing in the news about how we are going to protect seniors from the heat," said Graur, a businessman who lives in Dollard-des-Ormeaux.
Graur was worried the COVID-19 crisis would prevent staff from moving seniors to common areas that have air-conditioning units and feared they'd be left to swelter in their rooms. He has taken the initiative to start a grassroots campaign to provide air conditioners to as many seniors as possible, requesting help from family and friends and spreading the news on community Facebook pages in D.D.O. and Côte-St-Luc.
Graur then sought out Montreal businesswoman Leah Lasry, and within 24 hours they had raised at least $40,000.
"Forty-thousand dollars buys a lot of air conditioners," said Lasry, who has pledged $10,000 and has persuaded friends to do the same.
Graur is also planning to raise $10,000 and would like municipal, provincial and federal governments to help out.
Lasry knows the provincial health department is responsible to keep seniors' residences cool, but said they can't depend on the government to act quickly. Less than one-third of rooms in Quebec's CHSLDs have air conditioning.
"I have learned that when you want to get something done, you have to do it yourself," said Lasry, who spearheaded a campaign last year to block the demolition of apartment buildings in Hampstead. "Every air conditioner we place and every senior that gets relief in a heat wave like this will make a difference."
Air conditioners will be donated to seniors over 65 who live in a CHSLD or a private residence. Anyone with a severe health condition, like multiple sclerosis, can also apply. Applicants will have to fill out a one-page questionnaire at acforseniors.com
"If you qualify, we will contact you and put in the air conditioner," Lasry said.
Seniors is CHSLDs and other residences must have permission from administrators to have a unit installed.
Extreme heat can be fatal for vulnerable seniors, Montreal's public health director Mylène Drouin said Tuesday when asked whether using air-conditioning units could spread the novel coronavirus in residences.
"(The heat) is an immediate risk that we judged prevailed when compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19," she added.
Lasry said that news reports of the appalling conditions in many residences, such as seniors being left in soiled diapers, have encouraged the campaign to make seniors more comfortable on sweltering summer days.
"We are going to do this one air conditioner at a time," she said.

Quebec to launch a massive recruitment campaign for CHSLD staff

Full text: QUEBEC - Unable to shake its chronic labour problem, Quebec plans to launch a massive recruitment campaign to permanently fill vacant orderly positions in its CHSLD network.
But in the meantime, the province will continue cobbling together COVID-19 solutions, including making more use of Canadian Armed Forces personnel already lending a hand, Premier François Legault announced at his pandemic briefing Wednesday.
Legault made the remarks on the same day as Quebec continued with deconfinement announcements This time the government has authorized the reopening of hundreds of provincial campgrounds, outfitter lodges, marinas and summer cottages, starting Monday.
In the case of cottages, they have to be rented by one household unit or people who normally live together under one roof at a time, with a 24-hour gap between each group. Smaller chalets will have to be disinfected between customers.
Groups of friends can go camping together, but they will have to rent separate sites to ensure each group sleeps in different tents.
Auberges, motels and homes offered for rent will open outside of the greater Montreal and Joliette regions.
There are no real limits on inter-regional travel, which means a Montreal family suffering from the city heat could rent a cottage in another region. People have to limit their stops along the way, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said at a news conference.
"It's good news for vacationers and tourism businesses alike," Proulx said, conceding the rules are not exactly conducive for that 12-hour trip with the kids around the Gaspé coast.
The most well-off will be owners of recreational vehicles, which have their own sanitary facilities.
But the camping decision - which followed enormous pressure from ordinary Quebecers desperate for something to do this summer - was the only glimmer of good news Wednesday as the government continued to wrestle with labour issues in its CHSLD network and the fact many are not air-conditioned during the current heat wave.
A report issued by the Canadian Armed Forces based on their first-hand experience helping in the network highlighted the flaws in the system, from a lack of full-time trained workers to shortages in protective equipment and deficient infection-control procedures.
More than 60 per cent of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have taken place in the centres.
Reacting to the report, Legault said he did not learn much that he did not know already, but he noted it's hard to apply specific directives with so many new, under-trained, part-time personnel.
Legault thanked the soldiers - there are 1,000 on the front lines in 25 residences - for their work. He then announced he has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to extend the mandate of the army in Quebec until Sept. 15.
In short, Quebec wants to make use of the extra hands until it is able to train more orderlies to take up the job.
"We hope, if it happens, that the second wave (of the virus) is not before Sept. 15," Legault said.
But later in Ottawa, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said it won't be possible to deploy troops in Quebec for another four months.
"We will not be able to go that duration just because we don't have the number of personnel," Sajjan said. "When you have our people working seven days a week, it's just not sustainable."
Legault, nevertheless, announced fresh plans to launch a massive recruitment campaign in the hopes of convincing 10,000 Quebecers to become orderlies in centres.
Quebec will offer three months of paid training to anyone interested in working in the field. The students will be paid $21 an hour, or $760 a week. If they are successful and get hired, their salaries will rise to $26 an hour, or $940 a week.
That would be the equivalent of $49,000 a year.
"I ask every Quebecer who can to consider it seriously," Legault said. "We're talking about a rewarding job, which can make a real difference in people's lives."
Legault recognized recruiting 10,000 more people is a challenge - he has failed in the past - but said he hopes to convince some of the 10,000 temporary workers Quebec managed to recruit to stay.
"We may ask employees of the government to go and work in the CHSLDs for a few months," the premier added when asked what happens if the recruitment fails.
The government also responded to accusations by the opposition parties that it failed to see the current heat wave, which is making life miserable in CHSLDs.
Legault said a month ago that health officials did not want to take the risk of having workers enter the residences. It was also unclear whether air conditioners would spread the virus.

Allison Hanes: Let's enjoy the summer, but heed the dark cloud

Full text: Campgrounds have the green light to welcome visitors as of next week, the government announced Wednesday - the latest sign that Quebec is gradually returning to some semblance of normalcy just in time for summer.
Splash pads in Montreal were mercifully switched on to help city kids cool off during the first heat wave of the season.
Retail stores opened their doors for the first time in months Monday and eager shoppers came out in force, despite having to line up and keep their distance.
Last weekend, backyard barbecues and park meet-ups were allowed to resume - provided everyone keeps two metres apart and no more than 10 people from three households are present at any one gathering.
Golf courses are back in business. Tennis courts are occupied. The sun is out. The good times are ready to roll. Or so it seems.
Though blue skies beckon, they are also deceiving. There is a dark cloud on the not-so-distant horizon, and it is the second wave of COVID-19.
Preparations are already underway for Round 2 of the pandemic, Health Minister Danielle McCann acknowledged Wednesday. This means shoring up the health system, especially seniors' centres, where there is still a critical shortage of staff An influenza vaccination campaign is in the works, to prevent a double whammy of COVID-19 and ordinary flu infections that could overwhelm hospitals and lead to confusion about symptoms.
And medical professionals, particularly nurses, must get two weeks off sometime this summer so they can rest up for a second wave, McCann said. (Which doesn't seem like much. Exhausted nurses were already protesting across Quebec Wednesday, saying they've been denied holidays or time off since March and are "dead tired.")
Surveys sent home to parents suggest planning is taking place now for a new school year where social-distancing measures remain in place in September and classroom learning is likely to be suspended again at some point.
We are emerging from isolation, but we're not going back to the way things were before, Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda warned for the umpteenth time.
Acknowledging he may sound like a killjoy, Arruda said he understands people being excited to hang out with friends or go to a beach after a difficult spring of being cloistered. But we need to remain on guard. The precious privileges we have just been granted could be taken away if we fail to follow the rules of staying two metres apart, hand-washing and mask-wearing, causing a surge of new COVID-19 cases.
"I will be the most disappointed if I have to recommend to the premier that we start closing things again," Arruda said, sounding like a permissive father offering us restless teenagers some freedom while trusting us to behave responsibly.
In dense Montreal, especially, the situation is improving but delicate. Community transmission seems to be on the wane, even in hot zones, but Arruda said even if 10 per cent of the public starts ignoring social-distancing directives, we could undermine all the sacrifices we have made in the last 2 1/2 months and find ourselves on the verge of reconfinement.
The question is not so much if a second wave of COVID-19 is coming, but when. Until we have a vaccine or at least an effective treatment, this virus will be with us for some time and we must learn to live with it. Many experts expect the second round of the pandemic will hit sometime in the fall, perhaps coinciding with cold and flu season. But we could bring it on sooner if we throw caution to the wind and get carried away with our summer activities.
We will all be the big losers if we don't follow public health instructions and the summer reprieve we have all been craving gets called off abruptly.
So get out there, grab a golf club, pitch a tent, call your friends. But please enjoy responsibly

Full text: In case there was any doubt, Wednesday was a record-breaking day in terms of the heat in the city.
According to Environment Canada, Montreal recorded a high of 36 C as of 4 p.m. That shattered the previous high temperature recorded on May 27 in previous years, which was 30.4 C in 1978, when the Bee Gees were dominating the pop music charts with songs like Stayin' Alive and movies like Grease and Jaws 2 were about to hit the theatres.
On Wednesday, Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante announced the city will be opening 17 cooling stations in various parts of the city this week. The locations include the maison culturelle de Montréal-Nord, maison de la culture d'Ahuntsic, the centre des loisirs Saint-Laurent and the borough hall for the Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux Trembles. The city has offered an online map of where people can cool off. More info at montreal.ca/articles/le-coronavirus-covid-19
It could be much worse. A different record was set on May 27, 1969 when the temperature only reached the freezing mark, 0 C.
The average high for this time of year is a spring-like 21 C with nighttime lows just below 10 C.
Environment Canada issued a heat warning for the Greater Montreal area, including Longueuil and Laval. The weather service advised that, with the humidex factored in, it could feel like 40 C in some areas. The high humidex values are expected to continue into Thursday.
"Maximum temperatures will remain in the 30s Thursday. However, slightly lower humidity levels are expected to keep humidex values in the 30s. The risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors," Environment Canada noted in its alert. "Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion."
The unusually hot weather began Tuesday when people could be seen lined up outside stores that sell backyard pools. Also on Tuesday, Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin asked the city to open splash pads in the city's parks. Some cities in the West Island said they had no plans to open their splash pads, including Dollard des Ormeaux and Pointe Claire.
Beaconsfield announced it can provide air-conditioned respite, by appointment only, for those vulnerable to extreme heat in a multi-purpose room adjoining its recreation centre. Call 514-428-5999.
The forecast high for Thursday is 30 C with a low of 19 C and showers overnight. Showers are also expected on Friday along with a high of 28 C.

I reported earlier today on Quebec's plan to train 10,000 people to work in CHSLDs (long-term care homes) between mid-June and mid-September.
Several readers emailed to ask where they can apply.
It's a bit too early. Premier François Legault said Quebec is still preparing to launch the recruitment drive.
"Get ready. In the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centres that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.

2:30 p.m. Change of policy on Quebec case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.

Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today

3:45 p.m. Quebec to reopen camping, cottage rentals, marinas on Monday
Quebec will allow the reopening of camping, cottage rentals and marinas as of Monday, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx announced at a press conference this afternoon.
Only one family will be allowed per rental cottage, she said.
Tourist homes and Airbnb rentals can also reopen, but only outside Greater Montreal or in the Joliette region, where the situation remains fragile.
Proulx said Montrealers can go on vacation outside their region but people moving between regions should limit their stops - by bringing their groceries with them, for example.
3:15 p.m. 'Gigantic failure'

2:50 p.m. Want to apply to work in a CHSLD?
I reported earlier today on Quebec's plan to train 10,000 people to work in CHSLDs (long-term care homes) between mid-June and mid-September.
Several readers emailed to ask where they can apply.
It's a bit too early. Premier François Legault said Quebec is still preparing to launch the recruitment drive.
"Get ready. In the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centres that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.

2:30 p.m. Change of policy on Quebec case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.

12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.
Read our full story, by Philip Authier.
Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.

Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.

11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.

2:50 p.m. Want to apply to work in a CHSLD?
I reported earlier today on Quebec's plan to train 10,000 people to work in CHSLDs (long-term care homes) between mid-June and mid-September.
Several readers emailed to ask where they can apply.
It's a bit too early. Premier François Legault said Quebec is still preparing to launch the recruitment drive.
"Get ready. In the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centres that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.

2:30 p.m. Change of policy on Quebec case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.

"Get ready. In the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centres that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.

2:30 p.m. Change of policy on Quebec case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.

12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Read our full story
9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada
As of 4 a.m., there were 86,648 cases of COVID-19 and 6,639 deaths in Canada. A total of 45,352 people have recovered.
Here is the breakdown by province and territory:

3:25 p.m. Quebec details plan to reopen campgrounds on Monday
Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3:30 p.m. at which she is to announce details of a partial reopening of tourism in the province, including camping.
You can watch the press conference live below:
3:15 p.m. 'Gigantic failure'
In an opinion piece for Ricochet this week, André Noël describes Premier François Legault's management of the COVID-19 crisis as a "gigantic failure."
A former La Presse investigative reporter who later became an investigator for the Charbonneau Commission, Noël picks apart Quebec's strategy, the plan to "reorganize" long-term care homes and the role of Horacio Arruda, the province's top public health officer.
3 p.m. Opinion: Seniors' housing and care need a fundamental rethink
"COVID-19 has put a spotlight on a few things that can and should be addressed, and could serve as an impetus for some fundamental rethinking of what options should exist for seniors, including those who are not fully autonomous."

3:15 p.m. 'Gigantic failure'
In an opinion piece for Ricochet this week, André Noël describes Premier François Legault's management of the COVID-19 crisis as a "gigantic failure."
A former La Presse investigative reporter who later became an investigator for the Charbonneau Commission, Noël picks apart Quebec's strategy, the plan to "reorganize" long-term care homes and the role of Horacio Arruda, the province's top public health officer.
3 p.m. Opinion: Seniors' housing and care need a fundamental rethink
"COVID-19 has put a spotlight on a few things that can and should be addressed, and could serve as an impetus for some fundamental rethinking of what options should exist for seniors, including those who are not fully autonomous."

2:50 p.m. Want to apply to work in a CHSLD?
I reported earlier today on Quebec's plan to train 10,000 people to work in CHSLDs (long-term care homes) between mid-June and mid-September.
Several readers emailed to ask where they can apply.
It's a bit too early. Premier François Legault said Quebec is still preparing to launch the recruitment drive.
"Get ready, in the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centers that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.
2:40 p.m. New Brunswick says three new cases linked to a health-care worker who travelled to Quebec
Premier says the cases are linked to a medical professional who traveled to Quebec for personal reasons was not forthcoming about their reasons for travel, upon returning to New Brunswick and did not self-isolate.

2:30 p.m. Change of policy on Quebec case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, and offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.
12:30 p.m. Quebec mum on Cirque du Soleil loan
Quebec opposition parties are complaining about a lack of transparency after the province said it would not provide details yet on a possible loan of up to US$200 million to the Cirque du Soleil, which is struggling due to the pandemic.

Federal Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos provided an update on the response to the pandemic.
12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

Montreal restaurant owners bang on their pots and pans as they demonstrate to pressure governments to let them reopen their restaurants in Old Montreal today.
11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.
Read our full story, by Philip Authier.
Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Read our full story
9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada

2:50 p.m. Want to apply to work in a CHSLD?
I reported earlier today on Quebec's plan to train 10,000 people to work in CHSLDs (long-term care homes) between mid-June and mid-September.
A reader emailed to ask where she can apply.
It's a bit too early. Premier François Legault said Quebec is still preparing to launch the recruitment drive.
"Get ready, in the next few days, we will give you the addresses of the 40 or 50 vocational training centers that will accept applications," Legault said at his briefing this afternoon.
2:40 p.m. New Brunswick says three new cases linked to a health-care worker who travelled to Quebec
Premier says the cases are linked to a medical professional who traveled to Quebec for personal reasons was not forthcoming about their reasons for travel, upon returning to New Brunswick and did not self-isolate.

NEW: Higgs say a health care worker travelled to Quebec and didn't self isolate on return.
The person met with patients over a two-week period.
Higgs labels it "irresponsible." #NB

2:30 p.m. Change of policy of case, death updates
Since the beginning of the crisis, Premier François Legault has disclosed the number of new cases and deaths at his briefings, and offering his condolences to those who have lost loved ones.
That changed today, apparently part of a new communications strategy.
Legault said the figures will now be published in the morning.
"So I won't repeat all the numbers you already have," he added. "I will rather move on to some comments on the general situation."
For the record, Quebec today reported its highest number of deaths in two weeks, though it's unclear how many occurred over the past 24 hours. (See item below timestamped 11:35 a.m.)
2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.
12:30 p.m. Quebec mum on Cirque du Soleil loan
Quebec opposition parties are complaining about a lack of transparency after the province said it would not provide details yet on a possible loan of up to US$200 million to the Cirque du Soleil, which is struggling due to the pandemic.

12:10 p.m. Ottawa provides update
Federal Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos provided an update on the response to the pandemic.
12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

Montreal restaurant owners bang on their pots and pans as they demonstrate to pressure governments to let them reopen their restaurants in Old Montreal today.
11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.
Read our full story, by Philip Authier.
Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Read our full story
9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada

2:10 p.m. 'We need more staff in our CHSLDs,' Legault says; Quebec vows to train 10,000 new CHSLD workers this summer
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation.
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $760 per week during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $940 per week, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.
12:30 p.m. Quebec mum on Cirque du Soleil loan

Federal Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos provided an update on the response to the pandemic.
12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

Montreal restaurant owners bang on their pots and pans as they demonstrate to pressure governments to let them reopen their restaurants in Old Montreal today.
11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Read our full story
9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada
As of 4 a.m., there were 86,648 cases of COVID-19 and 6,639 deaths in Canada. A total of 45,352 people have recovered.
Here is the breakdown by province and territory:
Quebec: 48,598 (4,139 deaths, 14,999 resolved)

To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.
Legault said the salary will be $21 per hour during training. If they are hired full time, they will make $26 per hour, he said.
Working in a CHSLD is "a rewarding job that makes a real difference in people's lives," Legault said.

12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Quebec today will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
At 3:30 p.m., Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today

They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada

This item is being updated
"We need more staff in our CHSLDs (long-term care centres)," Premier François Legault tweeted moments before his briefing this afternoon.
"For those who can help, we can offer you a job that is well paid and very rewarding. I invite you to think about it very seriously."
In his opening statement, Legault added that "the situation remains difficult in CHSLDs."
On the severe staffing shortage in particular, he said: "It's embarrassing for Quebec society" to be in this situation."
To help with the labour shortage in long-term care homes, Quebec will launch a campaign in the coming days to hire 10,000 people to work in them. They will undergo paid training between mid-June and mid-September.
While the training ramps up, Quebec has asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to keep military personnel in place as helpers in CHSLDs until Sept. 15, Legault said. About 1,000 soldiers are currently in place.

11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, be phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day workweek.
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.

10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Well, today, at his 1 p.m. press conference, Legault will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
Later in the afternoon, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Masks are de rigueur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners took their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

Federal Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos provided an update on the response to the pandemic.
12:05 p.m. Shopping protection
Montreal's Ikea store reopened yesterday, with a limit on the number of customers, among other public health measures. The chain temporarily closed all Canadian stores on March 18.
Masks are de rigeur, as are umbrellas to shield customers from the sun. Montreal is experiencing its first heat wave of the season this week.
Ikea customers use the store's umbrellas to protect themselves from the 34C heat as they wait to enter the store on Wednesday May 27, 2020 in Montreal.
Noon Old Montreal restaurant owners to bang pots, pans in bid to reopen
From The Canadian Press:
Some Montreal restaurant owners are planning to take their pots and pans to the streets this morning, demanding answers on when they can reopen their restaurants.
The provincial government allowed retail stores in the city with outside access to resume business this week, but it has yet to announce when restaurants can open their dining rooms.
Earlier this month, a survey conducted by the Quebec Restaurant Association revealed 72 per cent of members wanted to reopen, even if it meant cutting seating capacity in half.
Eric Luksenberg, who owns two restaurants on Old Montreal's Place-Jacques-Cartier, said that without the summer season he won't be able to pay his rent next winter, so he came up with the idea to "make a little noise."
Luksenberg, whose restaurants are Chez Eric and Le Homard Fou, said restaurant workers are paying the price for poor management in the province's long-term care residences, which have seen the worst outbreaks of COVID-19.
Fellow owner Donato Trafficante estimates he lost more than $80,000 in revenue last weekend alone from his two establishments and says if he is unable to open this summer, it could take two to three years to recover.
Jean-Marc Lavoie owns two restaurants in the Old Montreal area and he is worried about their future. He says the pandemic has already forced him to permanently close a third, a Cage aux Sports that relied heavily on tourists.

11:55 a.m. Most CHSLDs are regaining control, but military reports 'difficult situations'
Following up on previous items about this, here's our full story, by Matthew Lapierre, about the military's report on conditions in Quebec long-term care homes.
11:50 a.m. Aislin
11:40 a.m. Updated charts, maps 11:35 a.m. Quebec reports 541 new cases, 89 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 541 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 49,139, the province announced this morning.
There were 89 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,228.
That's the highest number of deaths reported since May 13, when 131 were recorded.
Quebec has not said yet how many of the 89 deaths reported today occurred in the past 24 hours.
11:15 a.m. Canada must take better care of elderly, Trudeau says
This item is being updated
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has to take better care of its elderly. He said he will discuss long-term care with premiers at his weekly conference call with them tomorrow.
Ottawa is in discussions with Quebec and Ontario about their requests to extend the military's assistance in long-term care homes in the provinces, he said.
But he said having soldiers working in the residences is not a long-term solution to the problem.
He said military reports published this week about conditions at residences in Quebec and Ontario show that Canada has to improve how it cares for seniors.
Trudeau also said:
There are more than 45,000 jobs available through the federal online job bank
Certain emergency financial programs will have to end, phased out or changed. He made the comment when asked whether the Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be extended.
"Our immediate plan is to help out immediately." He was responding to a question about whether Canada needs national standards for long-term care.
He wouldn't comment on whether Canada should follow the lead of New Zealand and consider instituting a four-day work week.
You can watch the press conference live below:
10:50 a.m. Full report: Military releases findings on conditions at CHSLDs
The Quebec government has released the full report the Armed Forces prepared about the conditions soldiers found when they went into CHSLDs to help.
Military personnel found staffing shortages, improper infection prevention procedures and management problems, among other things.
"The report clearly shows that the arrival of the troops helped stabilize the quality of care and services offered to the most vulnerable elderly people," the Quebec government said.
"Although the situation is improving with the return to work of health personnel who were absent from the network due to COVID-19, the shortage of personnel and manpower remains a significant challenge, in several places, and the Quebec government is continuing its efforts to strengthen the teams on the ground.
"The government of Quebec wishes to once again thank the Canadian Armed Forces for their contribution to this unprecedented health crisis."
Here's the full report.
10:30 a.m. Parc Safari says it hopes to soon open as a drive-through zoo
Parc Safari had to postpone its usual May opening. But plans are afoot to work around the pandemic.
"We hope that soon you'll be able to drive around Safari Adventure with no more contact with other people than at a Tim Hortons drive-through," Parc Safari said in a press release.
"Visitors on safari in the heart of Quebec will discover 300 animals from four continents ... all from the comfort and safety of their own vehicles. This will be possible with limited and safe contact between visitors and staff at only two locations, the ticket office and the public washrooms."
The drive-through safari is inspired by measures taken by the Toronto Zoo.
10:20 a.m. The army's report on CHSLDs will be released to the public today
The Legault government will make public today a report produced by the Canadian Armed Forces on the state of Quebec's CHSLDs.
One day after Ontario released a similar report into the state of some of its long-term care residences, Quebec got its own version late Tuesday evening.
Read our full story, by Philip Authier.
Below is the full report about Ontario long-term care homes.
10 a.m. Quebec campgrounds can reopen Monday
Camping has never sounded more alluring to cooped-up Quebecers, especially since travelling to other provinces or countries will probably be off-limits this summer.
That's why the question of when campgrounds will reopen has come up repeatedly in Premier François Legault's briefings.
Well, today, at his 1 p.m. press conference, Legault will announce that campgrounds across Quebec can open their gates to campers starting on Monday, June 1, sources have confirmed to colleague Philip Authier.
Later in the afternoon, Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx is to explain the rules that will be put in place in campgrounds.
A 2012 survey found that one-quarter of Quebecers go camping every year. That would put the number of campers in the province at more than 2 million.
9:35 a.m. Some national parks reopen on Monday, including two in Quebec
Parks Canada says some operations at national parks, national historic sites, historic waterways and national marine conservation areas will resume starting June 1. Twenty-nine of Canada's 48 national parks will be accessible, including two in Quebec - La Mauricie, near Trois-Rivières, and Forillon in the Gaspé.
9:25 a.m. Saying they're 'dead tired,' nurses will take to the streets of Montreal today
Quebec nurses represented by the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé (FIQ) will hold protests outside the province's health centres today to demonstrate their frustration with working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Read our full story
9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island.
Some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. How Quebec compares to the rest of Canada
As of 4 a.m., there were 86,648 cases of COVID-19 and 6,639 deaths in Canada. A total of 45,352 people have recovered.
Here is the breakdown by province and territory:

Full text: As temperatures continue to climb this week, Quebec's public health institute says it can't know for sure whether or not using air-conditioning units and fans could further spread the novel coronavirus in places housing COVID-19 patients.
Despite the uncertainty, Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services issued directives Tuesday giving all long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, the green light to use the units to protect vulnerable residents from the heat. In Montreal, where many centres are fighting COVID-19 outbreaks, public health director Mylène Drouin explained the plan as a calculated gamble - the risk of having residents die from the heat weighed against the risk of them contracting COVID-19.
"For us, the risk tied to the heat is an immediate health threat. When there's an extreme heat wave, the impact can be fatal," Drouin said at a news conference, explaining the balancing act public health authorities performed.
"(The heat) is an immediate risk that we judged prevailed when compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19."
As of Tuesday, 170 public retirement homes and CHSLDs in the greater Montreal area had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case.
Ahead of this week's heat wave, many of the centres had looked to the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) for guidance on whether it is safe to use air-conditioning units or fans, unsure whether circulating the air could further spread the virus.
The institute's answer finally came on Monday, but did not offer the clarity some had sought: The decision, it said, should be made on a case-by-case basis.
"In the absence of evidence and in light of the literature consulted," the institute said in a notice published online, all centres, hospitals or residences with COVID-19 patients should assess the risks locally to determine whether "the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of using these devices."
"The benefits of comfort versus the safety of users and staff must be closely analyzed," the institute said, "and a safe and comfortable environment must be provided."
Though it stopped short of recommending whether or not the machines should be used, the IN-SPQ did offer general guidelines for those who opt to use them.
To avoid propagating droplets from infected residents, it suggested turning off the units when nurses or doctors are treating a patient, routinely disinfecting the units and, as much as possible, trying to avoid directing them toward a resident's face.
Before the health ministry's directive was issued Tuesday afternoon, there appeared to still be confusion over what should be done.
The Montreal Gazette had contacted the city's five regional health authorities to ask how they interpreted the INSPQ directives and whether they would deploy air-conditioning units across their networks. The answers differed from one region to the other.
But the ministry's directive later made it clear.
"For Quebec's director of public health, Dr. Horacio Arruda, it is appropriate, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to add air conditioning in health care environments," the notice sent to health authorities reads, "considering that the benefits of the use of these devices are greater than the possible inconveniences."
Less than one-third of rooms in Quebec's CHSLDs have air conditioning - a situation patient-rights advocates decried this week as "inhumane."
During previous heat waves, centres without air-conditioned rooms would move residents into cooler common areas to help them escape the heat. But that might not be an option this year.
At least two of Montreal's health authorities, which oversee a combined 17 long-term care centres, confirmed Tuesday they do not intend on using common air-conditioned areas to allow residents to cool down, deeming it too risky.
Both have started installing air-conditioning units in rooms instead. jfeith@postmedia.com

Full text: The city of Montreal will begin opening splash pads in parks as soon as possible to help deal with the heat wave and give families a chance to cool off while they also cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Montreal public health director Mylène Drouin made the announcement on Tuesday.
"We have already recommended to the city to open the water parks as quickly as possible to let families refresh themselves," she said.
As Drouin spoke, the city issued a release stating "the boroughs will gradually open their water games starting (Tuesday)."
Splash pads provide children with the opportunity to play in running water and spray their playmates without requiring supervision by lifeguards.
During her news conference, Drouin was asked if someone would have to supervise the splash pads to make sure social distancing measures are respected. She replied that she will leave the supervision up to parents.
The city will be opening splash pads in parks where slides, swings and other playground equipment have been roped off for weeks.
"I think it will be a question of limiting the play zone to one family for a period of time," Drouin said.
She said the overall pandemic situation in Montreal is "progressing in a good direction. While the number of tests are increasing, we still have slow constant reduction in the number of cases each day.
"We are seeing the same drop in terms of new hospitalizations, new admissions to emergency rooms and in intensive care for COVID-19," Drouin said. "We ask that the public remain vigilant, because we are in a period where we are reopening several sectors of activity. The virus is still circulating and outbreaks are still a possibility."
Drouin also announced that during the heat wave the city will reduce the operating hours of its mobile unit that tests for COVID-19 in the hardest-hit areas.
Tests conducted by the unit on Wednesday and Thursday will only be done between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
She also said the criteria to be tested in Montreal has not changed.
"People who are symptomatic are the priority," she said. "And people who have come in contact with COVID-19 or believe they have come in contact with COVID-19 are invited to be tested in clinics without appointments. But we are not at all (in a situation) where we can open it up to the entire public.
"If there are outbreaks in the daycares, the workplaces, with the contacts or the workers in those milieus, it is them that we will prioritize. The objective of testing is always to cut the chains of transmission as soon as possible."
On Tuesday, the city also announced it has extended the state of emergency for the Montreal agglomeration to May 30. The state of emergency was first declared on March 27. pcherry@postmedia.com

Following up on an earlier item about the pandemic and the heat wave, the city of Montreal has just announced that boroughs will "gradually" reopen splash pads, starting today.
In addition, the city said it is "also preparing to exceptionally open some of its infrastructure during future heat waves so that Montrealers can cool off there since shopping centers and libraries could possibly still be closed."

4:15 p.m. 'It will be different'
This afternoon, a reporter asked Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon about the province's plan to reopen malls, starting outside the Montreal region on Monday.
Here's what Fitzgibbon said.
4:10 p.m. Quebec to add A/C, fans to combat heat in CHSLDs
At a press conference this afternoon, Mylène Drouin, director of public health for Montreal, said the COVID-19 situation is stabilizing on the island, with both the number of new cases and hospitalizations going down. At the same time, testing is on the rise.
But she asked Montrealers to remain vigilant. "The virus is still circulating," Drouin said.
With Montreal in the throes of a heat wave, she said her department has been working on a plan to adapt heat wave mitigation measures to the new reality of COVID-19.
It's a particularly difficult time, with many air-conditioned areas such as mall closed due to the pandemic, and many seniors in self-isolation without air conditioning.
Simultaneously dealing with two risks - heat waves and COVID-19 transmission - will be "a big challenge" this summer, Drouin said.
She noted that the current spell of hot weather does not technically meet the criteria of extreme heat or a heat wave.
But she said her department has asked the city of Montreal to open splash pads as soon as possible so families can cool down.
And public health is working with the city to find ways, while respecting social distancing, to allow the opening of some public places - such as arenas - where people could cool down.
She urged people to drink a lot of water, try to spend time in air-conditioned rooms or rooms with lower temps and take cool baths or showers. In addition, Montrealers should check on people who are isolated, particularly older people who are more at risk in heat waves.
Also at risk are children and people with mental-health issues or alcohol/drug addictions, she said.
Mobile COVID-19 testing is being curtailed due to the hot weather, with reduced hours to protect workers and the public, Drouin said.
Caroline Dusablon, an emergency measures coordinator with the Quebec health department, told the press conference that Quebec has authorized the installation of mobile air conditioning and cooling fans in CHSLDs (long-term care centres).
"Some of these measures are already in progress or completed," Dusablon said.

2:25 p.m. Full report on Ontario long-term care homes
Following up on the previous item about the situation in Ontario long-term care homes, here's the full report by the Canadian Armed Forces.
2:20 p.m. Report details 'disturbing' issues in Ontario long-term care homes
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - A military report on five long-term care homes in Ontario details "horrific" allegations such as rooming COVID-19 positive patients with uninfected ones, insect infestations and aggressive resident feeding that led to choking.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford called it "the most heart-wrenching report I have ever read in my entire life."
"The reports they provided us were heartbreaking, they were horrific," he said. "It's shocking that this can happen here in Canada. It's gut-wrenching."
Ford called in military assistance last month for five long-term care homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. After reading the report, Ford said it's clear the system is broken. He said he is now not ruling out a public inquiry, which he previously declined.
The allegations detailed by Canadian Armed Forces members include failure to isolate COVID-19-positive patients and allowing them to wander outside of their rooms.
At one home, the military reported "significant" fecal contamination in resident rooms, cockroach infestations, residents not being bathed for weeks, and some crying out for help for more than two hours.
Residents at another home were bed-bound for weeks, with a "significant" number having pressure ulcers. Due to severe staffing issues, "most" residents were not receiving three meals a day, the report alleges.
Since members of the military began providing operational assistance in Ontario, 14 of them have become infected with COVID-19.
2:05 p.m. Quebec to provide US$200 million to save the Cirque du Soleil; province to temporarily ban commercial evictions
Premier François Legault, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, is not holding a press conference.
However, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon met reporters briefly to provide an update.
Fitzgibbon said:
The Quebec government is freeing up US$200 million to help save the Cirque du Soleil. He said under the deal, the province will have an option to buy the Cirque, which is struggling due to the pandemic
Quebec will introduce legislation in the coming weeks to temporarily ban commercial evictions due to non-payment of rent during the pandemic. He urged landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance
He could not comment on reports that Quebec will on Wednesday announce that campgrounds in the province can reopen in June.
Malls across Quebec apart from Greater Montreal can reopen on Monday but Fitzgibbon would not comment on when Greater Montreal malls can open their doors.
Le Conseil des ministres accordé une aide financière jusqu'à 200 M$ US pour la relance du Cirque du Soleil.
"Les impôts du Cirque vont continuer à être payés au Québec et au Canada. Le salaire des dirigeants va être très raisonnable. Le siège social va être au Québec."

1:15 p.m. Ontario to disclose 'disturbing' report about seniors' residences
At 1:30 p.m., Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to discuss the "disturbing findings" of Armed Forces personnel working in some of the province's seniors' residences.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning revealed that the military had prepared a report on the findings. He would not elaborate until Ontario commented.
Canadian soldiers are also helping in Quebec long-term care centres.
But provincial officials today said the military has sent no report about Quebec facilities, colleague Philip Authier tells me from Quebec City.
There are reports this afternoon that the military is working on a report about the situation in Quebec.

12:10 p.m. Federal officials provide update
Federal ministers and Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, provided an update this afternoon.
12:05 p.m. Montreal day camps can open - but will they?
In a recent survey, almost 80 per cent of accredited Montreal day camps said they would not open unless financial help is forthcoming, an industry association says.
In order to enforce social distancing, the government has instructed camps to lower the ratio of campers to counsellors, which could increase salary costs by at least 30 to 50 per cent.

11:40 a.m. Quebec reports 614 new cases, 70 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 614 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 48,598, the province announced this morning.
There were 70 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,139.
11:35 a.m. Quebec wants soldiers to continue in long-term care centres, Trudeau says
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec and Ontario have asked for Armed Forces personnel to remain at long-term care centres for now.
Ottawa has agreed to the request, he said. There was no word on how long the soldiers will remain.
Trudeau also said:
Canada has signed a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks. He says the masks are already being manufactured.
The federal government will finance up to 700 youth jobs in the agriculture industry to help farmers and students.
Armed Forces personnel have reported "extremely troubling observations" about several long-term care facilities in Ontario. Trudeau does not provide details but says he has discussed the matter with Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
Asylum seekers working in Quebec long-term care centres are doing important work. He was responding to a question about Premier François Legault's suggestion yesterday that some of them should be accepted as immigrants. Trudeau says Ottawa is looking at fast-tracking such workers.
It makes sense that political parties, including his Liberal Party, can receive emergency wage subsidies. Trudeau said party workers include translators, receptionists, accountants and other types of workers who deserve help as much as people who work in other sectors. The Bloc Québécois has said political parties should not receive the subsidy.
10:50 a.m. Quebec ombudsperson to investigate seniors' residences
In a press release this morning, Quebec's ombudsperson Marie Rinfret said her office is launching "an impartial and independent investigation" into seniors' residences, where the vast majority of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have occurred.
Her office said it is "very concerned about the situation of the elderly in many residences and is worried about the measures to ensure their safety and well-being. The proliferation of deaths and sites of contamination have brought alarming findings into focus concerning the ability of residences to deal with pandemics when even basic care is not always a guarantee."
Rinfret said: "The current crisis is happening in living environments that were vulnerable to begin with and where there were known problems that were often criticized by the Quebec Ombudsman. These include a glaring shortage of staff, difficult work conditions because of this shortage, a high turnover rate for care attendants, and insufficient oversight of private residences by the public network."
The investigation will "shed light on the government's and the health network's response to the COVID-19 crisis in residences for seniors.
"The investigation will make it possible to identify:
The required improvements in residences for seniors based on the events of the crisis and known pre-pandemic shortcomings;
The measures to put in place to better handle future pandemics or any other similar crisis."

10:30 a.m. Mixed messages in Ontario
Some have criticized Quebec briefings, suggesting public health authorities should hold separate ones from politicians. The idea being that health officials must remain independent and avoid becoming politicized.
But Quebec's way of doing things does avoid what happened in Ontario yesterday when politicians and public health provided contradictory advice.
WATCH: Do Ontario's public health officials and govt. leaders have a communications problem?
Here are their messages on:

10 a.m. Quebecers among least likely to believe most conspiracy theories
This is a follow-up to the previous item about the poll.
Though most Quebecers think governments are keeping secrets, the same survey found they're among the least likely to believe other conspiracy theories.
Below is a chart I grabbed from the poll, with Quebec responses highlighted.
(Numbers in red indicate a significantly lower proportion than that of other respondents. Green indicates a higher proportion.)
9:55 a.m. Half of Canadians think governments deliberately hiding information, poll finds
Half of Canadians believe they're not getting the whole truth from their governments about COVID-19, a new poll suggests, and some also believe conspiracy theories about where the novel coronavirus began.
The misgivings were greatest in Quebec, where 60 per cent of those polled believe governments are keeping secrets about the virus.

Many Montreal stores reopened yesterday for the first time in more than two months. Here's what some shoppers and store workers told us.
9:30 a.m. Canada has received fraction of needed protective equipment
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - The federal government will update Canadians today on the results of the mad scramble to procure personal protective equipment - just as demand is poised to skyrocket with more people returning to work and public health officials preparing for a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections.
As of May 19, data posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada showed only a fraction of the millions of gloves, masks, face shields, ventilators and litres of hand sanitizer ordered by the federal government had so far been received.
For example, of 29,570 ventilators ordered, only 203 had been received.
When it comes to the coveted N95 respirator mask that's the standard-issue covering for the heath-care profession, upwards of 104 million have been ordered but just less than 12 million received and, of those, 9.8 million didn't meet Canadian standards.
The equipment has been in high demand worldwide, with every country competing for scarce supplies from a limited number of suppliers, mostly in China. In what's been described as a "wild west" battle, some confirmed orders have been snatched out from under Canada's nose by other countries willing to pay more.
Even so, officials argue that the federal government has so far been able to deliver everything that the provinces and territories have requested.
However, the demand is expected to go up now that provinces are easing up on the restrictions imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
9:20 a.m. Quebecers confident they'll weather crisis, poll suggests
Despite the fact their province has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the country, Quebecers seem less worried about contracting the disease, are feeling less stressed during their confinement and think they are in better mental health than other Canadians, a new poll suggests.

9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today
Montrealers can be tested at free screening clinics across the island.
They are for people who 1) have symptoms or 2) don't have symptoms but have been in close contact with someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island
Note some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. Across Canada, almost 86,000 cases, 6,600 deaths
As of 4 a.m., there were 85,711 COVID-19 cases and 6,545 deaths in Canada. A total of 44,651 people have recovered.
Here's the breakdown by province and territory.
Quebec: 47,984 (4,069 deaths, 14,654 resolved)

11:40 a.m. Quebec reports 614 new cases, 70 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 614 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 48,598, the province announced this morning.
There were 70 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,139.
11:35 a.m. Quebec wants soldiers to continue in long-term care centres, Trudeau says
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec and Ontario have asked for Armed Forces personnel to remain at long-term care centres for now.
Ottawa has agreed to the request, he said. There was no word on how long the soldiers will remain.
Trudeau also said:
Canada has signed a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks. He says the masks are already being manufactured.
The federal government will finance up to 700 youth jobs in the agriculture industry to help farmers and students.
Armed Forces personnel have reported "extremely troubling observations" about several long-term care facilities in Ontario. Trudeau does not provide details but says he has discussed the matter with Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
Asylum seekers working in Quebec long-term care centres are doing important work. He was responding to a question about Premier François Legault's suggestion yesterday that some of them should be accepted as immigrants. Trudeau says Ottawa is looking at fast-tracking such workers.
It makes sense that political parties, including his Liberal Party, can receive emergency wage subsidies. Trudeau said party workers include translators, receptionists, accountants and other types of workers who deserve help as much as people who work in other sectors. The Bloc Québécois has said political parties should not receive the subsidy.
10:50 a.m. Quebec ombudsperson to investigate seniors' residences
In a press release this morning, Quebec's ombudsperson Marie Rinfret said her office is launching "an impartial and independent investigation" into seniors' residences, where the vast majority of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have occurred.
She said her office is "very concerned about the situation of the elderly in many residences and is worried about the measures to ensure their safety and well-being. The proliferation of deaths and sites of contamination have brought alarming findings into focus concerning the ability of residences to deal with pandemics when even basic care is not always a guarantee."
The investigation will "shed light on the government's and the health network's response to the COVID-19 crisis in residences for seniors.
"The investigation will make it possible to identify:
The required improvements in residences for seniors based on the events of the crisis and known pre-pandemic shortcomings;
The measures to put in place to better handle future pandemics or any other similar crisis."

10:30 a.m. Mixed messages in Ontario
Some have criticized Quebec briefings, suggesting public health authorities should hold separate ones from politicians. The idea being that health officials must remain independent and avoid becoming politicized.
But Quebec's way of doing things does avoid what happened in Ontario yesterday when politicians and public health provided contradictory advice.

10 a.m. Quebecers among least likely to believe most conspiracy theories
This is a follow-up to the previous item about the poll.
Though most Quebecers think governments are keeping secrets, the same survey found they're among the least likely to believe other conspiracy theories.
Below is a chart I grabbed from the poll, with Quebec responses highlighted.
(Numbers in red indicate a significantly lower proportion than that of other respondents. Green indicates a higher proportion.)
9:55 a.m. Half of Canadians think governments deliberately hiding information, poll finds
Half of Canadians believe they're not getting the whole truth from their governments about COVID-19, a new poll suggests, and some also believe conspiracy theories about where the novel coronavirus began.
The misgivings were greatest in Quebec, where 60 per cent of those polled believe governments are keeping secrets about the virus.

9:40 a.m. Video: Montrealers go shopping
Many Montreal stores reopened yesterday for the first time in more than two months. Here's what some shoppers and store workers told us.
9:30 a.m. Canada has received fraction of needed protective equipment
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - The federal government will update Canadians today on the results of the mad scramble to procure personal protective equipment - just as demand is poised to skyrocket with more people returning to work and public health officials preparing for a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections.
As of May 19, data posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada showed only a fraction of the millions of gloves, masks, face shields, ventilators and litres of hand sanitizer ordered by the federal government had so far been received.
For example, of 29,570 ventilators ordered, only 203 had been received.
When it comes to the coveted N95 respirator mask that's the standard-issue covering for the heath-care profession, upwards of 104 million have been ordered but just less than 12 million received and, of those, 9.8 million didn't meet Canadian standards.
The equipment has been in high demand worldwide, with every country competing for scarce supplies from a limited number of suppliers, mostly in China. In what's been described as a "wild west" battle, some confirmed orders have been snatched out from under Canada's nose by other countries willing to pay more.
Even so, officials argue that the federal government has so far been able to deliver everything that the provinces and territories have requested.
However, the demand is expected to go up now that provinces are easing up on the restrictions imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
9:20 a.m. Quebecers confident they'll weather crisis, poll suggests
Despite the fact their province has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the country, Quebecers seem less worried about contracting the disease, are feeling less stressed during their confinement and think they are in better mental health than other Canadians, a new poll suggests.

9:15 a.m. Here's where you can get tested in Montreal today

Today, nine testing centres are available across Montreal Island
Note some of the clinics require appointments.
9 a.m. Across Canada, almost 86,000 cases, 6,600 deaths
As of 4 a.m., there were 85,711 COVID-19 cases and 6,545 deaths in Canada. A total of 44,651 people have recovered.

4:15 p.m. 'It will be different'
This afternoon, a reporter asked Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon about the province's plan to reopen malls, starting outside the Montreal region on Monday.
Here's what Fitzgibbon said.
4:10 p.m. Quebec to add A/C, fans to lower temperatures in CHSLDs
At a press conference this afternoon, Mylène Drouin, director of public health for Montreal, said the COVID-19 situation is stabilizing on the island, with both the number of new cases and hospitalizations going down. At the same time, testing is on the rise.
But she asked Montrealers to remain vigilant. "The virus is still circulating," Drouin said.
With Montreal in the throes of a heat wave, she said her department has been working on a plan to adapt heat wave mitigation measures to the new reality of COVID-19.
It's a particularly difficult time, with many air-conditioned areas such as mall closed due to the pandemic, and many seniors in self-isolation without air conditioning.
She noted that this spell of hot weather does not technically meet the criteria of extreme heat or a heat wave.
But she said her department has asked the city of Montreal to open splash pads as soon as possible so families can cool down.
And public health is working with the city to find ways, while respecting social distancing, to allow the opening of some public places - such as arenas - where people could cool down.
She urged people to drink a lot of water, try to spend time in air-conditioned rooms or rooms with lower temps and take cool baths or showers. In addition, Montrealers should check on people who are isolated, particularly older people who are more at risk in heat waves.
Also at risk are children and people with mental-health issues or alcohol/drug addictions, she said.
Mobile COVID-19 testing is being curtailed due to the hot weather, with reduced hours to protect workers and the public, Drouin said.
Caroline Dusablon, an emergency measures coordinator with the Quebec health department, told the press conference that Quebec has authorized the installation of mobile air conditioning and cooling fans in CHSLDs (long-term care centres).
"Some of these measures are already in progress or completed," Dusablon said.

2:25 p.m. Full report on Ontario long-term care homes
Following up on the previous item about the situation in Ontario long-term care homes, here's the full report by the Canadian Armed Forces.
2:20 p.m. Report details 'disturbing' issues in Ontario long-term care homes
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - A military report on five long-term care homes in Ontario details "horrific" allegations such as rooming COVID-19 positive patients with uninfected ones, insect infestations and aggressive resident feeding that led to choking.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford called it "the most heart-wrenching report I have ever read in my entire life."
"The reports they provided us were heartbreaking, they were horrific," he said. "It's shocking that this can happen here in Canada. It's gut-wrenching."
Ford called in military assistance last month for five long-term care homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. After reading the report, Ford said it's clear the system is broken. He said he is now not ruling out a public inquiry, which he previously declined.
The allegations detailed by Canadian Armed Forces members include failure to isolate COVID-19-positive patients and allowing them to wander outside of their rooms.
At one home, the military reported "significant" fecal contamination in resident rooms, cockroach infestations, residents not being bathed for weeks, and some crying out for help for more than two hours.
Residents at another home were bed-bound for weeks, with a "significant" number having pressure ulcers. Due to severe staffing issues, "most" residents were not receiving three meals a day, the report alleges.
Since members of the military began providing operational assistance in Ontario, 14 of them have become infected with COVID-19.
2:05 p.m. Quebec to provide US$200 million to save the Cirque du Soleil; province to temporarily ban commercial evictions
Premier François Legault, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, is not holding a press conference.
However, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon met reporters briefly to provide an update.
Fitzgibbon said:
The Quebec government is freeing up US$200 million to help save the Cirque du Soleil. He said under the deal, the province will have an option to buy the Cirque, which is struggling due to the pandemic
Quebec will introduce legislation in the coming weeks to temporarily ban commercial evictions due to non-payment of rent during the pandemic. He urged landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance
He could not comment on reports that Quebec will on Wednesday announce that campgrounds in the province can reopen in June.
Malls across Quebec apart from Greater Montreal can reopen on Monday but Fitzgibbon would not comment on when Greater Montreal malls can open their doors.
Le Conseil des ministres accordé une aide financière jusqu'à 200 M$ US pour la relance du Cirque du Soleil.
"Les impôts du Cirque vont continuer à être payés au Québec et au Canada. Le salaire des dirigeants va être très raisonnable. Le siège social va être au Québec."
- Radio-Canada Info (@RadioCanadaInfo) May 26, 2020
1:15 p.m. Ontario to disclose 'disturbing' report about seniors' residences
At 1:30 p.m., Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to discuss the "disturbing findings" of Armed Forces personnel working in some of the province's seniors' residences.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning revealed that the military had prepared a report on the findings. He would not elaborate until Ontario commented.
Canadian soldiers are also helping in Quebec long-term care centres.
But provincial officials today said the military has sent no report about Quebec facilities, colleague Philip Authier tells me from Quebec City.
There are reports this afternoon that the military is working on a report about the situation in Quebec.

12:05 p.m. Montreal day camps can open - but will they?
In a recent survey, almost 80 per cent of accredited Montreal day camps said they would not open unless financial help is forthcoming, an industry association says.
In order to enforce social distancing, the government has instructed camps to lower the ratio of campers to counsellors, which could increase salary costs by at least 30 to 50 per cent.

This item is being updated
At a press conference this afternoon, Mylène Drouin, director of public health for Montreal, said the COVID-19 situation is stabilizing on the island, with both the number of new cases and hospitalizations going down. At the same time, testing is on the rise.
But she asked Montrealers to remain vigilant. "The virus is still circulating," Drouin said.
With Montreal in the throes of a heat wave, she said her department has been working on a plan to adapt heat wave mitigation measures to the new reality of COVID-19.
It's a particularly difficult time, with many air-conditioned areas such as mall closed due to the pandemic, and many seniors in self-isolation without air conditioning.
She noted that this spell of hot weather does not technically meet the criteria of extreme heat or a heat wave.
But she said her department has asked the city of Montreal to open splash pads as soon as possible so families can cool down.
And public health is working with the city to find ways, while respecting social distancing, to allow the opening of some public places - such as arenas - where people could cool down.
She urged people to drink a lot of water, try to spend time in air-conditioned rooms or rooms with lower temps and take cool baths or showers. In addition, Montrealers should check on people who are isolated, particularly older people who are more at risk in heat waves.
Also at risk are children and people with mental-health issues or alcohol/drug addictions, she said.
Mobile COVID-19 testing is being curtailed due to the hot weather, with reduced hours to protect workers and the public, Drouin said.
Caroline Dusablon, an emergency measures coordinator with the Quebec health department, told the press conference that Quebec has authorized the installation of mobile air conditioning and cooling fans in CHSLDs (long-term care centres).
"Some of these measures are already in progress or completed," Dusablon said.

Following up on the previous item about the situation in Ontario long-term care homes, here's the full report by the Canadian Armed Forces.
2:20 p.m. Report details 'disturbing' issues in Ontario long-term care homes
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - A military report on five long-term care homes in Ontario details "horrific" allegations such as rooming COVID-19 positive patients with uninfected ones, insect infestations and aggressive resident feeding that led to choking.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford called it "the most heart-wrenching report I have ever read in my entire life."
"The reports they provided us were heartbreaking, they were horrific," he said. "It's shocking that this can happen here in Canada. It's gut-wrenching."
Ford called in military assistance last month for five long-term care homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. After reading the report, Ford said it's clear the system is broken. He said he is now not ruling out a public inquiry, which he previously declined.
The allegations detailed by Canadian Armed Forces members include failure to isolate COVID-19-positive patients and allowing them to wander outside of their rooms.
At one home, the military reported "significant" fecal contamination in resident rooms, cockroach infestations, residents not being bathed for weeks, and some crying out for help for more than two hours.
Residents at another home were bed-bound for weeks, with a "significant" number having pressure ulcers. Due to severe staffing issues, "most" residents were not receiving three meals a day, the report alleges.
Since members of the military began providing operational assistance in Ontario, 14 of them have become infected with COVID-19.
2:05 p.m. Quebec to provide US$200 million to save the Cirque du Soleil; province to temporarily ban commercial evictions
Premier François Legault, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, is not holding a press conference.
However, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon met reporters briefly to provide an update.
Fitzgibbon said:
The Quebec government is freeing up US$200 million to help save the Cirque du Soleil. He said under the deal, the province will have an option to buy the Cirque, which is struggling due to the pandemic
Quebec will introduce legislation in the coming weeks to temporarily ban commercial evictions due to non-payment of rent during the pandemic. He urged landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance
He could not comment on reports that Quebec will on Wednesday announce that campgrounds in the province can reopen in June.
Malls across Quebec apart from Greater Montreal can reopen on Monday but Fitzgibbon would not comment on when Greater Montreal malls can open their doors.
Le Conseil des ministres accordé une aide financière jusqu'à 200 M$ US pour la relance du Cirque du Soleil.
"Les impôts du Cirque vont continuer à être payés au Québec et au Canada. Le salaire des dirigeants va être très raisonnable. Le siège social va être au Québec."

1:15 p.m. Ontario to disclose 'disturbing' report about seniors' residences
At 1:30 p.m., Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to discuss the "disturbing findings" of Armed Forces personnel working in some of the province's seniors' residences.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning revealed that the military had prepared a report on the findings. He would not elaborate until Ontario commented.
Canadian soldiers are also helping in Quebec long-term care centres.
But provincial officials today said the military has sent no report about Quebec facilities, colleague Philip Authier tells me from Quebec City.
There are reports this afternoon that the military is working on a report about the situation in Quebec.

In a recent survey, almost 80 per cent of accredited Montreal day camps said they would not open unless financial help is forthcoming, an industry association says.
In order to enforce social distancing, the government has instructed camps to lower the ratio of campers to counsellors, which could increase salary costs by at least 30 to 50 per cent.

11:40 a.m. Quebec reports 614 new cases, 70 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 614 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 48,598, the province announced this morning.
There were 70 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,139.
11:35 a.m. Quebec wants soldiers to continue in long-term care centres, Trudeau says
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec and Ontario have asked for Armed Forces personnel to remain at long-term care centres for now.
Ottawa has agreed to the request, he said. There was no word on how long the soldiers will remain.
Trudeau also said:
Canada has signed a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks. He says the masks are already being manufactured.
The federal government will finance up to 700 youth jobs in the agriculture industry to help farmers and students.
Armed Forces personnel have reported "extremely troubling observations" about several long-term care facilities in Ontario. Trudeau does not provide details but says he has discussed the matter with Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
Asylum seekers working in Quebec long-term care centres are doing important work. He was responding to a question about Premier François Legault's suggestion yesterday that some of them should be accepted as immigrants. Trudeau says Ottawa is looking at fast-tracking such workers.
It makes sense that political parties, including his Liberal Party, can receive emergency wage subsidies. Trudeau said party workers include translators, receptionists, accountants and other types of workers who deserve help as much as people who work in other sectors. The Bloc Québécois has said political parties should not receive the subsidy.
10:50 a.m. Quebec ombudsperson to investigate seniors' residences
In a press release this morning, Quebec's ombudsperson Marie Rinfret said her office is launching "an impartial and independent investigation" into seniors' residences, where the vast majority of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have occurred.
She said her office is "very concerned about the situation of the elderly in many residences and is worried about the measures to ensure their safety and well-being. The proliferation of deaths and sites of contamination have brought alarming findings into focus concerning the ability of residences to deal with pandemics when even basic care is not always a guarantee."
The investigation will "shed light on the government's and the health network's response to the COVID-19 crisis in residences for seniors.
"The investigation will make it possible to identify:
The required improvements in residences for seniors based on the events of the crisis and known pre-pandemic shortcomings;
The measures to put in place to better handle future pandemics or any other similar crisis."

10 a.m. Quebecers among least likely to believe most conspiracy theories
This is a follow-up to the previous item about the poll.
Though most Quebecers think governments are keeping secrets, the same survey found they're among the least likely to believe other conspiracy theories.
Below is a chart I grabbed from the poll, with Quebec responses highlighted.
(Numbers in red indicate a significantly lower proportion than that of other respondents. Green indicates a higher proportion.)
9:55 a.m. Half of Canadians think governments deliberately hiding information, poll finds
Half of Canadians believe they're not getting the whole truth from their governments about COVID-19, a new poll suggests, and some also believe conspiracy theories about where the novel coronavirus began.
The misgivings were greatest in Quebec, where 60 per cent of those polled believe governments are keeping secrets about the virus.

9:30 a.m. Canada has received fraction of needed protective equipment
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - The federal government will update Canadians today on the results of the mad scramble to procure personal protective equipment - just as demand is poised to skyrocket with more people returning to work and public health officials preparing for a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections.
As of May 19, data posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada showed only a fraction of the millions of gloves, masks, face shields, ventilators and litres of hand sanitizer ordered by the federal government had so far been received.
For example, of 29,570 ventilators ordered, only 203 had been received.
When it comes to the coveted N95 respirator mask that's the standard-issue covering for the heath-care profession, upwards of 104 million have been ordered but just less than 12 million received and, of those, 9.8 million didn't meet Canadian standards.
The equipment has been in high demand worldwide, with every country competing for scarce supplies from a limited number of suppliers, mostly in China. In what's been described as a "wild west" battle, some confirmed orders have been snatched out from under Canada's nose by other countries willing to pay more.
Even so, officials argue that the federal government has so far been able to deliver everything that the provinces and territories have requested.
However, the demand is expected to go up now that provinces are easing up on the restrictions imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
9:20 a.m. Quebecers confident they'll weather crisis, poll suggests
Despite the fact their province has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the country, Quebecers seem less worried about contracting the disease, are feeling less stressed during their confinement and think they are in better mental health than other Canadians, a new poll suggests.

2:25 p.m. Full report on Ontario long-term care homes
Following up on the previous item about the situation in Ontario long-term care homes, here's the full report by the Canadian Armed Forces.
2:20 p.m. Report details 'disturbing' issues in Ontario long-term care homes
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - A military report on five long-term care homes in Ontario details "horrific" allegations such as rooming COVID-19 positive patients with uninfected ones, insect infestations and aggressive resident feeding that led to choking.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford called it "the most heart-wrenching report I have ever read in my entire life."
"The reports they provided us were heartbreaking, they were horrific," he said. "It's shocking that this can happen here in Canada. It's gut-wrenching."
Ford called in military assistance last month for five long-term care homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. After reading the report, Ford said it's clear the system is broken. He said he is now not ruling out a public inquiry, which he previously declined.
The allegations detailed by Canadian Armed Forces members include failure to isolate COVID-19-positive patients and allowing them to wander outside of their rooms.
At one home, the military reported "significant" fecal contamination in resident rooms, cockroach infestations, residents not being bathed for weeks, and some crying out for help for more than two hours.
Residents at another home were bed-bound for weeks, with a "significant" number having pressure ulcers. Due to severe staffing issues, "most" residents were not receiving three meals a day, the report alleges.
Since members of the military began providing operational assistance in Ontario, 14 of them have become infected with COVID-19.
2:05 p.m. Quebec to provide US$200 million to save the Cirque du Soleil; province to temporarily ban commercial evictions
Premier François Legault, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, is not holding a press conference.
However, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon met reporters briefly to provide an update.
Fitzgibbon said:
The Quebec government is freeing up US$200 million to help save the Cirque du Soleil. He said under the deal, the province will have an option to buy the Cirque, which is struggling due to the pandemic
Quebec will introduce legislation in the coming weeks to temporarily ban commercial evictions due to non-payment of rent during the pandemic. He urged landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance
He could not comment on reports that Quebec will on Wednesday announce that campgrounds in the province can reopen in June.
Malls across Quebec apart from Greater Montreal can reopen on Monday but Fitzgibbon would not comment on when Greater Montreal malls can open their doors.
Le Conseil des ministres accordé une aide financière jusqu'à 200 M$ US pour la relance du Cirque du Soleil.
"Les impôts du Cirque vont continuer à être payés au Québec et au Canada. Le salaire des dirigeants va être très raisonnable. Le siège social va être au Québec."
- Radio-Canada Info (@RadioCanadaInfo) May 26, 2020
1:15 p.m. Ontario to disclose 'disturbing' report about seniors' residences
At 1:30 p.m., Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to discuss the "disturbing findings" of Armed Forces personnel working in some of the province's seniors' residences.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning revealed that the military had prepared a report on the findings. He would not elaborate until Ontario commented.
Canadian soldiers are also helping in Quebec long-term care centres.
But provincial officials today said the military has sent no report about Quebec facilities, colleague Philip Authier tells me from Quebec City.
There are reports this afternoon that the military is working on a report about the situation in Quebec.

Under the plan, the Montreal Canadiens are in the playoffs
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman will make an announcement at 4:30 p.m. ET regarding the Return to Play Plan for the 2019-20 season. It will air on NBCSN & NHL Network in the U.S., Sportsnet & TVA Sports in Canada, & streamed live on and NHL social platforms.

12:10 p.m. Federal officials provide update
Federal ministers and Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, provided an update this afternoon.
12:05 p.m. Montreal day camps can open - but will they?
In a recent survey, almost 80 per cent of accredited Montreal day camps said they would not open unless financial help is forthcoming, an industry association says.
In order to enforce social distancing, the government has instructed camps to lower the ratio of campers to counsellors, which could increase salary costs by at least 30 to 50 per cent.

11:40 a.m. Quebec reports 614 new cases, 70 more deaths
Quebec has recorded 614 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 48,598, the province announced this morning.
There were 70 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,139.
11:35 a.m. Quebec wants soldiers to continue in long-term care centres, Trudeau says
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec and Ontario have asked for Armed Forces personnel to remain at long-term care centres for now.
Ottawa has agreed to the request, he said. There was no word on how long the soldiers will remain.
Trudeau also said:
Canada has signed a contract with General Motors to produce 10 million face masks. He says the masks are already being manufactured.
The federal government will finance up to 700 youth jobs in the agriculture industry to help farmers and students.
Armed Forces personnel have reported "extremely troubling observations" about several long-term care facilities in Ontario. Trudeau does not provide details but says he has discussed the matter with Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
Asylum seekers working in Quebec long-term care centres are doing important work. He was responding to a question about Premier François Legault's suggestion yesterday that some of them should be accepted as immigrants. Trudeau says Ottawa is looking at fast-tracking such workers.
It makes sense that political parties, including his Liberal Party, can receive emergency wage subsidies. Trudeau said party workers include translators, receptionists, accountants and other types of workers who deserve help as much as people who work in other sectors. The Bloc Québécois has said political parties should not receive the subsidy.
10:50 a.m. Quebec ombudsperson to investigate seniors' residences
In a press release this morning, Quebec's ombudsperson Marie Rinfret said her office is launching "an impartial and independent investigation" into seniors' residences, where the vast majority of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths have occurred.
She said her office is "very concerned about the situation of the elderly in many residences and is worried about the measures to ensure their safety and well-being. The proliferation of deaths and sites of contamination have brought alarming findings into focus concerning the ability of residences to deal with pandemics when even basic care is not always a guarantee."
The investigation will "shed light on the government's and the health network's response to the COVID-19 crisis in residences for seniors.
"The investigation will make it possible to identify:
The required improvements in residences for seniors based on the events of the crisis and known pre-pandemic shortcomings;
The measures to put in place to better handle future pandemics or any other similar crisis."

10:30 a.m. Mixed messages in Ontario
Some have criticized Quebec briefings, suggesting public health authorities should hold separate ones from politicians. The idea being that health officials must remain independent and avoid becoming politicized.
But Quebec's way of doing things does avoid what happened in Ontario yesterday when politicians and public health provided contradictory advice.

10 a.m. Quebecers among least likely to believe most conspiracy theories
This is a follow-up to the previous item about the poll.
Though most Quebecers think governments are keeping secrets, the same survey found they're among the least likely to believe other conspiracy theories.
Below is a chart I grabbed from the poll, with Quebec responses highlighted.
(Numbers in red indicate a significantly lower proportion than that of other respondents. Green indicates a higher proportion.)
9:55 a.m. Half of Canadians think governments deliberately hiding information, poll finds
Half of Canadians believe they're not getting the whole truth from their governments about COVID-19, a new poll suggests, and some also believe conspiracy theories about where the novel coronavirus began.
The misgivings were greatest in Quebec, where 60 per cent of those polled believe governments are keeping secrets about the virus.

9:40 a.m. Video: Montrealers go shopping
Many Montreal stores reopened yesterday for the first time in more than two months. Here's what some shoppers and store workers told us.
9:30 a.m. Canada has received fraction of needed protective equipment
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - The federal government will update Canadians today on the results of the mad scramble to procure personal protective equipment - just as demand is poised to skyrocket with more people returning to work and public health officials preparing for a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections.
As of May 19, data posted by Public Services and Procurement Canada showed only a fraction of the millions of gloves, masks, face shields, ventilators and litres of hand sanitizer ordered by the federal government had so far been received.
For example, of 29,570 ventilators ordered, only 203 had been received.
When it comes to the coveted N95 respirator mask that's the standard-issue covering for the heath-care profession, upwards of 104 million have been ordered but just less than 12 million received and, of those, 9.8 million didn't meet Canadian standards.
The equipment has been in high demand worldwide, with every country competing for scarce supplies from a limited number of suppliers, mostly in China. In what's been described as a "wild west" battle, some confirmed orders have been snatched out from under Canada's nose by other countries willing to pay more.
Even so, officials argue that the federal government has so far been able to deliver everything that the provinces and territories have requested.
However, the demand is expected to go up now that provinces are easing up on the restrictions imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
9:20 a.m. Quebecers confident they'll weather crisis, poll suggests
Despite the fact their province has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the country, Quebecers seem less worried about contracting the disease, are feeling less stressed during their confinement and think they are in better mental health than other Canadians, a new poll suggests.

Full text: Forecasting that the region's first "heat event of the season" will take place Wednesday, Environment Canada on Tuesday issued a heat warning for the Montreal area
The warning, issued at 11:10 a.m. for Montreal, Laval and the Longueuil-Varennes area, predicts the humidex will surpass 40 C on Wednesday, as temperatures remain in the low 30s.
Those temperatures are expected to persist into Thursday, although the humidex will drop to the 30 C range.
Bob Hodgson wades in the water off the Verdun beach on a warm, humid day in Montreal Tuesday May 26, 2020.
The federal agency is reminding the public that the risks during such weather are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
It also advises people to drink plenty of water even before they feel thirsty, stay in a cool place and never leave people or pets inside a parked vehicle.
Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.
The heat wave raised concert over conditions inside Quebec's long-term care centres this week, with advocates calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident is protected from the hot weather But with the majority of the centres still not having air-conditioned rooms - and many fighting COVID-19 outbreaks - ensuring everyone is properly sheltered from the heat and humidity will be challenging, Quebec's health minister acknowledged Monday.

Full text: Here's what happened Monday night.
Montreal city council voted to expand Station 9 in Côte-St-Luc, sealing its merger with Station 11 in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Councillors voted 39 to 22 to spend $2.1 million to rent the station on Westminster Ave. from Sept. 1 until Jan. 31, 2027. The 6,000-square-foot station will be enlarged by 2,000 square feet. Opposition members called on the city to put the station merger on hold for one year and refer the issue to Montreal's public security committee. Independent councillor Marvin Rotrand said he was disappointed that the administration has not yet followed up on his suggestion of substituting a mini-station in eastern N.D.G. Loyola councillor Christian Arsenault said the administration demonstrated its open-mindedness by investigating the possibility of a mini-station in N.D.G. If residents are unhappy with the merger after one year, the administration would re-evaluate the situation, he promised.
Montreal is backing down on its plan to close St-Laurent Blvd. to traffic in Little Italy In city council on Monday, Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie Mayor François Croteau promised to respect merchants' wishes after a survey showed local businesses overwhelmingly oppose a proposed bike path on St-Laurent between St-Zotique and Jean-Talon Sts. The path was part of a plan Plante announced 10 days ago to set aside 327 kilometres of space on Montreal streets for pedestrians, cyclists and terrasses. Croteau also walked back an announcement he made last week that the borough would transform the stretch of St-Laurent into a car-free "transit mall" this summer.

Full text: An intense prolonged heat wave could present big issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
That's why Dr. Pierre Gosselin, a consulting physician with the Institut national de santé publique du Québec, feels that the best news about this week's heat wave is that it is only expected to last three days. Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area on Monday that foresees local temperatures taking a three-day soar starting on Tuesday.
In a phone interview Monday, Gosselin said a longer period of extreme temperatures could be highly problematic for a city like Montreal that is still grappling with the novel coronavirus crisis.
For a short heat wave, people should follow the usual public-health recommendations, said Gosselin. That means try to keep your home fresh and cool, keep the curtains closed during the day, and take cool showers and baths. Also don't walk in the sun between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. if possible.
Gosselin noted that roughly 800,000 Montrealers do not have air conditioning at home. If there is a longer heat wave later in the summer, the city will have to take special measures, he said.
"There shouldn't be a problem (this week) since it's a relatively short heat wave," said Gosselin. "But if it's longer we will have to think about finding spaces to refresh people with COVID...There are neighbourhoods where the homes are older and could be very hot. So in conjunction with the city, we would have to find spaces."
He said public-health authorities are looking at different possibilities to house older people, including schools, empty cinemas, or even air-conditioned buses that could be set up in different neighbourhoods.
"So we could have a bus for COVID-positive people and another for people who don't have COVID," said Gosselin.
But if there is a longer heat wave this summer, it will certainly put added pressure on the staff at CHSLDs and private nursing homes.
"For sure during a heat wave like we had in Montreal in 2018, there's a lot of unknowns," said Gosselin. "It could be difficult given the shortage of personnel that we have right now in the CHSLDs and in the private nursing homes. It would be a problem just to get people hydrated and give them basic personal care. We are already having trouble doing that right now. So if come summer we have a big heat wave and we have to take even more care with elderly people, to hydrate them and give them baths, for sure there could be deaths, as there are during every heat wave. ... I think the biggest problem will be the fatigue of the personnel, who will want to take vacations."

Full text: Monday, May 25, 2020: A look at some of the stories we've been following today.
More challenges for CHSLDs during heat wave
As a heat wave threatens to worsen conditions inside Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident is protected from the hot weather. But with the majority of the centres still not having air-conditioned rooms - and many in the midst of fighting COVID-19 outbreaks? - ensuring everyone is properly sheltered from the heat and humidity will be challenging, Quebec's health minister acknowledged Monday.

Doctor relieved it will be a short heat wave
An intense prolonged heat wave could present big issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. That's why Dr. Pierre Gosselin, a consulting physician with the Institut national de santé publique du Québec, feels that the best news about this week's heat wave is that it is only expected to last three days. Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area on Monday that foresees local temperatures taking a three-day soar starting on Tuesday. Read more here
'It's still tight. It's still fragile'
Data show the new coronavirus is infecting, killing and sickening fewer Quebecers each day, provincial officials said Monday, but hospitals in Montreal are still at risk of being overrun by COVID-19 patients. "It's still tight. It's still fragile. That's why we're opening gradually," Premier François Legault said at his daily news conference. Read more here
Status of asylum seekers to be reviewed
The province will review "one by one" the files of asylum seekers being employed on the pandemic front lines with the goal of accepting them officially as immigrants, Premier François Legault said Monday. Read more here
No emergency funds for homeless: shelter director
Montreal is being shortchanged on emergency funding meant to go toward fighting the spread of COVID-19 among its homeless population, according to three experts on homelessness. If the situation isn't rectified soon, hundreds more people will end up living on the street before the pandemic is done. Read more here
Monkland Ave. stirs to life
Writes columnist Bill Brownstein: With the reopening of commercial businesses Monday, there was a little more life on Monkland Ave. Read more here
Meanwhile, on Ste-Catherine St.
The din of jackhammers on Ste-Catherine St. and throngs of pedestrians holding shopping bags made it seem like the coronavirus was just a bad dream on Monday. It looked like the same old downtown core, as stores in Montreal reopened after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered most businesses in March. Read more here
Plan to close St-Laurent Blvd. hits a roadblock
Mayor Valérie Plante's plan to turn over major arteries like St-Laurent Blvd. to pedestrians and cyclists during the COVID-19 pandemic has hit a roadblock in Little Italy. In city council on Monday, Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie Mayor François Croteau promised to respect merchants' wishes after a survey showed local businesses overwhelmingly oppose a proposed bike path on St-Laurent between St-Zotique and Jean-Talon Sts. Read more here
Workplace safety instructions in new plan
As many stores in Montreal opened for the first time since March on Monday, the Quebec government released a 95-page plan to continue taking the province out of confinement in the coming weeks. The electronic document is available on the Quebec government's website in both English and French. Read more here
Higher fees coming, dentists warn
Throughout Quebec, dentists are scrambling to comply with new COVID-19 safety regulations and warning of increased fees after the government announced last week clinics can reopen for regular dental procedures next Monday. Read more here
Trading privacy for more freedom?
Writes columnist Allison Hanes: Our smartphones could soon be deployed to track our movements, communicate with the devices of other people, warn us if we were exposed to someone infected with COVID-19 and alert public health officials. Are we ready for this? Read more here

'It's inhumane' that so few rooms in CHSLDs have air conditioning: patient advocate

Full text: As a heat wave threatens to worsen conditions inside Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident is protected from the hot weather.
But with the majority of the centres still not having air-conditioned rooms - and many fighting COVID-19 outbreaks? - ensuring everyone is properly sheltered from the heat and humidity will be challenging, Quebec's health minister acknowledged Monday.
The measures in place could mean many senior residents, already dealing with the stresses of the pandemic, will be confined to their rooms as temperatures are expected to reach upward of 30 Celsius in Montreal.
"It's inhumane, it's unsafe, it's uncomfortable and it's not the living environment that (Quebec) has talked about for so many years now," patient-rights advocate Paul Brunet, head of the Conseil pour la protection des malades, said of the lack of air conditioning in the centres.
"People should not have to suffer 35- or 37-degree heat in their room," he said. "Is that too much to ask?"
Despite repeated calls over the years, it's estimated that only one-third of rooms in Quebec's long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, have air conditioning.
During past heat waves, centres without air-conditioned rooms would move residents into cooler common areas to help them escape the heat. But that might not be an option this week as it would risk further spreading the virus among residents.
"It's going to be more complicated this year," Health Minister Danielle McCann said Monday during the government's daily COVID-19 briefing. "For the three days we're going to live (this week), we're going to do our best."
McCann said public health authorities are evaluating different possibilities, including having the centres establish two separate air-conditioned areas, with residents who've tested positive for COVID-19 being grouped together in one.
She said the government has also accelerated a plan to install outdoor, generator-powered units that would blow cold air into the buildings.
"We're working on it," McCann said. "We want it in place as soon as possible."
Concerns over the heat are not limited to the residents. They also extend to those already working under difficult conditions in the centres.
Alain Croteau, president of the orderlies union at the CIUSSS Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, said many orderlies have already spoken out about getting too hot at work while wearing full personal protective equipment.
Croteau said centres also often direct them to avoid drinking water or using the washrooms - other than on their breaks - to limit the chances of getting infected when removing their protective equipment or lifting their masks and face shields. That won't be sustainable in 32-degree weather, Croteau warned.
"Something will need to give," he said.
Quebec Premier François Legault said Monday the government put aside $30 million a year and a half ago to install air-conditioned zones in the centres. As of Monday, 97 per cent of CHSLDs were equipped with them.
"Honestly, there's still work to be done," Legault said.
But Brunet said the government has no excuse for now finding itself scrambling to come up with solutions - advocates have been calling for more air-conditioned rooms in the centres for at least a decade, arguing it's a basic right.
Brunet's organization is in talks with lawyers to request a court order that would force all regional health authorities to provide decent temperatures in every CHSLD in Quebec. He believes it's a matter of life and death, noting that people die during heat waves each summer in Quebec
"We're going to lose people," Brunet said. "And each and every death that will occur because of the heat wave will be the government's responsibility."

Full text: As a heat wave threatens to further distress residents of Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident is able to fend off the hot weather.
But as many of the centres continue to fight COVID-19 outbreaks, even ensuring access to a shared space where those without air-conditioned rooms can cool down might not be possible, Quebec's health minister acknowledged Monday.
That could mean many senior residents, already dealing with the stresses of the pandemic, could be confined to their rooms as temperatures are expected to reach upward of 30 Celsius in Montreal.
"It's inhumane, it's unsafe, it's uncomfortable and it's not the living environment that (Quebec) has talked about for so many years now," said patients-rights advocate Paul Brunet, head of the Conseil pour la protection des malades.
"People should not have to suffer 35- or 37-degree heat in their room," he said. "Is that too much to ask?"
Despite repeated calls over the years, it's estimated that only one-third of rooms in Quebec's long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, have air conditioning.
During past heat waves, centres without air-conditioned rooms would move residents into cooler common areas to help them escape the heat and humidity. But that might not be an option this week as it would risk further spreading the virus among residents.
"It's going to be more complicated this year," Health Minister Danielle McCann said Monday during the government's daily COVID-19 briefing. "For the three days we're going to live (this week), we're going to do our best."
McCann said public health authorities are evaluating different possibilities, including having the centres establish two separate air-conditioned areas, with residents who've tested positive for COVID-19 being grouped together in one.
She said the government has also accelerated a plan to install outdoor, generator-powered units that would blow cold air into the buildings.
"We're working on it," McCann said. "We want it in place as soon as possible."
Concerns over the heat are not limited to the residents. They also extend to those already working under difficult conditions in the centres.
Alain Croteau, president of the orderlies union at the CIUSSS Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, said many orderlies have already spoken out about getting too hot at work while wearing full personal protective equipment.
Croteau said centres also often direct them to avoid drinking water or using the washrooms - other than on their breaks - to limit the chances of getting infected when removing their protective equipment or lifting their masks and face shields. That won't be sustainable in 32-degree weather, Croteau said.
"Something will need to give," he said.
Quebec Premier François Legault said Monday the government put aside $30 million a year and a half ago to install air-conditioned zones in the centres. As of Monday, 97 per cent of CHSLDs were equipped with them.
"Honestly, there's still work to be done," Legault said.
But Brunet said the government has no excuse for now finding itself scrambling to come up with solutions - advocates have been calling for more air-conditioned rooms in the centres for at least a decade, arguing it's a basic right.
Brunet's organization is in talks with lawyers to request a court order that would force all regional health authorities to provide decent temperatures in every CHSLD in Quebec. He believes it's a matter of life and death, noting that people die during heat waves each summer in Quebec
"We're going to lose people," Brunet said. "And each and every death that will occur because of the heat wave will be the government's responsibility."

Montreal is lucky heat wave will be short, public-health physician says

Full text: An intense prolonged heat wave could present big issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
That's why Dr. Pierre Gosselin, a consulting physician with the Institut national de santé publique du Québec, feels that the best news about this week's heat wave is that it is only expected to last three days. Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area on Monday that foresees local temperatures taking a three-day soar starting on Tuesday.
In a phone interview Monday, Gosselin said a longer period of extreme temperatures could be highly problematic for a city like Montreal that is still grappling with the novel coronavirus crisis.
For a short heat wave, people should follow the usual public-health recommendations, said Gosselin. That means try to keep your home fresh and cool, keep the curtains closed during the day, and take cool showers and baths. Also don't walk in the sun between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. if possible.
Gosselin noted that roughly 800,000 Montrealers do not have air conditioning at home. If there is a longer heat wave later in the summer, the city will have to take special measures, he said.
"There shouldn't be a problem (this week) since it's a relatively short heat wave," said Gosselin. "But if it's longer we will have to think about finding spaces to refresh people with COVID...There are neighbourhoods where the homes are older and could be very hot. So in conjunction with the city, we would have to find spaces."
He said public-health authorities are looking at different possibilities to house older people, including schools, empty cinemas, or even air-conditioned buses that could be set up in different neighbourhoods.
"So we could have a bus for COVID-positive people and another for people who don't have COVID," said Gosselin.
But if there is a longer heat wave this summer, it will certainly put added pressure on the staff at CHSLDs and private nursing homes.
"For sure during a heat wave like we had in Montreal in 2018, there's a lot of unknowns," said Gosselin. "It could be difficult given the shortage of personnel that we have right now in the CHSLDs and in the private nursing homes. It would be a problem just to get people hydrated and give them basic personal care. We are already having trouble doing that right now. So if come summer we have a big heat wave and we have to take even more care with elderly people, to hydrate them and give them baths, for sure there could be deaths, as there are during every heat wave. ... I think the biggest problem will be the fatigue of the personnel, who will want to take vacations."

4:45 p.m. Ontario blames Mother's Day gatherings for jump in COVID-19 cases
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - Mother's Day gatherings contrary to physical distancing rules helped boost Ontario's COVID-19 cases, the health minister said Monday, and those rising numbers plus concern over a large crowd at a Toronto park over the weekend are delaying any easing of those rules.
Ontario reported more than 400 new COVID-19 cases Monday for a fifth straight day, higher than the province has seen for several previous five-day periods.
That trend predates the province's Stage 1 of reopening launched on May 19, Health Minister Christine Elliott said.
"The increase in the number of cases that we're seeing now in the last few days really relates back to the week before, with the Mother's Day events and so on, people seeing families when they should not have been more than five people together," she said.
Premier Doug Ford himself has admitted that two of his daughters who don't live at home visited that weekend, in a group of at least six people. Provincial officials have told Ontarians to avoid being within two metres of anyone outside their household, and not to gather in groups larger than five.
4:42 p.m. Monkland Ave. comes back to life - at least a little bit

4:25 p.m. Quebec to review status of asylum seekers on pandemic front lines
Quebec will review "one by one" the files of asylum seekers being employed on the pandemic front lines with the goal of accepting them officially as immigrants, Premier François Legault said Monday.
His apparent about-face came in response to pleas from lawyers and humanitarian groups calling for the normalization of the status of hundreds of these workers who are today risking their lives in long-term care residences (CHSLDs), where most of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths occurred.

3:30 p.m. Deciphering Quebec's deconfinement plan
As I mentioned earlier, Quebec today published a tentative deconfinement plan.
It includes some clues as to what will be reopening in the near future.
Unless there is an increase in COVID-19 cases, it appears that some tourism businesses, including campgrounds, could reopen in early June.
Outdoor pools and Montreal malls seem to be on track to reopen in mid to late June, according to the government's plan. Phase One of the reopening of restaurants would be in the same time frame, as would the return of team sports.
Religious services, gyms, cruises, mass gatherings and professional sports would return some time after that.
Quebec is currently in Phase 4.
3 p.m. Payments for Canada Emergency Response Benefit top $40 billion
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - A key federal benefit for Canadians out of work, or seeing large drops in their earnings, in the COVID-19 pandemic has paid out over $40 billion in emergency aid.
Federal figures posted Monday show payments from Canada Emergency Response Benefit now total $40.33 billion to 8.21 million separate applicants, pushing the program further beyond its $35-billion budget.
However, billions could be clawed back next year when the government taxes the earnings and recoups improperly paid benefits.

1:55 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:50 p.m. Quebec reports 573 new cases, 85 more deaths; malls outside Montreal can reopen on Monday
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this item said the asylum motion had been presented by Québec solidaire. In fact, it was put forward by independent MNA Catherine Fournier Apologies for the error.)
Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a motion proposed by independent MNA Catherine Fournier recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on Monday, June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)

What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

4:45 p.m. Ontario blames Mother's Day gatherings for jump in COVID-19 cases
From The Canadian Press:
TORONTO - Mother's Day gatherings contrary to physical distancing rules helped boost Ontario's COVID-19 cases, the health minister said Monday, and those rising numbers plus concern over a large crowd at a Toronto park over the weekend are delaying any easing of those rules.
Ontario reported more than 400 new COVID-19 cases Monday for a fifth straight day, higher than the province has seen for several previous five-day periods.
That trend predates the province's Stage 1 of reopening launched on May 19, Health Minister Christine Elliott said.
"The increase in the number of cases that we're seeing now in the last few days really relates back to the week before, with the Mother's Day events and so on, people seeing families when they should not have been more than five people together," she said.
Premier Doug Ford himself has admitted that two of his daughters who don't live at home visited that weekend, in a group of at least six people. Provincial officials have told Ontarians to avoid being within two metres of anyone outside their household, and not to gather in groups larger than five.
4:42 p.m. Monkland Ave. comes back to life - at least a little bit
With the reopening of stores on Monday, there was a little more life on Monkland Ave. But it will require the reopening of the dining rooms of the street's myriad bars and restos - which are now mostly reduced to offering takeout - for it to return to being one of the city's more bustling streets.

4:25 p.m. Quebec to review status of asylum seekers on pandemic front lines
Quebec will review "one by one" the files of asylum seekers being employed on the pandemic front lines with the goal of accepting them officially as immigrants, Premier François Legault said Monday.
His apparent about-face came in response to pleas from lawyers and humanitarian groups calling for the normalization of the status of hundreds of these workers who are today risking their lives in long-term care residences (CHSLDs), where most of Quebec's COVID-19 deaths occurred.

3:30 p.m. Deciphering Quebec's deconfinement plan
As I mentioned earlier, Quebec today published a tentative deconfinement plan.
It includes some clues as to what will be reopening in the near future.
Unless there is an increase in COVID-19 cases, it appears that some tourism businesses, including campgrounds, could reopen in early June.
Outdoor pools and Montreal malls seem to be on track to reopen in mid to late June, according to the government's plan. Phase One of the reopening of restaurants would be in the same time frame, as would the return of team sports.
Religious services, gyms, cruises, mass gatherings and professional sports would return some time after that.
Quebec is currently in Phase 4.
3 p.m. Payments for Canada Emergency Response Benefit top $40 billion
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - A key federal benefit for Canadians out of work, or seeing large drops in their earnings, in the COVID-19 pandemic has paid out over $40 billion in emergency aid.
Federal figures posted Monday show payments from Canada Emergency Response Benefit now total $40.33 billion to 8.21 million separate applicants, pushing the program further beyond its $35-billion budget.
However, billions could be clawed back next year when the government taxes the earnings and recoups improperly paid benefits.

1:55 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:50 p.m. Quebec reports 573 new cases, 85 more deaths; malls outside Montreal can reopen on June 1
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this item said the asylum motion had been presented by Québec solidaire. In fact, it was put forward by independent MNA Catherine Fournier Apologies for the error.)
Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a motion proposed by independent MNA Catherine Fournier recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.
You can watch the press conference below:

12:35 p.m. 'It's inhumane' that so few rooms in CHSLDs have air conditioning: patient advocate
As the first heat wave of the year threatens to further distress residents of Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident has access to a cooler room to fend off the heat.
Here's our full story, by Jesse Feith.
12:30 p.m. How does Quebec compare to U.S. states? Not very well
Per-capita COVID-19 deaths in Ontario (15 per 100K) are higher than per-capita deaths in 31 U.S. states.
Per capita COVID-19 deaths in Quebec (49 per 100K) are higher than per-capita deaths in 43 U.S. states.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.
11 a.m. Bloc Québécois denounces Liberals, Conservatives for taking emergency federal aid
"I find it absolutely unacceptable" that other political parties are claiming COVID-19 payments via the wage subsidy, says Bloc Leader @yfblanchet
. "The Liberals don't need it and the Conservatives don't need it. Maybe the NDP needs it. Maybe the Greens need it. We do not."

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs
The Fête Nationale parade on St-Jean-Baptiste Day is cancelled and gatherings will have to be small this year due to the pandemic.
But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."
For more info, visit the SSJB's website
Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.
N'oubliez pas de respecter les règles de la santé publique lors de vos emplettes!
- Chantal Rouleau (@rouleauchantal) May 25, 2020
To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out hundreds of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.
[Let's take care of each other] ?????? Starting Monday, we will start giving out reusable face coverings at multiple métro stations. Let us remind you that wearing a face covering is strongly suggested when traveling by bus or by métro.

- STM (@stminfo) May 22, 2020
What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.
11 a.m. Bloc Québécois denounces Liberals, Conservatives for taking emergency federal aid
"I find it absolutely unacceptable" that other political parties are claiming COVID-19 payments via the wage subsidy, says Bloc Leader @yfblanchet
. "The Liberals don't need it and the Conservatives don't need it. Maybe the NDP needs it. Maybe the Greens need it. We do not."

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs
The Fête Nationale parade on St-Jean-Baptiste Day is cancelled and gatherings will have to be small this year due to the pandemic.
But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."
For more info, visit the SSJB's website
Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.
N'oubliez pas de respecter les règles de la santé publique lors de vos emplettes!

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out hundreds of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.
[Let's take care of each other] ?????? Starting Monday, we will start giving out reusable face coverings at multiple métro stations. Let us remind you that wearing a face covering is strongly suggested when traveling by bus or by métro.

- STM (@stminfo) May 22, 2020
What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

3:30 p.m. Deciphering Quebec's deconfinement plan
As I mentioned earlier, Quebec today published a tentative deconfinement plan.
It includes some clues as to what will be reopening in the near future.
Unless there is an increase in COVID-19 cases, it appears that some tourism businesses, including campgrounds, could reopen in early June.
Outdoor pools and Montreal malls seem to be on track to reopen in mid to late June, according to the government's plan. Phase One of the reopening of restaurants would be in the same time frame, as would the return of team sports.
Religious services, gyms, cruises, mass gatherings and professional sports would return some time after that.
Quebec is currently in Phase 4.
3 p.m. Payments for Canada Emergency Response Benefit top $40 billion
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - A key federal benefit for Canadians out of work, or seeing large drops in their earnings, in the COVID-19 pandemic has paid out over $40 billion in emergency aid.
Federal figures posted Monday show payments from Canada Emergency Response Benefit now total $40.33 billion to 8.21 million separate applicants, pushing the program further beyond its $35-billion budget.
However, billions could be clawed back next year when the government taxes the earnings and recoups improperly paid benefits.

1:55 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:50 p.m. Quebec reports 573 new cases, 85 more deaths; malls outside Montreal can reopen on June 1
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this item said the asylum motion had been presented by Québec solidaire. In fact, it was put forward by independent MNA Catherine Fournier Apologies for the error.)
Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a motion proposed by independent MNA Catherine Fournier recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.

12:35 p.m. 'It's inhumane' that so few rooms in CHSLDs have air conditioning: patient advocate
As the first heat wave of the year threatens to further distress residents of Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident has access to a cooler room to fend off the heat.

12:30 p.m. How does Quebec compare to U.S. states? Not very well

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?

The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a motion proposed by independent MNA Catherine Fournier recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.
11 a.m. Bloc Québécois denounces Liberals, Conservatives for taking emergency federal aid
"I find it absolutely unacceptable" that other political parties are claiming COVID-19 payments via the wage subsidy, says Bloc Leader @yfblanchet
. "The Liberals don't need it and the Conservatives don't need it. Maybe the NDP needs it. Maybe the Greens need it. We do not."

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs
The Fête Nationale parade on St-Jean-Baptiste Day is cancelled and gatherings will have to be small this year due to the pandemic.
But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."
For more info, visit the SSJB's website
Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out hundreds of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.
[Let's take care of each other] ?????? Starting Monday, we will start giving out reusable face coverings at multiple métro stations. Let us remind you that wearing a face covering is strongly suggested when traveling by bus or by métro.

What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

3:30 p.m. Deciphering Quebec's deconfinement plan
As I mentioned a bit earlier, Quebec today published a tentative deconfinement plan.
It includes some clues as to what will be reopening in the near future.
Unless there is an increase in COVID-19 cases, it appears that some tourism businesses, including campgrounds, could reopen in early June.
Outdoor pools and Montreal malls seem to be on track to reopen in mid to late June, according to the government's plan. Phase One of the reopening of restaurants would be in the same time frame, as would the return of team sports.
Religious services, gyms, cruises, mass gatherings and professional sports would return some time after that.
Quebec is currently in Phase 4.
3 p.m. Payments for Canada Emergency Response Benefit top $40 billion
From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - A key federal benefit for Canadians out of work, or seeing large drops in their earnings, in the COVID-19 pandemic has paid out over $40 billion in emergency aid.
Federal figures posted Monday show payments from Canada Emergency Response Benefit now total $40.33 billion to 8.21 million separate applicants, pushing the program further beyond its $35-billion budget.
However, billions could be clawed back next year when the government taxes the earnings and recoups improperly paid benefits.

Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a motion proposed by independent MNA Catherine Fournier recognizing the work of asylum seekers.

'It's inhumane' that so few rooms in CHSLDs have air conditioning: patient advocate

Full text: As a heat wave threatens to further distress residents of Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident has a way to fend off the heat.
But as many of the centres continue to fight COVID-19 outbreaks, even ensuring access to a shared space where those without air-conditioned rooms can cool down will prove challenging, Quebec's health minister acknowledged Monday.
That could mean many senior residents, already dealing with the stresses of the pandemic, could be confined to their rooms as temperatures are expected to reach upward of 30 Celsius in Montreal.
"It's inhumane, it's unsafe, it's uncomfortable and it's not the living environment that (Quebec) has talked about for so many years now," said patients-rights advocate Paul Brunet, head of the Conseil pour la protection des malades.
"People should not have to suffer 35- or 37-degree heat in their room," he added. "Is that too much to ask?"
Despite repeated calls over the years, it's estimated that only one-third of rooms in Quebec's long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, have air conditioning.
During past heat waves, centres without air-conditioned rooms would move residents into cooler areas in the home to help them escape the heat. But that might not be an option this week as it would risk further spreading the virus among residents.
"It's going to be more complicated this year," Health Minister Danielle McCann said Monday during the government's daily COVID-19 briefing. "For the three days we're going to live (this week), we're going to do our best."
Quebec Premier François Legault said his government put aside $30 million a year and a half ago to install "air-conditioned zones" in the centres. As of Monday, he said, 97 per cent of centres were equipped with the cool-down zones.
"Honestly, there's still work to be done," Legault said.
McCann said a plan was in the works to install more air-conditioning units in some centres as of June. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
The government has now accelerated the plan, McCann said, noting it's a bit surprising to be facing such high temperatures in May.
But Brunet said the government has no excuse for now finding itself scrambling to come up with solutions - advocates have been calling for more air-conditioned rooms in the centres for at least a decade.
Brunet's organization is now in talks with lawyers to request a court order that would force all regional health authorities to provide decent temperatures in every CHSLD in Quebec. Brunet believes it's a matter of life and death, noting that people die during heat waves each summer in Quebec
"We're going to lose people," Brunet said. "And each and every death that will occur because of the heat wave will be the government's responsibility."

From The Canadian Press:
OTTAWA - A key federal benefit for Canadians out of work, or seeing large drops in their earnings, in the COVID-19 pandemic has paid out over $40 billion in emergency aid.
Federal figures posted Monday show payments from Canada Emergency Response Benefit now total $40.33 billion to 8.21 million separate applicants, pushing the program further beyond its $35-billion budget.
However, billions could be clawed back next year when the government taxes the earnings and recoups improperly paid benefits.

Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a Québec solidaire motion recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs
The Fête Nationale parade on St-Jean-Baptiste Day is cancelled and gatherings will have to be small this year due to the pandemic.
But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."

Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out hundreds of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.

What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a Québec solidaire motion recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs

But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."

Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What is shopping like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out hundreds of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.

What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

1:55 p.m. Updated charts, maps 1:50 p.m. Quebec reports 573 new cases, 85 more deaths; malls outside Montreal can reopen on June 1
Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a Québec solidaire motion recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec is looking into the paid sick days for workers that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed at his briefing this morning. Legault said one question is who will pay for those days.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)
A reporter noted that very few Quebec long-term centres have air conditioning even as Montreal is preparing for a heatwave this week
Health Minister Danielle McCann said Quebec is working on a plan to create more air-conditioned areas in long-term care centres. Because the electrical service in many centres could not power air conditioning, the plan involves installing generator-powered units blowing cold air into the buildings.
But it was unclear from her answer whether some of these new areas could be in place this week.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

10:55 a.m. The STM is handing out 300,000 masks
Mayor Valérie Plante was at Langelier métro station this morning to help give out face masks. The STM says 300,000 of them will be handed out.

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

9:50 a.m. Fleur-de-lis masks up for grabs
The Fête Nationale parade on St-Jean-Baptiste Day is cancelled and gatherings will have to be small this year due to the pandemic.
But you can still celebrate the Fleur-de-lis, the Société St-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal says. It's selling Quebec-made blue masks. There are four styles, each featuring one or multiple fleur de lis. Price: $14.98. Some of the profits will go to "organizations in need."

Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.
9:25 a.m. What will shopping be like in reopened Montreal? Very different.
All eyes are on Montreal today as some retail businesses in the region reopen for the first time in more than two months. (Quebec reopened retail stores outside Montreal two weeks ago.)
Chantal Rouleau, the provincial minister responsible for the Montreal region, this morning wished businesses well and urged shoppers to practice physical distancing.
La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.
N'oubliez pas de respecter les règles de la santé publique lors de vos emplettes!

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out tens of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.
[Let's take care of each other] ?????? Starting Monday, we will start giving out reusable face coverings at multiple métro stations. Let us remind you that wearing a face covering is strongly suggested when traveling by bus or by métro.

- STM (@stminfo) May 22, 2020
What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

This item is being updated
Quebec has recorded 573 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,987, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
There were 85 new deaths reported. The death toll is now 4,069.
He said 43 of the newly reported deaths occurred over the past 24 hours.
Legault also said:
Quebec's immigration department will review the cases of asylum seekers who work in the province's seniors' centres to see if some of them could be treated as immigration applicants rather than refugees. He had previously rejected this idea and his Coalition Avenir Québec government recently rebuffed a Québec solidaire motion recognizing the work of asylum seekers.
Malls across Quebec (but not yet in Greater Montreal) can reopen on June 1.
Quebec has published a chart showing the reopening phases for the province. (See below)

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

10 a.m. Excitement, nervousness among retailers as Montreal reopens
Some business owners in the Montreal area said Sunday that they're preparing to find a new normal as Quebec prepares to further relax measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
Masks, plexiglass barriers, frequent distinfecting and no-touch browsing are some of the measures being put in place by retailers beginning Monday as the city becomes the final region in the province to be allowed to reopen retail stores, as long as they have a door to the outside.

Four styles of masks are available, including this one featuring the Quebec flag.

La semaine passée, j'étais avec Emile Roux de @DCV_Montreal en prévision de l'ouverture des commerces ayant pignon sur rue. Je souhaite à tous les commerces une belle première journée.

To help those taking buses and the métro to get to work or to shop, transit agencies are handing out tens of thousands of masks to riders starting today. Public health authorities say transit users should wear face coverings.
[Let's take care of each other] ?????? Starting Monday, we will start giving out reusable face coverings at multiple métro stations. Let us remind you that wearing a face covering is strongly suggested when traveling by bus or by métro.

What will shopping be like?
Very different.
Initially, store hours will be reduced to allow for thorough and more frequent cleaning. Outdoor lineups will be commonplace, with security guards watching over waiting shoppers.
Inside, customers can expect a very usual shopping experience, with masked employees, plexiglass barriers aplenty and multiple signs that underline hygiene measures and the importance of physical distancing.

10:35 a.m. How would you feel about a four-day work week?
That idea of a four-day work week recently got a boost when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern floated it, as a way to help the country as it reopens following the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it may not be as far-fetched as it would have seemed just a few months ago, before the shutdowns, which brought Canada, New Zealand and many countries around the world to a standstill.

10:30 a.m. Crunch time for Canada's big banks
To avoid a wave of defaults, Canada's big banks have allowed more than 700,000 Canadians to skip or defer mortgage payments since March. Those measures were announced with little discussion about what they meant for the bottom line.
That will change this week when the Big Six banks report earnings for the quarter ended April 30, starting with Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada on May 26.

11:50 a.m. Trudeau seeks 10 days of paid sick leave for workers
At his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will work with provinces to give 10 days of paid sick leave per year.
"Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills," he said.
Earlier today, federal New Democrats said they are conditioning their support for a plan to continue suspending full House of Commons sittings on real action from the Liberal government on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with COVID-19, The Canadian Press reported.
In his opening statement today, Trudeau said all Canadians have a responsibility to continue to practice physical distancing. Despite the nicer weather and the gradual reopening of the economy, "we're not out of the woods yet," he said.
Trudeau also urged commercial landlords to apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Applications opened this morning.
The prime minister did not answer when several reporters asked questions about his Liberal Party of Canada benefiting from the federal emergency wage subsidy that his government passed.
Among the unanswered questions: Why is his party taking it and did he anticipate that political parties would take it when the measure was brought in?
Instead of answering directly, Trudeau spoke in general about why the program is important to help Canadians. He said the government "needs to support Canadians regardless of the organization they work for."
The Conservatives and NDP are also taking the wage subsidy. The Bloc Québécois says it will not apply.
Trudeau was also asked if he's confident that Canada's health care system is ready for a second wave. In response, he said dozens of international flights have arrived with personal protective equipment and more are on the way. He said domestic production is also ramping up.

'It's inhumane' that so few rooms in CHSLDs have air conditioning: patient advocate

Full text: As a heat wave threatens to further distress residents of Quebec's long-term care centres this week, advocates are calling on the provincial government to ensure every resident has access to a cooler room to fend off the heat.
It's estimated only one-third of rooms in Quebec's long-term care centres, or CHSLDs, have air conditioning. And according to patients-rights advocate Paul Brunet, head of the Conseil pour la protection des malades, residents who do have access to air-conditioned rooms pay extra fees for them.
"It's inhumane, it's unsafe, it's uncomfortable and it's not the living environment that (Quebec) has talked about for so many years now," Brunet said Monday morning.
During past heat waves, centres without air conditioning would move residents into cooler areas in the home to help them cool down. But with the distancing measures in place as many centres continue to fight COVID-19 outbreaks, Brunet says that won't be an option this summer.
"People should not have to suffer 35- or 37-degree heat in their room," he said. "Is that too much to ask?"
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area Monday, warning temperatures will spike this week and could reach between 30 and 33 Celsius.
Brunet says his organization is in talks with lawyers to request a court order that would force all regional health authorities to provide decent temperatures in every CHSLD in Quebec - either through air conditioning or installing fresh air conducts to send cooler air through the building.
He believes it's a matter of life and death, noting that people die during heatwaves each summer in Quebec
"We're going to lose people," Brunet said. "And each and every death that will occur because of the heat wave will be the government's responsibility."

Heat waves will compound COVID misery; We know summer is coming, so we must start preparing for the soaring temperatures

Full text: It was a glorious weekend, signalling warmer days ahead. Indeed, spring has sprung and my itchy eyes confirm that trees will soon be covered in leaves a softer shade of green.
In a few weeks, I will be sneezing and scratching my head off, due to the seasonal allergies that have been the bane of my existence for the past 50 years.
How am I going to manage getting about with a mask covering my mouth and nose? I have no idea. Not touching my eyes during the itchy season has so far proven impossible.
Forecasters predict a very hot summer, punctuated by heat waves, meaning 30 degrees and over for three consecutive days or more.
In 2018, 66 Montrealers died during a heat wave that lasted from June 30 to July 5. The victims were predominantly old, poor or suffering from mental illness. In 2003, some 15,000 died in France during a Europe-wide heat wave that August.
Heat kills. Add COVID-19 to the mix and watch a perfect storm develop.
Unless we are hit by a blue cosmic flash that will make the virus disappear in time for la Saint-Jean, we may face hell on Earth. Are we ready? Last year, the Montreal General Hospital installed air-conditioning units in 70 of its rooms.
Hôpital Sacré-Coeur turned to its foundation, a charitable organization, to fund the purchase of units for sensitive areas such as palliative care, neurology and neurosurgery.
Only the newer CHUM and MUHC Glen campus are 100-per-cent air-conditioned.
It is estimated that only 30 per cent of Montreal's CHSLDs'patients'rooms are air-conditioned. Read that again.
Paul Brunet, president of the Conseil pour la protection des malades likes to point out that all office areas in health-related establishments are air-conditioned.
To counteract the lack of air-conditioning, hospitals have air-conditioned common rooms where patients can cool off.
Social distancing will probably put an end to this "privilege."
Patients will suffer, especially COVID-19 ones who have trouble breathing, as well as medical staff who wear such protective gear as masks, visors and coveralls often made of non-breathable synthetics.
The heat problem won't be confined to hospitals and residences.
During heat waves, many people seek relief inside shopping malls and movie theatres. Will they be open this summer? Will parks be accessible? Pools? What about wading pools for small children who don't tolerate heat as well as adults? What about Montreal's famed terrasses where cold beers and glasses of rosé cool people off while inducing a nice buzz as the sun goes down? I doubt it. I can't help but worry about the aged, the sick and poor families who live in cramped apartments of dubious salubrity. Who will make sure they are OK? What kind of help is planned when the temperature reaches 30 C? Dying of heat stroke in times of the coronavirus will become all too easy unless preventive and monitoring measures are implemented. The time to act is now.
Watching how the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, I get the impression that health authorities mostly react to what's right under their noses.
They were preparing hospitals for a tsunami of patients that never came, while CHSLDs were turning into hell holes. So then they turned their attention to CHSLDs. Always chasing the next disaster.
We know summer is coming. We know there will be heat waves. We know the virus will continue to be present in Montreal for a while, unless U.S. President Donald Trump is right and this very complicated virus disappears as soon as the temperature rises to the level that sends run-of-mill influenza viruses into hiding. It seems unlikely at this point, given its presence in hot countries and regions also.
Surviving the summer of 2020 may require more than masks and safe distancing. lravary@yahoo.com

Full text: It was a glorious weekend, signalling warmer days ahead. Indeed, spring has sprung and my itchy eyes confirm that trees will soon be covered in leaves a softer shade of green.
In a few weeks, I will be sneezing and scratching my head off, due to the seasonal allergies that have been the bane of my existence for the past 50 years.
How am I going to manage getting about with a mask covering my mouth and nose? I have no idea. Not touching my eyes during the itchy season has so far proven impossible.
Forecasters predict a very hot summer, punctuated by heat waves, meaning 30 degrees and over for three consecutive days or more.
In 2018, 66 Montrealers died( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/news/news/extreme-heat-66-deaths-in-montreal-in-2018/ ) during a heat wave that lasted from June 30 to July 5. The victims were predominantly old, poor or suffering from mental illness. In 2003, some 15,000 died in France during a Europe-wide heat wave that August.
Heat kills. Add COVID-19 to the mix and watch a perfect storm develop.
Unless we are hit by a blue cosmic flash that will make the virus disappear in time for la Saint-Jean, we may face hell on Earth. Are we ready?
Last year, the Montreal General Hospital installed air-conditioning units in 70 of its rooms. Hôpital Sacré-Coeur turned to its Foundation, a charitable organization, to fund the purchase of units for sensitive areas such as palliative care, neurology and neurosurgery. Only the newer CHUM and MUHC Glen campus are 100-per-cent air-conditioned.
It is estimated that only 30 per cent of Montreal's CHSLDs' patients' rooms( https://www.lesoleil.com/actualite/sante/climatisation-des-chsld-du-travail-a-faire-selon-les-retraites-du-secteur-public-57903743d718fe4e8265ed270ee4c705 ) are air-conditioned. Read that again.
Paul Brunet, president of the Conseil pour la protection des malades likes to point out that all office areas in health-related establishments are air-conditioned.
To counteract the lack of air-conditioning, hospitals have air-conditioned common rooms where patients can cool off. Social distancing will probably put an end to this "privilege."
Patients will suffer, especially COVID-19 ones who have trouble breathing, as well as medical staff who wear such protective gear as masks, visors and coveralls often made of non-breathable synthetics.
The heat problem won't be confined to hospitals and residences.
During heat waves, many people seek relief inside shopping malls and movie theatres. Will they be open this summer? Will parks be accessible? Pools? What about wading pools for small children who don't tolerate heat as well as adults? What about Montreal's famed terrasses where cold beers and glasses of rosé cool people off while inducing a nice buzz as the sun goes down?
I doubt it.
I can't help but worry about the aged, the sick and poor families who live in cramped apartments of dubious salubrity. Who will make sure they are OK? What kind of help is planned when the temperature reaches 30 C? Dying of heat stroke in times of the coronavirus will become all too easy unless preventive and monitoring measures are implemented. The time to act is now.
Watching how the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, I get the impression that health authorities mostly react to what's right under their noses. They were preparing hospitals for a tsunami of patients that never came, while CHSLDs were turning into hell holes. So then they turned their attention to CHSLDs. Always chasing the next disaster.
We know summer is coming. We know there will be heat waves. We know the virus will continue to be present in Montreal for a while, unless U.S. President Donald Trump is right and this very complicated virus disappears as soon as the temperature rises to the level that sends run-of-mill influenza viruses into hiding. It seems unlikely at this point, given its presence in hot countries and regions also.
Surviving the summer of 2020 may require more than masks and safe distancing.

Mayor Valérie Plante wants Montrealers to start wearing face masks

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/mayor-valérie-plante-wants-montrealers-start/docview/2396015765/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: None available.

Links: https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=ProQ:&amp;issn=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;title=Mayor+Val%C3%A9rie+Plante+wants+Montrealers+to+start+wearing+face+masks&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020&amp;atitle=Mayor+Val%26eacute%3Brie+Plante+wants+Montrealers+to+start+wearing+face+masks&amp;au=&amp;id=&amp;isbn=

Full text: Face masks will become an indispensable summer accessory under new public health guidelines outlined Tuesday by Mayor Valérie Plante and the regional public health department.
"Whether you're going for a walk or a bike ride, or you're going to the grocery (store) or to the pharmacy or taking public transport, I definitely invite you to wear a face covering as one of the ways to protect yourself and also protect others," Plante said during a press conference held via Facebook and telephone conference call.
It won't be mandatory to wear a mask, whether homemade or purchased, and you won't be stopped by police for not doing so, the mayor added.
But given that it is difficult in a densely populated city to keep two metres away from others at all times, it's safer for everyone if people cover their faces, she said, showing off a fabric mask that she keeps on hand at all times.
"A face covering must become the social norm," regional public health director Mylène Drouin said.
The Montreal transit authority is providing reusable cloth masks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-to-hand-out-homemade-masks-to-employees-who-request-them/ ) to all employees who request them.
Plante said the city has ordered 50,000 reusable masks that will be supplied to community organizations to distribute to vulnerable people, like the homeless.
The new health advice is not a substitute for washing hands, using sanitizer or coughing into your elbow, nor does it mean you can start disregarding rules on social distancing, Plante said. But it's one more tool to help prevent COVID-19 cases from escalating when elementary schools and businesses reopen in the coming weeks.
People are urged to make or purchase their own reusable fabric mask( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/colourful-masks-address-need-during-bleak-times/ ), but not to use medical-grade masks needed in the health-care sector.
Plante took back her earlier criticism of the Quebec government for pressing the restart button on the Montreal economy later than it's doing in the rest of the province. On Friday, she objected when Premier François Legault said businesses in greater Montreal might not reopen at the same time as those in other regions of Quebec.
But on Tuesday, Plante said she had come around to Legault's way of thinking, given that the island of Montreal is still the epicentre of the pandemic with 12,487 cases and 1,039 deaths to date.
Legault announced( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-legault-to-announce-plan-to-reopen-quebec-businesses-economy/ ) that stores with outside entrances will reopen on May 11 in the Montreal region, compared to May 4 in the rest of Quebec.
"I think it was the right thing to do," Plante said.
The mayor said she was not yet ready to announce if and when playgrounds, playing fields, day camps, libraries and pools will open this summer, saying those decisions will depend on provincial health policy and the evolution of the pandemic.
Helping Montrealers in densely populated neighbourhoods stay cool if pools, wading pools, libraries and air-conditioned malls remain closed could be "a big challenge," Plante added.
The city will need to find innovative ways to keep residents safe if summer temperatures soar to deadly levels, she said. In 2018, 66 Montrealers - many of them seniors, people with chronic conditions and residents of densely populated, low-income neighbourhoods - died in a heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave/ ).
"We'll have to think outside the box," Plante said.
Plante has promised to unveil a plan to help relaunch the city's economy in May.
With festivals cancelled, restaurants closed and theatres shuttered, Plante said she would be calling on higher levels of government to throw a lifeline to the city's tourism and hospitality industries.
"They have more substantial sources of revenue to support those sectors that really need help," she said.

Full text: It's the end of the line for King and Maximus, Marilyn and Maya, and the rest of the gentle draft horses that live in an aging stable in Montreal's Griffintown neighbourhood.
Weather permitting, they will wheel their carriages out for the last time on Dec. 31, past the construction sites and new condo towers that have popped up like mushrooms, making their way to the cobblestoned streets of Old Montreal. Their hoofbeats hearken back to a bygone era, but soon they will be heard no more.
As of Jan. 1, the city has banned horse-drawn guided carriage tours, citing heightened concern over animal welfare and a series of high-profile incidents involving the horses that spawned a wave of outrage and concern from citizens.
Depending on whom you ask, it's a victory for the rights of the long-suffering horses or a tragic loss of a piece of the city's heritage.
For Nathalie Matte, who has worked as a driver for 11 years, it's the latter.
The horses "are what makes Old Montreal magic; it's not the lights," the 52-year-old said during a recent open house at the stables in Griffintown, as she finished the final harness adjustments on Knockout, a chestnut gelding.
"It will be the first time you won't have the sound of horses there."

Matte, who became captivated by the horses while working another job in Old Montreal, vehemently denies the animals in the industry are mistreated.
"He weighs 2,000 pounds; I weigh 90," the 52-year-old said as she patted Knockout, who wore a dapper top hat perched atop his bridle. "If he didn't want to go out, I couldn't make him."
But for opponents of the industry, including the current municipal administration, the horse-drawn carriages, known as calèches, belong in the city's past.
"With heat waves in summer, climate change, extreme cold in the winter, construction and the number of vehicles on the road, we have a serious question on the animals' safety," Coun. Sterling Downey told reporters recently at City Hall.
He pointed to a number of incidents involving the horses in the last few years, including one video of a collision between a horse and a car, and another that showed a horse down on the ground after slipping on a metal grate. In 2018, a horse fell and died in the middle of a guided tour.
Downey insisted the administration has done everything it can to ease the transition, including giving a full year's notice. They have worked with the provincial labour department to help calèche drivers find other work and have offered to pay the owners $1,000 per horse to retire the animals.
As of mid-December, only one owner had taken advantage of the buyback - a sign, Downey said, that the horses are still being used in other jurisdictions that may suit them better.
"We're confident in the position we've taken and the actions we've taken," Downey told reporters. "We've been more than respectful. We've tried to do everything, taking into consideration this has an impact on people's lives and livelihoods."
But many of the calèche drivers and owners, some of whom have invested tens of thousands of dollars in their businesses, say they risk losing everything and don't know how to move on from an industry where many have worked for decades.
Luc Desparois, who runs the city's largest calèche operation and who works out of the Griffintown stable, said he's not done fighting.
On Dec. 16, he and a group of owners filed a court injunction in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the ban, arguing the drivers have the right to make a living. In court filings, they argued the drivers would suffer serious financial harm due to loss of income and would have to go into debt to support themselves and their animals.
Quebec Superior Court Justice Michel A. Pinsonnault refused the request, ruling that drivers didn't demonstrate that an emergency injunction is needed, and the request was brought far too late in the game.
Pinsonnault did note that the case brought by the group deserved to be heard on its merits.
In an interview at the stable prior to the injunction request, Desparois described the ban as "political," motivated by a small group of activists and city politicians eager to free up the valuable stable land for development.
He said his horses are well-treated and he has the veterinary records to prove it. His stable, a converted sawmill without a paddock or box stalls, may not be fancy - but it is safe, he insists.
At the Griffintown open house, children played in the yard and adults sipped coffee as the horses stood tied in the aisle, accepting carrots and pats from the crowd.
"They say the horses are being hurt doing this. They say the horses aren't happy doing this?" Desparois said, gesturing at the scene. "Prove it, and I'll stop tomorrow."
He said that for years, the city refused simple requests to make things better, including installing poles to tie the horses on the street in Old Montreal for the safety of animals and pedestrians. He also blames the city for the incident of the horse slipping on the metal grate, saying drivers aren't informed of roadwork. Calèche drivers try to cover the plates with rubber mats, he says, but they're removed.
For now, Desparois doesn't want to speculate about what he'll do after the ban, refusing to accept the end of the industry.
"I don't want to let this go, because it's a bunch of lies," he said.
Cynthia Grahame, a Montrealer who has followed the story, said she has mixed feelings about the end of the industry.
She agrees that downtown Montreal, with the heat, traffic and construction, is "not a safe or appropriate place for the animals." At the same time, it's hard to see them go.
"It's sad to see all the life go from the city," she said in an interview.
Now Grahame worries about the uncertain future of the animals, some of which she says have been seen for sale on classified sites such as Kijiji.
She wonders whether it might not have been better to explore an alternative solution, such as moving the calèches to a safer area like Mount Royal.
"Is this the best the city and the SPCA can do?" she asked.

Matte, who became captivated by the horses while working another job in Old Montreal, vehemently denies the animals in the industry are mistreated.
"He weighs 2,000 pounds; I weigh 90," the 52-year-old said as she patted Knockout, who wore a dapper top hat perched atop his bridle. "If he didn't want to go out, I couldn't make him."
But for opponents of the industry, including the current municipal administration, the horse-drawn carriages, known as calèches, belong in the city's past.
"With heat waves in summer, climate change, extreme cold in the winter, construction and the number of vehicles on the road, we have a serious question on the animals' safety," Coun. Sterling Downey told reporters recently at City Hall.
He pointed to a number of incidents involving the horses in the last few years, including one video of a collision between a horse and a car, and another that showed a horse down on the ground after slipping on a metal grate. In 2018, a horse fell and died in the middle of a guided tour.
Downey insisted the administration has done everything it can to ease the transition, including giving a full year's notice. They have worked with the provincial labour department to help calèche drivers find other work and have offered to pay the owners $1,000 per horse to retire the animals.
As of mid-December, only one owner had taken advantage of the buyback - a sign, Downey said, that the horses are still being used in other jurisdictions that may suit them better.
"We're confident in the position we've taken and the actions we've taken," Downey told reporters. "We've been more than respectful. We've tried to do everything, taking into consideration this has an impact on people's lives and livelihoods."
But many of the calèche drivers and owners, some of whom have invested tens of thousands of dollars in their businesses, say they risk losing everything and don't know how to move on from an industry where many have worked for decades.
Luc Desparois, who runs the city's largest calèche operation and who works out of the Griffintown stable, said he's not done fighting.
On Dec. 16, he and a group of owners filed a court injunction in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the ban, arguing the drivers have the right to make a living. In court filings, they argued the drivers would suffer serious financial harm due to loss of income and would have to go into debt to support themselves and their animals.
Quebec Superior Court Justice Michel A. Pinsonnault refused the request, ruling that drivers didn't demonstrate that an emergency injunction is needed, and the request was brought far too late in the game.
Pinsonnault did note that the case brought by the group deserved to be heard on its merits.
In an interview at the stable prior to the injunction request, Desparois described the ban as "political," motivated by a small group of activists and city politicians eager to free up the valuable stable land for development.
He said his horses are well-treated and he has the veterinary records to prove it. His stable, a converted sawmill without a paddock or box stalls, may not be fancy - but it is safe, he insists.
At the Griffintown open house, children played in the yard and adults sipped coffee as the horses stood tied in the aisle, accepting carrots and pats from the crowd.
"They say the horses are being hurt doing this. They say the horses aren't happy doing this?" Desparois said, gesturing at the scene. "Prove it, and I'll stop tomorrow."
He said that for years, the city refused simple requests to make things better, including installing poles to tie the horses on the street in Old Montreal for the safety of animals and pedestrians. He also blames the city for the incident of the horse slipping on the metal grate, saying drivers aren't informed of roadwork. Calèche drivers try to cover the plates with rubber mats, he says, but they're removed.
For now, Desparois doesn't want to speculate about what he'll do after the ban, refusing to accept the end of the industry.
"I don't want to let this go, because it's a bunch of lies," he said.
Cynthia Grahame, a Montrealer who has followed the story, said she has mixed feelings about the end of the industry.
She agrees that downtown Montreal, with the heat, traffic and construction, is "not a safe or appropriate place for the animals." At the same time, it's hard to see them go.
"It's sad to see all the life go from the city," she said in an interview.
Now Grahame worries about the uncertain future of the animals, some of which she says have been seen for sale on classified sites such as Kijiji.
She wonders whether it might not have been better to explore an alternative solution, such as moving the calèches to a safer area like Mount Royal.
"Is this the best the city and the SPCA can do?" she asked.

Full text: The clip-clopping of horses slowly meandering through the windy streets of Old Montreal are soon to be a thing of the past.
Calèche drivers lost a last-ditch legal bid Friday to save their industry against a ban that comes into force on Jan. 1, but they have vowed to continue the fight.
"I'm very disappointed," said Luc Desparois, the owner of Services des calèches et traineau Lucky Luc. Desparois told a huddled mass of reporters at the courthouse he still intends to challenge the city's bylaw. "We'll keep fighting. They are taking away our livelihood."
Desparois filed the request for a temporary injunction this week, asking the court to temporarily suspend the city's bylaw ending the practice until a judge can rule on whether it is legal. Desparois said he waited just before the ban was enacted because he was concerned the city would make his life more difficult.
"And as soon as I said I was going to challenge the law, I got two tickets in the mail from the city; two tickets means I lose a permit for a year, and I have to pay for a lawyer and go to court."
Desparois's lawyer, Audi Gozlan, pleaded for the injunction, saying the situation was urgent. He argued the December holiday period is a crucial revenue period for owners of horse-drawn carriages, because there are many tourists in town. Gozlan also argued the city has no authority to abolish the horse-drawn carriage industry because that is under provincial jurisdiction.
He had hoped a judge would grant a temporary injunction as an emergency measure so that the calèches could continue operating through the new year. However, in the end, the judge agreed with the city's lawyer, who argued that there is no urgency in this case, because the owners had knowledge of the bylaw 16 months ago.
"They're coming here at one minute to midnight and arguing it's an emergency," lawyer Mélissandre Asselin-Blain argued. "But this is an emergency of their own making."
Gozlan said he still intends to challenge the legality of the law, and hopes to argue on the merits of the case in the next few weeks.
"The judge has not (ruled on the merits of the case) yet, but he simply said it's not urgent to decide this question," he said. "It will be decided later on. Hopefully, in a week or two, we'll be back in court to go over this question."
When Valérie Plante was elected in 2017, one of her campaign pledges was to put an end to the industry.
Incidents like horses collapsing in extreme heat have demonstrated that the calèche industry is inhumane, city councillor and deputy mayor Sterling Downey said this week.
"With heat waves in the summer, with climate change, with extreme colds in the winter, with construction on the roads, with the amount of vehicles that are on the road, we have a serious question on the animals'safety," he said.
Gozlan has argued the horses are well treated, and the decision of the city to put an end to the industry will mean a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars for Desparois and other calèche owners.
Because the permits were only issued once by the city, they have a high resale value, with some people spending up to $200,000 for the permits. There are a little more than 20 permits in force in the city of Montreal, and about 50 horse drivers are operating under those permits. Those permits all expire on Jan. 1. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder Facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Gozlan said he still intends to challenge the legality of the law, and hopes to argue on the merits of the case in the next few weeks.
Lawyer Audi Gozlan, left, spoke to caleche drivers at the Palais de Justice Dec. 20, 2019.
"The judge has not (ruled on the merits of the case) yet, but he simply said it's not urgent to decide this question," he said. "It will be decided later on. Hopefully, in a week or two, we'll be back in court to go over this question."
When Valérie Plante was elected in 2017, one of her campaign pledges was to put an end to the industry.
Incidents like horses collapsing in extreme heat have demonstrated that the calèche industry is inhumane, city councillor and deputy mayor Sterling Downey said this week.
"With heat waves in the summer, with climate change, with extreme colds in the winter, with construction on the roads, with the amount of vehicles that are on the road, we have a serious question on the animals' safety," he said.
Gozlan has argued the horses are well treated, and the decision of the city to put an end to the industry will mean a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars for Desparois and other calèche owners.
Because the permits were only issued once by the city, they have a high resale value, with some people spending up to $200,000 for the permits. There are a little more than 20 permits in force in the city of Montreal, and about 50 horse drivers are operating under those permits. Those permits all expire on Jan. 1.

Calèche drivers lost a last-ditch legal bid( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-scolds-caleche-owners-over-11th-hour-bid-to-halt-ban ) Friday to save their industry against a ban that comes into force on Jan. 1, but they have vowed to continue the fight.
"I'm very disappointed," said Luc Desparois, the owner of Services des calèches et traineau Lucky Luc. With his hair slicked back in a ponytail, wearing a dark brown suit with a red tie, Desparois told a huddled mass of reporters at the courthouse he still intends to challenge the city's bylaw. "We'll keep fighting. They are taking away our livelihood."
Luc Desparois, owner of Services des calèches et traineau Lucky Luc, enters the Montreal courthouse on Dec. 20, 2019.
Desparois filed the request for a temporary injunction this week, asking the court to temporarily suspend the city's bylaw ending the practice until a judge can rule on whether it is legal. Desparois said he waited just before the ban was enacted because he was concerned the city would make his life more difficult.
"And as soon as I said I was going to challenge the law, I got two tickets in the mail from the city; two tickets means I lose a permit for a year, and I have to pay for a lawyer and go to court."
Desparois's lawyer, Audi Gozlan, pleaded for the injunction, saying the situation was urgent. He argued the December holiday period is a crucial revenue period for owners of horse-drawn carriages, because there are many tourists in town. Gozlan also argued the city has no authority to abolish the horse-drawn carriage industry because that is under provincial jurisdiction.
He had hoped a judge would grant a temporary injunction as an emergency measure so that the calèches could continue operating through the new year. However, in the end, the judge agreed with the city's lawyer, who argued that there is no urgency in this case, because the owners had knowledge of the bylaw 16 months ago.

Full text: The owners of the city's horsedrawn carriages will learn Friday morning if they will continue their livelihoods in the new year.
A judge is expected to rule on an injunction request from the owners to temporarily suspend the city's bylaw banning the practice, which is due to come into force on Jan. 1.
Lawyers for the owners and the city were in court Thursday arguing their case. The owners say the city is outside its authority to abolish the horse-drawn carriage industry because it is provincial jurisdiction.
"You can't prohibit something that is outside your jurisdiction," said Audi Gozlan, who represents Luc Desparois, owner of Services des calèches et traineau Lucky Luc.
"Especially when the balance of inconvenience tells you that these people are going to lose everything because of this decision."
The city has 15 permits outstanding, which give owners the permission to own and operate horse-drawn carriages, but a bylaw adopted in 2018 would rescind those permits as of Jan. 1.
Gozlan said because the permits were only issued once by the city, they have a high resale value, with some people spending up to $200,000 for the permits.
He added that December and the beginning of January are considered to be high season for the drivers because of the high number of tourists in town, so repealing the permits on Jan. 1 will be punitive for the drivers.
However, the city has said the calèche drivers are misusing the legal system in this case.
They argue that the bylaw was enacted in August 2018, so the drivers have known about it for 16 months and they can't claim there is an urgency just because they failed to act in time.
"They're coming here at one minute to midnight and arguing it's an emergency," lawyer Mélissandre Asselin-Blain argued. "But this is an emergency of their own making."
This is the second time in four years the calèche industry has had to defend its fate in court.
Gozlan represented the drivers in 2016 when then-mayor Denis Coderre wanted to put a moratorium on the practice for a year.
A judge ruled in favour of the drivers and granted a temporary injunction.
Coderre then settled with the drivers, agreeing to let them continue the practice and promising a horse-themed amusement park within the city.
When Valérie Plante was elected in 2017, one of her campaign pledges was to put an end to the industry.
Incidents like horses collapsing in extreme heat have demonstrated that the calèche industry is inhumane, city councillor and deputy mayor Sterling Downey said this week.
"With heat waves in the summer, with climate change, with extreme colds in the winter, with construction on the roads, with the amount of vehicles that are on the road, we have a serious question on the animals'safety," he said.
Desparois refuted the city's claims, saying the horses are well treated.
"We've gotten tickets, but we fought them successfully in court," Desparois said. "There is no evidence that the horses are mistreated. We have a good relationship with our horses."
He said the owners waited until now to file their injunction because they don't have a lot of means to afford lawyers.
"I don't have a big budget, and I just finished with a judgment against the city of Montreal (where a fine imposed by the city was deemed invalid)," he said.
If the injunction is granted, both parties will return to court early next year to argue on the merits of the case. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder Facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

Calèche owner asks judge to overturn upcoming ban; Man says he intends to prove horses are well cared for and suited to the work

Full text: Calèche owner Luc Desparois filed an injunction Monday to try to get a Superior Court judge to strike down the city of Montreal's bylaw that will ban horse-drawn carriages in the city as of Jan. 1, 2020.
Desparois, owner of Services des caleches et traineau Lucky Luc, is one of about 15 remaining owners of calèche permits who say the city has unfairly deprived them of their livelihood because of what he considers misplaced concerns about the welfare of the horses.
"Enough with the fake news, enough with the lies," Desparois said in a telephone interview. "We want to be able to work and keep our jobs."
Desparois said he plans to prove in court that the calèche horses are well cared for and suited to the work, through testimony from veterinarians and other experts. He said animal welfare organizations and the mayor of Montreal are simply wrong to say that it is bad for horses to pull carriages in hot weather or in Montreal traffic. He said calèche drivers have been subject to insults and threats by strangers in the streets since the city announced in the summer of 2018 that it would ban the practice.
"Everybody is crying for the horses," he said. "People have to wake up and learn what a horse is, because horses live outside 12 months a year, so 28 degrees is nothing for them. Pulling a carriage in Montreal is nothing for them. We have all the proof and we will be showing it. This is enough. They are crying for horses while people are suffering, and they are crying for nothing."
Only one calèche owner has accepted the city's offer of $1,000 to "retire" former carriage horses once Montreal's calèche ban takes effect on New Year's Eve at midnight.
"We would have liked to have more than one," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for carriage horses, at a press conference Monday on the front porch of city hall.
Parenteau said last April that he expected owners of 30 of the approximately 50 remaining calèche horses to take the buyback offer of $1,000 per horse. The horses would be retired to rural settings under a program established in conjunction with Le Refuge de Galahad, a horse-rescue organization.
"We expect to get more requests after Dec. 31," he said Monday.
He added that he also hoped the remaining calèche drivers would take advantage of a program to help them retrain for other tourism jobs, for example, as guides for walking tours.
Parenteau said the calèche industry has declined in recent years because of increased public awareness of animal welfare.
He reacted to the news of the injunction by saying owners have had a full year to prepare for the end of the industry.
The city announced in June 2018 that a municipal bylaw adopted that August would eliminate horse-drawn carriages, once a familiar sight in Old Montreal and on Mount Royal, by the end of 2019.
Last April, it announced the buyback program for former calèche horses after owners warned that horses would end up going to slaughterhouses if banned from city streets. The $1,000 is more than the $500 to $800 that abattoirs pay for a horse, Parenteau said.
On Monday, he said the fact that only one driver has taken the offer shows that calèche owners intend to carry on their business outside of Montreal, for example at sugar shacks, apple orchards and weddings.
Anita Kapuscinska, spokesperson for the Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said her organization is not worried about the injunction.
"We are confident in the validity of the city's bylaw. We understand that the owners of the horses are waiting to see how that rolls out before potentially contacting us for our program," Kapuscinska said. "It's not surprising that only one horse has so far participated in the program and with the injunction, we understand that the owners of the horses are waiting to see what happens next."
Chamie Cadorette, founder of Le Refuge de Galahad, said the one horse - Sissi - that was adopted through the "retirement" program last month is adapting very well to her new home. She was adopted by two veterinarians who live in the Eastern Townships.
"We are really happy about Sissi because now we know she will have a beautiful end of life and not go to the slaughterhouse," Cadorette said. "After all the years she gave of work, that she is not ending up as steak is important to us. It's a kind of recognition for her."
Incidents like horses collapsing in extreme heat have demonstrated that the calèche industry is inhumane, said city councillor and deputy mayor Sterling Downey, who accompanied Parenteau at the press conference.
"With heat waves in the summer, with climate change, with extreme colds in the winter, with construction on the roads, with the amount of vehicles that are on the road, we have a serious question on the animals'safety," he said.
"People have to understand that these animals don't just work in Montreal," Downey added.
Also starting Jan. 1, all cats and dogs in Montreal will be required to be neutered and microchipped. When it comes time to renew a pet's licence, owners will need to submit proof both procedures have been done, Downey noted. mlalonde@postmedia.com mscott@postmedia.com

"We would have liked to have more than one," said Jean-Franc?ois Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for carriage horses, at a press conference Monday on the front porch of city hall.

Full text: Sombre start to this Saturday, with news of a fatal fire in Lachine.
Arson investigation after apartment fire in Lachine claims 2 lives:( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lachine-fire-that-claimed-life-of-woman-child-being-investigated-as-arson )A fire in an apartment building in the Lachine borough in Montreal on Friday night cost the lives of an 8-year-old girl and a 40-year-old woman. Despite their resuscitation efforts, the two were declared dead on the scene by firefighters and paramedics, according to Matthew Griffith, head of the prevention section at the Service de sécurité incendie de Montréal (SIM). The flames broke out around 11 p.m. Friday in the 51-unit building located on Duff Court St., near the corner of Esther-Blondin St. Three others in the same unit were taken to the hospital, including a five-year-old girl who was still in critical condition on Saturday morning. Two boys, aged 13, also suffered injuries, but their lives are not in danger. Seventy firefighters were called to the scene. Because of the two fatalities, the investigation has been turned over to the arson unit of the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
West-coast heatwave abates: Yes, while we are pulling on boots and frantically trying to get the winter tires put on, the west coast has a different problem. Scientists say a marine heat wave that blanketed a large area of the west coast has weakened, but the potential disruption to ocean life isn't over yet. Nate Mantua of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the "good news" is that the area of exceptionally warm water is substantially smaller now than it was earlier this year. And while the area about 1,500 kilometres offshore between Hawaii and Alaska is still seeing high temperatures by historical standards, it is "simply not nearly as large as it was and it is no longer strong in areas near the west coast," he said. Scientists have been watching a marine heat wave that developed around June this year and resembled a phenomenon that was nicknamed 'The Blob,' which disrupted ocean life between 2014 and 2016. The heat wave, which resembles a wedge this time, stretched from south of Vancouver Island to Baja, Calif., and offshore towards Hawaii. It raised temperatures by up to 4 C.
Georgian police arrest more than 25 in clashes at gay movie premiere: Police in Tbilisi, Georgia said on Saturday they had arrested more than 25 people after ultra-nationalist protesters attempting to derail the premiere of an award-winning movie about gay love clashed with security forces. A few hundred demonstrators blocked the road outside a cinema in the capital's city centre on Friday ahead of the first screening of And Then We Danced, which tells the story of two young male Georgian ballet dancers falling in love. Chanting "Long live Georgia" and "Shame," the protesters - some holding crosses and religious icons - tried to force their way inside the cinema but were held back by riot police. "This is not just a movie. This is an insult to our faith, our traditions and all that is holy for us," said Guram Damenia, who came dressed in a traditional Georgian costume. Two police officers and a young woman, who was trying to go watch the film, were injured, police said. The movie premiered at the Cannes film festival in May and has won awards at festivals around the world.

Cities turn to urban forests to combat climate change: As populations increase and temperatures rise, experts see urban parks and trees vital as 'natural air conditioners'

Author: Israelson, David

Full text: Halifax is mitigating the effects of climate change by making it easier for people to get lost in the woods - within city limits.
Backed by funding from all three government levels and fundraising through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the city is building the Halifax Wilderness Park, a 380-acre tract of Acadian forest, just five kilometres from downtown.
The $8-million project provides ecological and recreational value, says Richard Harvey, manager of policy and planning for the municipality's parks and recreation programs.
"We hope it changes the way people look at where they live, so they see themselves as more connected to nature within the city."
The park, with woods of jack pine trees and broom crowberry shrubs, is part of a trend of cities around the world trying to literally shift the ground to combat the negative effects of climate change.
Whereas a few years ago, municipalities might have permitted developers to pave paradise, now cities are using those spaces to create parks - and developers are using this as a selling point. Although it's protected land in most cases, they realize that commercial, residential and live/work projects are more attractive to buyers, tenants and companies seeking to locate offices if there are trees and green space nearby.
"Developers see parks as a way to attract skilled employees," says Sean Malone, chief executive officer of the Dorothea Dix Park Conservancy in Raleigh, N.C. The city is creating a 308-acre park, in this case on the site of a former mental-health hospital, a 15-minute walk from the downtown core.
"Not only do residents who live and work nearby like having a park, it makes property in the area more valuable, the city a better place for high-end employers to locate, and establishes stores and dining places that serve their employees," says Mr. Malone. "As populations and densities increase, a city park lets people breathe in and say, 'Ahh!'"
Mr. Malone agrees that more parks mean more business, pointing to data analysis by the not-for-profit U.S. Trust for Public Land. It shows that every dollar invested in parks - whether it's a small green space or expansive grounds - generates US$20.84 in direct and indirect economic benefits, including increased tourist spending and more efficient storm-water management.
Urban parks and trees also provide cost-effective ways to control and moderate climate change, says Jake Tobin Garrett, policy and planning manager for Park People, a national not-for-profit group that supports the creation and maintenance of parks in Canadian cities and towns.
"Think of green spaces as natural air conditioners," he says, "but a lot cheaper and longer-lasting than air-conditioning units - and trees don't burn fuel and emit carbon fumes."
A study released by Park People in September identifies three significant ways increased parkland addresses climate change. First, an urban tree canopy provides shade and shields heat-absorbing pavement and concrete from the sun. Trees absorb water from the earth and release it as a cooling vapour - think of dewy grass in the morning.
Second, adequate urban green space is critical to controlling the effects of severe storms and costly flooding by absorbing water that would otherwise cause sewer and drainage systems to overflow. Root systems can also prevent erosion and landslides.
Third, trees and greenery absorb carbon from the air. According to a study by The Global Tree Restoration Potential, published by Science magazine in July, there's enough land around the world available for tree planting to cut carbon emissions by 25 per cent.
"This would erase nearly 100 years of carbon emissions," say Mr. Garrett, "and apparently Canada has 79 million acres (31.5 million hectares) available for planting."
Janet McKay, executive director of LEAF (Local Enhancement and Appreciation of Forests), a Toronto-based not-for-profit, points to a recent report by the Green Infrastructure Ontario Coalition, which shows that there are more than 34 million trees in the Greater Toronto Area, providing canopy cover for 26 per cent of the total land area. According to the report, to replace these trees would cost $14.2-billion.
Halifax and Winnipeg are both currently scrambling to replace thousands of trees that were lost in recent weather disasters - Hurricane Dorian and an early winter storm, respectively.
"Creating and replacing urban forests doesn't mean just planting any old trees either," Ms. McKay says. "You have to plant the right species and provide them with the right kinds of soil and take care of them too. Over the years, for example, we have planted a lot of Norway maple trees, which are not as resilient as other species, so we need more variety."
The creation of parks and green spaces, too, is failing to keep pace with growing cities, says Mr. Garrett.
"Vancouver has a 25-year plan to add green space, but in the last 25 years, even though the amount of parkland has grown, so has the population," he says. "The amount of park per 1,000 residents has actually declined."
In addition to their storm-protection, carbon-capture and cooling functions, city trees are necessary to keep people healthy, he says.
The heat wave that hit Montreal two summers ago has been blamed for 66 deaths, many occurring in neighbourhoods identified by the city's public health department as "heat islands" - tree-impoverished areas in which temperatures can be as much as five degrees Celsius warmer than nearby treed areas.
Carly Ziter, an assistant biology professor at Montreal's Concordia University, has been collecting data on to what degree street trees cool the air at local scales. Her report, published this year, found that significant temperature differences can exist between treed and barren areas that are just a few hundred metres apart, and that tree canopy needs to cover 40 per cent of a neighbourhood to have a cooling effect.
Mr. Garrett cannot stress enough the urgent need to build more urban parks, green spaces and wooded areas, such as the Halifax Wilderness Park.
"In areas that are devastated by extreme heat, nothing compares with green space as a solution to keep a neighbourhood cooler," Mr. Garrett says. "Trees and parks can be life-saving."

Full text: Welcome to no-drama Canada.
The Canadian vote is only 37 days off, but we're not paying much attention. We're too glued to more spectacular dramas playing in England and the U.S.
Many of us are binging on Brexit, a British thriller with way bigger ratings than The Crown.
The plot: New PM Boris Johnson suspends Parliament hoping to sneak through a no-deal Brexit, but Parliament courageously revolts and outvotes him. Boris then kicks 21 members out of his party - and his own brother quits.
What happens next? Will England leave the EU? Will Scotland leave the U.K.? Will the Queen leave England for safe refuge in Ottawa? Stay tuned for more great British drama!
Meanwhile, the daily drama factory to our south is equally binge and cringeworthy. In the latest episodes, President Trump tries to buy Greenland, then plays Meteorologist-in-Chief by predicting Hurricane Dorian will hit Alabama - and proving it with a weather map doctored by a Sharpie.
When U.S. national meteorologists disagree, the government threatens to fire them - and maybe even cancel all weather predictions except the president's.
What happens next? Will the president play medical researcher and announce a cure for cancer - Diet Coke (his favourite drink) - then order national cola vaccinations?
Meanwhile, here in slow-news Canada, a recent poll shows our two largest parties' leaders are both seen more unfavourably than favourably - and the election is an unpopularity contest.
I watched my third U.S. democratic presidential debate Thursday, with at least nine more scheduled - way more than we'll have during the entire Canadian election. The U.S. campaign already seems to have gone on three years, while ours will be a five-week hiccup.
How can we possibly compete? How can we catch the eye of Canadian voters, let alone the world? Here are some bold, dramatic ideas to add some buzz to our ballot:
1 - It's too late to make headlines by buying Greenland, but there are other "lands" we can still purchase that would make big news. Why not make the U.S. an offer to buy Disneyland, or Frontierland, or Cleveland, or Portland, or Manhattan Island?
Alternatively, we could offer to buy Scotland once it leaves England after England leaves the EU.
2 - Our PM could make global news by turning weatherman and predicting a wonderful heat wave if he's elected in October. Then he could show a Sharpie-drawn map with Toronto and Montreal included in the latest Miami weather projections.
When Environment Canada issues a correction saying no Canadian heat waves are expected before next summer, Trudeau could fire the whole agency, saying it doesn't fit with his philosophy of "sunny ways."
3 - Trudeau could go rogue and attack the one per cent, like Bernie Sanders does, although Trudeau is probably part of it. Elizabeth May could join Elizabeth Warren and demand Medicare-for-all - oops we already have it.
Andrew Scheer could add some desperately needed charisma during our debates by starting to shout like Bernie Sanders:
"LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, PEOPLE! IT'S TIME FOR MORE CARBON - NOT CARBON TAXES! MORE PIPELINES - NOT POT LINES! TIME FOR AN OIL CHANGE - NOT CLIMATE CHANGE!"
4 - If none of this gets voters' attention, here's a dramatic idea guaranteed to make Canadian and world headlines. Our government could announce our own thrilling version of Brexit by proposing a referendum for Canada to leave .... North America!
We'd call it Nexit. Trudeau could declare we're not getting anything out of the continent anymore: all the news is about the U.S., all the good TV is on Netflix, the U.S. even gets the best weather.
It's time to LEAVE North America by digging a canal between the two countries - and making the U.S. pay for it.
Like the EU, the U.S. would demand Canada pay back what we owe them: the U.S. Open tennis trophy that Bianca Andreescu just won. Otherwise they'll bar us from playing and rename the tournament "The U.S. Closed."
For added news coverage, Trudeau could arrange to box with Vladimir Putin, form a trade alliance with Kim Jong Un and wear his India costume at the debates, guaranteeing more world headlines.
Meanwhile, Scheer could appear on Saturday Night Live and outdo famed hypnotist Reveen by putting the entire audience to sleep - without using hypnosis.
As for Elizabeth May and Jagmeet Singh, they could talk about dull, irrelevant topics like the growing rich-poor gap and climate change.
I know my ideas already have you thinking excitedly about the Canadian election, but this being Canada I fear they won't happen.
Instead we'll have a few polite TV debates with no sharp exchanges, no hateful rhetoric, no trolling insults and no major headlines or gaffes - just tedious arguments over jobs, the economy, the environment and MuchMoreLavalin.
It will be a sensible election with little anger, division or emotion. How boring can you get?
But that's the price of living in no-drama Canada.

I watched my third U.S. democratic presidential debate Thursday, with at least nine more scheduled - way more than we'll have during the entire Canadian election. The U.S. campaign already seems to have gone on three years, while ours will be a five-week hiccup.
How can we possibly compete? How can we catch the eye of Canadian voters, let alone the world? Here are some bold, dramatic ideas to add some buzz to our ballot:
1. It's too late to make headlines by buying Greenland, but there are other "lands" we can still purchase that would make big news. Why not make the U.S. an offer to buy Disneyland, or Frontierland, or Cleveland, or Portland, or Manhattan Island? Alternatively, we could offer to buy Scotland once it leaves England after England leaves the EU.
2. Our PM could make global news by turning weatherman and predicting a wonderful heat wave if he's elected in October. Then he could show a Sharpie-drawn map with Toronto and Montreal included in the latest Miami weather projections.
When Environment Canada issues a correction saying no Canadian heat waves are expected before next summer, Trudeau could fire the whole agency, saying it doesn't fit with his philosophy of "sunny ways."
3. Trudeau could go rogue and attack the one per cent, like Bernie Sanders does, although Trudeau is probably part of it. Elizabeth May could join Elizabeth Warren and demand medicare for all - oops we already have it.
Andrew Scheer could add some desperately needed charisma during our debates by starting to shout like Bernie Sanders: "LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, PEOPLE! IT'S TIME FOR MORE CARBON - NOT CARBON TAX-ES! MORE PIPELINES - NOT POT LINES! TIME FOR AN OIL CHANGE - NOT CLIMATE CHANGE!"
4. If none of this gets voters'attention, here's a dramatic idea guaranteed to make Canadian and world headlines. Our government could announce our own thrilling version of Brexit by proposing a referendum for Canada to leave ... North America.
We'd call it Nexit. Trudeau could declare we're not getting anything out of the continent anymore: all the news is about the U.S., all the good TV is on Netflix, the U.S. even gets the best weather.
It's time to LEAVE North America by digging a canal between the two countries - and making the U.S. pay for it.
Like the EU, the U.S. would demand Canada pay back what we owe them: the U.S. Open tennis trophy that Bianca Andreescu just won. Otherwise they'll bar us from playing and rename the tournament "The U.S. Closed."
For added news coverage, Trudeau could arrange to box with Vladimir Putin, form a trade alliance with Kim Jong Un and wear his India costume at the debates, guaranteeing more world headlines.
Meanwhile, Scheer could appear on Saturday Night Live and outdo famed hypnotist Reveen by putting the entire audience to sleep - without using hypnosis.
As for Elizabeth May and Jagmeet Singh, they could talk about dull, irrelevant topics like the growing rich-poor gap and climate change.
I know my ideas already have you thinking excitedly about the Canadian election, but this being Canada I fear they won't happen.
Instead we'll have a few polite TV debates with no sharp exchanges, no hateful rhetoric, no trolling insults and no major headlines or gaffes - just tedious arguments over jobs, the economy, the environment and MuchMoreLavalin.
It will be a sensible election with little anger, division or emotion. How boring can you get? But that's the price of living in no-drama Canada. joshfreed49@gmail.com

Full text: Summertime, and the livin' is easy. Yet in our information-overload society, there's always something to make you queasy.
Too many of us are suffering from new summertime afflictions, like:
Weather Worry: After complaining incessantly about our cold, rainy spring, many Montrealers have been complaining about the heat.
Montreal had 11 July days of over 30 degrees, but pretty much every other day had a "feels like 35 degrees" alert on the weather forecast.
The better the weather gets, the more terrifying we make it sound.
Weather channels and websites now issue daily SEVERE THUNDERSTORM watches, EXTREME HEAT! alerts, humidex warnings, lightning warnings, flood advisories, heavy rainfall warnings and smog alerts that quietly scream: "Stay indoors everyone!"
It won't be long before they have a Dangerous Falling Leaf Alert.
Every hour of the hourly weather Fear Forecast now threatens at least some rain, though it's usually less than 0.5 millimetres, or even 0.1 mm - barely enough to wash your face.
I took a daylong bike trip with friends last Wednesday when the forecast threatened "severe thunderstorms" and 70 per cent chance of rain almost every hour - but we never even got wet.
At night, I went to the Rogers Cup despite a "severe rain warning" and watched a gorgeous rain-free night of tennis. If any of you stayed home that day because of the forecast, you were a victim of this new weather prediction terrorism.
It's an epidemic of fake weather news, as forecasting sites compete to frighten us into clicking on them every 15 minutes instead of stepping outdoors.
It's also creating an obsessive new generation of "satellite radar" addicts, mostly male, who spend more time staring at clouds on their phone apps than at actual clouds in the sky.
"Uh-oh honey, look-it this extreme cumulonimbus thundercloud formation simulation coming in from The Caribbean in 7.87 hours! I can see it's definitely on a trajectory to hit N.D.G.
"Better head for the cellar with the kids till it blows over."
My own advisory? Ignore the weather forecast. Much like 60 years ago in the days of CBC's Percy Saltzman, it's wrong as often as it's right - and you'll miss some beautiful days by worrying about a few bad ones.
It's fake weather news, folks!
Bite fright: I spent last week in the Eastern Townships and made a grim discovery. The fierce, carnivorous Laurentian mosquito has blundered out of its usual habitat and discovered The Townships, once a bug-free oasis.
By 5 p.m. everyone around was slapping or scratching themselves silly, or spraying on Deep Woods Smells Awful OFF!
West end Montreal parks also have more mosquitos, so tennis players have to whack themselves before whacking the ball. It's another symptom of climate change as bug life migrates North seeking fresh meat - us.
You can't even ignore your bites like the old days, since bug life is morphing. There are 3,000 species of mosquito in the world and too many are heading our way.
West Nile-carrying mosquitos are still rare here, but West Nile paranoia has arrived, as people study their bite patterns like entomologists, saying:
"Omigod! What is that and why isn't it going away? Quick - someone call Medevac!"
Adding to the paranoia is understandable fear of another airborne threat: Lyme disease carried by ticks. These, too, have migrated north and are terrorizing the Townships, where doctors are treating many more patients.
If a tick bite doesn't heal in a day, physicians advise antibiotics - so maybe it's wise to be paranoid.
As fear mounts it won't be long before hourly bug forecasts become common: "Extreme deer tick warning and Asian tiger mosquito sighting. Stay indoors everyone!"
Air-con contradictions: More Montrealers are getting AC because of rising temperatures, like people everywhere.
Stoic Europeans always scorned American air-conditioning, but this summer's blistering heat wave has ignited a cooling craze across Europe.
The trouble is, the more people get air-conditioning, the more the world heats and the more A/C we need - as cooling ourselves helps warm the planet.
But relief might be coming. Sony says it has invented an ecological, portable "mini-air conditioner" to wear on your body that cools you more than the space around.
Due out in Japan next year, it slips into a special pocket behind your neck and purportedly cools you down by 13 degrees Celsius.
This could also solve one of the biggest summer marital spats on Earth - couple air-con wars( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-great-ac-debate-when-some-like-it-hot-but-others-not-so-much ).
In the future, maybe you'll wear an individual climate control device in the same bed as your spouse - only you'll be living at a chilly 18 while she basks at 31.
There will be no more "honey turn down the air-conditioning - there's ice forming on my cuticles." Just you happily surrounded by a thin layer of personal Arctic air, while she bakes in her own private Sahara.
With luck you can save your marriage and the planet at the same time.
Until then, maybe you should just - Stay Indoors Until Winter! Then you can start complaining all over again.

#ICYMI: Mummified baby, heat wave workouts, Big Splash

Full text: His mother kept a box in the freezer for decades. Inside, he found a 'mummified' baby( https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/his-mother-kept-a-cardboard-box-in-the-freezer-for-decades-inside-he-found-a-mummified-baby/wcm/9770fcfb-b1fd-485e-9d3b-b84a2fa19136 )
When Adam Smith pulled open the yellowed door of the freezer in his mother's St. Louis apartment, he saw a familiar item. Wedged among bags and cartons of frozen food was the small cardboard box that had taken up space in every freezer in every home the 37-year-old had ever shared with his mother.
Fitness: Here's what happens when you exercise during a heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/health/diet-fitness/heres-what-happens-when-you-exercise-during-a-heat-wave )
It's hot out there. Yet runners, cyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts are sweating it out at high noon when temperatures are at their peak. What happens to workout junkies who ignore warnings about high heat and humidity?
Montrealers make Big Splash at Old Port in push for urban-water access( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-make-big-splash-at-old-port-in-push-for-urban-water-access )
On one of those mornings when just about anything is cooler than standing outside in Montreal( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-6vKa ), about 100 people jumped off the Jacques-Cartier Pier in Old Montreal and into the St. Lawrence River.
Boon for Mirabel as Air France set to buy A220 jets( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/boon-for-mirabel-as-air-france-set-to-buy-a220-jets )
Slowly but surely, orders are piling up for the jet formerly known as the C Series - and that's good news for Mirabel. Air France-KLM Group on Tuesday placed a firm order to acquire 60 Airbus A220 aircraft( https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/system/files/cpafkla22030072019_ven.pdf ) to modernize its fleet. The deal comes with an additional 30 purchase options and 30 acquisition rights, Air France-KLM said in a statement. Its Air France unit will operate the aircraft.
Zurkowsky: What is going on with the Alouettes' ownership situation?( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/football/cfl/montreal-alouettes/zurkowsky-what-is-going-on-with-the-alouettes-ownership-situation )
It will be two weeks this Friday since commissioner Randy Ambrosie went on national television, during a game at Winnipeg, and declared the potential sale of the Alouettes to brothers Jeffrey and Peter Lenkov was all but a foregone conclusion.
Canadiens prospect Cole Caufield scores a beauty for Team USA( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-prospect-cole-caufield-scores-a-beauty-for-team-usa )
Canada beat the United States 4-1 Tuesday at the 2019 World Junior Summer Showcase in Plymouth, Mich., but the one goal scored by Team USA will have Canadiens fans smiling.

Full text: Montrealers who are already sweltering through the second day of high temperatures( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-heat-wave-continues-with-chance-of-thunderstorms ) on Tuesday now have to deal with the possibility of severe thunderstorms breaking out over the course of the day.
Environment Canada, who issued a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:44 a.m., raised the alert to the level of a warning at 1:51 p.m., saying their "meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain."
The urban areas covered by the storm watch are Montréal, Joliette, Saint-Jérôme, Trois-Rivières, Shawinigan, Sorel-Tracy, Granby, Sherbrooke, Saint-Hyacinthe, Drummondville, Victoriaville, Thetford Mines, Lac-Mégantic, Saint-Georges and Quebec City.
As of 3:30 p.m., Hydro Quebec reported roughly 80 service interruptions in the Montreal and Laval areas, affecting thousands of customers.
High winds are pushing branches into contact with power lines, resulting in them being turned off automatically, said Hydro Quebec spokesperson Gary Sutherland.
Residents in Laval said trees have fallen onto houses during the storm.
"When there's no damage, it's really just a question of putting the breaker back on," Sutherland said. "We're seeing a lot of fluctuations."
Sutherland expects the fluctuations to continue throughout the afternoon as the weather shifts.
Meanwhile, the heat warning issued on Monday morning remains in effect for Montreal on Tuesday.
Cooler temperatures and drier air are expected Wednesday.
The forecast for Montreal on Tuesday calls for a few showers or thunderstorms beginning early this afternoon along with the risk of a severe thunderstorm this afternoon and a forecast high of 30 C with a humidex of 38 C( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ). The risk of a severe thunderstorm will continue into the evening with a forecast low for tonight of 21 C.

Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:44 a.m., the alert covering the Montreal area as well as much of southern and central Quebec, particularly along the length of the St. Lawrence valley between Montreal and Quebec City.
The storm watch notes that conditions are favourable for the creation of violent storms that could include sudden wind gusts, large hail and heavy rainfalls.
The federal agency warns also that storms of such severity can produce tornados.
The urban areas covered by the storm watch are Montréal, Joliette, Saint-Jérôme, Trois-Rivières, Shawinigan, Sorel-Tracy, Granby, Sherbrooke, Saint-Hyacinthe, Drummondville, Victoriaville, Thetford Mines, Lac-Mégantic, Saint-Georges and Quebec City.

Hanes: In times of climate crisis, trees are crucial urban infrastructure

Full text: Heat records are tumbling like dominoes across western Europe, as cities like Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris sizzle in temperatures over 40 C.
The climate crisis is making life unbearable - and even dangerous - on a continent where only about five per cent of citizens( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/europes-record-heatwave-is-changing-stubborn-minds-about-value-air-conditioning/?fbclid=IwAR0l84zh2b12L42HcdKVuuFPU0dtNq8w5o5xnQauA3env6lFe8HhOzbPMN8&utm_term=.758dc0bd3bee ) have air conditioning.
The mercury in Montreal reached a comparatively pleasant 30 C this weekend. So far we've escaped the oven-like heat roasting Europe. Still, Montrealers can commiserate. Last July, stifling weather claimed 66 lives in a weeklong span( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ) - two thirds of them, according to Montreal's public health department, in heat islands, where paved surfaces and a lack of green space amplify the risk of scorching temperatures.
As Montreal and other cities around the world increasingly seek ways to mitigate the impact of extreme heat - which is only expected to intensify as climate change wreaks havoc - new research offers some valuable data about the importance of trees in this effort.
A Concordia University biology professor set out to quantify the cooling power of trees in an urban environment.
While doing her PhD in Madison, Wis., Carly Ziter used a bicycle-mounted unit to take temperature readings in different parts of the city with varying amounts of trees.
Until now, research has focused on the temperature variations between urban areas and forested zones beyond city limits. But Ziter wanted to see if there were fluctuations between inner-city neighbourhoods as well.
"We really wanted to know how temperature differs at the scale we go about our daily lives, so we went out and measured temperatures at these scales," she said. "We wanted to put some really specific measures to this instead of just saying, 'Wow, trees are great. They provide shade.' "
What she found is that temperatures can be up to 5 C cooler during the day and 2 C cooler at night in parts of the city where there is significant tree coverage, versus areas that are heavily paved. The most drastic differences were detected where the tree canopy reached a lush 40 per cent.
"Trees not only provide shade, they are also transpiring or giving off water vapour, so they act like little air conditioners," Ziter said.
Ziter's study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America( https://www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7575 ), is just one of several recent findings about the role of trees in addressing the global climate crisis.
Research out of ETH Zurich using satellite imagery and on-the-ground data indicates that planting 1.2 trillion trees( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/trees-reforestation-climate-change-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR1rLJ1rxpIHbM1BUwx_qvCHW1kdz5emaETlTAobocMtxrPUsIO18IcJw18 ) - and adding 1.6 billion hectares to the 2.8 billion hectares that already exist - could absorb two-thirds of the carbon emissions pumped into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The science suggests that massive reforestation efforts should be moved to the top of the priority list of actions needed to combat the climate emergency.
While 0.9 billion hectares of the land needed for this reforestation effort is available outside urban and agricultural areas, expanding the tree canopy in cities will also be crucial.
Yet biologists are only beginning to understand the particularities of urban trees compared to larger forests. Alain Paquette, a biology professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal, just received a federal grant to investigate the conditions under which urban trees grow best( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/researchers-take-stock-of-how-canadas-urban-forests-protect-our-health ) and what practices should be developed to keep them healthy and thriving.
Ziter hopes to contribute to this knowledge. But her research measuring how much trees cool their environment and how many are needed to make a difference already has profound policy implications for Montreal.
"It's really hard to achieve 40 per cent canopy in an urban environment," she said. "What this means is we're going to have to be a lot more creative about how we design cities and plant trees to get to these levels."
For Montreal, addressing the lack of greenery in boroughs like LaSalle, Park Ex and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, where the most heat-related deaths were recorded in 2018, is crucial. But measures to protect old-growth trees from sickness or being cut down for development are equally essential.
"Tree planting is great, but we also have to ensure we are protecting the large, mature trees that we have," said Ziter. "If you cut down a tree, even if you replant it, it's going to take decades to get to where it was."
Trees alone won't spare cities the worst effects of climate change, Ziter said, so new technologies are also needed, like green or white roofs and road construction materials that lessen the heat-island effect.
But it's hard to beat the power of trees.
"We really have to start looking at trees as the valuable infrastructure that they are."

The great AC debate: When some like it hot, but others not so much

Full text: The usual tests to gauge a couple's compatibility look at each partner's attitude toward big issues such as time, money and fidelity. Air conditioning never comes up. Yet this time of year, especially during a heat wave in a city that gets as muggy as Montreal, many couples quarrel about air conditioning. Some like it hot, and others - well - not so much.
Local marriage and family therapist Tom Caplan says that in his 32 years in the field, the air-conditioning issue has occasionally come up. Usually, Caplan says, it's a problem couples are able to resolve in a reasonable amount of time. But sometimes, he said, the argument is about more than air conditioning. "It might be a metaphor about problem-solving and negotiation," he said.
Meghan Stevenson estimates that, in warm weather, she and her partner, Matthew Demetriou, argue two to three times a week about air conditioning. "I hate being hot and uncomfortable. I need the AC to sleep and to live," said Stevenson, 31, an executive assistant.
The couple's cottage in Brossard has central air conditioning. If it was up to Demetriou, 33, an elevator mechanic, he would never use the system, even on the hottest days. "I like real air, not fake air. We have six of months of winter, and we complain about the cold. I want and love the heat," he said.
Mostly, Stevenson gets her way. Sometimes, when she wakes up at night, she goes downstairs and adjusts the air-conditioning settings so that the house is even colder.
Demetriou copes by bundling up. "I cover my face and my body. I don't see any light," he said.
Brian Azimov, 31, and Camille Traill, 29, start squabbling about air conditioning well before the first heat wave. During cooler weather, the couple, who have been married four years, stores their air conditioner in a locker in the basement of their N.D.G. apartment. "When I decide it's time to bring the air conditioner up, I'm met with resistance. She says it's too soon," said Azimov, who works for the SAQ.
Traill, an operations manager, does not mind heat and humidity. What bothers her most about the air conditioner, which is installed in their bedroom window, is the noise. "It annoys me. I can't sleep through the night when it's on," she said.
Meghan Stevenson estimates that, in warm weather, she and her partner, Matthew Demetriou, argue two to three times a week about air conditioning. She hates "being hot and uncomfortable," while he says, "I want and love the heat."
Traill also has environmental concerns. "Running the air conditioner 24-7 is just wasteful. Everyone in the city is doing it. I think it's crazy," she said.
The couple's Siamese cat, Suai, shares Traill's aversion to air conditioning. "If the air conditioning is on, she meows, and then goes to sleep on the couch," Azimov said.
In some cases, the air-conditioning argument can go on for years. Christine and Wayne Ross have been married for 47 years. "Forty-seven glorious years," said Christine. However, the couple spent 25 summers arguing about air conditioning. Christine, who is 68, dislikes it; Wayne, 69, is a fan.
Originally from Montreal and now living in Edmonton, the couple used to live near the Atwater Market. "I was always turning the air conditioner off, and he was always turning it back on," Christine said. "She'd go to work and I'd put the AC on," Wayne said.
Things improved when, in 1997, the Rosses moved west. "There's no humidity in Edmonton," said Wayne. "Now the main thing we argue about is when I leave the back door open. She doesn't want bugs in the house," he said.
But the air-conditioning argument resurfaced this week when the Rosses were in town to visit relatives. Wayne found that the air conditioning at his sister-in-law's condominium in LaSalle was too strong. "At least this time I was fighting with my sister-in-law, not my wife," he joked.
Numerous studies indicate a link between hotter temperatures and aggression. Though sunny, warm days tend to improve our moods, hot sticky days make us feel cranky. There are biological reasons for our crankiness, including the effects of dehydration and lack of sleep, both common occurrences when the temperature climbs. These reasons help explain not only arguments about air conditioning, but also the increased honking that seems to occur in traffic during heat waves.
"We know that when people don't feel their best, they tend to be more defensive and to have less ability to manage negative emotions," Caplan said.
Caplan has also observed that in younger couples, men seem to prefer cool conditions, while women like it warmer. Those preferences, he said, often change with age. Women who experience hot flashes tend to want air conditioning. "Then there are older men who you see wearing sweaters on hot days," he said.
But Caplan says the prognosis is good for couples who bicker about air conditioning - as long as they are willing to negotiate. In fact, that's what he and his wife, who have been together 30 years, managed to do. "I sleep under the sheet; she sleeps under the comforter," he said. "Couples can also adjust the settings on their air conditioners. It's about some form of compromise," he said.
Azimov and Traill seem to have the right attitude. "When it comes to relationships, I don't focus on the minutiae," Azimov said. "When you find someone who tolerates you, you can the tolerate the air conditioning."

Full text: The usual tests to gauge a couple's compatibility look at each partner's attitude toward big issues such as time, money and fidelity. Air conditioning never comes up. Yet this time of year, especially during a heat wave in a city that gets as muggy as Montreal, many couples quarrel about air conditioning. Some like it hot, and others - well - not so much.
Local marriage and family therapist Tom Caplan says that in his 32 years in the field, the air-conditioning issue has occasionally come up. Usually, Caplan says, it's a problem couples are able to resolve in a reasonable amount of time. But sometimes, he said, the argument is about more than air conditioning. "It might be a metaphor about problem-solving and negotiation," he said.
Meghan Stevenson estimates that in warm weather, she and her partner, Matthew Demetriou, argue two to three times a week about air conditioning. "I hate being hot and uncomfortable. I need the A/C to sleep and to live," said Stevenson, 31, an executive assistant.
The couple's cottage in Brossard has central air conditioning. If it was up to Demetriou, 33, an elevator mechanic, he would never use the system, even on the hottest days. "I like real air, not fake air. We have six of months of winter, and we complain about the cold. I want and love the heat," he said.
Mostly, Stevenson gets her way.
Sometimes, when she wakes up at night, she goes downstairs and adjusts the air-conditioning settings so that the house is even colder.
Demetriou copes by bundling up. "I cover my face and my body. I don't see any light," he said.
Brian Azimov, 31, and Camille Traill, 29, start squabbling about air conditioning well before the first heat wave. During cooler weather, the couple, who have been married four years, stores their air conditioner in a locker in the basement of their N.D.G. apartment. "When I decide it's time to bring the air conditioner up, I'm met with resistance. She says it's too soon," said Azimov, who works for the SAQ.
Traill, an operations manager, does not mind heat and humidity. What bothers her most about the air conditioner, which is installed in their bedroom window, is the noise. "It annoys me. I can't sleep through the night when it's on," she said.
Traill also has environmental concerns. "Running the air conditioner 24-7 is just wasteful. Everyone in the city is doing it. I think it's crazy," she said.
The couple's Siamese cat, Suai, shares Traill's aversion to air conditioning. "If the air conditioning is on, she meows, and then goes to sleep on the couch," Azimov said.
In some cases, the air-conditioning argument can go on for years. Christine and Wayne Ross have been married for 47 years. "Forty-seven glorious years," said Christine. However, the couple spent 25 summers arguing about air conditioning. Christine, who is 68, dislikes it; Wayne, 69, is a fan.
Originally from Montreal and now living in Edmonton, the couple used to live near the Atwater Market. "I was always turning the air conditioner off, and he was always turning it back on," Christine said. "She'd go to work and I'd put the A/C on," Wayne said.
Things improved when, in 1997, the Rosses moved west. "There's no humidity in Edmonton," said Wayne. "Now the main thing we argue about is when I leave the back door open. She doesn't want bugs in the house," he said.
But the air-conditioning argument resurfaced this week when the Rosses were in town to visit relatives. Wayne found that the air conditioning at his sister-in-law's condominium in LaSalle was too strong. "At least this time I was fighting with my sister-in-law, not my wife," he joked.
Numerous studies indicate a link between hotter temperatures and aggression. Though sunny, warm days tend to improve our moods, hot sticky days make us feel cranky. There are biological reasons for our crankiness, including the effects of dehydration and lack of sleep, both common occurrences when the temperature climbs. These reasons help explain not only arguments about air conditioning, but also the increased honking that seems to occur in traffic during heat waves.
"We know that when people don't feel their best, they tend to be more defensive and to have less ability to manage negative emotions," Caplan said.
Caplan also has observed that in younger couples, men seem to prefer cool conditions, while women like it warmer. Those preferences, he said, often change with age. Women who experience hot flashes tend to want air conditioning. "Then there are older men who you see wearing sweaters on hot days," he said.
But Caplan says the prognosis is good for couples who bicker about air conditioning - as long as they are willing to negotiate. In fact, that's what he and his wife, who have been together 30 years, managed to do. "I sleep under the sheet; she sleeps under the comforter," he said. "Couples can also adjust the settings on their air conditioners. It's about some form of compromise," he said.
Azimov and Traill seem to have the right attitude. "When it comes to relationships, I don't focus on the minutiae," Azimov said. "When you find someone who tolerates you, you can the tolerate the air conditioning."

Full text: In a summer that has been relatively hot overall, this weekend won't be the hottest, but it will have its moments.
As it was Friday, Saturday will be hot with low humidity.
"Starting on Sunday, the humidity is going to be really intense," said Simon Legault, meteorologist with Environment Canada. "We can say we are heading into another heat wave, but it won't be of the same intensity as last week," said Legault, adding that last weekend was the summer's first heat wave.
A heat wave is when the temperature is over 30 C for at least three days and the temperature doesn't drop below 20 C overnight.
Environment Canada has issued two heat warnings already this summer. Here is what to expect from the weather this weekend, according to Environment Canada:
Saturday
It should be a mainly sunny day with wind coming from the southwest at 20 km/h in the morning.
There will be a high of 32 C and a humidex of 37 C. The night will be clear and the temperature will drop overnight to a low of 22 C.
Sunday There will be a mix of sun and cloud with a high of 29 C. This is the day when the humidity will really kick in, according to Legault. There is a 60 per cent chance of showers during the day and the night, which will also be cloudy. The temperature will drop to 21 C overnight.
Southern Quebec could see thunderstorms, according to Legault, but it is uncertain for Montreal.
Monday
We can expect to start the week on a sunny note with a high of 32 C. The temperature will drop overnight to a low of 24 C with a clear sky. According to Legault, we can also expect to have a high humidex reading. Increased fire risk The Société de protection des forêts contre le feu also calls for cautionary measures in the next couple of days as there will be a risk of fire in spots across the province.
The regions most at risk until Sunday are Nord-du-Québec, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Côte-Nord, Bas-St-Laurent, Gaspésie and Chaudière-Appalaches.
The society recommended using a fireplace with a fire screen with openings no more than one cm in size to make a safe campfire.

Full text: Environment Canada has extended its heat warning until Sunday afternoon, but relief is in sight for the rest of the week.
A cool front will come in Sunday evening, dropping temperatures to a refreshing 17 degrees by 5 a.m., the national weather service is forecasting.
"Tomorrow, we're expecting lower temperatures, with much lower humidity levels," said Catherine Brabant, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.
Saturday's high of 32.8 - with a humidex of 43 - wave didn't break any records "but we came close," she said.
The record temperature of 33.3 for July 20 was set in 1991.
Sunday's temperature is expected to reach 29 degrees by 4 p.m., when the humidex will reach 37. But temperatures will start dropping by 8 p.m. There is a medium risk of thundershowers all day, dropping to a low risk in the evening.
While this weekend's heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-temperature-could-soar-to-45-c ) has been oppressive, it doesn't compare with last year's, which caused 66 deaths in July 2018( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), Brabant said.
"It was pretty humid but the duration was not what we got last year," she said.
The length of a heat wave is the most important factor, since the effects of prolonged heat are cumulative( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ) and increase the longer it drags on, she said.
"The fourth day is going to be much worse in terms of the effects on people's bodies," she said.
That's why health authorities warn people to drink water frequently in extremely hot weather - not waiting until they feel thirsty - and to cool down at least once a day, either by taking a dip in a local pool or going into an air-conditioned environment, she noted.
The weekend weather cocktail also included thundershowers. Transports Québec closed two ramps on Highway 40 near Langelier Blvd. Sunday morning after heavy rain in east-end Montreal flooded part of the Métropolitain Expressway. The situation returned to normal within about an hour.
Starting Sunday night, "we'll be able to open the windows and get some relief," she said.
Monday's forecast calls for a high of 24, under mainly cloudy skies.
"The heat and humidity will build up slowly during the week," Brabant said.
The daily high will reach 29 by Friday and 30 by Sunday, staying around that level into the following week, she said.
"It will be slightly above normal, but not unusual," she said.
The average high for July 21, 22 and 23 is 26.6 and the average low is 15.8.

Full text: The Impact loses its fourth straight game in Columbus.( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/soccer/mls/montreal-impact/impact-loses-its-fourth-straight-game-in-columbus )Things are not looking good for the Impact. The team suffered its fourth straight loss in MLS play Saturday night, dropping a 2-1 decision to the Crew in Columbus.

Legault's Coalition has its support base outside Montreal, and it isn't afraid of making policy decisions it knows are going to be massively unpopular with English speakers. Liberal member Greg Kelley, who represents a riding in Montreal's English-speaking West Island, said in a recent interview that Legault's government uses the rhetoric of us versus them. "It's frustrating, because it's not the tone you want to hear from the premier," Kelley said of Legault's March comments. "There is a lot of this: 'We have the support of the francophones, and you people are just the others.' You see it in what they say sometimes in the (legislature)."

There are some road closures( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sunday-july-21-road-closures-to-start-construction-holiday )as we make our way into the construction holiday.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/by-the-numbers-a-look-at-quebecs-annual-construction-holiday-2 )
Ramps to Highway 20 west from Décarie south and Highway 15 north will be completely, as well, the ramps from Highway 20 east to Highway 720 east and Décarie north. Highway 720 and Highway 20 west will be closed between the Robert Bourassa exit and the Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Blvd. exit until Monday at 5 a.m. This closure means the St-Antoine entrance in both directions will be closed.

Summer can be especially hard for the lonely; It's easy to feel like everyone is out having fun together, Victoria Carmichael writes

Full text: For many, the summer months are a welcome change from Montreal's long and harsh winter - an opportunity to get outside and enjoy all the fun activities the city has to offer. For those who are lonely and isolated, however, summer can be an especially difficult time of year.
According to a recent report released by the Angus Reid Institute, which surveyed about 2,000 Canadians, nearly one in two people reported being either lonely, isolated or both. It is important to note that isolation and loneliness are not uniquely later-life experiences. Indeed, the findings reveal that people reported being both lonely and isolated across the lifespan. Other research shows that loneliness peaks in adolescence.
Isolation and loneliness can fluctuate over time as conditions change. For many, summer can be the loneliest time of year. Indeed, the myriad of group activities and events taking place during the summer, such as barbecues and picnics, may lead isolated people to feel as though everyone else is out having fun together while they are missing out. This perceived gap may be worsened by social media and its "highlight reel." Such perceptions can worsen existing mental-health issues and may even play a role in suicidality.
There are numerous negative health outcomes associated with loneliness and isolation. To begin, much research suggests that being isolated or lonely increases the likelihood of premature death. In other words, isolation and loneliness can quite literally kill us. Studies show that those who are socially isolated are 60 to 70 per cent more likely to die prematurely than those who are socially integrated, while lonely individuals are around 25 per cent more likely to die than non-lonely individuals.
With summer comes higher temperatures.
Heat exposure poses a serious risk for those who are isolated and living alone, especially if extreme and prolonged. In fact, isolation has been identified as a key determinant for heat-related mortality. In Montreal, single-person households are the most common. Living alone can lead people to live more isolated lives, especially elderly adults and those with health issues, which can be particularly devastating in extreme heat.
A recent report shows the majority of those who died in the Montreal heat wave last July lived alone and without air conditioning. Many also had existing physical and mental-health issues. Similar patterns were noted during the famous 1995 Chicago heat wave and this year's heat wave in France. Extreme heat is expected to occur more frequently as global warming worsens. Because of that, it is crucial we do more to protect vulnerable, isolated Canadians during the summer.
Another particularly worrisome outcome tied to isolation and loneliness is suicide. Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates tend to peak in spring and summer. Some research has linked these seasonal variations in suicidality to peaks in loneliness during the spring-summer transition. Eminent French sociologist Émile Durkheim posited there exists an inverse relationship between social integration and suicide: The less people feel integrated into society, the more likely they are to die by suicide.
Durkheim's observations may be useful for understanding the recent rise in suicide deaths as well as those involving drugs and alcohol - so-called "deaths of despair." Our society has indeed become increasingly individualistic with fewer and fewer Canadians belonging to religious communities, community associations and unions. These low levels of social participation may have a negative effect on well-being, especially in the summer when loneliness and isolation may be more salient.
All this suggests we need to pay more attention to those who are lonely and isolated, especially in the summer months. Working to make people feel a part of something larger could go a long way in improving the well-being of Canadians year-round and ensure the summer is enjoyable for all. Victoria Carmichael is the research manager of the Social Psychiatry Research and Interest Group (SPRING) at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.

Apart from the Montreal area, the statement covers Pontiac, Maniwaki, St-Jérôme, Joliette, St-Hyacinthe, Drummondville, Sorel-Tracy, Shawinigan, Trois-Rivières and Victoriaville.
By sunrise on Wednesday, the humidex reading in Montreal was already 30 C.
During times of extreme heat, the regional public health authority recommends( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-are-6-things-to-avoid-doing-during-a-heat-wave ) that people spend at least two to three hours a day in a cool environment, regularly drink water without waiting to feel thirsty and reduce physical effort.
It also warns that children should never be left in cars or in poorly ventilated areas during heat waves, and that regular checks of friends and relations, particularly those who are elderly, be made and if necessary that they be accompanied to a cooler area.

Full text: For many, the summer months are a welcome change from Montreal's long and harsh winter - an opportunity to get outside and enjoy all the fun activities the city has to offer. For those who are lonely and isolated, however, summer can be an especially difficult time of year.
According to a recent report released by the Angus Reid Institute( http://angusreid.org/social-isolation-loneliness-canada/ ), which surveyed around 2,000 Canadians, nearly one in two people reported being either lonely, isolated or both. It is important to note that isolation and loneliness are not uniquely later-life experiences. Indeed, the findings reveal that people reported being both lonely and isolated across the lifespan. Other research shows that loneliness peaks in adolescence( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22303614 ).
Isolation and loneliness can fluctuate over time( https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/12038/1/Fulltext.pdf ) as conditions change. For many, summer can be the loneliest time of year( https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/robertwhitley/loneliness-mental-health_b_16145694.html ). Indeed, the myriad of group activities and events taking place during the summer, such as barbecues and picnics, may lead isolated people to feel as though everyone else is out having fun together while they are missing out. This perceived gap may be worsened by social media( https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751 ) and its "highlight reel."( https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriekerpen/2017/07/29/stop-comparing-your-behind-the-scenes-with-everyones-highlight-reel/#16941f503a07 ) Such perceptions can worsen existing mental health issues and may even play a role in suicidality.
There are numerous negative health outcomes associated with loneliness and isolation. To begin, much research suggests that being isolated or lonely increases the likelihood of premature death. In other words, isolation and loneliness can quite literally kill us. Studies show that those who are socially isolated are 60 to 70 per cent more likely to die prematurely( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22963-w ) than those who are socially integrated, while lonely individuals are around 25 per cent more likely to die( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081321 ) than non-lonely individuals.
With summer comes higher temperatures. Heat exposure poses a serious risk for those who are isolated and living alone, especially if extreme and prolonged. In fact, isolation has been identified as a key determinant for heat-related mortality. Here in Montreal, single-person households are the most common( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/MTL_STATS_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/PROFIL_SOCIOD%C9MO_AGGLOM%C9RATION%202016.PDF ). Living alone can lead people to live more isolated lives, especially elderly adults and those with health issues, which can be particularly devastating in extreme heat.
A recent report( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/fileadmin/user_upload/Uploads/tx_asssmpublications/pdf/publications/Enquete_epidemiologique_-_Vague_de_chaleur_a_l_ete_2018_a_Montreal_version15mai_EUSHV_finale.pdf ) shows the majority of those who died in the Montreal heat wave last July lived alone without air conditioning. Many also had existing physical and mental health issues. Similar patterns were noted during the famous 1995 Chicago heat wave and more recent 2019 France heat wave. Extreme heat is expected to occur more frequently as global warming worsens. As such, it is crucial we do more to protect vulnerable isolated Canadians during the summer.
Another particularly worrisome outcome tied to isolation and loneliness is suicide. Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates tend to peak in spring and summer( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3315262/ ). Some research has linked these seasonal variations in suicidality to peaks in loneliness( https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1977.40.3.807 ) during the spring-summer transition. Eminent French sociologist Émile Durkheim posited there exists an inverse relationship between social integration and suicide: The less people feel integrated into society, the more likely they are to die by suicide.
Durkheim's observations may be useful for understanding the recent rise in suicide deaths as well as those involving drugs and alcohol - so-called "deaths of despair." Our society has indeed become increasingly individualistic, with fewer and fewer Canadians belonging to religious communities, community associations and unions. These low levels of social participation may have a negative effect on well-being, especially in the summer when loneliness and isolation may be more salient.
All this suggests we need to pay more attention to those who are lonely and isolated, especially in the summer months. Working to make people feel a part of something larger may go a long way in improving the well-being of Canadians year-round and ensure the summer is enjoyable for all.

Full text: Environment Canada on Wednesday issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area and other regions of southern Quebec warning of soaring temperatures expected on Friday and continuing into Saturday.
The statement, issued at 4:44 a.m., notes that "a warm and very humid airmass will move into southern Quebec on Friday and remain in place until Saturday. Humidex values( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ) will be high and approach 40, especially in heavily urbanized areas."

Green pilot project in Cartierville 'an urban laboratory'

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/green-pilot-project-cartierville-urban-laboratory/docview/2256022184/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: It's 30 degrees in the shade on Laurentien Blvd. in Cartierville, and Élise Beauregard is busy tucking green seedlings into a planting bed set into the sidewalk.
Unlike most municipal plots, this one doesn't feature stiff rows of geraniums, or frilly petunias, or that standby of green spaces everywhere, neatly mowed grass.
Instead, Beauregard, a landscape architect and president of the Laboratoire d'intégration de l'écologie urbaine (LIEU), is using plants like clover that will naturally fertilize the soil and conserve water. Long seen as a weed that should be eliminated from lawns, clover adds nitrogen to the soil and resists drought.
"We want to reduce maintenance. We want to combat heat islands. We want to encourage biodiversity," said Beauregard, whose organization is in charge of a $300,000 pilot project to naturalize municipal landscaping on the site.
Over the next two years, the non-profit organization will measure the impact of naturalizing 875 square metres of planting beds on the site near the intersection of Laurentien and Gouin Blvds. It will analyze soil quality, temperature, water use and upkeep, and compare those results with the city's traditional gardening methods.
"This is really an urban laboratory," said Philippe Sabourin, a spokesperson for the city of Montreal.
"If it works, we will be able to deploy that kind of technique around the city and lower the cost of maintenance."
Cities have long relied on colourful annuals and swaths of green grass in their landscaping. But that must change as they increasingly cope with intense heat waves and freak weather events, Sabourin said.
"Grass requires a lot of maintenance," he said. "Every time there's a heat wave, you have to water it. And it doesn't reduce heat islands."
The project also calls for the planting of 127 trees, at an additional cost to the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough of $150,000.
In the past, the survival rate of city trees was very low, mainly because the beds where they were planted were too small and had poor soil. In this project, trees will have more room to spread their roots, and the soil mixture will combat contaminants in the urban environment, Sabourin said.
The city chose the site in the north-end borough because it was already slated for a $22-million sewer, water main and repaving project.
Instead of rebuilding that part of Laurentien Blvd. as it was, with six lanes, the city eliminated three lanes and widened the sidewalk to accommodate a café-terrasse, planting beds and benches where local residents, including the large number of seniors who live nearby, can sit and chat.
The changes will turn what used to be a drab, unfriendly speedway into a neighbourhood hub, Sabourin said.
"In 2016, it was nothing but concrete and asphalt," he said.
"Now we're creating zones where people can socialize."
Beauregard said her team has been getting positive feedback from local residents.
"They're happy about it," she said. "I think people like to see we're paying some attention to their living environment."
The team is using some 60 different plants, including a ground cover mixture developed by Sylvie Bélair, a horticultural technician at the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough.
"We have to think about the aesthetic aspect," said Beauregard. While the goal is to use plants that will thrive naturally without much care and watering, the plantings should also be pleasing to the eye and have a relaxing effect, she added.
In 2017, Pointe-Claire amended a bylaw( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kramberger-pointe-claire-green-lights-au-naturel-gardens ) that had required residents to limit lawns to 20 centimetres (eight inches) in height. It also recognized the importance of naturalized gardens in combatting climate change, conserving water and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.
The amendment was a victory for resident Peter Graham, who had sought to save his wild-growth front garden after being served with a ticket for violating the bylaw in 2016.
A mowed lawn is "a demonstration of insanity if you really think about it," Graham said in an interview. It impoverishes the soil and requires a large amount of labour, water and fertilizers to maintain, he noted.
"Western culture has this drive to demonstrate that we are masters of nature," said Graham, who recently earned a PhD from Queen's University's School of Environmental Studies.
"It's ironic, because you become a slave to the mowed lawn," he said.

"We have to think about the esthetic aspect," said Beauregard. While the goal is to use plants that will thrive naturally without much care and watering, the plantings should also be pleasing to the eye and have a relaxing effect, she added.
In 2017, Pointe-Claire amended a bylaw that had required residents to limit lawns to 20 centimetres (eight inches) in height. It also recognized the importance of naturalized gardens in combating climate change, conserving water and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.
The amendment was a victory for resident Peter Graham, who had sought to save his wild-growth front garden after being served with a ticket for violating the bylaw in 2016.
A mowed lawn is "a demonstration of insanity if you really think about it," Graham said in an interview. It impoverishes the soil and requires a large amount of labour, water and fertilizers to maintain, he noted.
"Western culture has this drive to demonstrate that we are masters of nature," said Graham, who recently earned a PhD from Queen's University's School of Environmental Studies.
"It's ironic, because you become a slave to the mowed lawn," he said. mscott@postmedia.com

In a heat wave, vigilance and kindness are key; Looking out for the welfare of vulnerable people and pets can prevent tragedies

Full text: This past week has been a scorcher. If you're lucky enough to have air conditioning at home, where you work and in your vehicle, consider yourself fortunate. For many Montrealers, especially those who are among the most vulnerable, this has been a stressful time.
We know that our elderly are particularly vulnerable, as are our children, those who are ill and the homeless. We also know that our pets need extra love and attention in the heat, but somehow this knowledge does not seem to be sufficient to prevent tragedies. Just as inevitable as heat waves seem to be tragic, fatal incidents of children and pets being left in vehicles. There was yet another such incident involving a toddler in British Columbia this past May. Yes, we seem to have this conversation year after year.
Something that I have heard all too often from older family members who live without air conditioning is that they sometimes do not feel the heat rise as quickly as they used to. The results can be especially devastating, as they may not be fully aware of how hot it is, especially if they suffer from such additional health conditions as asthma or Alzheimer's, or be recovering from a stroke.
This is why it's essential to take the time to check in on our parents, relatives or neighbours, and perhaps take them out to an air-conditioned mall or movie theatre. Those who do so know how important it is, but all too often we become preoccupied with our jobs, kids and travels. I was pleased to see Mayor Valérie Plante announcing proactive initiatives Wednesday to stay ahead of this heat wave and to ensure that our city's most vulnerable are checked on and taken care of.
Infants and toddlers are also particularly vulnerable to dehydration or heat exhaustion. The symptoms can come on quickly in the intense heat, and the damage can be devastating.
The timing of the current heat wave, coinciding with the recent big July 1 moving day, creates extra challenges, particularly when it comes to pets: this is a time when animals are abandoned in great numbers by owners moving to places where pets are excluded. The number of animals abandoned by their owners annually in Montreal is around 10,000-15,000, which, while staggeringly high, is still significantly lower than the 100,000 pets that used to be left annually 30 years ago.
Hot weather increases the vulnerability of pets, abandoned or not. It's essential to raise awareness among pet owners. I came across a graphic online that startled me. When temperatures reach 25 C, the temperature of asphalt is much hotter, at 51 C. At just 32 C, as we have been experiencing, the temperature of asphalt feels closer to 60 C, and this can lead to scorched paws. I don't need to own a dog to know that such temperatures can lead to avoidable accidents.
There also have been some troubling reports online recently of dogs being tied to trees while their owners shop, and more posts than I can count where people are saying that their neighbours who moved left their cats or dogs behind. We all share in the responsibility of bringing attention to these incidents, whether it means posting them online or contacting the right authorities.
But there has been good news, too. I love reading that some stores across the country have been allowing dogs inside their stores to discourage shoppers from leaving their pets locked up in their vehicles. I also love seeing establishments leave bowls of fresh water outside for dogs being walked.
We'll all have an easier time getting through the summer heat if we remain vigilant and think of others. Fariha Naqvi-Mohamed is the founder and editor in chief of CanadianMomEh.com, a lifestyle blog. Twitter.com/canadianmomeh

Seniors especially vulnerable in heat wave; Concerns raised about warnings from government not reaching older adults

Author: Sucar, Daniel

Full text: By this time last year, 66 people had died in Montreal during the summer's first heat wave. More than two-thirds of the victims were over 65. While the temperatures of the current heat wave are not expected to be as high as those in 2018, older adults remain the demographic that is most vulnerable to the hot spell.
"It's a balance between having to go outside long enough for your health, but not going outside for too long because of the heat," said Elizabeth Crawford, 79, whose family is helping her manage that balancing act.
Last summer's first heat wave lasted from June 30 to July 5, and at one point there were so many deaths that the city's morgue was filled to capacity. Of those who died, a disproportionately high number were older adults living alone or suffering from a chronic disability.
According to Constance LaFontaine, the associate director of research project ACT Concordia focusing on senior citizens, 51 per cent of Montreal seniors are renters and 36 per cent of those live alone. And 61 per cent of seniors live with a disability.
"We're accustomed to thinking about heating in the winter as a basic necessity in Canada, but we also have to think about cooling in the summer for older adults," LaFontaine said.
Through ACT Concordia, LaFontaine has heard many instances of landlords telling senior citizens to not install air-conditioning units in their windows, despite the sweltering heat. After contacting Quebec's Régie du logement, LaFontaine discovered that it was legal for landlords to refuse the installation of air-conditioning units for esthetic reasons.
"This is a small example of how public policy can put people in a position of vulnerability, and can even put their lives in danger," she said.
To respond to excessively high temperatures this year, the city's public health department created a registry that shows neighbourhoods and homes that are at the highest risk. The city is leaving it up to boroughs to extend hours at swimming pools. For example, the wading pool at Martin Luther King Park in Côte-des-Neiges is open until 7:30 p.m. for the rest of the heat wave.
Still, LaFontaine is more concerned about how governments are communicating with the older public.
"We've seen a shift over the last five years towards more online communication from all levels of government," she said. "We need to understand that older people who are vulnerable are not the people who are online."
Said Crawford: "Old people don't know about the help that is available to them because it's all online."
For Crawford, the lack of communication between the government and older adults during a crisis is reflective of society's treatment of senior citizens.
"They don't care about us old people," she said. "If you're past a certain age, nobody cares. People don't look after each other here."
Still, she feels grateful for having the help of her family during this heat wave.
"There's nothing better than family. I feel sorry for seniors who are alone, because there's nothing worse than being alone." dsucar@postmedia.com

Full text: By this time last year, 66 people had died in Montreal during the summer's first heat wave. More than two-thirds of the victims were over 65. While the temperatures of the current heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-in-montreal-to-be-followed-by-average-summer-meteorologist ) are not expected to be as high as those in 2018, older adults remain the demographic that is most vulnerable to the hot spell.
"It's a balance between having to go outside long enough for your health, but not going outside for too long because of the heat," said Elizabeth Crawford, 79, whose family is helping her manage that balancing act.
Last summer's first heat wave lasted from June 30 to July 5, and at one point there were so many deaths that the city's morgue was filled to capacity( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-morgue-filled-to-capacity-due-to-heat-related-deaths ). Of those who died, a disproportionately high number were older adults living alone or suffering from a chronic disability.
According to LaFontaine, 51 per cent of Montreal seniors are renters and 36 per cent of those live alone. And 61 per cent of seniors live with a disability.
"We're accustomed to thinking about heating in the winter as a basic necessity in Canada, but we also have to think about cooling in the summer for older adults," said Constance LaFontaine, the associate director of ACT Concordia, a research project focusing on senior citizens.
Through ACT Concordia, LaFontaine has heard many instances of landlords telling senior citizens to not install air-conditioning units in their windows, despite the sweltering heat. After contacting Quebec's Régie du logement, LaFontaine discovered that it was legal for landlords to refuse the installation of air-conditioning units for esthetic reasons.
"This is a small example of how public policy can put people in a position of vulnerability, and can even put their lives in danger," she said.
To respond to excessively high temperatures this year, the city's public health department created a registry that shows neighbourhoods and homes that are at the highest risk( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ). The city is leaving it up to boroughs to extend hours at swimming pools. For example, the wading pool at Martin Luther King Park in Côte-des-Neiges is open until 7:30 p.m. for the rest of the heat wave.
Still, LaFontaine is more concerned about how governments are communicating with the older public.
"We've seen a shift over the last five years towards more online communication from all levels of government," she said. "We need to understand that older people who are vulnerable are not the people who are online."
Said Crawford: "Old people don't know about the help that is available to them because it's all online."
For Crawford, the lack of communication between the government and older adults during a crisis is reflective of society's treatment of senior citizens.
"They don't care about us old people," she said. "If you're past a certain age, nobody cares. People don't look after each other here."
Still, she feels grateful for having the help of her family during this heat wave.
"There's nothing better than family. I feel sorry for seniors who are alone, because there's nothing worse than being alone."

Full text: Good morning,
These are the top stories:
Canopy Growth's Bruce Linton amassed more than $200-million during his time as co-CEO
Bruce Linton was pushed outof Canopy Growth after spending more than five years at the company, but still managed to amassone of the largest personal fortunes in Canada's cannabis industry.
Linton's total wealth from Canopy comes to more than $200-million, mostly from ownership of a major stake in the company. Stock-ownership records show Linton owns slightly fewer than 2.5 million shares of company stock worth $131-million at Tuesday's closing price of $52.49 and more than 600,000 stock options worth just less than $20-million.
Linton's departure comes less than two weeks after Canopy reported a fourth-quarter loss that wasnearly four timeswhat analysts were expecting.
The cannabis industry that Canada seemed destined to lead when the federal Liberals legalized recreational cannabis last October is increasingly dominated by foreigners,Andrew Willis writes. The trailblazing Linton lost his job because his visionary approach for Canopy Growth didn't fit with the predictable, quarter-by-quarter profits demanded by Constellation Brands, which dropped $5-billion last August to gain effective control of the company.
After Constellation's investment, it was clear the company expected a management style for Canopy that was a little less flashy than Bruce Linton,Jeffrey Jones says.
Meanwhile, Ontario is set to get50 more cannabis stores starting in October, including eight on First Nations reserves. The announcement yesterday comes as some of the first 25 of the province's legal pot shops that were set to open April 1 are still not running.

Ottawa is asking the RCMP to probe a Canadian lobby firm representing Sudan's military
The federal governmenthas asked the RCMPto investigate a Montreal-based lobbyist to see whether it violated Canadian sanctions by signing a US$6-million contract to seek funding and equipment for Sudan's new military regime.
The Globe and Mail revealed last week that the lobbyist, Dickens & Madson (Canada) Inc., has been hired to burnish the image of the military council that seized power in a coup in April. The regime's security forces later massacred more than 100 pro-democracy protesters in Khartoum in a bid to crush a protest camp near the military headquarters.
Three months after a military coup, Sudanis just the latestof dozens of countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia that have shut down the internet for political reasons, sometimes for a few days but often for weeks or months at a time.
Correspondent Geoffrey York reports from Khartoum on how these digital blackouts have made it increasingly difficult forprotest movementsto communicate.
Greater Vancouver housing sales have fallen to a 19-year low as the benchmark price dips below $1-million
Greater Vancouver housing sales fell in Juneto a 19-year low for the month while the benchmark price for a typical home dropped below $1-million for the first time in two years.
It marked the lowest number of transactions for June since 2000, when 1,985 properties sold.
The residential benchmark price slipped to $998,700, down from a record high of $1.1-million in May, 2018, and the lowest since $992,500 in May, 2017, according to the board.
With falling sales and prices, patient buyers in Vancouver are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for sellersto face reality.

MORNING MARKETS
Stocks mixed
Government bonds held near multiyear lows on Thursday on bets the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this month and that other major central banks would embrace looser monetary policy, pushing world stocks to new 18-month highs. Tokyo's Nikkei gained 0.3 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.2 per cent, and the Shanghai Composite shed 0.3 per cent. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were up slightly by about 6:45 a.m. ET, with the Paris CAC 40 down marginally. New York futures were mixed.The Canadian dollar was at about 76.5 US cents.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Canada certainly can't count on Trump bargaining for the release of two detained Canadians in China
Campbell Clark:"Mr. Xi was said to be personally behind the policy of punishing Canada for arresting Ms. Meng. And he has reason to listen to Mr. Trump since China and the U.S. are in talks to settle a high-stakes trade war. But Mr. Trump can't be counted on to bargain for two Canadians. He is a famously inconstant ally, who has made looking out for number one a political virtue."
Fair access to justice must be for all Indigenous people
Kim Beaudin: "Respectfully resisting the characterization that Gladue causes violence against Indigenous women is important. The disproportionate and devastating measure of violence experienced by far too many Indigenous women is a direct result of colonialism. There is no question that Indigenous women and girls have survived much violence, but they are now also facing the highest rates of over-incarceration in the country; yet another form of colonial violence."Kim Beaudin is the national vice-chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.
Hong Kong is ground zero in a new Cold War - and democracies must lend support
Gloria Fung: "We must join the Canadians living in Hong Kong in holding politicians accountable on election day and throughout their terms in office. The extradition bill - the sword hanging over the heads of anyone who ever sets foot in Hong Kong - must be withdrawn. The people of Hong Kong are struggling to preserve rights guaranteed by international treaty, rights we take for granted." Gloria Fung is president of Canada-Hong Kong Link.

LIVING BETTER
How a train trip across Canada helped me heal
When travelling solo, you're with your own thoughts for most of the day, so having a strong mind is necessary," Sarah Pledge Dicksonwrites in a First Person Essay. "This is true about tree planting as well. My mind was made strong out of necessity, but that was the strength I needed when I came back to my hometown and found it in me to seek out the help I needed."
MOMENT IN TIME
Henry David Thoreau moves to Walden Pond
July 4, 1845: "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." So goes the best-known passage of Henry David Thoreau's Walden, a work that had its beginning on this date in 1845 when the writer turned his back on contemporary society in favour of a small cabin on a piece of farmland owned by his friend and transcendentalist mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson. For the next two years, two months and two days, Thoreau immersed himself in nature, rejecting much of American life he found disgusting and frustrating, and striving to prove the beauty in living a simple life. His memoirs of this time, Walden, published in 1854, sold poorly, not winning its current status as an American classic until after Thoreau's death in 1862. Despite the fact the book literally includes an explanation of his motivation, academics ever since have argued about his true reasons. Thoreau himself later described the period as an experiment, and felt it impossible to live such a nature-first style long-term. Ken Carriere

Here are 6 things to avoid doing during a heat wave

Full text: Now that the heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/humidex-will-hit-near-40-c-as-montreals-heat-warning-extended ) has settled in over southwestern and central Quebec, residents sweltering their way through it are being reminded to stay hydrated and make time to spend in a cooler environment whenever possible.
But what are the errors to avoid during a heat wave? The Presse Canadienne asked that question to Dr. Pierre Gosselin, a climate and health adviser at the Institut national de santé publique du Québec, and here are six examples he provided of what NOT to do during a heat wave.
Don't consume very cold drinks. This isn't a good idea because the cold of the beverage can freeze up your sinuses, which is as unpleasant as being overly hot. While the idea is to cool off, super cold drinks are not a necessary part of the process. By all means stay by an air conditioner or a fan, and yes, remain hydrated, but cold beverages are not an essential way to do so.
Don't drink fruit juices. High in sugar content, the juices will not hydrate you the way water will. The sugar in fruit juices creates a need for extra water, which is self-defeating during a heat wave. In fact, make sure to consume some salt - either in your drink or food - while you're hydrating, which allows the body to balance its water intake.
Avoid alcohol. Moderate consumption of low-proof drinks like regular beers or wine is all right, but must be done in moderation. Avoid spirits, craft beers and high-proof wines. Increased alcohol intake provokes frequent urination and can act as a diuretic - which eliminates rather than increases hydration. It can also alter judgment and cause you to not observe the precautions needed during a heat wave.
Do not take a cold shower. Water temperature isn't as cold in summer as it is in winter and while you're perfectly free to let your shower head chill up as much as possible, a cool rather than frigid shower will inflict less of a shock on your system.
Do not engage in strenuous activity - at least not after sunrise or before sundown. Jogging in the heat is risky enough, but given the increased level of air pollution that attends the arrival of a heat wave, you're not doing your lungs any favours. The warning extends to all physical activity - exercise or physical labour - since high temperatures and high levels of activity can add up to dehydration and potentially fatal heat stroke.
Do not leave your drapes open. Once again, at least not after sunrise or before sundown. Open curtains during the day let in heat as well as sunlight. Also, don't operate appliances such as ovens, dishwashers and washing machines and dryers during a heat wave because they will add heat to an already over warm environment.

Hot reads for Montreal's hot weeks, from Adam Gopnik to Julie Delporte

Full text: It's a tradition that has survived everything modern life and technology can throw at it: When summer rolls around, people reach for a book. Reading, it would seem, is the perfect activity for that very specific state in which heat-induced lassitude and mental engagement overlap. There's even a small sub-genre of books about reading books in the summer.
Here, then, are some suggestions for filling the seasonal reading need. There's no particular genre bias at play, the reasoning being that a good book is a good book no matter the weather. Included are a couple of titles already covered in this space but long enough ago that a friendly reminder won't go amiss, as well as a couple still unread by this reviewer but worthy of a flyer based on reputation. Most are available electronically, but as always this reviewer recommends the format that you won't mind seeing splashed with the occasional bit of water or lotion.
Adam Gopnik's( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/adam-gopnik-is-back-and-raging-against-the-habs-and-trump-machines ) A Thousand Small Sanities: The Moral Adventure of Liberalism (Basic Books, 249 pages, $36.50) arrives in what feels like the nick of time. A corrective has been needed for the slow but steady demonization of small-l liberalism and the traditions it embodies, and former Montrealer Gopnik has applied the rigour and wit familiar to fans of his New Yorker pieces and essay collections to the task. Early on, he nails what makes liberalism such a soft target for absolutists at both ends of the spectrum: "The world is an imperfect place, and liberals are imperfect actors within it." Focusing on major figures in the l-word's evolution - he's especially illuminating on John Stuart Mill and his critically undervalued wife, Harriet Taylor - Gopnik humanizes what could have been a dry polemic, and leaves crucial space for the thought that the pendulum may yet swing back from its current authoritarian-friendly position. "Liberalism," he writes, "is realistic about the huge task of remaking worlds. But it is romantic about the possibility of making marginally happier endings for as many as possible within this one."
Mark Abley's The Organist has a worth beyond its immense literary value.
Mark Abley's The Organist: Fugues, Fatherhood, and a Fragile Mind( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/books/books-mark-abley-pays-eloquent-tribute-to-his-complicated-father-in-the-organist ) (University of Regina Press, 312 pages, $24.95) has been echoing in this reviewer's head ever since first reading late last year. In the intervening months, it has achieved across-the-board critical raves and word-of-mouth success; this is one of those rare and heartening cases of a book and its ideal readership finding each other. At a time when unprecedented numbers of people are dealing with caring for their parents, and with grieving their loss, books like this memoir of the author's relationship with his musician father have a bona fide utility beyond their literary value. Abley is no sentimentalist: his often difficult father gets nothing like a free ride. But he ends up with an indelible testament to honesty being the best form of love and respect.
Self-portrait by Ebony Flowers.
Hot Comb by Ebony Flowers (Drawn & Quarterly, 180 pages, $24.95) charts one African-American woman's youth and coming of age through a series of short stories and vignettes, all having something to do with hair. Graphic lit is a form ideally suited to the story Hot Comb tells: Flowers is able to pack her frames with the kind of detail that brings a narrative fully alive, while her deceptively naive drawing style belies the psychological depth of her character portraits, pulling you in by stages until you feel yourself a participant in these women's travails.
Self-portrait by Julie Delporte.
Occupying a similar but different space in the comics Venn diagram is This Woman's Work by Julie Delporte (Drawn & Quarterly, 256 pages, $29.95). Named for the Kate Bush song, this impressionistic work is essentially a meditation on how women who create are faced with the reality that they will still be expected to do everything traditionally demanded of women as well. Delporte's chosen medium - her palette looks to this admittedly untrained eye to be drawn from a set of Laurentien coloured pencils - communicates both vulnerability and a guarded optimism, and her writing is razor-sharp.
Mikella Nicol is a master of millennial tension.
If it's true that the young inhabit their own world, then novels about urban youth can feel like dispatches from a foreign country even when they're set in your own neighbourhood. Mikella Nicol's Aphelia( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/making-the-scene-in-2019-quebec-artists-to-watch-this-year ) (Véhicule Press, 160 pages, $18.95, translated by Lesley Trites), a cause célèbre on its original 2017 French publication, follows the ups and downs - mostly downs - of a 20-something graveyard-shift worker at a call centre during a summer heat wave as she attempts to recover from the messy end of a volatile relationship. If you've found your views on millennials piqued and enriched by Geneviève Pettersen and Guillaume Morissette, Nicol looks like the natural next thing.
Also in the realm of potential crossover, Eric Dupont's Giller-shortlisted family epic Songs for the Cold of Heart (QC Fiction, 608 pages, $27.95) has some distance to go before its profile in English starts approaching its stature as a modern classic of Québécois literature. What better time than the dog days, then, to start catching up? Peter McCambridge's translation is eminently readable. There's really no reason to put it off any longer.
EQUALLY WORTHY
Young readers, and all seekers of comic relief, should investigate Elise Gravel's( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/elise-gravels-childrens-books-never-talk-down-to-readers ) laugh-per-page The Worst Book Ever, a meta exercise in creating exactly what its title claims.
A trio of recent books across the crime and thriller spectrum - Ann Lambert's( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/playwright-ann-lambert-shows-a-flair-for-newly-adopted-genre ) The Birds That Stay, Denis Coupal's Blindshot and Catherine McKenzie's( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/books/catherine-mckenzie-a-convincing-storyteller-in-court-and-on-the-page ) I'll Never Tell - evince a local tradition in rude health.

Full text: Now that the heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/humidex-will-hit-near-40-c-as-montreals-heat-warning-extended ) has settled in over southwestern and central Quebec, residents sweltering their way through it are being reminded to stay hydrated and make time to spend in a cooler environment whenever possible.
But what are the errors to avoid during a heat wave? The Presse Canadienne asked that question to Dr. Pierre Gosselin, a climate and health adviser at the Institut national de santé publique du Québec, and here are six examples he provided of what NOT to do during a heat wave.
Don't consume very cold drinks. This isn't a good idea because the cold of the beverage can freeze up your sinuses, which is as unpleasant as being overly hot. While the idea is to cool off, super cold drinks are not a necessary part of the process. By all means stay by an air conditioner or a fan, and yes, remain hydrated, but cold beverages are not an essential way to do so.
Don't drink fruit juices. High in sugar content, the juices will not hydrate you the way water will. The sugar in fruit juices creates a need for extra water, which is self-defeating during a heat wave. In fact, make sure to consume some salt - either in your drink or food - while you're hydrating, which allows the body to balance its water intake.
Avoid alcohol. Moderate consumption of low-proof drinks like regular beers or wine is all right, but must be done in moderation. Avoid spirits, craft beers and high-proof wines. Increased alcohol intake provokes frequent urination and can act as a diuretic - which eliminates rather than increases hydration. It can also alter judgment and cause you to not observe the precautions needed during a heat wave.
Do not take a cold shower. Water temperature isn't as cold in summer as it is in winter and while you're perfectly free to let your showerhead chill up as much as possible, a cool rather than frigid shower will inflict less of a shock on your system.
Do not engage in strenuous activity - at least not after sunrise or before sundown. Jogging in the heat is risky enough, but given the increased level of air pollution that attends the arrival of a heat wave, you're not doing your lungs any favours. The warning extends to all physical activity - exercise or physical labour - since high temperatures and high levels of activity can add up to dehydration and potentially fatal heat stroke.
Do not leave your drapes open. Once again, at least not after sunrise or before sundown. Open curtains during the day let in heat as well as sunlight. Also, don't operate appliances such as ovens, dishwashers and washing machines and driers during a heat wave because they will add heat to an already over warm environment.

Full text: With Oka Beach being closed( https://www.sepaq.com/pq/oka/nouvelles/nouvelle.dot?id=4cb1ba6b-ef58-47db-8b92-55a527daded6&language_id=2 ) during the first heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ) of 2019, here are a few other options to beat the heat.
Verdun Beach( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/long-awaited-chilly-verdun-beach-opens-on-a-hot-saturday )
This brand-new beach opened on June 22, just in time for a classic Montreal heat wave. The beach opens from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., where you can enjoy the calm (and cool) water of the St. Lawrence River or lounge around on the sandy beach. The beach also features a climbing wall and slides for those looking to get a sweat going before taking a dip.
Jean-Doré Beach( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/jean-dore-beach-sand-swimming-sun-montreal/ )
Located five minutes from downtown at Parc Jean-Drapeau, this convenient beach is accessible by bus, car, métro or bike. Jean-Doré beach also features the Aquazilla obstacle course, free wifi, snack bar, changing rooms and lockers.
Aquatic Complexe, Parc Jean-Drapeau( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/aquatic-complex-pool-swimming-competitions-montreal/ )
Some people would rather swim in a pool than a lake. If you're that person, hit up one of Montreal's public pools such as the Aquatic Complexe at Parc Jean-Drapeau. Featuring a recreational pool for wading and eight lanes designated for swimming laps, the Aquatic Complexe has all your swimming needs covered.
Parc Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Pool( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7297,74577648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL )
Located on Brébeuf St. within Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Park in the heart of the Plateau, Laurier pool is another great option for Montrealers looking to seek refuge from the heat. The park features lots of great 'pool day' activities (Ping-Pong, playground, workout circuit, etc.), so you might want to pack a lunch and stay the entire day.
Splash Pads( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much )
With splash pads located all over the city, we asked some of our newsroom staffers to compile a list of their favourite pads to take their children( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much ) when the heat is too much to handle.

Full text: This past week has been a scorcher. If you're lucky enough to have air conditioning at home, where you work and in your vehicle, consider yourself fortunate. For many Montrealers, especially those who are among the most vulnerable, this has been a stressful time.
We know that our elderly are particularly vulnerable, as are our children, those who are ill and the homeless. We also know that our pets need extra love and attention in the heat, but somehow this knowledge does not seem to be sufficient to prevent tragedies. Just as inevitable as heat waves seem to be tragic, fatal incidents of children and pets being left in vehicles. There was yet another such incident involving a toddler in British Columbia this past May. Yes, we seem to have this conversation year after year.
Something that I have heard all too often from older family members who live without air conditioning is that they sometimes do not feel the heat rise as quickly as they used to. The results can be especially devastating, as they may not be fully aware of how hot it is, especially if they suffer from such additional health conditions as asthma or Alzheimer's, or be recovering from a stroke. This is why it's essential to take the time to check in on our parents, relatives or neighbours, and perhaps take them out to an air conditioned mall or movie theatre. Those who do so know how important it is, but all too often we become preoccupied with our jobs, kids and travels. I was pleased to see Mayor Valérie Plante announcing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ) proactive initiatives Wednesday to stay ahead of this heat wave and to ensure that our city's most vulnerable are checked on and taken care of.
Infants and toddlers are also particularly vulnerable to dehydration or heat exhaustion. The symptoms can come on quickly in the intense heat, and the damage can be devastating.

The timing of the current heat wave, coinciding with the recent big July 1 moving day, creates extra challenges, particularly when it comes to pets: this is a time when animals are abandoned in great numbers by owners moving to places where pets are excluded. The number of animals abandoned by their owners annually in Montreal is around 10,000-15,000, which, while staggeringly high, is still significantly lower than the 100,000 pets that used to be left annually 30 years ago.( http://www.iheartradio.ca/virginradio/montreal/news/moving-day-brings-annual-surge-in-abandoned-pets-1.9388165 )
Hot weather increases the vulnerability of pets( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/how-to-help-pets-stay-cool-and-safe-during-intense-heat ), abandoned or not. It's essential to raise awareness among pet owners. I came across a graphic online that startled me. When temperatures reach 25 C, the temperature of asphalt is much hotter, at 51 C. At just 32 C, as we have been experiencing, the temperature of asphalt feels closer to 60 C, and this can lead to scorched paws. I don't need to own a dog to know that such temperatures can lead to avoidable accidents.
There also have been some troubling reports online recently of dogs being tied to trees while their owners shop, and more posts than I can count where people are saying that their neighbours who moved left their cats or dogs behind. We all share in the responsibility of bringing attention to these incidents, whether it means posting them online or contacting the right authorities.
But there has been good news, too. I love reading that some stores across the country have been allowing dogs inside their stores to discourage shoppers from leaving their pets locked up in their vehicles. I also love seeing establishments leave bowls of fresh water outside for dogs being walked.
We'll all have an easier time getting through the summer heat if we remain vigilant and think of others.

Full text: Environment Canada on Thursday issued special weather statements and heat warnings for several areas of southwestern and central Quebec as well as southern and eastern Ontario as a heat wave continued to hover over those regions.
In Montreal, meteorologists are predicting a high on Thursday of 34 Celsius, which, when coupled with the humidity factor( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ), will feel like 39 C. The temperature will fall overnight to 24 C before climbing to 32 C on Friday.
Forecasters warn that the heat will be particularly acute and uncomfortable in highly urbanized zones of the Montreal area.
Warnings and special weather statements have also been issued for Longueuil, Laval, Gatineau, Pontiac, Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville, Victoriaville, Shawinigan, Trois-Rivières, Joliette and Bécancour.
Ottawa, Sudbury, North Bay, Pembroke and Hawkesbury in Ontario are also on alert.
The temperature is expected to climb on Thursday in Quebec City, Sherbrooke and Saint-Georges, although no special warnings have been issued for these areas.
Some relief is expected on Saturday, with temperatures approaching seasonal norms and a 60-per-cent chance of showers.
On Wednesday, Quebec Health Minster Danielle McCann said the public health system was ready to face the heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ), with air conditioned common areas established in long-term care centres.
A heat wave in the summer of 2018 was blamed for 66 deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ) on the island of Montreal.

Full text: As Environment Canada issued a heat warning Wednesday, Mayor Valérie Plante said Montreal is monitoring temperatures and is ready to deploy emergency measures if necessary.
Public health authorities are doing everything possible to protect the vulnerable and avoid a repeat of the consequences of last summer's heat wave, when 66 people died, she said.
"I want to reassure the population that we are currently on alert for a possible wave of extreme heat and we are ready to intervene if necessary," Plante said at a press conference at city hall.
"All stakeholders in the Montreal agglomeration, including both the independent municipalities and boroughs, are working in close collaboration to ensure the well-being and safety of all Montrealers," she added.
Environment Canada forecast highs of 32 C Wednesday, 33 C Thursday and 34 C Friday, dipping to minimums of 21 C, 24 C and 21 C, respectively, overnight.
That is just under the minimum for deploying emergency measures, according to Montreal's civic protection organization, which says it's a heat wave when one of the two following conditions is met:
The maximum average temperature reaches or exceeds 33 C for three consecutive days and the minimum temperature reaches or exceeds 20 C.
The minimum average temperature reaches or exceeds 25 C for two consecutive nights. Dr. David Kaiser, who is responsible for environmental health and healthy lifestyles at the regional public health directorate, said the most important thing is to protect those most vulnerable to heat: seniors, people with chronic illnesses or mental health problems, and children age four and under.
Last year, firefighters and police visited 40,000 homes to check up on vulnerable people.
This year, public health authorities are focusing on better targeting door-to-door visits to ensure they reach those who are in most need of help, Kaiser said.
"We want to better target places and people," he said.
Visits will concentrate on older buildings, such as rooming houses without air conditioning, and on inner-city neighbourhoods lacking green spaces, which combat heat islands, he said.
The public health department has created a registry of addresses that have already been identified by firefighters and police, as well as volunteers who provide services like Meals-on-Wheels, he said.
That list, which is not public, is being constantly refined as emergency workers monitor vulnerable people, he said.
Public health authorities are also considering following the example of Paris, which keeps a self-declared list of people especially vulnerable to high temperatures, such as the elderly or people with breathing problems, who can register by phone.
Authorities check in with people on the list by phone, provide advice on how to cool off and send medical help if necessary.
"It's a model we find interesting," Kaiser said.
Opposition leader Lionel Perez called on the city to adopt the Parisian system without delay. He also urged health authorities to deploy the heat wave emergency plan without waiting for temperatures to meet the official criteria.
The action plan has been deployed three times in the past: in 2010, 2011 and 2018.
However, Kaiser said it does not improve outcomes to deploy the emergency plan before it's necessary, since mortality only increases after two or three days of intense heat.
"That doesn't mean nothing is being done," he said. Even before temperatures reach critical levels, it's important to take measures to protect yourself and vulnerable people you know, he noted.
Here are some tips for coping with hot weather:
Drink water regularly without waiting to be thirsty. Ensure that children are drinking plenty of water.
Spend two to three hours a day in a cool environment, ideally with air conditioning.
Reduce physical effort.
Never leave a child alone in a car or in a poorly ventilated room.
Keep in touch with relatives and other people you know who are elderly or sick.
The city is leaving it up to boroughs whether to extend hours at swimming and wading pools, and said it doesn't know which ones are doing so, said Laurence Houde-Roy, a spokesperson for the mayor's office. Côte-des-Neiges- Notre-Dame-de-Grâce issued an advisory saying the borough's two outdoor pools will stay open until 8 p.m. and wading pools until 7:30 p.m. (Martin Luther King Park) or 8 p.m. (Trenholme Park).

Full text: Despite the heat wave upon us this week, this summer should be cooler than last summer, according to the current forecast.
"Today and the next couple of days should not be the rule for the whole summer," said André Cantin, meteorologist at Environment Canada. "If we look back, Montreal gets one or two heat waves per summer on average," he said.
Environment Canada issued the first heat warning of the summer on Wednesday.
"The beginning of July this year is quite similar to last year, but the warm temperatures we have today and tomorrow won't last as long as they did (last year)," Cantin said.
This week's heat wave will last until Friday, and starting Saturday the temperature is expected to drop to around 26 C.
This time last year, Montreal went through a seven-day heat wave that resulted in the deaths of 66 people, 13 more than what was initially reported.
Montreal only had one "official" heat wave last summer, said Cantin, although it may have felt like there were a couple. However, Cantin said "we were close many times" during July and August 2018 to having other heat waves.
"We talk about a heat wave when we have three days in a row with a maximum temperature of 30 C or more," Cantin said.
On several occasions last summer, we came close. During July and August, Cantin noted six times in which we had two consecutive days above 30 C, while the third day was just under the threshold.
Last year's heat wave did not set a record.
"I don't think there was a longer heat wave than the one in 2001," said Cantin, referring to a 10-day heat wave that lasted from Aug. 1 to 10 in Montreal.
That same year, the temperature was above 30 C for 17 cumulative days in July. In July 2018, there were only 11 days with temperatures above 30 C.
The earliest recorded heat wave in Montreal was in 1962, lasting three days from May 17 to 19.
"The average temperature for July is around 26 C for Montreal, and that's what we should expect (this summer)," Cantin said.
"That's not to say we won't have a couple days above 30 C," he added.
Meanwhile, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said on Wednesday the city is ready to deploy emergency measures if needed during this week's heat wave.
JUNE 2018 VS. JUNE 2019
The temperature this June was below the normal mean temperature of 18.6 C, Cantin said. The mean temperature in June 2018 was 19 C compared with 18.2 C this year.
If we compare temperatures in June 2018 with June 2019, each month only had two days with temperatures above 30 C. However, June 2019 was warmer because there were more days closer to the 30 C mark, Cantin said. manhoury@postmedia.com Twitter.com/mia_anhoury

Montreal releases emergency plan as temperatures forecast to rise

Full text: With a potential heat wave looming, Montreal says it's prepared to lengthen pool hours and send firefighters door to door to mitigate conditions that contributed to the deaths of 66 people last year.
"With the floods of the spring, and the winter that was especially difficult, or last year's heat wave, it is clear that we're more and more vulnerable to extreme climate events, and we need to act," Mayor Valérie Plante said Wednesday at a news conference.
Ms. Plante said the city's emergency plan is especially focused on vulnerable people such as the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, those living alone, outdoor workers and newborns.
The plan includes extending hours for pools, libraries, community centres and homeless shelters if temperatures climb to dangerous levels for several days in a row.
She said officials will go door to door to check on people, hand out water bottles to the homeless and encourage citizens to stay cool and hydrated.
Longer term, she says the city has increased its budget to plant more trees in order to reduce the heat island effect.
A meteorologist for Environment Canada says Montreal temperatures are expected to reach between 31 and 34 C in the next three days, with a humidex that could reach 40 C.
Ms. Plante said the plan would be deployed if temperatures reach a daytime high of 33 C for three days in a row.
The city's public-health authority reported that 66 people, most of them seniors or chronically ill, died as a result of extreme heat on the island of Montreal between June 30 and July 8 last year.
Recommendations in its May report included the creation of a registry of vulnerable people and planting more trees and greenery to absorb heat and combat the heat island effect.
The study indicated people living in heat islands were twice as likely to die from extreme heat than others in cooler parts of the city. Neighbourhoods in heat islands are also home to a higher percentage of people living in poverty.
David Kaiser, a doctor with the health authority, said the city is taking a multipronged approach to preparing for heat waves. "On one hand, it's making our neighbourhoods less hot - that's greening, changing building architecture and the way we build our neighbourhoods, reducing the amount of traffic in our neighbourhoods," he said at the news conference. On the other hand is the need to care for the vulnerable and break their social isolation, he said.
Last summer's heat wave officially occurred between June 30 and July 5, when daytime temperatures were recorded between 31.9 C and 35.5 C.
André Cantin, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, said this week's weather event will be shorter and less severe than last year, but that Canadians should prepare for more frequent and intense heat waves as global temperatures rise.

Montreal ready for heat wave: Plante

Full text: As Environment Canada issued a heat warning Wednesday, Mayor Valérie Plante said Montreal is monitoring temperatures and is ready to deploy emergency measures if necessary.
Public-health authorities are doing everything possible to protect the vulnerable and avoid a repeat of the consequences of last summer's heat wave, when 66 people died( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), she said.
"I want to reassure the population that we are currently on alert for a possible wave of extreme heat and we are ready to intervene if necessary," Plante said at a press conference at city hall.
"All stakeholders in the Montreal agglomeration, including both the independent municipalities and boroughs, are working in close collaboration to ensure the well-being and safety of all Montrealers," she added.
Environment Canada forecast highs of 32C Wednesday, 33C Thursday and 34C Friday, dipping to minimums of 21C, 24C and 21C, respectively, overnight.
That is just shy of the minimum for deploying emergency measures, according to Montreal's civic protection organization, which says it's a heat wave when one of the two following conditions is met:
- the maximum average temperature reaches or exceeds 33C for three consecutive days and the minimum temperature reaches or exceeds 20C.
- the minimum average temperature reaches or exceeds 25C for two consecutive nights.
The most important thing is to protect those most vulnerable to heat.
Dr. David Kaiser, who is responsible for environmental health and healthy lifestyles at the regional public health directorate, said the most important thing is to protect those most vulnerable to heat: seniors, people with chronic illnesses or mental health problems and children age four and under.
Last year, firefighters and police visited 40,000 homes to check up on vulnerable people.
This year, public health authorities are focusing on better targeting door-to-door visits to ensure they reach those who are in most need of help, Kaiser said.
"We want to better target places and people," he said.
Visits will concentrate on older buildings such as rooming houses without air conditioning and on inner-city neighbourhoods lacking green spaces, which combat heat islands, he said.
The public health department has created a registry of addresses that have already been identified by firefighters and police as well as volunteers who provide services like Meals-on-Wheels, he said.
That list, which is not public, is being constantly refined as emergency workers monitor vulnerable people, he said.
Public health authorities are also considering following the example of Paris, which keeps a self-declared list of people especially vulnerable to high temperatures, such as the elderly or people with breathing problems, who can register by phone.
Authorities check in with people on the list by phone, provide advice on how to cool off and send medical help if necessary.
"It's a model we find interesting," Kaiser said.
Opposition leader Lionel Perez called on the city to adopt the Parisian system without delay. He also urged health authorities to deploy the heat wave emergency plan without waiting for temperatures to meet the official criteria.
The action plan has been deployed three times in the past.
The action plan has been deployed three times in the past: in 2010, 2011 and 2018.
However, Kaiser said it does not improve outcomes to deploy the emergency plan before it's necessary, since mortality only increases after a two or three days of intense heat.
"That doesn't mean nothing is being done," he said. Even before temperatures reach critical levels, it's important to take measures to protect yourself and vulnerable people you know, he noted.
Here are some tips for coping with hot weather:
Drink water regularly, without waiting to be thirsty. Ensure that children are drinking plenty of water.
Spend two to three hours a day in cool environment, ideally with air conditioning.
Reduce physical effort.
Never leave a child alone in a car or in a poorly ventilated room.
Keep in touch with relatives and other people you know who are elderly or sick.
The city is leaving it up to boroughs whether to extend hours at swimming and wading pools and doesn't know which ones are doing so, said Laurence Houde-Roy, a spokesperson for the mayor's office. Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce issued an advisory saying the borough's two outdoor pools will stay open until 8 p.m. and wading pools until 7:30 p.m. (Martin Luther King Park) or 8 p.m. (Trenholme Park).

Full text: With Oka Beach being closed( https://www.sepaq.com/pq/oka/nouvelles/nouvelle.dot?id=4cb1ba6b-ef58-47db-8b92-55a527daded6&language_id=2 ) during the first heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ) of 2019, here are a few other options to beat the heat.
Verdun Beach( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/long-awaited-chilly-verdun-beach-opens-on-a-hot-saturday )
This brand-new beach opened on June 22, just in time for a classic Montreal heat wave. The beach opens from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., where you can enjoy the calm (and cool) water of the St. Lawrence River or lounge around on the sandy beach. The beach also features a climbing wall and slides for those looking to get a sweat going before taking a dip.
Jean-Doré Beach( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/jean-dore-beach-sand-swimming-sun-montreal/ )
Located five minutes from downtown at Parc Jean-Drapeau, this convenient beach is accessible by bus, car, métro or bike. Jean-Doré beach also features the Aquazilla obstacle course, free wifi, snack bar, changing rooms and lockers.
Aquatic Complexe, Parc Jean-Drapeau( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/aquatic-complex-pool-swimming-competitions-montreal/ )
Some people would rather swim in a pool than a lake. If you're that person, hit up one of Montreal's public pools such as the Aquatic Complexe at Parc Jean-Drapeau. Featuring a recreational pool for wading and eight lanes designated for swimming laps, the Aquatic Complexe has all your swimming needs covered.
Parc Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Pool( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7297,74577648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL )
Located on Brébeuf St. within Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Park in the heart of the Plateau, Laurier pool is another great option for Montrealers looking to seek refuge from the heat. The park features lots of great 'pool day' activities (Ping-Pong, playground, workout circuit, etc.), so you might want to pack a lunch and stay the entire day.
Splash Pads( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much )
With splash pads located all over the city, we asked some of our newsroom staffers to compile a list of their favourite pads to take their children( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much ) when the heat is too much to handle.

Full text: As Environment Canada issued a heat warning Wednesday, Mayor Valérie Plante said Montreal is monitoring temperatures and is ready to deploy emergency measures if necessary.
Public-health authorities are doing everything possible to protect the vulnerable and avoid a repeat of the consequences of last summer's heat wave, when 66 people died( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), she said.
"I want to reassure the population that we are currently on alert for a possible wave of extreme heat and we are ready to intervene if necessary," Plante said at a press conference at city hall.
"All stakeholders in the Montreal agglomeration, including both the independent municipalities and boroughs, are working in close collaboration to ensure the well-being and safety of all Montrealers," she added.
Environment Canada forecast highs of 32C Wednesday, 33C Thursday and 34C Friday, dipping to minimums of 21C, 24C and 21C, respectively, overnight.
That is just shy of the minimum for deploying emergency measures, according to Montreal's civic protection organization, which says it's a heat wave when one of the two following conditions is met:
- the maximum average temperature reaches or exceeds 33C for three consecutive days and the minimum temperature reaches or exceeds 20C.
- the minimum average temperature reaches or exceeds 25C for two consecutive nights.
Dr. David Kaiser, who is responsible for environmental health and healthy lifestyles at the regional public health directorate, said the most important thing is to protect those most vulnerable to heat: seniors, people with chronic illnesses or mental health problems and children age four and under.
Last year, firefighters and police visited 40,000 homes to check up on vulnerable people.
This year, public health authorities are focusing on better targeting door-to-door visits to ensure they reach those who are in most need of help, Kaiser said.
"We want to better target places and people," he said.
Visits will concentrate on older buildings such as rooming houses without air conditioning and on inner-city neighbourhoods lacking green spaces, which combat heat islands, he said.
The public health department has created a registry of addresses that have already been identified by firefighters and police as well as volunteers who provide services like Meals-on-Wheels, he said.
That list, which is not public, is being constantly refined as emergency workers monitor vulnerable people, he said.
Public health authorities are also considering following the example of Paris, which keeps a self-declared list of people especially vulnerable to high temperatures, such as the elderly or people with breathing problems, who can register by phone.
Authorities check in with people on the list by phone, provide advice on how to cool off and send medical help if necessary.
"It's a model we find interesting," Kaiser said.
Opposition leader Lionel Perez called on the city to adopt the Parisian system without delay. He also urged health authorities to deploy the heat wave emergency plan without waiting for temperatures to meet the official criteria.
The action plan has been deployed three times in the past: in 2010, 2011 and 2018.
However, Kaiser said it does not improve outcomes to deploy the emergency plan before it's necessary, since mortality only increases after a two or three days of intense heat.
"That doesn't mean nothing is being done," he said. Even before temperatures reach critical levels, it's important to take measures to protect yourself and vulnerable people you know, he noted.
Here are some tips for coping with hot weather:
- Drink water regularly, without waiting to be thirsty. Ensure that children are drinking plenty of water.
- Spend two to three hours a day in cool environment, ideally with air conditioning.
- Reduce physical effort.
- Never leave a child alone in a car or in a poorly ventilated room.
- Keep in touch with relatives and other people you know who are elderly or sick.
The city is leaving it up to boroughs whether to extend hours at swimming and wading pools and doesn't know which ones are doing so, said Laurence Houde-Roy, a spokesperson for the mayor's office. Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce issued an advisory saying the borough's two outdoor pools will stay open until 8 p.m. and wading pools until 7:30 p.m. (Martin Luther King Park) or 8 p.m. (Trenholme Park).

Full text: What a scorcher of a day!
The English Montreal School board is contesting the transfer of two of its schools in court( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-seeks-injunction-to-block-school-transfers ). Lawyers for the board filed a motion in Quebec Superior Court on Tuesday seeking an injunction to block the transfers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-parents-disappointed-with-decision-to-transfer-schools ) until a hearing can be held on the merits of the case. "He's making the decision when the decision (to transfer) belongs to us, not just the school board, but the greater (English) community," said Joe Ortona, the board's vice-chairperson. "We are not just contesting it because of those two schools, we are contesting it in order to protect our other schools so the minister cannot do this in the future." Education Minister Jean-François Roberge said last week that he was forced to transfer General Vanier elementary and John Paul 1 junior high to the Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île because its schools are bursting at the seams. A spokesperson for Roberge said they're disappointed, but not surprised, by the EMSB's decision.
Minority francophone groups outside Quebec say they are ready to create a common front to help the EMSB keep its schools( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/francophone-groups-outside-quebec-support-emsbs-fight-to-keep-schools ). Last week, citing a desperate need for class space in its francophone school system, Quebec Education Minister Jean-François Roberge decided to transfer two English-language EMSB schools to the Pointe-de-l'Île school commission. Carol Jolin, head of the Assemblée de la francophonie de l'Ontario, said he's ready to demonstrate alongside his English-speaking counterparts to protect English-language schools, even though some are half empty. Robert Melanson, of the Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick, believes that in certain regions, anglophone minorities are as much victims of discrimination when it comes to receiving public services as francophones outside of Quebec. He, too, said he's ready to support the fight by Quebec anglophones to keep their schools.
Proposed electoral reforms in Quebec could increase the influence of minority communities in government( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-electoral-reform-could-boost-clout-of-minorities-researcher ), according to one researcher. Henry Milner, a member of the board of the Mouvement Démocratie Nouvelle( https://www.democratienouvelle.ca/en/ ), said the last election was a classic example of how "first past the post" elections can diminish minority votes. The Coalition Avenir Québec looked at their level of support off and on the island and chose to invest its resources in ridings that would pay off electorally outside Montreal. The CAQ won 74 of Quebec's 125 ridings with 37.8 per cent of the vote. "Now there is really no input into their caucus or cabinet of people who represent the other ridings and so when they pass legislation, when they choose their priorities, they are responding to their electorate," he said. The province is due to debate electoral reform this fall, with the CAQ government proposing to scrap the existing voting system and replace it with a mixed proportional system similar to Scotland's.
Well, the Sebastian Aho optimism was fun while it lasted. Let's review the latest developments in this saga:
The Carolina Hurricanes made it official on Tuesday that they intend to match the offer sheet the Canadiens gave the restricted free-agent centre( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/hurricanes-will-match-canadiens-offer-to-sebastian-aho-carolina-gm ). This was an easy decision," Hurricanes GM Don Waddell said Tuesday on the team's website. "Sebastian is one of the best players in the league and the centrepiece of what we're building here." The Hurricanes actually did the Canadiens a favour by making the announcement so soon. They had seven days to make a decision and the longer they waited the fewer players would still be available to the Canadiens on the free-agent market.
Hurricanes ownership is claiming the Habs were played by Aho's agent( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-6rnx ).
Elsewhere, Brendan Kelly argues that the Aho bid was just Marc Bergevin's attempt to make himself look good( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/what-the-puck-canadiens-bid-for-aho-nothing-more-than-window-dressing ). "This is just one more spin from the cynical Canadiens management team," he writes. "It's an effort to distract fans from the fact that they were unable to sign the guy they really wanted, Matt Duchene."
Stu Cowan previously outlined what might happen if the Habs failed to nab Aho( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-what-happens-if-canadiens-dont-get-sebastian-aho ). Spoiler: not much. As with the departure of Alexander Radulov, there does not appear to be a backup plan.
As you may have noticed, Montreal is in the midst of a heatwave - and it's expected to last into the weekend( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-expected-until-the-weekend-in-montreal ). Environment Canada is forecasting a high of 30 for Tuesday, 31 for Wednesday, and 32 on Thursday and Friday while nighttime temperatures will hover between 18 and 22. Relief is expected on Saturday with the arrival of a cold front. Meteorologists define a heat wave as three consecutive days during which the temperature does not fall below 30C and nighttime temperatures remain above 20C. Humidex factors - a measure that takes into account the combined air temperature and humidity - also contribute to the calculation and are expected to jump this week as well. During periods of extreme heat, public health officials recommend that stays outdoors be broken up by several hours of exposure to a cooler environment, that physical activity be limited and water be consumed on a regular basis.

Full text: Montrealers may well be on their way to sweltering through their first heat wave of the year as temperatures this week are expected to continually break the 30C mark until this weekend.
Environment Canada is forecasting a high of 30 for Tuesday, 31 for Wednesday, and 32 on Thursday and Friday while nighttime temperatures will hover between 18 and 22.
Relief is expected on Saturday with the arrival of a cold front.
Meteorologists define a heat wave as three consecutive days during which the temperature does not fall below 30C and nighttime temperatures remain above 20C.
Humidex factors - a measure that takes into account the combined air temperature and humidity - also contribute to the calculation and are expected to jump this week as well.
"So long as we stay in the same air mass, we'll be stuck with high humidex readings of 35 to 40C," said André Cantin of Environment Canada, adding that the heat wave seemed to be centred on the greater Montreal area.
During periods of extreme heat, public health officials recommend that stays outdoors be broken up by several hours of exposure to a cooler environment, that physical activity be limited and water be consumed on a regular basis.
Last year, at least 66 persons died during a heat wave that gripped Montreal Island from June 30 to July 8. Most of the victims were elderly or suffered from chronic health problems.

Full text: Montrealers may well be on their way to sweltering through their first heat wave of the year as temperatures this week are expected to continually break the 30C mark until this weekend.
Environment Canada is forecasting a high of 30 for Tuesday, 31 for Wednesday, and 32 on Thursday and Friday while nighttime temperatures will hover between 18 and 22.
Relief is expected on Saturday with the arrival of a cold front.
Meteorologists define a heat wave as three consecutive days during which the temperature does not fall below 30C and nighttime temperatures remain above 20C.
Humidex factors - a measure that takes into account the combined air temperature and humidity - also contribute to the calculation and are expected to jump this week as well.
"So long as we stay in the same air mass, we'll be stuck with high humidex readings of 35 to 40C," said André Cantin of Environment Canada, adding that the heat wave seemed to be centred on the greater Montreal area.
During periods of extreme heat, public health officials recommend that stays outdoors be broken up by several hours of exposure to a cooler environment, that physical activity be limited and water be consumed on a regular basis.
Last year, at least 66 persons died during a heat wave that gripped Montreal Island from June 30 to July 8. Most of the victims were elderly or suffered from chronic health problems.

Full text: Finally, a few sunny days has me changing my flannel bed sheets, rolling up rugs (I love the cool tile floors in warm weather) and closing the blinds each afternoon to keep the house cool. Yes, summer is 'somewhat' arriving next week! I'm praying the heat won't be as bad as last year's high temperatures, but I'm also getting my place ready just in case.
For me, that's a lot of work because my house is mostly decorated for cooler weather, with draperies, dark rugs and wool-upholstered furnishings. But sometimes all it takes is one small change (or decor accessory) to change your perception of how cool a room feels. If I add a seaside-scented candle, display beach glass in a bowl or bring in a new palm plant, I feel transported to a breezy summer island. Looking for summer-inspired accessories to cool down the look of your home? Here you go...now let's keep those temperatures cool!
Chill out
Let this old-style dispenser be your best hydrating friend, whether your spot to enjoy the hot weather is the balcony or your boudoir. Fill with ice cubes, garden mint and lemon slices then top up with water throughout the day. Ahhh! Recycled Glass Beverage Dispenser, $20, Homesense.ca
Breathe easy
Breathable linen bedding keeps you cool at night and the longer your relationship (with the sheets, that is!), the softer to the skin linen becomes. Washed Linen Duvet Cover in chrome colour, $250, MaisonTESS.com
Cool-down style
Picnics and potlucks never looked so stylish! The glass is heatproof and the bamboo lid doubles as a base for the bowl when serving. 365 Glass food container with bamboo lid, $6, IKEA.com
Bohemian breeze
An airy open-weave design keeps the breeze flowing right through this side table. The fade-resistant handwoven PVC cord over a rustproof steel frame makes it ideal indoors and out. White/Grey Side Table, $148, UrbanBarn.com
Cool as a cucumber
Keep your fruits and veggies cool and show off your best tropical finds when shopping the Atwater or Jean-Talon Market with this eco-friendly fridge storage tote. Hand Picked Freshness Reusable Drawstring bag, $10, Simons.ca.
Try these tried and true ways to keep you and your home cool on extra hot days.
The Science of Circulating Air - Hot air rises: To release hot air that's built up during the day, run the fan in an upper level bathroom after sunset. At the same time, open a window or door on a lower level to invite the cooler night air in and up.
Get Wet Feet: During extreme heat waves, wet a pair of cotton socks and wear them to bed (place a towel under your feet to keep mattress dry). The air movement from a circulation fan will cool your feet and lower your body temp until you fall asleep.
Take a Dip ... or Two: Who needs a pool? Keep the tub filled with cool water and take a quick dip (10 minutes) to cool down. Don't use soap and bath oils so you can reuse the bath water throughout the day - although you could add three or four drops of blue food colouring and pretend it's a pool!
Do you have a decor dilemma or want to give feedback? You can contact Karl on Facebook or Instagram at Karl Lohnes Designer.
Karl has worked as a home decor expert and product designer for 25 years. He appears Thursdays during the 8 a.m. hour on Global News Morning Montreal.

Police chief defends rise in stun-gun use

Full text: The use of stun guns by Montreal Police soared to 383 incidents in 2018 from 236 in 2017, according to the force's annual report.
Police Chief Sylvain Caron defended the increased use of electroshock weapons after presenting the annual report to Montreal's public security commission.
"It reassures me to have stun guns instead of using a firearm," Caron said to reporters after the meeting. "If verbal means don't work and other methods don't work, we want our people to use a stun gun instead of a firearm," he said.
Caron noted that in most cases, police officers don't have to actually use their stun gun but simply demonstrate they have it to defuse a situation.
"As a general rule, that is sufficient to calm a person who is in contact with reality, since obviously sometimes we have people who are not in contact with reality," he said.
Of the 383 times the weapons, often referred to by the trade name Taser, were used, police officers just demonstrated them 336 times, used them on people from a distance by projecting the electrical charge 46 times and applied them directly to a person's body at close range once.
Police spokesperson André Durocher said the fact they were only actually used on people 47 times shows that stun guns are an effective deterrent.
But opposition councillor and committee vice-chairperson Abdelhaq Sari said the rise in use of the weapons was worrisome.
"This can only increase the number of complaints we can have and it could create a clear correlation in terms of the perception of racial and social profiling," said Sari, the councillor for the Marie-Clarac district in Montreal North.
In April 2018, the police department announced a plan to equip all patrol cars with one of the electroshock weapons by 2020.
Committee chair Alex Norris, who questioned Caron about the increased use of stun guns during the presentation, said the city administration is studying whether giving one to every pair of police officers on the beat would make the public safer or put citizens at greater risk.
"The priority of our administration is to emphasize de-escalation," he said.
"We believe that is the best way to handle many situations and that repression should only be used as a last resort."
In April, the police department announced that over the next three years, 2,700 patrol officers will take a one-day training session to learn how to de-escalate tense situations and improve their conflict resolution skills.
While undergoing an organizational restructuring to solve deep-seated problems within the force, Montreal Police also dealt with a killer heat wave and the legalization of cannabis, Caron noted in his presentation.
Appointed to the job last November to replace interim chief Martin Prud'homme, Caron said restoring public confidence in police and shoring up morale in the 6,000-member force (including civilians) remain top priorities.
Caron said morale within the force has vastly improved in the wake of reforms introduced by Prud'homme, who returned to his position as director of the Sûreté du Québec. In March, he was relieved of his duties pending a probe into allegations of criminal conduct.
During the 2018 heat wave, which killed 66 people according to Montreal's public health authority, about 690 police officers went door-to-door to visit vulnerable residents of more than 25,000 dwellings.
Caron said he was preoccupied by a rise in pedestrian fatalities last year, when 18 pedestrians were killed, up from 15 in 2017. Most of the victims were over 55 years old.
There were 32 homicides on the island of Montreal in 2018, up from 24 in 2017. However, Caron noted the murder rate has dropped dramatically compared to 10 or 20 years ago.
Crimes against people went up by nearly two per cent, while crimes against property dropped by nearly six per cent. mscott@postmedia.com

"This can only increase the number of complaints we can have and it could create a clear correlation in terms of the perception of racial and social profiling," said Sari, the councillor for the Marie-Clarac district in Montreal North.
Sari charged that it is paradoxical that while the city is requiring police officers to receive training in de-escalating conflicts( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-to-undergo-more-training-to-defuse-conflicts ), particularly with vulnerable people, it is also providing officers with more stun guns.
In April 2018, the police department announced a plan to equip all patrol cars with one of the electroshock weapons by 2020( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-committee-studies-taser-use-by-police ).
Committee chair Alex Norris, who questioned Caron about the increased use of stun guns during the presentation, said the city administration is studying whether giving a stun gun to every pair of police officers on the beat would make the public safer or put citizens at greater risk.
"This is a sensitive question and one that we're following closely," he said.
"The priority of our administration is to emphasize de-escalation," he said.
"We believe that is the best way to handle many situations and that repression should only be used as a last resort," he said.
In April, the police department announced that over the next three years, 2,700 patrol officers will take a one-day training session to learn how to de-escalate tense situations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-to-undergo-more-training-to-defuse-conflicts ) and improve their conflict resolution skills.
In December, the police department unveiled a strategy to combat racial and social profiling( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-unveil-profiling-strategy ) that critics say falls short of the actions needed to eliminate the problem.
Police chief Sylvain Caron speaks to reporters with Mayor Valérie Plante after being sworn in at Montreal city hall on Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018.
While undergoing an organizational restructuring to solve deep-seated problems within the force, Montreal Police also dealt with a killer heat wave and( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ) the legalization of cannabis,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-marks-three-month-cannaversary-of-legal-weed ) Caron noted in his presentation to the committee.
Appointed to the job last November( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sylvain-caron-chosen-as-new-montreal-police-chief ) to replace interim chief Martin Prud'homme, Caron said restoring public confidence in police and shoring up morale in the 6,000-member force (including civilians) remain top priorities.
Prud'homme took over in December 2018 after a damning report by lawyer Michel Bouchard revealed deep-seated problems within the force that resulted in the suspension of then-chief Philippe Pichet.
Caron said morale within the force has vastly improved in the wake of reforms introduced by Prud'homme,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/report-card-on-montreal-police-force-to-made-public-by-quebec ) who returned to his position as director of the Sûreté du Québec. In March, he was relieved of his duties( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sq-chief-martin-prudhomme-relieved-of-duties-due-to-criminal-allegations ) pending a probe into allegations of criminal conduct.
During the 2018 heat wave, which killed 66 people according to Montreal's public health authority, about 690 police officers went door-to-door to visit vulnerable residents of more than 25,000 dwellings.
Caron said he was preoccupied by a rise in pedestrian fatalities last year, when 18 pedestrians were killed, up from 15 in 2017. Most of the victims were over 55 years old.
Another 87 pedestrians were seriously injured in 2018, up from 78 in 2017. A total of 1,169 pedestrians suffered minor injuries, about the same as the previous year.
Caron said the city's Vision Zero strategy to reduce traffic deaths and injuries, announced in March, should help to reduce pedestrian deaths.
There were 32 homicides on the island of Montreal in 2018, up from 24 in 2017. However, Caron noted the murder rate has dropped dramatically compared to 10 or 20 years ago.
Crimes against people went up by nearly two per cent, while crimes against property dropped by nearly six per cent.

Committee chair Alex Norris, who questioned Caron about the increased use of stun guns during the presentation, said the city administration is studying whether giving a stun gun to every pair of police officers on the beat would make the public safer or put citizens at greater risk.
"This is a sensitive question and one that we're following closely," he said.
"The priority of our administration is to emphasize de-escalation," he said.
"We believe that is the best way to handle many situations and that repression should only be used as a last resort," he said.
In April, the police department announced that over the next three years, 2,700 patrol officers will take a one-day training session to learn how to de-escalate tense situations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-to-undergo-more-training-to-defuse-conflicts ) and improve their conflict resolution skills.
In December, the police department unveiled a strategy to combat racial and social profiling( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-unveil-profiling-strategy ) that critics say falls short of the actions needed to eliminate the problem.
Police chief Sylvain Caron speaks to reporters with Mayor Valérie Plante after being sworn in at Montreal city hall on Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018.
While undergoing an organizational restructuring to solve deep-seated problems within the force, Montreal Police also dealt with a killer heat wave and( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ) the legalization of cannabis,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-marks-three-month-cannaversary-of-legal-weed ) Caron noted in his presentation to the committee.
Appointed to the job last November( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sylvain-caron-chosen-as-new-montreal-police-chief ) to replace interim chief Martin Prud'homme, Caron said restoring public confidence in police and shoring up morale in the 6,000-member force (including civilians) remain top priorities.
Prud'homme took over in December 2017 after a damning report by lawyer Michel Bouchard revealed deep-seated problems within the force that resulted in the suspension of then-chief Philippe Pichet.
Caron said morale within the force has vastly improved in the wake of reforms introduced by Prud'homme,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/report-card-on-montreal-police-force-to-made-public-by-quebec ) who returned to his position as director of the Sûreté du Québec. In March, he was relieved of his duties( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sq-chief-martin-prudhomme-relieved-of-duties-due-to-criminal-allegations ) pending a probe into allegations of criminal conduct.
During the 2018 heat wave, which killed 66 people according to Montreal's public health authority, about 690 police officers went door-to-door to visit vulnerable residents of more than 25,000 dwellings.
Caron said he was preoccupied by a rise in pedestrian fatalities last year, when 18 pedestrians were killed, up from 15 in 2017. Most of the victims were over 55 years old.
Another 87 pedestrians were seriously injured in 2018, up from 78 in 2017. A total of 1,169 pedestrians suffered minor injuries, about the same as the previous year.
Caron said the city's Vision Zero strategy to reduce traffic deaths and injuries, announced in March, should help to reduce pedestrian deaths.
There were 32 homicides on the island of Montreal in 2018, up from 24 in 2017. However, Caron noted the murder rate has dropped dramatically compared to 10 or 20 years ago.
Crimes against people went up by nearly two per cent, while crimes against property dropped by nearly six per cent.

Full text: A rise in pedestrian fatalities was among the most worrisome trends Montreal Police( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-police ) faced last year, chief Sylvain Caron said Tuesday while unveiling the force's annual report for 2018.
Eighteen pedestrians were killed in traffic on the island of Montreal, up by nearly 17 per cent from 15 in 2017, the report reveals. Most of the victims were over 65.
Caron said the city's Vision Zero strategy to reduce traffic deaths and injuries( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-will-vision-zero-pledge-bring-attitude-adjustment ), announced in March, should help to reduce pedestrian deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-five-pedestrian-deaths-in-four-months-in-montreal-is-an-outrage ). The vulnerability of elderly pedestrians is a major concern, he noted.
Another 87 pedestrians were seriously injured in 2018, up by 14 per cent from 78 in 2017. A total of 1,169 pedestrians suffered minor injuries, about the same as the previous year.
Three cyclists were killed in 2018, compared to four in 2017, while 20 were seriously injured, down from 32 in 2017, and 587 suffered minor injuries, down from 657.
There were 24 fatal traffic accidents, down from 26 in 2017, and 166 accidents with serious injuries, down from 178 in 2017.
Police chief Sylvain Caron speaks to reporters with Mayor Valérie Plante after being sworn in at Montreal city hall on Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018.
Montreal Police also dealt with a killer heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), the legalization of cannabis( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-marks-three-month-cannaversary-of-legal-weed ) and organizational restructuring to solve deep-seated problems within the force, Caron noted in a public presentation before Montreal's Public Security Committee.
During the 2018 heat wave, which killed 66 people according to Montreal's public health authority, about 690 police officers went door-to-door to visit more than 25 000 dwellings, specifically targeting seniors and other vulnerable residents.
The force, working with provincial and other local police departments, also cracked down on an illegal cannabis operations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-target-illegal-drug-network-with-raids-across-city-region ). In November, it carried out an operation involving 18 raids, in which nine people were charged and investigators seized large quantities of cannabis and other items valued at $1.8 million.
Montreal Police are also targeting illegal cannabis suppliers by setting up the ACCES Cannabis program.
Caron, who was appointed to the job last November( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sylvain-caron-chosen-as-new-montreal-police-chief ) to replace interim chief Martin Prud'homme, said efforts to restore public confidence in police and shore up morale in the 6,000-member force (including civilians) remain a top priority.

There were 32 homicides on the island of Montreal in 2018, a 33-per-cent increase from 2017, when there were 24. However, Caron said the increase should not cause undue concern, since the murder rate has dropped dramatically compared to 10 or 20 years ago.
Crimes against persons went up by nearly two per cent, while crimes against property dropped by nearly six per cent, the report said.

Fuel savings of STM's hybrid buses less than half what was promised, documents show

Full text: Montreal's transit agency has several written reports showing its diesel-electric hybrid buses will never come close to their original promise of a 30-per-cent savings in fuel.
According to two documents the Société de transport de Montréal provided to the Montreal Gazette through an access-to-information request, the actual savings is between 11 and 15 per cent.
One document showed a chart outlining the fuel consumption of all the buses in the STM's fleet, and showed the Series 7 hybrid buses consumed 47.5 litres to travel 100 kilometres, compared with the most efficient diesel buses that consumed 53.5 L/100 km - an 11.2-per-cent savings. Another chart showed the STM's hybrid buses save 15 per cent annually on fuel compared with its conventional diesel buses.
The agency is now coming under fire for not revealing the doubts about fuel efficiency to board members before they approved the purchase last year of830 new hybrid buses at the cost of nearly $1 billion,( http://www.stm.info/sites/default/files/media/CA/2018/06/ca06_art.03.2_stm-5520_rec.pdf ) to be delivered over five years starting in 2020. By the time the delivery is complete, hybrids will make up about half the city's fleet.
When the STM first presented its hybrid buses to the public in 2016, it vaunted an expected savings of fuel of 30 per cent, on average, and an equivalent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said the hybrids would save money over the long run, because although they are more expensive to purchase, they yield a significant savings on fuel. Those figures were based on a 2009 study( http://www.sto.ca/ligneverte/_download/depliant_phybride_2_1.pdf ) the STM conducted under the supervision of Transport Canada.
However, the new figures cast doubt on both the promised fuel economy and reduction of harmful emissions by the buses, because when asked, the STM was not able to produce any documents showing that the buses will result in significant savings in greenhouse gases.
Upon hearing the revelations, former STM board member Marvin Rotrand said he feels he was deceived when he voted to approve the major hybrid bus purchase.
"The bus is substantially more expensive to purchase, but we were told it is substantially less expensive to operate and over the 16-year life of the bus, it would come out to almost the same thing, but we would have the advantage of significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions and providing better customer comfort with air conditioning," said Rotrand, who was kicked off the board by Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante last year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-shakes-up-its-board-ejects-marvin-rotrand-and-welcomes-peter-trent ). "It now appears that was never the case, which begs the question why the STM pushed the board to purchase so many hybrid buses."
Rotrand said the board was motivated to move quickly with the purchase after Plante was elected because one of her signature campaign promises was to boost the STM's fleet.
"The STM was under a lot of pressure from city hall to quickly come up with a plan, come up with the specs, go to tender and purchase the buses," Rotrand said. "We were told as soon as the new board was constituted after the November (2017) election, (by STM chairperson Philippe Schnobb) that this was our No. 1 priority."
While the STM decided in 2016 that it would only purchase hybrid buses from that point on, Rotrand said the sheer size of the 2018 purchase warranted a proper analysis to assure the best technology was chosen. That analysis was not done, and Rotrand blames city hall for that lack of rigour.
Lionel Perez, the interim leader of the opposition Ensemble Montréal party at city hall, said he's alarmed that the STM's experts appear to have lied to board members in order to ram through the purchase.
"It's very disconcerting that the STM has been hiding this information from the public, from the board and from elected officials," Perez said. "If they fudged the numbers because of that political pressure, then someone has to be accountable."
Perez said the STM should suspend the purchase of hybrid buses until the issue can be better studied to see if other technologies of buses can provide similar environmental benefits at a lower price.
"We need to reassess the business case, and maybe we have to advance our objective to buy electric. We know that the life cycle of a hybrid bus is 16 years. That means we're going to be stuck with these hybrid buses with savings that aren't even there," Perez said.
The STM acknowledges its hybrid buses are not well suited to deal with the wide temperature variations that are typical of Montreal's climate.
Earlier this year, STM director general Luc Tremblay said in a radio interview that the STM's hybrid buses are "allergic to the cold."
In fact, a 2015 report from the STM's engineers state that in the winter, it takes a lot of energy to heat up the electric battery. As a result, the bus's electric battery never kicks in when the outside temperature is minus-10C or lower. The report added that the buses also don't perform well during a heat wave, because when their air conditioning units are running, the buses consume 15 per cent more fuel. In other words, when the buses have their air conditioning running on full power, they can consume more fuel than a conventional diesel bus with no air conditioning unit.
Nigel Clark, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at West Virginia University, who has studied hybrid bus technology, said the battery life appears to be their main disadvantage. He said batteries on hybrids tend to be replaced more often than on conventional diesel buses and at a very high cost that can wipe out any cost savings from fuel economy.
The STM's 2015 report recommends hybrid buses be configured to limit the number of times electric batteries take over for the diesel engines. The recommendation is for the engines to be automatically shut off only when the onboard electric batteries are charged at 100 per cent, when the bus is stationary, and when its doors are open.
Back in February, when doubts were first cast on the fuel efficiency of the STM's hybrid buses, Plante said she intended to go ahead with the purchase anyway.
"There is no way as a city we could have ordered 300 more buses that were not even a little bit electric, because of our targets for the environment," Plante said. "We found a good compromise where we know the technology."
STM vice-chairperson Craig Sauvé, the Plante administration's executive committee associate councillor in charge of mobility, said the order was based on recommendations from the foremost experts in the industry.
"The technology we're investing in is the best available technology( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-keeps-buying-hybrid-buses-even-though-the-technology-is-faulty )," Sauvé said. "The STM wouldn't recommend buses that are no good."

After enjoying Sunday's welcome sun (and getting my first slight burn), I dared to believe we'd finally turned a corner weather-wise and that warm temperatures were here to stay.
But when I stepped out of the house Monday morning, after shipping my eldest off to school in little more than a long-sleeve shirt, my bare legs were quickly covered with goosebumps and my youngest asked to be wrapped in her freshly laundered naptime blankie. Once again, I'd been overly optimistic about the temperature.
Sunday's summery-ness was little more than a tease, it turns out. As if reading my mind, Méteo Média on Monday released a long-range forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sorry-quebec-looks-like-april-showers-will-hang-around-till-july ) that puts a damper on hopes for imminent heat. June is going to be chilly, it predicts, and the hot weather is not expected until late July or early August. Maybe. If we're lucky.
On the bright side, we've been told we'll likely be spared the kind of oppressive heat wave that contributed to the deaths of 66 people in Montreal last summer. So that's positive.
But adding insult to injury, September, when the kids are back in school without air conditioning or proper ventilation, is expected to be hot again. Since my daughter experienced a suspected case of heat stroke on the second day of class last fall, that doesn't bode well.
If we're grumbling now, summer's late onset is going to make for some very unhappy campers in Montreal (both literally and figuratively speaking).
The one thing that makes winter bearable in this city - especially the long, frigid, brutal, icy one we all just lived through - is the prospect of those few months of summer warmth. When we're tip-toeing like penguins through the slippery trenches that pass for sidewalks in January and February, our resolve is derived from those distant recollections of ambling down wide boulevards lined with blooming flowers.
We don't even really have spring in this city. Typically we have the end of winter and then summer is suddenly upon us, as if the weather gods flipped a switch. And when the lights go on, Montreal comes alive. The greyness dissipates and the city is bathed in colour.
We overrun the parks or install ourselves on a terrasse. We have back-to-back festivals, from Jazz to Just For Laughs. We have street fairs on Mont-Royal Ave., St-Laurent Blvd., and Ste-Catherine St. We have the F1 and the Tour de l'île. We do everything we can to make the most of it, until the leaves turn and fall, and the first flakes tumble from the leaden clouds. But all of this is way more fun under blue skies.
Whether you revel in barbecue season, gardening season, backyard pool season, chalet season, camping season - all of these pastimes have been delayed as we wait for that switch to be definitely flipped. In the meantime, it's a rollercoaster of cool temperatures and abundant precipitation.
It seems unfair that both our summer long weekends are set to fall during this tepid period before the good weather is projected to descend. By Labour Day, most Montrealers are no longer in holiday mode. So we can only hope our overall prospects are brightened by a smattering of hot days falling fortuitously.
Those who have planned to take their vacation in early July might be regretting their decision to get summer off on the right foot, unless they're headed to distant destinations with better forecasts. And Montrealers who partake of the construction holiday at the end of July are surely crossing their fingers that the summer temperatures we're craving come sooner rather than later.
But to keep from wallowing too deeply in our own meteorological woes for the moment, some perspective is required.
The spring melt and heavy rains have left a mess to clean up from Pierrefonds to Rigaud to Ste-Marthe-sur-le-lac( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ). Summer's going to be more than just a downer for those cleaning up from the devastation.
And while Montreal's weather has been crummy, it hasn't beenas wild as elsewhere on the continent( https://globalnews.ca/news/5320770/tornado-flooding-heat-u-s-weather/?utm_medium=Facebook&utm_source=GlobalToronto&fbclid=IwAR2oICSn3qUso3t5xjNJZgtUbcxuEfr3vk29gXk0dJII_YjptViobet3hms ). Tornadoes have torn through Oklahoma and deadly heatwaves have descended on the American South. Wildfires are also burning in Alberta, alarmingly early given the blazes that blackened swaths of British Columbia during last year's scorching season.
Whether we chalk it up to climate change or nature's fury, shifting patterns and extreme events have become a fact of life.
For this summer, all we can hope is that the grim forecast is wrong.

Sorry, Quebec, looks like April showers will hang around till July

Full text: Summer will still begin on June 21. However, it doesn't look as if it will actually get started until sometime in July.
Météo Media's long-range summer forecast, made public Monday, calls for a chilly June with temperatures below normal and the prospect of actual summer weather not appearing until sometime between July and August and persisting until September.
Météo Média chief meteorologist André Monette said that once the heat does arrive( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), it will do so less brutally than in 2018, with fewer heat waves prostrating the province over the course of the summer.
The summer of 2018 saw a heat wave hit southern Quebec between June 29 and July 5. More than 260 local records for maximum temperatures were equalled or broken, and 66 deaths were linked to the intense heat.
Cooler temperatures will be the norm in eastern Quebec this summer due to a cold air mass parked in the middle of the continent. The cold air mass and a warm front along the eastern seaboard could lead to episodes of storms and rain in southern Quebec and Ontario.
"When you mix hot and cold in the weather, you get rain and storms, particularly in the summer, " said Monette. "In the St. Lawrence Valley, from Montreal up to Rimouski, through the Outaouais and Eastern Townships, there's a risk of higher than normal precipitation."
Monette said the rain would not be constant, but the amount dumped by storms could be high.

St-Laurent's biodiversity plan comes at crucial time

Full text: Birds, bees, foxes and wildflowers might not be the first thing you picture when thinking of the St-Laurent borough in Montreal's north end.
After all, 70 per cent of its territory is industrial and commercial. The lower quadrant stretches from the parking lots of the Ikea outlet to the runways of Trudeau airport. Bombardier, Siemens and Ericsson have sprawling campuses. Criss-crossed by wide boulevards, highways and rail yards, it will soon host a compost facility.
But the borough is taking steps to protect plant, animal and insect life in an environment that is 82 per cent concrete jungle. On Wednesday, it unveiled a master plan for biodiversity that will link up various natural spaces like the Bois de Saraguay, Bois de Liesse and Parc Marcel-Laurin woodlands along a hydro corridor to be planted with crucial vegetation.
Borough mayor Alan DeSousa says it's a first in Montreal and Quebec and will help preserve delicate ecosystems that have been fragmented by human development, combat the heat island effect and address the climate emergency.
"It's not just a re-greening process," he said. "If we want to protect these natural spaces, you have to find ways of linking them. You want to have bees, you want places for the birds, you want room for the foxes."
It will also include pathways and green space for humans.
The move comes amid grim news locally and globally. This month, a landmark United Nations report found economic development and resource exploitation could drive one million species to extinction, with devastating consequences.
An earlier study from the International Panel for Climate Change warned the worst effects of global warming will be felt sooner and at a lower temperature increase than previously believed. A federal government analysis revealed Canada is warming at twice the rate of other parts of the world and three times as fast in the Arctic.
The effects of climate change are hitting home, with this spring's terrible flooding (the second bout in three years) and last summer's killer heat wave. A report from Montreal public health authorities last week found 66 people died from the heat, 13 more than initially counted, and that the mortality rate was higher in neighbourhoods with the fewest trees and parks.
By now it should be readily apparent that protecting the environment is as much about preserving human health and building resilient cities that will withstand the challenges to come.
Cities are often the ones taking the lead. On Wednesday, Paris announced it will green a 100-acre area around the Eiffel Tower that is now mostly concrete. The United Kingdom is on a mission to plant one million trees by 2022, while London is creating a seven-mile wildflower corridor or "bug highway" through the city to support declining insect populations.
Although St-Laurent's announcement came on International Day for Biological Diversity, the project has been years in the making. It involved consultation with urban planners, landscape architects, biologists, environmentalists and residents. The plan was also the subject of an international design competition.
De Sousa said that through the process, he learned about foxes having their litters in dens in small stands of trees - one example of the life-sustaining role of woods, wetlands and streams even in St-Laurent's heavily industrialized technoparc. But even as we are learning about the crucial importance of nature, these ecosystems are fragile and under threat.
"The corridors we're trying to create are not just terrestrial, but aerial and hydraulic," he said. "Animals don't just walk, they fly and swim."
While the initial leg of the biodiversity belt will be on public land - a hydro right-of-way - De Sousa expects it will be expanded to private land as well. The master plan will guide urban planning and zoning decisions for decades to come.
At a cost of $500,000 so far and $1.8 million over the next three years, St-Laurent's biodiversity corridor comes as Montreal set aside a record $60 million in its 2019 budget to buy up remaining green spaces around the island to preserve them.
Still, Montreal's moves to fight climate change fell short of Luc Ferrandez's expectations. Out of frustration last week, he quit as head of parks on Mayor Valérie Plante's executive committee and as three-time Plateau borough mayor.
Even if they belonged to different parties, DeSousa said he respected Ferrandez's commitment to the environment and is sad to see him leave.
But DeSousa also hopes St-Laurent's biodiversity corridor will serve as "inspiration" for the city and region - the starting point of a larger initiative to reconnect important natural habitats throughout Montreal.

Full text: Susan Doherty and Caroline Evans were playmates as children. But while Doherty went on to enjoy a career and family and become an awardwinning writer, Evans joined society's most marginalized, living in squalor and locked in an endless struggle with her own mind.
For Evans (a pseudonym), the onset of schizophrenia led to decades of suffering and countless losses, including that of her marriage, custody of her two beloved children, and her independence.
In her new book, The Ghost Garden: Inside the Lives of Schizophrenia's Feared and Forgotten, Doherty retraces Evans's life up to the present to provide an unflinching and intimate portrayal of how the disorder, which affects about 1 per cent of the population, affects patients and their families. Woven throughout are anecdotes featuring other individuals with schizophrenia, whom Doherty has encountered as a long-time volunteer at a psychiatric hospital in Montreal.
"So many symptomatic people live far outside the boundary of acceptance," Doherty says, noting the disorder can make them hard to love.
But, as she explains to The Globe and Mail, a little kindness and understanding can go a long way.
What is the meaning of the "ghost garden"?
The title came to me from one of the men I volunteer with. He and I, for years, would meet for coffee every Thursday, and I would always call him the night before to confirm. One Wednesday night, he got on the phone and said he had spent the night with [actress] Jennifer Love Hewitt. I hadn't heard that kind of breathy enthusiasm from him in forever.
Of course, you and I would call what he said to me fictitious, but I said to him, "Tell me about it when I get there."
At the café, he put his elbows on the table, and I asked, "Where did you meet?" He said, "Suzy, I met her in the ghost garden.
That's where I meet all the souls of the people I love." It gave me chills. In that moment, I felt as though I'd been invited to the party - the party of understanding the roots of psychosis.
When Caroline says that [actor] Mel Gibson is the father of her children, what she's really saying is she's reminding me that at one time, she was beautiful and desirable. The ghost garden means we have to look beyond the delusion to identify the feelings behind the words.
So, how do you respond to the delusions?
Andrea, one of the women in the book, loves [singer] Mick Jagger.
But her negative delusion is that Mick Jagger came to her fourthfloor window and raped her. You and I know that he did not come through the window. But that feeling of being violated is her truth, and maybe something else happened earlier in the day that made her feel that way.
So I listen sympathetically and I would never, ever say, "Well, of course Mick Jagger didn't do that," or "Of course, Mel Gibson isn't your children's father," and "Of course, Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't your girlfriend." They're metaphors for feelings.
You talk in the book about having mixed feelings about the reliance on medication to treat schizophrenia.
Don't get me started. I'm not a medical professional, but here's what I can tell you from my personal view: Drugs are the most expedient way out of a crisis. Hallucinations can provoke panic and desperation. So, yes, with drugs, the psychotic experience is dulled, but so, too, are all emotions.
My problem is the overuse of medications. The fact that people are medicated for life. It's just not necessary, in my opinion, and the side effects are so problematic.
There's weight gain, lethargy, brain fog, tardive dyskinesia, which is a movement disorder that is not reversible. There's sexual dysfunction, constipation, diabetes.
And then there's this whole idea that the biological component of schizophrenia has not yet been pinned down. That means the medications are speculative.
One issue you raise, which could potentially save lives if more people knew about it, is how certain medications can cause individuals with schizophrenia to experience temperature dysregulation. What is it?
Carl was this truly lovely man who was in his early thirties. In his transition from hospital to group home, they bumped up his medication. What happened is Carl had heat stroke. He died on a hot summer day during a heat wave, and his core body temperature was between 42 and 43 C, but he didn't show any signs of distress. He wasn't sweating, he was in no discomfort. His thermoregulation was affected by his antipsychotic medication, and the real tragedy was that nobody around him knew about this problem, including myself. He'd be wearing this parka, and he'd ask me, "Suzy, do I look fat?" I thought he was wearing his coat because he was very self-conscious about his weight.
What are some ways our society can support families?
This is what Caroline said: "We need to make room for psychiatric survivors and their families so that we do not feel guilty about our lives." She said, "My entire life, I've been crucified for having the symptoms of mental illness."
The first step is to remove blame and the shame that family members feel, and especially if a family has chosen to let go. Some families do walk away, and we can't sit in judgement.
Have Caroline and her family members read this book?
Her sisters Rosalind and Peggy have, and they both called me sobbing. They have been unflinching in their desire to get the word out about what it's like. But there were other siblings who were afraid to have their shame reignited. And you know what?
It's dirty. There's blood and maggots and bed bugs. It's a dirty book.
What about Caroline?
Caroline doesn't have the capacity to read any more. But will I give her a copy of the book? Of course.
When Caroline said to me, "Is the book over?" I had to say to her, "No, it will never be over."
She couldn't bear for it to be over.
She crawled into the sewers of her mind for this book, so if the book is over, it means another loss for her.

N.D.G.'s newest resident is ruffling feathers - and not just its own. The wild turkey, which was first spotted in the neighbourhood over the weekend, quickly became a local sensation. Members of the extremely active NDG Living group on Facebook have taken to tracking the turkey's movements. Over the weekend, it was spotted around the intersection of Cavendish and de Maisonneuve Blvds.
CAQ government to ease restrictions on cannabis use in parks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/caq-government-poised-to-ease-restrictions-on-cannabis-use-in-parks-report )
In the interest of people who are "less wealthy and are renters," the Coalition Avenir Québec government is abandoning its hard line on marijuana smoking. Cannabis will no longer be forbidden in all public spaces, because municipalities will be able to permit it in their parks.
A cloud of smoke wafts over a crowd celebrating 4/20 at Mount Royal Park in Montreal, Wednesday, April 20, 2016.
Montreal better prepared for heat wave this year: health authorities( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave )
Montreal public health authorities say they're better prepared to handle a potentially deadly heat wave this summer than the one last year that was blamed for the deaths of 66 people, 13 more than the initial tally.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-death-toll-reaches-53-in-montreal-but-could-get-higher )"I think we've improved our interventions and our capacity to work together," Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of the public health department, told a news conference Wednesday following the release of an exhaustive report on last summer's heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/at-least-15-montrealers-transported-to-hospital-for-heat-related-injuries-urgences-sante ).
Measles outbreak declared by Montreal Public Health Department( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/first-measles-outbreak-declared-by-montreal-public-health-department )
The Montreal Public Health Department has declared the city's first community measles outbreak in years after a girl contracted the highly contagious disease from a member of her family and then transmitted it to a health worker. Authorities are now trying to track down as many as 400 people who might have come into contact with the infected health worker. The caregiver had visited six locations while contagious on the West Island, St-Laurent and Town of Mount-Royal from May 11 to 14.
Montreal health authorities are taking the extraordinary step of offering free measles vaccines until June 14 to anyone who has not received the standard two doses.
A new poll shows support for Bill 21 is built on anti-Islam sentiment( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-new-poll-shows-support-for-bill-21-is-built-on-anti-islam-sentiment )
Anti-Muslim sentiment appears to be the main motivation for those who support a ban on religious symbols, a new poll has found. The poll of 1,212 Quebecers, conducted May 3-7, found 63 per cent of Quebecers supported a ban on religious signs for judges, police officers and prison guards, and 59 per cent were in favour of a similar ban for teachers. This was true for all age categories except for 18-24 year olds, who were against such a ban.

Full text: Montreal public health authorities said they're better prepared to handle a potentially deadly heat wave this summer than the one last year that was blamed for the deaths of 66 people, 13 more than the initial tally.
"I think we've improved our interventions and our capacity to work together," Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of the public health department, said at a news conference Wednesday following the release of an exhaustive report on last summer's heat wave.
Drouin acknowledged that it will always "be difficult to have zero deaths associated with heat waves," but authorities have learned a great deal from last summer's experience. The biggest lesson learned is the need to set up a detailed registry that will show neighbourhoods and homes at the highest risk.
Contrary to some media accounts last summer that focused on heat-related deaths in hospitals and long-term care centres, the report found that 80 per cent of the victims died at home.
Researchers discovered that two-thirds of the deaths occurred in so-called heat islands - neighbourhoods with few trees to provide shade. For example, the heat-related mortality rate was 1.2 per 100,000 residents in leafy Notre-Dame-de-Grâce compared with 5.8 in the largely concreteand-brick environment of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
In the event of a heat wave this summer, the Montreal Fire Department and police officers would visit properties that the registry indicates are at high risk of being affected by heat waves, including rooming houses and private seniors' residences. The public health department also plans to work with community groups to reach out to people who live with mental illness.
"Low income and social isolation are also important risk factors during heat waves," Drouin said, adding that authorities can expect more heat waves as a result of climate change.
Last summer's heat wave lasted from June 30 to July 5 and at one point there were so many deaths that the city's morgue was at capacity. Still, the mortality rate overall was lower than another heat wave in 2010.
Of those who died during the 2018 heat wave, 72 per cent suffered from chronic diseases and 66 per cent were at least 65 years old. What's more, a disproportionately high number of those who died - 25 per cent - lived with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
The registry is expected to be completed by next month. It will combine data from the city's housing department with a heat map of Montreal Island as well as the input of the city's first responders.
Last summer, firefighters and police conducted 42,000 doorto-door visits. Louise Desrosiers, prevention section chief of the fire department, said firefighters can recommend during visits that the owners of rooming houses install air conditioning for their tenants.
The city of Montreal would also be ready to install temporary vegetation on some building walls and in other areas that are prone to high temperatures, said Coun. Laurence Lavigne-Lalonde, a member of the executive committee who is in charge of the environment portfolio.
"I think it's a global responsibility to take real and strong action regarding a city that is greener and better adapted to fight against heat waves," Lavigne-Lalonde added, noting that the city will spend $16 million this year to plant trees that will also absorb the heat.
The report warned that summer temperatures will rise by 2 to 3 C in Montreal and Laval in the coming decades.
During last summer's heat wave, the maximum temperature soared to 35.5 C. aderfel@postmedia.com twitter.com/Aaron_Derfel

Montreal adds more victims to death toll from 2018 heat wave

Full text: Health authorities in Montreal are adding 13 more people to the list of victims of last summer's heat wave, and are urging the city to do more to diminish heat across the densely populated urban neighbourhoods that are home to the most vulnerable.
At least 66 people died as a result of extreme heat on the Island of Montreal between June 30 and July 8, 2018, said Mylene Drouin, head of the city's public-health authority, on Wednesday. Authorities last year thought the number was 53. Ms. Drouin and medical researchers discovered 72 per cent of those who died suffered from a chronic illness and 66 per cent were over the age of 65.
The statistic that stands out, however, is that 25 per cent of heat-wave victims had schizophrenia, a severe form of psychosis.
Ms. Drouin said people with schizophrenia need to be better looked after by the health-care system, but "collaboration is not always easy."
The health authority recommended Montreal do more to identify vulnerable people. Ms.Drouin said her office is currently building a registry of those deemed most in need of attention during heat waves. The health authority also suggested some neighbourhoods immediately plant more trees and other greenery to combat the so-called heat island effect.
Urban heat islands are defined as the parts of a city made hotter by human activity, as compared to nearby rural areas. These neighbourhoods often have less vegetation as well as more buildings and other material that absorb heat.
The study indicated people living in heat islands were twice as likely to die from extreme heat than others in cooler parts of the city. Neighbourhoods in heat islands are also home to a higher percentage of people living in poverty. Councillor Laurence Lavigne-Lalonde told reporters the city is planning to increase the number of temporary urban green spaces to try and cool down the temperature in heat islands.
Street corners could have temporary urban gardens equipped with shelters from the sun, she said. These spaces would encourage citizens to interact more outside.
"It has an impact on reducing heat and it has a social impact," Ms. Lavigne-Lalonde said, alongside Ms. Drouin. "People go outside more and talk to their neighbours. In emergency situations it's important to know who your neighbours are."
Last summer's heat wave officially occurred between June 30 and July 5, when daytime temperatures were recorded between 31.9 C and 35.5 C. Ms. Drouin's office extended the period of analysis by three days because she said people suffered health effects related to the heat until then. Researchers analyzed all 328 deaths reported to the coroner that occurred on the Island of Montreal between June 30 and July 8, 2018.
They collected information from the medical records of the deceased as well as the circumstances of their death, such as the location, room temperature and the presence of air conditioning, to come up with results.

"I think we've improved our interventions and our capacity to work together," Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of the public health department, told a news conference Wednesday following the release of an exhaustive report on last summer's heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/at-least-15-montrealers-transported-to-hospital-for-heat-related-injuries-urgences-sante ).
Drouin acknowledged that it will always "be difficult to have zero deaths associated with heat waves," but authorities have learned a great deal from last summer's experience. The biggest lesson learned is the need to set up a detailed registry that will show neighbourhoods and homes that are at the highest risk.
Contrary to some news media accounts( https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/07/04/des-conditions-execrables-denoncees-a-sacre-coeur ) last summer that focused on heat-related deaths in hospitals and long-term care centres, the report( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/news/news/extreme-heat-66-deaths-in-montreal-in-2018/ ) found that 80 per cent of the victims died at home.
Researchers discovered that two-thirds of the deaths occurred in so-called heat islands - neighbourhoods with few trees to provide shade. For example, the heat-related mortality rate was 1.2 per 100,000 residents in leafy Notre-Dame-de-Grâce compared with 5.8 in the largely concrete-and-brick environment of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
In the event of a heat wave this summer, the Montreal Fire Department and police officers would visit properties that the registry indicates are at high risk of being affected by heat waves, including rooming houses and private seniors' residences. The public health department also plans to work with community groups to reach out to people who live with mental illness.
"Low income and social isolation are also important risk factors during heat waves," Drouin said, adding that authorities can expect more heat waves as a result of climate change.
Last summer's heat wave lasted from June 30 to July 5, and at one point there were so many deaths that the city's morgue was filled to capacity( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-morgue-filled-to-capacity-due-to-heat-related-deaths ). Still, the mortality rate overall was lower than a heat wave in 2010.
Of those who died during the 2018 heat wave, 72 per cent suffered from chronic diseases and 66 per cent were at least 65 years old. What's more, a disproportionately high number of those who died - 25 per cent - lived with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
The registry is expected to be completed by next month. It will combine data from the city's housing department with a heat map of Montreal Island as well as the input of the city's first responders.
Last summer, firefighters and police conducted 42,000 door-to-door visits. Louise Desrosiers, prevention section chief of the fire department, said firefighters can recommend during visits that the owners of rooming houses install air conditioning for their tenants.
The city of Montreal would also be ready to install temporary vegetation on some building walls and in other areas that are prone to high temperatures, said city councillor Laurence Lavigne-Lalonde, a member of the executive committee who is in charge of the environment portfolio.
"I think it's a global responsibility to take real and strong action regarding a city that is greener and better adapted to fight against heat waves," Lavigne-Lalonde added, noting that the city will spend $16 million this year to plant trees that will also absorb the heat.
The report warned that summer temperatures will rise by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius in Montreal and Laval in the coming decades. During last summer's heat wave, the maximum temperature soared to 35.5 degrees.

Full text: A total of 66 people died from extreme heat during last summer's heat wave, 13 more than the initial tally( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-death-toll-reaches-53-in-montreal-but-could-get-higher ), the Montreal Public Department reported Wednesday.

During last summer's heat wave, the Montreal Fire Department and police conducted 42,000 door-to-door visits, and authorities say the new registry will allow them to better target at-risk residences to reduce the number of heat-related deaths.
In the long term, the city of Montreal intends to plant more trees on the island to absorb the summer heat.
More to come.

The Hot And Cold of climate change's effects on wine; While some growing regions experience short-term benefits, most of news is bad

Full text: I was asked by a reader how climate change will affect the future of wine. Rather than just give my impressions, I went back to a recording I have of the Tasting Climate Change conference that was held here in Montreal back in October 2017.
Organized by Montreal sommelier Michelle Bouffard, the panel of experts presented a fascinating overview of the possible ramifications of our planet's warming climate. A second edition will be held here on Nov. 12, 2019.
What I took out of the conference is that there is some good, but mostly bad news. I, of course, use "good" with the understanding that the wide-scale implications of climate change will be catastrophic for our planet. However, at least in the short term, many of the coolest growing regions have benefitted from warmer temperatures.
Gregory Jones, a specialist in climate change and a vineyard owner in Oregon, said, "lots of wine is being produced at latitudes that 30 years ago we would never have dreamed."
We can see this all over the world, even here in Quebec where our local wine industry is not only thriving, but we are seeing a movement away from cold-climate hybrid grapes to classic vinifera varieties like chardonnay and the pinot family.
Jamie Goode, also a scientist and wine critic, mentioned places like Germany and his native England that have seen a marked increase in the quality of wines.
Jones has spent 30 years mapping average temperatures in the world's regions, which he refers to as "climate envelopes." Certain grapes, such as pinot noir, have a narrow climate niche that he said was an average temperature between 14-16 C.
While growing seasons that go above this envelope can produce good vintages, Jones believes pinot's tolerance for producing quality wine is limited to a two-degree rise in average temperatures.
Jones has more than 120 years of climate data on Oregon and 15 of the last 20 have been the warmest. If it continues, Oregon winemakers might need to change grape varieties.
Other grapes have a wider envelope but a warming climate can bring a host of other problems. Australia and South Africa are facing water shortages and heat waves, like Australia's record heat wave in January where temperatures didn't drop below 40 C for a week. Aside from an imbalanced ripening, wine cultivation puts even more stress onto water supply.
As cooler climate regions warm, they can be touched by new insects and diseases that previously couldn't survive the winters. Also, warmer winters, especially in warmer growing areas, mean the vines do not reach full dormancy, which causes stress and can affect the following year's harvest.
While we all appreciate an early spring, it can be dangerous for wine grapes. In many areas such as Burgundy and the Loire Valley, warm soil temperatures too early in the season have caused the vines to start their growing season earlier. So-called "global warming" pertains to average temperatures and that does not preclude late frosts, which have ravaged some areas over the past few years.
In short, there is a lot to worry about if you are a wine lover. Warmer growing areas are at risk of becoming too warm to produce quality wines. Cooler areas are at risk of more hail and disease. Those in the middle, well, they might have to replant their grape varieties as they transition from cool to a warm climate. gazettewine@gmail.com T\twitter.com/BillZacharkiw Facebook.com/billzacharkiwine

Full text: Potholes continue to be the bane of Montreal drivers, making for an uncomfortable ride as they do expensive damage to cars. Municipal authorities blame them on our freeze-and-thaw weather cycles; citizens tend to suspect that the city's road construction practices are at least partly responsible.
As demonstrated by this photo from our archives - it is labelled Cedar Ave. and dated Feb. 20, 1954 - the problem has a long history.
As the puddles suggest, the city was experiencing an unseasonably warm spell, what we referred to in a report published that day as a "heat wave." (According to the Environment Canada website, the high Feb. 20, as recorded at McGill University, was 6.7 degrees C.) It was a Saturday. There had been a blizzard earlier in the week, and "1,200 men and more than 20 snow blowers" were still busy clearing snow and slush from major thoroughfares, we reported.
While what appear to be muddy snowbanks are visible at the side of the road, the street itself is littered not by snow, but by crumbling pavement amid the craters.
Two days later, after considerable rain on the Sunday, we wrote: "Four days of mild weather have Montreal streets running with water, and under the surface the pavement is breaking up in many sections." Cars were described as lurching through potholes while "broken asphalt litters the street like pebbles on a beach after a storm." That almost sounds poetic, but no doubt most Montrealers would have used more prosaic language to describe the condition of the streets, as indeed they often do now.

Full text: MI'KMAQ DIRECTOR BARNABY HOPES TO CREATE 'WATERSHED ZOMBIE FILM'
"I've always operated on the idea that you need to wrap hard-toswallow concepts in familiar tropes," said Jeff Barnaby.
The Montreal writer-director packed a lot into his last movie, the 2013 coming-of-age tale Rhymes for Young Ghouls. Set up as a heist film, starring then-newcomer Kawennáhere Devery Jacobs as a young Mi'kmaq girl out for revenge, Barnaby's debut feature commented on the residential school system, as well as the effects of incarceration, drug use and the broken family unit on Indigenous communities.
Barnaby chose the zombie genre as a framework for his second feature, Blood Quantum, because in his words, "Who doesn't love zombie films?" Viewers can expect a "pretty hardcore zombie movie that deals with a lot of issues around miscegenation and multiculturalism," Barnaby said. "I wanted to tell a story about colonialism without actually showing individuals in fox skin and white people coming in on boats, so I came up with the concept of Natives being immune to a zombie plague."
A Mi'kmaq reserve becomes an asylum against the zombie threat in Blood Quantum, leading to a quandary as Indigenous inhabitants argue about whether to protect their non-Indigenous guests or let them fend for themselves.
At the centre of the drama are a young white woman (Degrassi's Olivia Scriven), who is pregnant, and her Indigenous boyfriend (Forrest Goodluck, seen in The Revenant).
Barnaby shot the film on a shoestring budget, due to funding challenges.
He hopes to create "a watershed zombie film, or at least open up the idea that Native people, people of colour and minorities in general can start tackling these old genres and bring a fresh perspective of our culture."
Montreal production company Prospector Films is eyeing a fall release.

PITRE IS LITTLE CHARMING WITH A LOT OF TALENT
At 25, Westmount-raised Laurent Pitre still has the look of youthful innocence that helps him get away with playing Prince Charming's lesser-known little brother in his stage show Little Charming and its sequel Mid Knight.
But he can also do hardbitten, as he demonstrated in another self-penned show, A Perfect Picture, in which he played the war photographer who took the infamous snap of a vulture and a dying Sudanese child.
Eye-catching roles like these (his recent turns in Urban Tales at Centaur and Oren Safdie's Gratitude at MainLine were also real treats) have made a breakthrough into the mainstream an inevitability.
"I seem to have been 'emerging'for a long time," Pitre said. "2019 looks like the first time I'll be really hitting it off on the professional stage."
Pitre was talking about his role in The Shoplifters, a comedy crime caper written by Morris Panych, who will also be directing when it plays at Centaur in March.
Yet francophone audiences have already had a glimpse of Pitre in a major professional role, in Annie Baker's Les flâneurs célestes (The Aliens), which played at Théâtre Prospero in 2014.
"I was very blessed to have come straight out of theatre school (at Dawson) and got a role in that production," Pitre said.
"It went on to play sold-out houses at La Licorne. I got my first agent out of that."
Pitre is returning to francophone theatre in February, when he will play in a new piece called Hâgar et la source at Agora de la danse's space in the Wilder Building. Meanwhile, he's also been working on a screenplay.
"Basically, the protagonist is a guy who dresses as a traffic cone and fights crime," he explained. "He's called Cone Man. It's a very Montreal story."

LA VOIX SEMIFINALIST FILS-AIMÉ REFUSES TO BE BOXED IN
Dominique Fils-Aimé may not be a household name, but she garnered plenty of buzz with the release of her second album, Nameless, last February. And it looks like the heat around this Montreal artist is set to be upped a few notches with the launch of Stay Tuned! on Feb. 22.
Nameless and Stay Tuned! are the first two instalments in a trilogy of albums focused on the history of women, music and African-Americans over the past two centuries. Nameless was inspired by the Maya Angelou poem Still I Rise and was steeped in the blues songs of the first half of the 20th century. The new album is inspired by the arrival of jazz in the U.S., though both collections mix soul, jazz and blues, all built around Fils-Aimé's evocative voice.
"People have called it neo-soul, blues tinted with R&B," she said. "People put so many labels, and I love that, because we're at a point where there are no longer any boxes. Things can mix more than ever. It's rare that we have someone who is purely in one single genre."
Growing up in a family headed by Haitian parents, Fils-Aimé mostly looked to black American music for inspiration. But she only started singing seriously at 17. She went to the semifinals in the TVA hit La Voix four years ago, but says she feels her real musical self is reflected much more on her albums than on La Voix, and now "music is the real healer" for her.
Fils-Aimé played two dates at the small M2 room in MTelus during the jazz festival last summer, and is set to play L'Astral as part of Montréal en lumière on March 1.

ESPLANADE'S TRACK RECORD MAKES NICOL A GOOD BET
In the literary world, you don't always see the next thing coming. Even if you're among the select circle given to combing publishers'catalogues and quarterly magazines, predicting who might rise from the vast pool of hopefuls can feel like a fool's errand. So it's nice to have a marker or two to help make it all a little less random. Véhicule Press's Esplanade Fiction imprint, currently under the stewardship of Dimitri Nasrallah, is one such standard-bearer.
As in the old days when you'd buy a record on faith if it bore the Rough Trade or Factory seal, the Esplanade brand has earned readers' loyalty. Among the alumni are Anita Anand, Guillaume Morissette, Geneviève Pettersen, Josip Novakovich and, indeed, Nasrallah himself. This spring their ranks will be joined by 26-year-old Montrealer Mikella Nicol, who makes her English-language debut with Aphelia, a translation of her second novel, 2017's Aphélie.
The basic setup - a 20-something graveyard-shift worker at a call centre during a summer heat wave is on the rebound from a volatile relationship - already includes at least four elements rife with dramatic portent. The catalogue description includes words like "brooding," "millennial" and "ennui," so as a novel of urban youth, this one sounds both timeless and bang up to date.
Its April publication is part of a bigger and heartening development whereby French-language causes célèbres are being rendered in English in less time than we'd been used to. In this case, that assignment went to fiction writer, poet and Montreal Review of Books editor Lesley Trites, indicative of another trend that sees name writers of both languages translating their fellow writers' work.

WHALEN'S DARK HUMOUR IS SERVED UP WITH A SMILE It's been quite the ride for standup Shirley Whalen, but she has hit her stride in Montreal.
Whalen was born in Fort McMurray, Alta., and was based in Toronto for a spell, but made her mark on the Montreal alt-comedy scene soon after moving to these parts. Recently, she did a CBC-TV taping at the Winnipeg Comedy Festival and was the only Montreal-based wit to make it to the semifinals of the 2018 Canadian SiriusXM Top Comic challenge.
Whalen, 29, admits she didn't leave Toronto to advance her comedy career here: "Things were going well for me. No, I came for a boy I love." That boyman would be comic Troy Stark.
Whalen is nothing if not humble. "The comedy scene is smaller here than in Toronto, so it's easier to stand out, although audiences here seem to appreciate the arts much more and love to laugh. But the real plus is that my lifestyle outside comedy is just so much better here."
Funny also helps. Ever self-deprecating, Whalen - whose mom is renowned opera soprano Laura Whalen, but who has no such singing ability herself - loves "to address subjects women are usually uncomfortable to talk about but subjects tailored to women."
She plays heavily on her slight body frame: "I like to say there's less of me to love. But skinny has become almost a derogatory word used against me. Girls come up to me all the time and say they hate me for being so skinny. Still, I would probably be thrown into jail for ever telling a girl that I hated her because she was too fat." Pause. "But at least I would be able to slip through the prison bars and escape, because I am so skinny."
What makes Whalen's comedy so appealing is that she always delivers her brand of darkish humour with a disarming smile. "A friend of mine describes it as twisted optimism."

Full text: Mi'kmaq director Barnaby hopes to create 'watershed zombie film'
"I've always operated on the idea that you need to wrap hard-to-swallow concepts in familiar tropes," said Jeff Barnaby.
The Montreal writer-director packed a lot into his last movie, the 2013 coming-of-age tale Rhymes for Young Ghouls. Set up as a heist film, starring then-newcomer Kawennáhere Devery Jacobs as a young Mi'kmaq girl out for revenge, Barnaby's debut feature commented on the residential school system, as well as the effects of incarceration, drug use and the broken family unit on Indigenous communities.

Full text: Sometimes a photographer's assignment is very specific, such as "construction of the Champlain Bridge." Other times, it's incredibly vague: "There is freezing rain. Tell us a story." Somewhere in the middle, experience and happenstance collide in the perfect shot.
Here are our photographers' favourite shots of 2018.
Pierre Obendrauf: 'And then they kissed'
May 6, 2018.
I was walking around downtown looking for pictures between two assignments - Place des Festivals always brings out people. I saw Mikael Gervais and Laurence Crete on the other side of the fountain, enjoying a romantic weekend away from their hometown, Gatineau. I took pictures of them talking, looking at maps, drinking water - and then they kissed.
March 15, 2018.
More than 200 dogs were rescued from a dog-meat farm in South Korea. They were going crazy because of all the media present, so to try to get a sense of what they might be feeling in their new environment, I focused on one: Sunny, the Korean jindo, who was being held by Humane Society International's Chantal Ducharme. I got on my stomach and I could sense he could smell my three cats on my clothes. So then I played with his inquisitiveness and was lucky enough to get it to work.
Jan. 23, 2018.
Freezing rain hit the city overnight and we needed something early for the web. Marie-Philippe Bois was already well underway de-icing her vehicle and she was gracious enough to let me get inside her car to get this picture.
John Mahoney: When it all comes together
Aug. 29, 2018.
It was a double bill: Deep Purple and Judas Priest at the Bell Centre, and I could take pictures during the first three songs of each band's performance. Usually when I shoot a concert, I make sure to get a good selection of pictures of the lead singer and only then do I shoot the supporting musicians. Just when I started looking for pictures of guitarist Richie Faulkner, they unleashed the smoke machine - and with some backlight on Faulkner's sunglasses, the picture came together.
July 5, 2018.
I was assigned to photograph Olivia Lavallee at her home on the South Shore for a sports column by Stu Cowan about her swimming in the World Down Syndrome Championship in Nova Scotia. I hoped I'd be able to get a photo of her in a pool, so I made sure my GoPro camera had a full charge. But the only place to get her in water was in the family's above-ground pool in their backyard. I had Olivia swim back and forth across the round pool, sticking the underwater camera in the water and firing as many frames as I could without being able to see exactly what the camera was capturing. At one point, Olivia stopped to reposition her swim goggles and that made the best frame.
May 8, 2018
When a couple of busloads of senior citizens arrived at the Russian consul general's residence for a ceremony commemorating the end of the Second World War, I was immediately drawn to these two gentlemen wearing their veterans' uniforms and chests-full of medals. Before the ceremony, they engaged in a lively conversation and I had my photo. Only afterward did I learn that David Ficherman, on the left, was 103 years old, and his friend Shulin Grinberg was 96.
Dave Sidaway: Now that's a lot of construction
April 6, 2018.
Transport Quebec crews start to assemble huge scaffolding on the east side of the St-Jacques St. overpass. Three of my favourite photos this year are of major construction sites - Montreal hasn't seen this much major construction at the same time in decades.
Oct. 25, 2018.
The main structure of the new Champlain Bridge should be completed by Dec. 21, but it won't be open to traffic until the summer of 2019.
May 8, 2018.
The Société de transport de Montréal is building an underground garage at the Côte-Vertu station on the métro's Orange Line. It's expected to be finished in 2021 at a cost of $330 million.
Allen McInnis: Heat waves and ice
July 27, 2018.
I generally do not like shooting concerts. Photographers are often micro-managed by the PR teams working for the bands, and photo opportunities can be limited. AFI was high energy on stage - when I saw Hunter Burgan climb on a speaker, I didn't take my eyes off him. When he leaped off, I knew I had at least one good one.
July 23, 2018.
Montreal was in the middle of a heat wave. While walking along the Lachine Canal, I saw the misting station at Atwater Market and this young girl, Anokhi, who was enjoying the mist as her father, Arijit Nandi, lifted her to the peak of the stream.
Feb. 10, 2018.
Nashville Predators defenceman P.K. Subban has words with Montreal Canadiens right wing Brendan Gallagher after being driven into the boards by Gallagher during NHL action in Montreal. I wasn't on the schedule to shoot hockey that night, but really wanted to be there for the return of P.K. Shooting through a small hole in the glass, where only a portion of the rink is viewable, I was lucky that this transpired right in front of my window to the rink.

July 5, 2018.
I was assigned to photograph Olivia Lavallee at her home on the South Shore for a sports column by Stu Cowan about her swimming in the World Down Syndrome Championship in Nova Scotia. I hoped I'd be able to get a photo of her in a pool, so I made sure my GoPro camera had a full charge. But the only place to get her in water was in the family's above-ground pool in their backyard. I had Olivia swim back and forth across the round pool, sticking the underwater camera in the water and firing as many frames as I could without being able to see exactly what the camera was capturing. At one point, Olivia stopped to reposition her swim goggles and that made the best frame.
May 8, 2018
When a couple of busloads of senior citizens arrived at the Russian consul general's residence for a ceremony commemorating the end of the Second World War, I was immediately drawn to these two gentlemen wearing their veterans' uniforms and chests-full of medals. Before the ceremony, they engaged in a lively conversation and I had my photo. Only afterward did I learn that David Ficherman, on the left, was 103 years old, and his friend Shulin Grinberg was 96.
Dave Sidaway: Now that's a lot of construction
April 6, 2018.
Transport Quebec crews start to assemble huge scaffolding on the east side of the St-Jacques St. overpass. Three of my favourite photos this year are of major construction sites - Montreal hasn't seen this much major construction at the same time in decades.
Oct. 25, 2018.
The main structure of the new Champlain Bridge should be completed by Dec. 21, but it won't be open to traffic until the summer of 2019.
May 8, 2018.
The Société de transport de Montréal is building an underground garage at the Côte-Vertu station on the métro's Orange Line. It's expected to be finished in 2021 at a cost of $330 million.
Allen McInnis: Heat waves and ice
July 27, 2018.
I generally do not like shooting concerts. Photographers are often micro-managed by the PR teams working for the bands, and photo opportunities can be limited. AFI was high energy on stage - when I saw Hunter Burgan climb on a speaker, I didn't take my eyes off him. When he leaped off, I knew I had at least one good one.
July 23, 2018.
Montreal was in the middle of a heat wave. While walking along the Lachine Canal, I saw the misting station at Atwater Market and this young girl, Anokhi, who was enjoying the mist as her father, Arijit Nandi, lifted her to the peak of the stream.
Feb. 10, 2018.
Nashville Predators defenceman P.K. Subban has words with Montreal Canadiens right wing Brendan Gallagher after being driven into the boards by Gallagher during NHL action in Montreal. I wasn't on the schedule to shoot hockey that night, but really wanted to be there for the return of P.K. Shooting through a small hole in the glass, where only a portion of the rink is viewable, I was lucky that this transpired right in front of my window to the rink.

Full text: Sometimes a photographer's assignment is very specific, such as "construction of the Champlain Bridge." Other times, it's incredibly vague: "There is freezing rain. Tell us a story." Somewhere in the middle, experience and happenstance collide in the perfect shot.
Here are our photographers' favourite shots of 2018.
Pierre Obendrauf: 'And then they kissed'
May 6, 2018.
I was walking around downtown looking for pictures between two assignments - Place des Festivals always brings out people. I saw Mikael Gervais and Laurence Crete on the other side of the fountain, enjoying a romantic weekend away from their hometown, Gatineau. I took pictures of them talking, looking at maps, drinking water - and then they kissed.
March 15, 2018.
More than 200 dogs were rescued from a dog-meat farm in South Korea. They were going crazy because of all the media present, so to try to get a sense of what they might be feeling in their new environment, I focused on one: Sunny, the Korean jindo, who was being held by Humane Society International's Chantal Ducharme. I got on my stomach and I could sense he could smell my three cats on my clothes. So then I played with his inquisitiveness and was lucky enough to get it to work.
Jan. 23, 2018.
Freezing rain hit the city overnight and we needed something early for the web. Marie-Philippe Bois was already well underway de-icing her vehicle and she was gracious enough to let me get inside her car to get this picture.
John Mahoney: When it all comes together
Aug. 29, 2018.
It was a double bill: Deep Purple and Judas Priest at the Bell Centre, and I could take pictures during the first three songs of each band's performance. Usually when I shoot a concert, I make sure to get a good selection of pictures of the lead singer and only then do I shoot the supporting musicians. Just when I started looking for pictures of guitarist Richie Faulkner, they unleashed the smoke machine - and with some backlight on Faulkner's sunglasses, the picture came together.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh campaigns in Montreal ahead of byelection

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-campaigns-montreal-ahead/docview/2159921781/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh ventured into his predecessor's former territory on Saturday as he campaigned in Montreal's Outremont riding ahead of several federal byelections expected to take place early next year.
Singh shook hands and chatted in French as he visited local businesses alongside NDP candidate Julia Sanchez.
The riding was vacated earlier this year by former NDP Leader Tom Mulcair,( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-ex-ndp-leader-tom-mulcair-to-join-cjad-as-new-political-analyst ) whose 2007 byelection victory represented a breakthrough for the NDP in Quebec.
Mulcair went on to win the riding three more times before leaving politics to take a teaching job.
Despite the NDP's past success in Outremont, the party could be facing a challenge once the byelection is called.
Its results in recent byelections have been disappointing and Sanchez has never run in an election before.
The NDP finished a distant third in a byelection in Chicoutimi-Le Fjord in June, taking only 8.7 per cent of the vote in a riding the NDP won in 2011.
The previous October, the NDP finished a distant fourth in a byelection in Lac-St-Jean. Both of those races were won by the Conservatives.
Despite those losses, the NDP leader expressed confidence on Saturday.
"You can't compare byelection results to general election results," Singh said. "I don't think that's a fair comparison."
Singh is counting on his environmental platform, including promises of green energy jobs and investments, to win over Quebecers.
"Between the heat wave in Quebec that saw significant lives lost, floods, and extreme weather across Canada, more and more people are really concerned about what we're doing to fight climate change," he said.
Singh would not offer a prediction on the Outremont byelection, but acknowledged the riding held symbolic importance as the birthplace of the so-called orange wave that propelled the party to its best-ever showing in the province in 2011.
But while he's made several trips there, not everyone in Outremont appeared to recognize the NDP leader as he made stops at a pastry shop and café on Saturday.
While he attracted curiosity, several people asked who he was, and one wondered if he was Canada's defence minister.
However, Singh appeared well received as he introduced himself to restaurant patrons, chatting in French as he asked them about their political priorities.
At his side was Sanchez, a political newcomer who has spent the last seven years in Ottawa as CEO of the Canadian Council of International Co-operation.
She said she relished the challenge of moving back to Montreal and taking on a high-profile assignment in her first political battle.
"I've been knocking on doors since August, and people are really proud of the work the NDP and Thomas Mulcair and the team did ... and I think they want continuity," she said.
Sanchez will face Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer who finished second to Mulcair in the last election, while the Conservatives have announced Jasmine Louras as their candidate.
Singh also appeared confident of winning his own battle for a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South once the next round of byelections is called.
He said he has moved to the riding and is seeing "a lot of support" from people on the ground as he campaigns on issues including the environment and the need for affordable housing.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce the date for byelections for the Burnaby South, Outremont and York-Simcoe, Ont., ridings early in the new year.

Cannabis aside, smoke was also one of the top weather stories of 2018

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/cannabis-aside-smoke-was-also-one-top-weather/docview/2159289092/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: David Phillips isn't pulling any punches: "The weather's gotten weird and wild and wacky and variable. The climate has changed."
The senior climate scientist for Environment Canada revealed his top 10 weather stories for 2018, and Quebec was affected by more than half of them, from a cruel winter to windstorms to a deadly heat wave to tornadoes to a spring and fall that were missing in action.
"It was almost a smorgasbord of everything that could go wrong," Phillips said. "I don't think there was anything missing."
He named smoke as Canada's top weather story this year. A cold spring delayed the start of fire season. But once it warmed up, it didn't take long for sparks to strike( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/forest-fires-a-primer-on-what-not-to-do-on-your-vacation ).
There were more than 250,000 lightning strikes in southern British Columbia between April and August. On one day alone there were 20,000. The resulting huge wildfires thickened skies from coast to coast with smoke that could be detected as far away as Europe.
While factors including forestry practices and urban spread influence the effects of wildfires, Phillips said it comes down to weather.
"This is too dry, too hot, for too long."
Speaking of hot, Canada took full part in a global heat wave that involved four continents. It was Phillips's No. 2 story.
"It's a big country, Canada, and you don't often see people experiencing the same weather from Vancouver Island to Bonavista (in Newfoundland), but this year we saw that with record temperatures."
In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ). July 1 in Ottawa set records for heat and humidity and the conditions cut Canada Day attendance to 6,000 from an expected 20,000. Moose Jaw, Sask., reached 42.3 C one day in August.
But it wasn't all smoke and heat. Phillips said the No. 3 story was the disappearance of spring and fall, "the almost non-existence of the transition seasons."
A long, cold spring kept frost in the ground as deep as two metres in some places, which meant a late start to the crop year for farmers. Then, with the fields ready in August and a nice start to the harvest, unprecedented snow crushed hopes. More than $4 billion worth of crop was flattened under record snowfall.
Where else did Quebec measure up? It's No. 4 on the list with a devastating May windstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/strong-winds-could-cause-damage-friday-environment-canada-warns ) that saw hundreds of thousands of people left without power here and in Ontario. Winds gusted up to 94 kilometres per hour and knocked down trees and Hydro poles.
At No. 5, a twisters ripped through the Gatineau and Ottawa regions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-homes-damaged-in-dunrobin-possible-tornado/wcm/2678a04d-42c2-4405-89d2-6612b0477aec ), flattening homes and causing millions of dollars of damage.
"You could hear things ripping. The wind was just amazingly strong," said a Gatineau resident( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evacuations-in-gatineau-following-severe-weather-and-tornado-watch ). "It was intimidating and scary."
We also made the list at Nos. 9 and 10 - cold, long winter, and the cruellest April - the cruellest( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/fish-and-birds-die-in-magog-pet-shop-because-of-low-temperatures ) we've seen in 71 years.
Like most climatologists, Phillips is circumspect about blaming any one weather event on climate change, but he did say that despite a long, colder-than-normal winter, Canada was again slightly warmer than usual - the 22nd year in a row of above-normal temperatures.
"Scientists have kind of shown the fact that these things are directly related to human activity," he said.
Phillips has been drawing up Top 10 weather lists for 23 years. Some years, he confesses, there wasn't much to talk about.
"There weren't a lot of things happening back then. Summers were hot, winters were cold. In 23 years, it has changed," he said.
A man and woman embrace as they survey the damage to a home in Gatineau Sept. 23, 2018. Houses and Apartment buildings had roofs torn off and windows blown out and automobiles were damaged after a tornado caused extensive damage.
The top 10 weather events for 2018
1. Smoky skies: Driven by hot, dry conditions, the number of fires was higher than last year and the area burned was double the 25-year averages. Smoke from wildfires in British Columbia and down the Pacific Coast to California darkened skies and soured air for more than 10 million Canadians.
2. Canada and the global heat wave: It was hot from coast to coast. Canada Day in Ottawa was the second-warmest in more than 130 years. Three Saskatchewan cities broke all-time records with temperatures into the 40s C. In Quebec, 93 people died from heat-related causes.
3. Spring and fall disappear: The coldest April on record slammed into the hottest-ever May. A few months later, the Prairie harvest ground to a halt when 30 centimetres of snow fell in some areas in September and October.
4. Billion-dollar windstorm: Hundreds of thousands in Quebec and Ontario were left without power in May as 120-km/h winds snapped power poles, damaged homes and hurled tree branches into vehicles like armour-piercing spears. The clean-up tab is estimated at more than $1 billion.
5. Ottawa tornadoes: A series of tornadoes tore up the boundary region between Ontario and Quebec on Sept. 21. One of them was the most powerful recorded anywhere in North America last summer. Insurance costs are expected to be about $307 million.
6. British Columbia floods: A snowpack nearly twice the norm, a wet spring and high late-spring temperatures produced flooding in several river valleys in southern B.C. Almost 5,000 people were forced from their homes by river levels not seen in 50 years.
7. Fast flooding in New Brunswick: Floods on the Saint John River are an old story, but even old-timers were surprised by the speed of the water in 2018. Deep snow, heavy rains and sudden heat created the largest, most damaging flood in modern New Brunswick history down river of Fredericton in April and May. The Reversing Falls stopped reversing.
8. Toronto's tiny, perfect storm: On Aug. 7, a compact storm dumped 58 millimetres of rain downtown and 72 millimetres on Toronto Island, while the suburbs and the airport got almost nothing. Two men nearly drowned in an underground parking elevator and Blue Jays baseball fans got rained on despite the closed roof at Rogers Centre.
9. Cold start, long winter: Six months of it. Albertans faced wind-chill cold of -45 C on New Year's Eve. In early January, Toronto was colder than Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T.
10. The cruellest month: Nationally, it was the coldest April in 16 years and in 71 years if you lived through it in Ontario and Quebec. In those provinces the misery was compounded with up to 12 centimetres of freezing rain, snow and ice pellets. Windows on Parliament Hill were smashed. The CN Tower was closed after Rogers Centre was bombed by ice falling from the tower.

Montreal, environmental groups will collaborate to reach climate goals

Full text: Montreal is partnering with three environmental organizations to achieve its climate goals, Mayor Valérie Plante announced Monday.
Flanked by representatives of the David Suzuki Foundation, C40 and the Trottier family foundation, Plante signed a two-year agreement to work together to achieve the goal of making the city carbon neutral by 2050( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/it-looks-like-greenhouse-gas-reduction-targets-are-out-of-quebecs-reach ).
The partnership will make it possible to pool resources, knowledge and know-how, she said.
The foundations will contribute at least $250,00 to the city's efforts to reduce carbon emissions over the next two years, with the possibility of spending up to $400,000, depending on how needs evolve, she said.
"Together, we want to make Montreal a true leader in the struggle against climate change, and bring concrete solutions to achieve change and succeed in the ecological transition," she said.
David Miller, regional director for North America of the C40 Cities Leadership Group, called the partnership unique and said it would help Montreal achieve its 2050 target.
"This partnership I hope will be a model to other cities globally," he said.
Karel Mayrand, director of the David Suzuki Foundation for eastern Canada, said the 90 deaths during last summer's heat wave demonstrated the urgency of acting to limit planetary warming to within 1.5 degrees.
"We're happy to unite behind this leadership to make the metropolis a model for ecological transition and resilience," he said.

Full text: Canadiens Game Day is a new feature this season in which we will follow the Habs during every home game from the morning skate in Brossard through the post-game interviews at the Bell Centre, updating throughout the day with all the news, quotes, notes and opinion you're looking for:
Former Canadien Alexander Radulov didn't want to talk to the media who showed up at the Bell Centre for the Dallas Stars' morning skate on Tuesday, walking past them and simply saying: "No."
He still didn't want to talk to the Montreal media after the Stars' 4-1 win over the Canadiens Tuesday night in which he scored the final goal into an empty net.
A Stars media-relations person said Radulov was unavailable because he was undergoing post-game treatment. When J.F. Chaumont of the Journal de Montréal spotted Radulov in the treatment room beside the Stars locker room he asked the Russian if he could come out to talk.
"Talk to Bergy," Radulov told Chaumont.
After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas after Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin made final "first-come, first-served" contract offers to Radulov and Andrei Markov and then lost both of them as free agents. Radulov signed a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million with the Stars, while Markov went back home to Russia to play for Kazan Ak-Bars, where he won the KHL's Gagarin Cup.
Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 5-6-11 totals in seven games. Radulov returned to the Stars lineup Tuesday night after missing the previous four games with a lower-body injury. He logged 21:04 of ice time against the Canadiens, with two shots, two hits, a plus-1 and the empty-net goal.
"He's obviously a big part of our team," the Stars' Jason Spezza said after the game about Radulov. "He's an emotional guy, he's a physical player. He protects pucks well. He's a big part of our team, so it was nice to get him back. I think the more and more he plays he'll get back up to speed. But just to have him there emotionally it was important for us."
After the game, Canadiens coach Claude Julien said his team wasn't focused on Radulov.
"Our game plan wasn't to shut down Radulov," Julien said. "Our game plan was to more or less shut down their best players and it's more than Radulov. I think when you look at guys like (Jamie) Benn and guys like (Tyler) Seguin it was important for us to shut them down. But their power play is what hurt us the most, I think, tonight."
Officially, the Stars were 1-for-6 on the power play, but one of their goals came only seconds after a power play had finished. The Canadiens went 0-for-4 on the power play.
The Canadiens continued to struggle in the faceoff circle, winning only 44 per cent of the draws.

Bell Centre fans boo Radulov
Canadiens fans loved Radulov when he was in Montreal, but they booed him almost every time he touched the puck Tuesday night.
There are some fans who believe Radulov was greedy to leave Montreal - calling him "Greedulov" - after Bergevin took a chance on the Russian, signing him to join the Canadiens as a free agent after he had spent four seasons with CSKA Moscow in the KHL.
Personally, I have no problem with Radulov or any other NHL player trying to get as much money as they can from whatever team wants to pay them since their careers are short. And when it comes to greed, NHL owners are more guilty of that since they lock out the players every chance they can to get what they want in collective bargaining - taking the game away from the fans in the process. Don't be surprised if there's another lockout in 2020.
As Bergevin once said himself: "If you want loyalty, buy a dog."
Wheels fall off for Habs after fast start
The Canadiens got off to a fast start against the Stars, outshooting them 10-2 in the first period.
Then while the Canadiens' were short-handed, Artturi Lehkonen was awarded a penalty shot only 48 seconds into the second period. He was stopped trying to shoot for the five-hole against Stars goalie Ben Bishop and then the wheels fell off for the Canadiens.
The Stars' Esa Lindell scored a power-play goal at 1:49 of the second period when the shots were 12-4 for the Canadiens and then Miro Heiskanen made it 2-0 at the 7:24 mark and the Stars never looked back.
Brendan Gallagher made things interesting when he scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season for the Canadiens at 2:58 of the third period, banging in a rebound from the top of the crease - where else? The Stars called for a goalie-interference video review, but the goal counted because Gallagher had been pushed into Bishop by defenceman John Klinberg.
The Stars' Devin Shore delivered the knockout blow with a short-handed goal at 9:27 of the third period after Lehkonen was stripped of the puck in front of his own net. Radulov put the finishing touch on the Stars' victory when he scored into an empty net at 17:23.
Canadiens goalie Carey Price, coming off a 3-0 shutout win Saturday night in Boston, allowed three goals on the 21 shots he faced as the Canadiens outshot the Stars 35-22.
The Canadiens saw their record fall to 6-3-2.
"It wasn't the greatest game," Julien said. "I'm not going to stand here and say our effort wasn't good. There was a good effort. Now, did we play well enough? That's another thing. I don't think we played well enough, but I can't complain about the effort. I think the guys were trying. Some nights things go a lot better than others. I felt especially in the second period we lacked cohesion (with) too many of the Ds and forwards and we weren't generating as much."
The Stars improved their record to 6-5-0 with their first road win of the season.
"A tough game," Spezza said. "We know how well they've been playing and I thought they outplayed us in the first and Bish stood tall and gave us a chance. Then I thought we did a really good job in the second of really taking over the game by cycling and playing a hard, heavy game and did a lot of good things."

Byron suffers lower-body injury
The Canadiens didn't make any lineup changes against the Stars, meaning forwards Andrew Shaw and Nikita Scherbak were healthy scratches again and defenceman Noah Juulsen sat out with a minor upper-body injury.
The Canadiens' Paul Byron suffered a lower-body injury during the second period and did not return to the game.
"No idea on Paulie," Julien said after the game when asked if he had an update on Byron's injury.

Scherbak sent to Laval Rocket
After the game, the Canadiens announced that Scherbak, who has been a healthy scratch for all 11 games this season, was being sent to the AHL's Laval Rocket for conditioning purposes. Scherbak was the Canadiens' first-round pick (26th overall) at the 2014 NHL Draft.
"Scherbak needs to go and play," Julien said. "He hasn't played in over a month. I'm not sure it's fair to throw him in the lineup here, where he hasn't played in a while. I think a good conditioning stint and make sure that when he comes back he's got some games under his belt. So that was the intention behind it and I think it's important for him to find his game and for us to have a better player when we need him."
Domi's streak comes to an end
The Canadiens' Max Domi saw his six-game point streak - during which he posted 5-3-8 totals - come to an end against the Stars, finishing the game minus-2 with two shots on goal while winning only 5 of 14 faceoffs (36 per cent). Domi's linemates, Jonathan Drouin and Lehkonen, were also pointless.
"I think that Domi's line with Dru and Lehky tonight they didn't have it as much as they've had it lately," Julien said. "Those things happen. So I'm not going to stand here and dwell on one game. Let's see what we can do and bounce back for the next one."
Fourth line needs to chip in
The Canadiens' new, fast-paced style is a lot easier to play when Julien can roll four lines - especially over the course of the long, 82-game schedule.
The fourth line against the Stars had Matthew Peca at centre between Nicolas Deslauriers and Charles Hudon. The line was pointless with Hudon logging 11:56 of ice time, Peca 11:37 and Deslauriers 10:33.
After Tuesday's morning skate, Julien was asked how much ice time he'd like to see his fourth line get each game.
"I wouldn't want you guys to dissect that system and ice time and that," the coach said. "I think at the end of the day, what I would tell you is that in order for us to get the maximum out of our lineup we do need our fourth line. Do we need them for 18 minutes? No, not really. But we need them to bring us some good presence where it's going to give us the energy, it's going to bring something - whether it's the forecheck creates offensive chances, whether it's being on the ice at times when I really need them against top lines and being able to give us those kind of shifts. But I think we need them for sure.
"As far as time is concerned, I think a lot of it depends on the game," Julien added. "There's no doubt we need four lines, not just in the system. In today's game, you look at most teams and I don't think we're much different than anybody else as far as the amount of ice time, but I think every team knows nowadays with the schedule and the way the game is played - the pace of the game has picked up in the last few years - you have to be able to rely on your fourth line."
Last season, Julien struggled to find an identity on his fourth line. This season, the coach says the fourth line will have two identities.
"I think some of it depends on who we're playing," Julien said. "We've been able to try and use those two identities, whether it's been a little bit more grit or whether it's been giving us a little bit more balance on the attack - and I think a lot of it depends who's on the other side. What kind of team you're playing and how they play and we've been able to kind of adjust accordingly."

Armia on the power play
Joel Armia continues to have a spot on the Canadiens' second power-play unit even though he has never scored a power-play goal and has only six power-play assists in 191 career NHL games.
Armia has 2-2-4 totals in 11 games this season.
"There's a lot of guys that are good right now that aren't really scoring," Julien said. "Lehkonen's another one of them (with only one goal this season). They're playing good hockey. We're going to need them to score. It's going to come. I really feel that those guys will eventually find the back of the net."

Ouellet a pleasant surprise
One of the pleasant surprises for the Canadiens early this season has been the play of defenceman Xavier Ouellet.
The Canadiens signed Ouellet as a free agent on July 1 after Detroit bought out the final season of his two-year, US$2.5-million contract in June after he posted 0-7-7 totals and a minus-3 in 45 games with the Red Wings, unable to crack the roster on a regular basis. He signed a one-year, two-way deal with the Canadiens that pays him US$700,000 in the NHL and $275,000 in the AHL.
Ouellet earned a spot among the Canadiens' top six defencemen during training camp and has yet to miss a game this season. He logged 18:49 of ice time against the Stars and was even in plus/minus. For the season, Ouellet has 0-3-3 totals and is minus-2 while averaging 16:39 of ice time.
"I'm really happy for sure," Ouellet said about his performance after Tuesday's morning skate. "I always believed I could do it ... it was just a matter of actually getting the opportunity and taking it. I prepared well, I had a good camp, personally. I think the most fun right now is the way the team's going."
Most nights this season you probably haven't noticed Ouellet on the ice, which is a good thing for a No. 5 or No. 6 defenceman.
"As a D, I think it is a good thing if you don't get noticed," Ouellet said. "Especially the type of game I play ... I try to be solid defensively and if you don't see me it's because I haven't made any mistakes."

Stars rebound nicely
The Stars rebounded nicely against the Canadiens from a 4-2 loss to the Red Wings Sunday in Detroit. It was only the second win of the season for the Red Wings (2-7-2), who have the worst record in the NHL.
"I think it's a team that's coming off a tough loss," Julien said about the Stars after Tuesday's morning skate. "I think they'll bounce back a little bit like we were Saturday (in a 3-0 win over the Boston Bruins) after losing to Buffalo. They lost to Detroit. I'm sure that one stung and they're going to want to bounce back. We should and we'll probably see their best tonight."
The Canadiens did - especially in the last two periods.

Habs honour Stars' Spezza
The Stars' Spezza played in his 1,000th career NHL regular-season game Tuesday night and the Canadiens congratulated him on the giant screen at the Bell Centre during a TV timeout in the first period.
The Montreal fans gave Spezza a nice ovation.
"That was really nice," said Spezza, who was pointless in 18:44 of ice time while winning 13 of 17 faceoffs (76 per cent) against the Canadiens. "Definitely unexpected. It's nice to get respect from a hockey community like this that follows the game and knows the game so well. So it definitely was a touching moment for me."
Spezza's parents were in attendance and they were also shown on the big screen.
"My dad looks younger than I do," Spezza said with a smile. "It's great to be so close to home. Montreal's such a great city, so for them it's easy to come down from Toronto. It definitely makes it even more special."
The 35-year-old Spezza was selected by the Ottawa Senators with the No. 2 overall pick at the 2001 NHL Draft after the Atlanta Thrashers took Ilya Kovalchuk with the No. 1 pick.
Spezza has 326 goals and 570 assists for 896 career points in his 1,000 games.

Canadiens trivia
What link does Stars coach Jim Montgomery have with the Canadiens?
Montgomery was the player the Canadiens received from the St. Louis Blues on Aug. 19, 1994 when they traded captain Guy Carbonneau. Montgomery, a Montreal native, would only play five games with the Canadiens. Carbonneau spent one season with the Blues before getting traded to Dallas, where he spent five seasons with the Stars and won the Stanley Cup in 1999.
Before joining the Stars this season, Montgomery spent five seasons as head coach at the University of Denver.
What's next?
The Canadiens will practise at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday in Brossard and will be back in action Thursday night when the Washington Capitals visit the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio). The Tampa Bay Lightning will be at the Bell Centre on Saturday (7 p.m., SN360, CITY, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).
Next week, the Canadiens will visit the New York Islanders on Monday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) and the New York Rangers on Tuesday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) before returning home to play the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) and the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday (7 p.m., SN, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).

Brendan Gallagher made things interesting when he scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season for the Canadiens at 2:58 of the third period, banging in a rebound from the top of the crease - where else? The Stars called for a goalie-interference video review, but the goal counted because Gallagher had been pushed into Bishop by defenceman John Klinberg.
The Stars' Devin Shore delivered the knockout blow with a short-handed goal at 9:27 of the third period after Lehkonen was stripped of the puck in front of his own net. Radulov put the finishing touch on the Stars' victory when he scored into an empty net at 17:23.
Canadiens goalie Carey Price, coming off a 3-0 shutout win Saturday night in Boston, allowed three goals on the 21 shots he faced as the Canadiens outshot the Stars 35-22.
The Canadiens saw their record fall to 6-3-2.
"It wasn't the greatest game," Julien said. "I'm not going to stand here and say our effort wasn't good. There was a good effort. Now, did we play well enough? That's another thing. I don't think we played well enough, but I can't complain about the effort. I think the guys were trying. Some nights things go a lot better than others. I felt especially in the second period we lacked cohesion (with) too many of the Ds and forwards and we weren't generating as much."
The Stars improved their record to 6-5-0 with their first road win of the season.
"A tough game," Spezza said. "We know how well they've been playing and I thought they outplayed us in the first and Bish stood tall and gave us a chance. Then I thought we did a really good job in the second of really taking over the game by cycling and playing a hard, heavy game and did a lot of good things."

Byron suffers lower-body injury
The Canadiens didn't make any lineup changes against the Stars, meaning forwards Andrew Shaw and Nikita Scherbak were healthy scratches again and defenceman Noah Juulsen sat out with a minor upper-body injury.
The Canadiens' Paul Byron suffered a lower-body injury during the second period and did not return to the game.
"No idea on Paulie," Julien said after the game when asked if he had an update on Byron's injury.

Scherbak sent to Laval Rocket
After the game, the Canadiens announced that Nikita Scherbak, who has been a healthy scratch for all 11 games this season, was being sent to the AHL's Laval Rocket for conditioning purposes. Scherbak was the Canadiens' first-round pick (26th overall) at the 2014 NHL Draft.
"Scherbak needs to go and play," Julien said. "He hasn't played in over a month. I'm not sure it's fair to throw him in the lineup here, where he hasn't played in a while. I think a good conditioning stint and make sure that when he comes back he's got some games under his belt. So that was the intention behind it and I think it's important for him to find his game and for us to have a better player when we need him."
Domi's streak comes to an end
The Canadiens' Max Domi saw his six-game point streak - during which he posted 5-3-8 totals - come to an end against the Stars, finishing the game minus-2 with two shots on goal while winning only 5 of 14 faceoffs (36 per cent). Domi's linemates, Jonathan Drouin and Artturi Lehkonen, were also pointless.
"I think that Domi's line with Dru and Lehky tonight they didn't have it as much as they've had it lately," Julien said. "Those things happen. So I'm not going to stand here and dwell on one game. Let's see what we can do and bounce back for the next one."
Fourth line needs to chip in
The Canadiens' new, fast-paced style is a lot easier to play when coach Claude Julien can roll four lines - especially over the course of the long, 82-game schedule.
The fourth line against the Stars had Matthew Peca at centre between Nicolas Deslauriers and Charles Hudon. The line was pointless with Hudon logging 11:56 of ice time, Peca 11:37 and Deslauriers 10:33.
After Tuesday's morning skate, Julien was asked how much ice time he'd like to see his fourth line get each game.
"I wouldn't want you guys to dissect that system and ice time and that," the coach said. "I think at the end of the day, what I would tell you is that in order for us to get the maximum out of our lineup we do need our fourth line. Do we need them for 18 minutes? No, not really. But we need them to bring us some good presence where it's going to give us the energy, it's going to bring something - whether it's the forecheck creates offensive chances, whether it's being on the ice at times when I really need them against top lines and being able to give us those kind of shifts. But I think we need them for sure.
"As far as time is concerned, I think a lot of it depends on the game," Julien added. "There's no doubt we need four lines, not just in the system. In today's game, you look at most teams and I don't think we're much different than anybody else as far as the amount of ice time, but I think every team knows nowadays with the schedule and the way the game is played - the pace of the game has picked up in the last few years - you have to be able to rely on your fourth line."
Last season, Julien struggled to find an identity on his fourth line. This season, the coach says the fourth line will have two identities.
"I think some of it depends on who we're playing," Julien said. "We've been able to try and use those two identities, whether it's been a little bit more grit or whether it's been giving us a little bit more balance on the attack - and I think a lot of it depends who's on the other side. What kind of team you're playing and how they play and we've been able to kind of adjust accordingly."

Armia on the power play
Joel Armia continues to have a spot on the Canadiens' second power-play unit even though he has never scored a power-play goal and has only six power-play assists in 190 career NHL games.
Armia has 2-2-4 totals in 11 games this season.
"There's a lot of guys that are good right now that aren't really scoring," Julien said. "Lehkonen's another one of them (with only one goal this season). They're playing good hockey. We're going to need them to score. It's going to come. I really feel that those guys will eventually find the back of the net."

Ouellet a pleasant surprise
One of the pleasant surprises for the Canadiens early this season has been the play of defenceman Xavier Ouellet.
The Canadiens signed Ouellet as a free agent on July 1 after Detroit bought out the final season of his two-year, US$2.5-million contract in June after he posted 0-7-7 totals and a minus-3 in 45 games with the Red Wings, unable to crack the roster on a regular basis. He signed a one-year, two-way deal with the Canadiens that pays him US$700,000 in the NHL and $275,000 in the AHL.
Ouellet earned a spot among the Canadiens' top six defencemen during training camp and has yet to miss a game this season. He logged 18:49 of ice time against the Stars and was even in plus/minus. For the season, Ouellet has 0-3-3 totals and is minus-2 while averaging 16:39 of ice time.
"I'm really happy for sure," Ouellet said about his performance after Tuesday's morning skate. "I always believed I could do it ... it was just a matter of actually getting the opportunity and taking it. I prepared well, I had a good camp, personally. I think the most fun right now is the way the team's going."
Most nights this season you probably haven't noticed Ouellet on the ice, which is a good thing for a No. 5 or No. 6 defenceman.
"As a D, I think it is a good thing if you don't get noticed," Ouellet said. "Especially the type of game I play ... I try to be solid defensively and if you don't see me it's because I haven't made any mistakes."

Stars rebound nicely
The Stars rebounded nicely against the Canadiens from a 4-2 loss to the Red Wings Sunday in Detroit. It was only the second win of the season for the Red Wings (2-7-2), who have the worst record in the NHL.
"I think it's a team that's coming off a tough loss," Canadiens coach Claude Julien said after Tuesday's morning skate. "I think they'll bounce back a little bit like we were Saturday (in a 3-0 win over the Boston Bruins) after losing to Buffalo. They lost to Detroit. I'm sure that one stung and they're going to want to bounce back. We should and we'll probably see their best tonight."
The Canadiens did - especially in the last two periods.

Habs honour Stars' Spezza
The Stars' Jason Spezza played in his 1,000th career NHL regular-season game Tuesday night and the Canadiens congratulated him on the giant screen at the Bell Centre during a TV timeout in the first period.
The Montreal fans gave Spezza a nice ovation.
"That was really nice," said Spezza, who was pointless in 18:44 of ice time while winning 13 of 17 faceoffs (76 per cent). "Definitely unexpected. It's nice to get respect from a hockey community like this that follows the game and knows the game so well. So it definitely was a touching moment for me."
Spezza's parents were in attendance and they were also shown on the big screen.
"My dad looks younger than I do," Spezza said with a smile. "It's great to be so close to home. Montreal's such a great city, so for them it's easy to come down from Toronto it definitely makes it even more special."
The 35-year-old Spezza was selected by the Ottawa Senators with the No. 2 overall pick at the 2001 NHL Draft after the Atlanta Thrashers took Ilya Kovalchuk with the No. 1 pick.
Spezza has 326 goals and 570 assists for 896 career points in his 1,000 games.

Canadiens trivia
What link does Stars coach Jim Montgomery have with the Canadiens?
Montgomery was the player the Canadiens received from the St. Louis Blues on Aug. 19, 1994 when they traded captain Guy Carbonneau. Montgomery, a Montreal native, would only play five games with the Canadiens. Carbonneau spent one season with the Blues before getting traded to Dallas, where he spent five seasons with the Stars and won the Stanley Cup in 1999.
Before joining the Stars this season, Montgomery spent five seasons as head coach at the University of Denver.
What's next?
The Canadiens have a practice scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday in Brossard and will be back in action Thursday night when the Washington Capitals visit the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio). The Tampa Bay Lightning will be at the Bell Centre on Saturday (7 p.m., SN360, CITY, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).
Next week, the Canadiens will visit the New York Islanders on Monday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS TSN 690 Radio) and the New York Rangers on Tuesday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) before returning home to play the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) and the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday (7 p.m., SN, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).

Full text: Canadiens Game Day is a new feature this season in which we will follow the Habs during every home game from the morning skate in Brossard through the post-game interviews at the Bell Centre, updating throughout the day with all the news, quotes, notes and opinion you're looking for:
The Canadiens got off to a great start Tuesday night against the Dallas Stars, outshooting them 10-2 in the first period at the Bell Centre.
Then while the Canadiens' were short-handed, Artturi Lehkonen was awarded a penalty shot only 48 seconds into the second period. He was stopped trying to shoot for the five-hole against Stars goalie Ben Bishop and then the wheels fell off for the Canadiens, who went on to lose 4-1.
The Stars' Esa Lindell scored a power-play goal at 1:49 of the second period when the shots were 12-4 for the Canadiens and then Miro Heiskanen made it 2-0 at the 7:24 mark and the Stars never looked back.
Brendan Gallagher made things interesting when he scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season for the Canadiens at 2:58 of the third period, banging in a rebound from the top of the crease - where else? The Stars called for a goalie-interference video review, but the goal counted because Gallagher had been pushed into Bishop by defenceman John Klinberg.
The Stars' Devin Shore delivered the knockout blow with a short-handed goal at 9:27 of the third period after Lehkonen was stripped of the puck in front of his own net. Former Canadien Alexander Radulov put the finishing touch on the Stars' victory when he scored into an empty net at 17:23. Radulov was booed by Bell Centre fans almost every time he touched the puck.
After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas as a free agent, signing a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million. Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 6-6-11 totals in seven games.
Canadiens goalie Carey Price, coming off a 3-0 shutout win Saturday night in Boston, allowed three goals on the 21 shots he faced as the Canadiens outshot the Stars 35-22.

Stars were looking to rebound
The Stars were looking to rebound from a 4-2 loss to the Red Wings Sunday in Detroit when they faced the Canadiens. It was only the second win of the season for the Red Wings (2-7-2), who have the worst record in the NHL.
"I think it's a team that's coming off a tough loss," Canadiens coach Claude Julien said after Tuesday's morning skate. "I think they'll bounce back a little bit like we were Saturday (in a 3-0 win over the Boston Bruins) after losing to Buffalo. They lost to Detroit. I'm sure that one stung and they're going to want to bounce back. We should and we'll probably see their best tonight."

Fast start for Habs' Domi
Max Domi led the Canadiens in scoring heading into Tuesday night's game with 5-6-11 totals and was on a six-game point streak with 5-3-8 totals during that span.
"I think he's just been very good," Julien said about Domi. "If anything, he's such a good skater that he's been able to cover a lot of the ice and he loves the pace of the game. It fits his style well. What I've seen from him is he's been as good in one end as he has in the other. The fact that he's shooting more this year has obviously given him the results that maybe he didn't have as much in the past."
Domi had only nine goals in each of the last two seasons with the Arizona Coyotes before being traded to the Canadiens during the off-season in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. Four of Domi's nine goals last season were empty-netters.
"I think we've really encouraged him to take a shot more than pass, where that's the first thing he looked for is a pass," Julien said. "He's been able to, I think, balance both of those, shooting vs. passing. There's a better balance there and that makes him a more dangerous player. There's not much to say: 'Max, you got to get better at.' I think as a team we got to get better at faceoffs and he's working at it. So I think all the stuff that we needed from him he's providing right now."
The Canadiens headed into Tuesday night's game ranked 29th in the NHL in faceoffs, winning only 45.2 per cent. Domi had won 44.0 per cent of his faceoffs.

Habs honour Stars' Spezza
The Stars' Jason Spezza played in his 1,000th career NHL regular-season game Tuesday night and the Canadiens congratulated him on the giant screen at the Bell Centre during a TV timeout in the first period.
The Montreal fans gave Spezza a nice ovation. The 35-year-old was selected by the Ottawa Senators with the No. 2 overall pick at the 2001 NHL Draft after the Atlanta Thrashers took Ilya Kovalchuk with the No. 1 pick.
Spezza went into Tuesday night's game with 326 goals and 570 assists for 896 career points.

Canadiens trivia
What link does Stars coach Jim Montgomery have with the Canadiens?
Montgomery was the player the Canadiens received from the St. Louis Blues on Aug. 19, 1994 when they traded captain Guy Carbonneau. Montgomery, a Montreal native, would only play five games with the Canadiens. Carbonneau spent one season with the Blues before getting traded to Dallas, where he spent five seasons with the Stars and won the Stanley Cup in 1999.
Before joining the Stars this season, Montgomery spent five seasons as head coach at the University of Denver.
What's next?
The Canadiens have a practice scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday in Brossard and will be back in action Thursday night when the Washington Capitals visit the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio). The Tampa Bay Lightning will be at the Bell Centre on Saturday (7 p.m., SN360, CITY, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).
Next week, the Canadiens will visit the New York Islanders on Monday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS TSN 690 Radio) and the New York Rangers on Tuesday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) before returning home to play the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) and the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday (7 p.m., SN, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).

Full text: Canadiens Game Day is a new feature this season in which we will follow the Habs during every home game from the morning skate in Brossard through the post-game interviews at the Bell Centre, updating throughout the day with all the news, quotes, notes and opinion you're looking for:
Former Canadien Alexander Radulov will be in the Dallas Stars lineup Tuesday night when the two teams meet at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio).
Radulov had missed the previous four games with a lower-body injury, but after Tuesday's morning skate at the Bell Centre Stars coach Jim Montgomery confirmed the forward will return to the lineup.
"(He adds) emotion, skill, passion," Montgomery said about Radulov on the team's website. "A lot of things any team needs."
After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas as a free agent, signing a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million. Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 4-6-10 totals in six games.
Radulov's linemates, Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin, really missed him. Benn is pointless in the last six games, while Seguin had no goals and two assists during that span.
Montgomery is going to shake up his lines against the Canadiens with Radulov playing with Seguin and Justin Dowling, while Benn will play with Jason Spezza and Mattias Janmark. Spezza will play in his 1,000th career NHL game Tuesday night.
The Canadiens and Stars split their two meetings last season with the Stars winning 3-1 at the Bell Centre and the Canadiens winning 4-2 in Dallas. Radulov picked up an assist in each of those games.

No changes to Habs lineup
After Tuesday's morning skate in Brossard, Canadiens coach Claude Julien said there won't be any lineup changes against the Stars, meaning forwards Andrew Shaw and Nikita Scherbak will be healthy scratches again and defenceman Noah Juulsen will also sit out with a minor upper-body injury.
Here's how the Canadiens' lines and defence pairings are expected to look against the Stars with Carey Price starting in goal:
Tatar - Danault - Gallagher
Drouin - Domi - Lehkonen
Byron - Kotkaniemi - Armia
Deslauriers - Peca - Hudon
Benn - Petry
Alzner - Reilly

Stars looking to rebound
The Stars will be looking to rebound from a 4-2 loss to the Red Wings Sunday in Detroit. It was only the second win of the season for the Red Wings (2-7-2), who have the worst record in the NHL.
"I think it's a team that's coming off a tough loss," Canadiens coach Claude Julien said after Tuesday's morning skate. "I think they'll bounce back a little bit like we were Saturday (in a 3-0 win over the Boston Bruins) after losing to Buffalo. They lost to Detroit. I'm sure that one stung and they're going to want to bounce back. We should and we'll probably see their best tonight."

Domi on fire for Habs
Max Domi led the Canadiens in scoring heading into Tuesday night's game with 5-6-11 totals and was on a six-game point streak with 5-3-8 totals during that span.
"I think he's just been very good," Julien said about Domi. "If anything, he's such a good skater that he's been able to cover a lot of the ice and he loves the pace of the game. It fits his style well. What I've seen from him is he's been as good in one end as he has in the other. The fact that he's shooting more this year has obviously given him the results that maybe he didn't have as much in the past."
Domi had only nine goals in each of the last two seasons with the Arizona Coyotes before being traded to the Canadiens during the off-season in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. Four of Domi's nine goals last season were empty-netters.
"I think we've really encouraged him to take a shot more than pass, where that's the first thing he looked for is a pass," Julien said. "He's been able to, I think, balance both of those, shooting vs. passing. There's a better balance there and that makes him a more dangerous player.

Where the Habs stand
The Canadiens (6-2-2) headed into Tuesday night's game ranked 13th in the NHL in offence, scoring an average of 3.20 goals per game, and fourth in defence, allowing an average of 2.50 goals per game. They ranked 19th on the power play (17.9 per cent), 19th in penalty-killing (76.5 per cent) and 29th in faceoffs (45.2 per cent).
Max Domi led the Canadiens in scoring heading into the game with 5-6-11 totals, followed by Jeff Petry (1-8-9), Tomas Tatar (3-5-8), Jonathan Drouin (3-5-8) and Brendan Gallagher (6-1-7).

Canadiens trivia
What link does Stars coach Jim Montgomery have with the Canadiens?
Montgomery was the player the Canadiens received from the St. Louis Blues on Aug. 19, 1994 when they traded captain Guy Carbonneau. Montgomery, a Montreal native, would only play five games with the Canadiens. Carbonneau spent one season with the Blues before getting traded to Dallas, where he spent five seasons with the Stars and won the Stanley Cup in 1999.
Before joining the Stars this season, Montgomery spent five seasons as head coach at the University of Denver.
What's next?
The Canadiens have a practice scheduled for 11 a.m. Wednesday in Brossard and will be back in action Thursday night when the Washington Capitals visit the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio). The Tampa Bay Lightning will be at the Bell Centre on Saturday (7 p.m., SN360, CITY, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).
Next week, the Canadiens will visit the New York Islanders on Monday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS TSN 690 Radio) and the New York Rangers on Tuesday (7 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) before returning home to play the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio) and the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday (7 p.m., SN, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio).

Full text: Canadiens Game Day is a new feature this season in which we will follow the Habs during every home game from the morning skate in Brossard through the post-game interviews at the Bell Centre, updating throughout the day with all the news, quotes, notes and opinion you're looking for:
Former Canadien Alexander Radulov will be in the Dallas Stars lineup Tuesday night when the two teams meet at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio).
Radulov had missed the previous four games with a lower-body injury, but after Tuesday's morning skate at the Bell Centre Stars coach Jim Montgomery confirmed the forward will return to the lineup.
After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas, signing a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million. Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 4-6-10 totals in six games.
Radulov's linemates, Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin, really missed him. Benn was pointless in the last four games without Radulov, while Seguin had no goals and two assists.
Montgomery is going to shake up his lines against the Canadiens with Radulov playing with Seguin and Justin Dowling, while Benn will play with Jason Spezza and Mattias Janmark. Spezza will play in his 1,000th career NHL game Tuesday night.
The Canadiens and Stars split their two meetings last season with the Stars winning 3-1 at the Bell Centre and the Canadiens winning 4-2 in Dallas. Radulov picked up an assist in each of those games.

No changes to Habs lineup
After Tuesday's morning skate in Brossard, Canadiens coach Claude Julien said there won't be any lineup changes against the Stars, meaning forwards Andrew Shaw and Nikita Scherbak will be healthy scratches and defenceman Noah Juulsen will also sit out with a minor upper-body injury.
Here's how the Canadiens' lines and defence pairings are expected to look against the Stars with Carey Price starting in goal:
Tatar - Danault - Gallagher
Drouin - Domi - Lehkonen
Byron - Kotkaniemi - Armia
Deslauriers - Peca - Hudon
Benn - Petry
Alzner - Reilly
Ouellet - Mete

Stars looking to rebound
The Stars will be looking to rebound from a 4-2 loss to the Red Wings Sunday in Detroit. It was only the second win of the season for the Red Wings (2-7-2), who have the worst record in the NHL.
"I think it's a team that's coming off a tough loss," Canadiens coach Claude Julien said after Tuesday's morning skate in Brossard. "I think they'll bounce back a little bit like we were Saturday (in a 3-0 win over the Boston Bruins) after losing to Buffalo. They lost to Detroit. I'm sure that one stung and they're going to want to bounce back. We should and we'll probably see their best tonight."

Domi on fire for Habs
Max Domi led the Canadiens in scoring heading into Tuesday night's game with 5-6-11 totals and was on a six-game point streak with 5-3-8 totals during that span.
"I think he's just been very good," Julien said about Domi. "If anything, he's such a good skater that he's been able to cover a lot of the ice and he loves the pace of the game. It fits his style well. What I've seen from him is he's been as good in one end as he has in the other. The fact that he's shooting more this year has obviously given him the results that maybe he didn't have as much in the past."
Domi had only nine goals in each of the last two seasons with the Arizona Coyotes before being traded to the Canadiens during the off-season in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk. Four of Domi's nine goals last season were empty-netters.
"I think we've really encouraged him to take a shot more than pass, where that's the first thing he looked for is a pass," Julien said. "He's been able to, I think, balance both of those, shooting vs. passing. There's a better balance there and that makes him a more dangerous player. There's not much to say: 'Max, you got to get better at.' I think as a team we got to get better at faceoffs and he's working at it. So I think all the stuff that we needed from him he's providing right now."
The Canadiens headed into Tuesday night's game ranked 29th in the NHL in faceoffs, winning on 45.2 per cent. Domi had won 44.0 per cent of his faceoffs.

Dallas Stars at Canadiens: Five things you should know

Full text: Here are five things you should know about the Canadiens-Stars game Tuesday at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio):
The matchup: The Canadiens are coming off an impressive 3-0 win over the Bruins Saturday night in Boston. It's still early but Montreal, with a 6-2-2 record, has been one of the major surprises in the NHL and the Canadiens have reached this point without losing back-to-back games. This is the second stop on a six-game road trip for Dallas, which has a 5-5 record after losing 4-2 in Detroit Sunday. The loss left the Stars with an 0-3 record on the road.
Domi continues to roll: Newcomer Max Domi scored his fifth goal of the season Saturday as he extended his consecutive-game points streak to six games. He has five goals and three assists in that streak and he leads the Canadiens in scoring with 11 points. Brendan Gallagher scored his team-leading sixth goal in Boston. The other Montreal goal was an empty-netter by defenceman Jordie Benn, whose first point of the season ended a 58-game goal drought.
Defence leads the way: Before the season started, there were serious concerns about the Canadiens defence with Shea Weber on the injured reserve list to start the season and goaltender Carey Price coming off the worst season of his career. Those fears appear unfounded. The Canadiens have the fifth-best goals-against average in the league (2.47) and Price's shutout against the Bruins gave Price a 4-1-2 record with a 2.13 GAA and a .922 save percentage.
Radulov likely to return: If you were hoping to boo Alex Radulov when he plays against his former team, you might be in luck. Radulov has missed the past four games with an undisclosed injury, but he skated Monday and there's a good chance he'll be back. Radulov, who spurned the Canadiens' offer two summers ago in favour of lower taxes and better football in Texas, scored four goals and added six assists in his first six games.
Coach Monty comes home: Montreal native Jim Montgomery will be behind the Dallas bench as he returns to the Bell Centre for the first time since 2002, when he played for the Stars. Montgomery's NHL career included a brief stop in Montreal in 1994 after he was traded for Guy Carbonneau. He was hired by the Stars after a successful run in the USHL and in the U.S. college ranks, where he won the 2017 NCAA title with Denver.

Full text: Ok, it looks like our Montreal Canadiens are going to win the October Stanley Cup - again.
I'm kidding around. There's no denying this squad has done better than anyone expected. Absolutely nobody predicted there was any chance that the Habs would be 6-2-2 after their first ten games. And for anyone who was still doubting if this was the real thing, Saturday's statement game against the archrival Boston Bruins settled that argument.
A 3-0 win against the Bruins on their home ice? On a Saturday night? On Hockey Night in Canada? Wow. This team just keeps impressing. Though, just because I like to grumble, let's admit that Tuukka Rask once again had his Habs psychosis in full bloom, letting in two goals on the Canadiens' first five shots. All credit to the Habs for holding off the Bruins and the best line in the NHL for the rest of the game, but Rask wasn't great on either of those goals and was downright terrible on Brendan Gallagher's marker.
Speaking of inspiring, what more can you say about Max Domi? He did it all on his goal. He came up with an incredible stretch/flip pass to linemate Artturi Lehkonen. And after Lehkonen once again flubbed a scoring chance, Domi came to the rescue, looked like he, too, was flubbing it and then ripped it over Rask's shoulder from his knees. Wow, Part II.
Montreal Canadiens' Mike Reilly collides along the boards with Boston Bruins' Noel Acciari during the second period on Oct. 27, 2018, in Boston.
Domi has been the biggest surprise of this young season. He has five goals and 11 points to lead the Habs in scoring, and keep in mind that he scored only nine goals last season with the Arizona Coyotes, including four empty-netters.
And Alex Galchenyuk has yet to score in Arizona, though he has only played three games.
It's early in the season and it is still far from clear that Montreal is a playoff team but if you're a fan, then you have to be loving this month in Habs Nation.
In an interview with the National Post( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/born-into-it-tropic-thunder-actor-jay-baruchel-divulges-stories-of-lifelong-fandom-from-new-book/wcm/e0bfd3a5-3e1f-472c-8f55-678d3d77f3ea ), Canadian actor and quintessential Habs fan Jay Baruchel says he's very impressed by this team. But like any true supporter of the most successful franchise in NHL history, Baruchel has mostly had to deal with a lot of pain and disappointment during the past quarter century of watching the Habs not win Stanley Cups.
That's part of the story he tells in his new memoir, Born Into It: A Fan's Life, which is being published on Tuesday. Reading an advance copy of the book, I was struck by how the Ottawa-born, Montreal-raised actor, writer and director captures the essence of what it means to be emotionally attached to the Habs. And I just love how he riffs on two of the themes dear to me - the soul-destroying insanity of the P.K. Subban trade and the Shakespearean tragedy that is the 21st century Montreal Canadiens.
Like thousands of Habs fans, the 2016 Subban-Shea Weber deal tested Baruchel's faith. Writes Baruchel:
"What the point? If P.K. can get traded, well then, so can Carey Price, and it's that true, then why ... devote hours and hours of my life to caring about and participating in something that doesn't really seem to care if I do or don't?"
Only to conclude: "Because this is Montreal, and Montreal will break your heart."
Exactly. That's Habs fandom in a line. We will have our hearts broken. That's the definition of this miserable life of ours since the last Cup win in 1993.

But the chapter on the elusive 25th Cup is even more on point. I don't buy his argument that the salary cap is the problem, but Baruchel is so right when he says maybe the biggest handicap is the team's nutty obsession with its past. Writes Baruchel:
"Maybe we should pretend there was no Guy Lafleur, no Rocket Richard, no Jean Béliveau, no Patrick Roy, no Forum, no such thing as a dynasty. Maybe the only way for us to compete in the modern-era NHL is to act like we just got here."
Brilliant. The defining aspect of the past 25 years is the pregame video montage of long gone moments of Habs glory. No one does the video homage better than the Habs, but who cares? How about coming up with a contender?
Can the Habs be dragged kicking and screaming into the present? Well, like I said above, it's early but give credit to the Habs' bosses for actually adapting to the 2018 NHL with their approach this season because it's paying off big-time. So maybe there is some hope.

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante hopes the recent chilling scientific report on climate change will help to persuade premier-designate François Legault that fighting global warming should be a top priority for his new provincial government.
On Sunday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report warning that rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in how cities are managed, as well as land, energy, industry, buildings, and transportation, are urgently needed to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The IPCC is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change and providing policy-makers with information on risks, mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Plante told reporters Tuesday that the special report only increased her determination to pursue her administration's plan to make Montreal carbon neutral by 2050.
That plan, announced at a climate conference in San Francisco last month and not yet fully unveiled, involves compensating for all carbon emissions and rendering all municipal buildings energy efficient.
"When I read that report I didn't learn anything new," Plante said. "But I said to myself here is another opportunity for all of us to speak up with one voice. We have a new (provincial) government and I think it will listen to what is being said. We have to think globally and transportation is the principal battle call in Quebec. We can't switch from fossil fuels to clean energy, because we already have. So transportation is our focal point and that means major investments," in projects such as new métro lines and tramways, she said.
Legault has promised to widen and extend some highways, which critics say will only increase carbon emissions by worsening urban sprawl and traffic congestion. But he has also said he wants Quebec to participate in an international carbon trading market. It is not clear whether Legault will commit to meeting Quebec's previous objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The IPCC special report looked at the difference in impact of allowing the planet to warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as opposed to two degrees.
The latter would have far more devastating impacts on humans and other species, including exposing 420 million more people across the planet to severe heat waves, according to the report.
United Nations secretary general António Guterres called the report an "ear-splitting wake-up call to the world" and noted that a half a degree of warming more would cause more deadly heat waves, greater species loss, water scarcity and wipe out the world's coral reefs.
The world is already feeling the consequences of one degree C of global warming, a level that has caused more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, the report noted.
"The decisions we make today are critical in ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future," said Debra Roberts, the co-chair of one of the working groups that produced the report." The next few years are probably the most important in our history."
Plante echoed that urgency Tuesday, saying the government of Quebec "must absolutely say loud and clear that (it favours) public transit options like reserved bus lanes, electric buses, tramways ... in short, we must think big, be ambitious because that is the point we are at."
She said her administration plans to produce a guide for how individual Montrealers can make changes in their day-to-day lives to counter climate change, but she said the real battle will be fought in the political arena.
"We don't want to put it on individuals to save the planet. They can help. But it is really about how we can make collective choices," she said. "I would ask Montrealers to support us when we decide to buy or enlarge green spaces, help me to fight for more public transport options. As a metropolis, we have to stand strong and say this is what needs to be done. We want massive investment, we want a clear decision and we want political will behind this. It is so important. It's crucial. It's now. We need to act now." mlalonde@postmedia.com

CAQ's Legault Rides Pale-Blue Wave To Win; Liberals'Couillard enters reflection mode; Lisée to step down after loss

Full text: Quebecers have decided to try on a new shade of blue.
Fuelled by a desire for change, the Coalition Avenir Québec deftly heaved the governing Liberals out of office Monday with enough seats to form a majority government.
And despite predictions of a nailbiter of an election, or even a minority regime, it was all over early - around 8:30 p.m. - with the CAQ winning a stunning 73 seats as the pale-blue wave that started in the east washed across the province.
The Liberals were reduced from 68 seats in the house to their core ridings in Montreal and a scattering of others for a total of 32, as francophones turned massively to the CAQ in nearly all regions of Quebec. The Liberals will form the official opposition.
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard, who was re-elected in his riding of Roberval, conceded victory early, calling CAQ Leader and Premier-designate François Legault to offer his co-operation for a smooth transition of power.
Later, addressing a crowd of Liberals in his home riding, a sombre Couillard said he is personally assuming responsibility for the loss.
He said he is giving himself a few days to reflect on his future, but it appears highly unlikely he will be able to continue leading the party, which has little history for tolerating such losses.
"I am not bitter," Couillard told the sullen crowd. "I ask you not to be either. I am proud and I ask you to be too."
"Together we did what we had to do. I finish my mandate as premier with my head held high."
As for the once-mighty Parti Québécois, it was a telling blow as the party fell from 28 seats in the house to about 10 - the final chapter of a fall from grace that started way back in 1998. It risks losing official status in the legislature.
Worse, PQ Leader Jean-François Lisée lost in his home riding of Rosemont as Québec solidaire challenger and former La Presse columnist Vincent Marissal, who was ridiculed for making the leap into politics, trumped him.
Lisée becomes the second PQ leader in a row to not only lose an election, but also his seat. The last one was Pauline Marois in 2014.
Faced with the devastating defeat, Lisée announced he would be stepping down as leader.
"The verdict in Rosemont also puts an end to the greatest job I ever had: leader of the PQ," a bittersounding Lisée told his supporters.
The PQ was also wiped off the island of Montreal, including in the fortress east-end riding of Pointeaux-Trembles, which fell to CAQ candidate Chantal Rouleau. The riding represents the CAQ's beachhead in Montreal.
In fact, the election revealed the PQ has completely lost control of a large swath of Quebec's left-wing progressive vote, replaced by the fresh-faced Québec solidaire, whose co-spokespersons Manon Massé and Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois both won re-election.
Not only did QS hold its three island seats of Mercier, Gouin and Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, it added seven more ridings to the stable, including Laurier-Dorion (a former Liberal riding) and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (a former PQ riding) in the city.
But the big news for the 12-yearold organization was that it broke through in the rest of the province. QS candidate Catherine Dorion won in the Quebec City riding of Taschereau, Sol Zanetti won in the riding of Jean-Lesage and Christine Labrie took Sherbrooke, where the student vote turned out in droves.
QS was also fighting the good fight against a Liberal cabinet minister in the northern riding of Rouyn-Noranda, where voters seized QS as the best party for the environment and the working class.
The win is historic in several ways. It is the first time in 50 years that Quebec will not be ruled by either a Liberal or PQ government, as the old federalism/sovereignty debate took on the allure of ancient history for voters - particularly youth.
The results also show new parties (the CAQ and QS) are in vogue and the old ones (Liberal and PQ) are out - a line repeated day in, day out by Legault over the 39-day campaign.
On his third attempt to become premier, Legault, a 61-year-old millionaire and former airline executive, won his gamble after losing twice before, in 2012 and 2014. He will become Quebec's 43rd premier.
A no-nonsense, frank talker, Legault campaigned on a plan that wasn't that different from a classic Liberal theme: economic development and job creation. It's not well understood, but his party wants the legal age for cannabis consumption to be 21 rather than 18.
He is expected to move quickly with his plans, calling back the legislature before Christmas to present key pieces of legislation and either an economic update or a new budget.
Quebecers'desire for change - which has hovered around the 60 per cent level for months - proved to be the biggest factor in the vote.
On the other hand, a lot hinged on the level of voter participation after a campaign that didn't really catch fire in the minds of many. For the record, in 2014 the participation level was 71.43 per cent. Monday it hovered at 68 per cent.
The polls had the Liberals, which have governed Quebec for nearly 15 years, in a dead heat with the CAQ for most of the campaign.
Another battle roared for third and fourth place, between the Parti Québécois and Québec solidaire on Quebec's overcrowded left wing.
Where the CAQ dominated, however, was in the critical francophone vote, which determines who will rule the province.
While most pollsters cautiously predicted a possible CAQ minority government, they lowballed the possibility of a CAQ majority. But pollsters also say 33 per cent of Quebecers do not decide until the last weekend of the election, so it is possible they missed the wave.
Basking in her win, Massé struggled Monday to speak to a cheering crowd in Montreal.
"Québec solidaire is not the party of the Plateau-Mont-Royal," Massé told a packed hall. "You have given Quebecers the desire to walk again."
QS correctly understood a sea change was about to happen and ran with it. According to Quebec's chief electoral office, 28 per cent of the eligible voting population was between the ages of 18 and 35, and for the first time in many years they turned out to vote.
Described as unprecedented in recent Quebec history, the campaign broke ground on a number of levels. It was the first fixed-date election in the province - a situation that created almost a year of pre-campaign jockeying.
It also broke records for the number of female candidates. Out of 940 candidates seeking office, 47 per cent were women - an increase from 2014, when the total was 29.8 per cent. In nine ridings, all candidates were women. pauthier@postmedia.com twitter.com/philipauthier

Full text: Quebecers have decided to try on a new shade of blue.
Fuelled by a desire for change, the Coalition Avenir Québec heaved the governing Liberals out of office Monday with enough seats to form a majority government. CAQ Leader François Legault will be Quebec's 32nd premier, promising Monday evening to make Quebec "strong and proud" again.
"Today, many Quebecers put aside a debate which has divided us for 50 years," he told a crowd at a Quebec City rally, referring to the federalism-sovereignty feud.
Switching to English, he added: "The election is over now; let's start working together for the benefit of all Quebecers. Let's work together to make Quebec stronger within Canada. I want to assure you that my government will be your government."
Despite predictions of a nail-biter of an election( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-welcome-to-the-battle-for-quebec-with-sovereignty-off-the-table ), or even a minority regime, it was all over early - around 8:30 p.m. - with the CAQ winning a stunning 74 seats as the pale-blue wave that started in the east washed across the province.
The Liberals were reduced from 68 seats in the house to their core ridings in Montreal and a scattering of others for a total of 32, as francophones turned massively to the CAQ in nearly all regions. A dozen cabinet ministers including Pierre Moreau, François Blais and Lucie Charlebois lost their ridings. The Liberals will form the official opposition.
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard, who was re-elected in his riding of Roberval, conceded victory early, calling CAQ Leader and Premier-elect François Legault to offer his co-operation for a smooth transition of power.
J'ai eu l'occasion de m'entretenir avec François Legault pour le féliciter. Je lui lègue un Québec en santé financière et prêt à faire face à tous les défis. Je contribuerai à une transition harmonieuse pour le bien de la population québécoise.
- Philippe Couillard (@phcouillard) October 2, 2018( https://twitter.com/phcouillard/status/1046928701861109760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Later, addressing a crowd of Liberals in his home riding, a sombre Couillard said he is personally assuming responsibility for the loss.
He said he is giving himself a few days to reflect on his future, but it appears highly unlikely he will be able to continue leading the party, which has little history for tolerating such losses.
"I am not bitter," Couillard told the sullen crowd. "I ask you not to be either. I am proud and I ask you to be too."
"Together we did what we had to do. I finish my mandate as premier with my head held high."
As for the once-mighty Parti Québécois, it was a telling blow as the party fell from 28 seats in the house to nine - the final chapter of a fall from grace that started way back in 1998. It risks losing official status in the legislature.
Worse, PQ Leader Jean-François Lisée lost in his home riding of Rosemont as Québec solidaire challenger and former La Presse columnist Vincent Marissal, who was ridiculed for making the leap into politics, trumped him.
Lisée becomes the second PQ leader in a row to not only lose an election, but also his seat. The last one was Pauline Marois in 2014.
Faced with the devastating defeat, Lisée announced he would be stepping down as leader.
"The verdict in Rosemont also puts an end to the greatest job I ever had: leader of the PQ," a bitter-sounding Lisée told supporters.
The PQ was also wiped off the island of Montreal, including in the fortress east-end riding of Pointe-aux-Trembles, which fell to CAQ candidate Chantal Rouleau. The CAQ also won in Bourget. The two ridings represent a CAQ beachhead in Montreal.
In fact, the election revealed the PQ has completely lost control of a large swath of Quebec's left-wing progressive vote, replaced by the fresh-faced Québec solidaire, whose co-spokespersons Manon Massé and Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois both won re-election.
Not only did QS hold its three island seats of Mercier, Gouin and Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, it added seven more ridings to the stable, including Laurier-Dorion (a former Liberal riding) and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (a former PQ riding) in the city.
The big news for the 12-year-old organization was that it broke through in the rest of the province. QS candidate Catherine Dorion won in the Quebec City riding of Taschereau, Sol Zanetti won in the riding of Jean-Lesage and Christine Labrie took Sherbrooke, and Émilise Lessard-Therrien won in Rouyn-Noranda, where voters seized QS as the best party for the environment and the working class.
Monday's win is historic in several ways. It is the first time in 50 years that Quebec will not be ruled by either a Liberal or PQ government, as the old federalism/sovereignty debate took on the aura of ancient history for voters - particularly youth.
The results also show new parties (the CAQ and QS) are in vogue and the old ones (Liberal and PQ) are out - a line repeated day in, day out by Legault over the 39-day campaign.
On his third attempt to become premier, Legault, a 61-year-old millionaire and former airline executive, won his gamble after losing twice before, in 2012 and 2014. He will become Quebec's 32nd premier.
A no-nonsense, frank talker, Legault campaigned on a plan that wasn't that different from a classic Liberal theme: economic development and job creation. It's not well understood, but his party wants the legal age for cannabis consumption to be 21 rather than 18.
He is not expected to move too quickly with his plans, because his team lacks experience.
Quebecers' desire for change - which has hovered around the 60 per cent level for months - proved to be the biggest factor in the vote( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-after-39-days-of-campaigning-voters-get-their-say-in-the-battle-for-quebec ).
On the other hand, a lot hinged on the level of voter participation after a campaign that didn't really catch fire in the minds of many. For the record, in 2014 the participation level was 71.43 per cent. Monday it hovered at a mere 67 per cent, a sign many Liberal supporters sat out the election.
The polls had the Liberals, who have governed Quebec for nearly 15 years, in a dead heat with the CAQ for most of the campaign. Another battle roared for third and fourth place, between the Parti Québécois and Québec solidaire on Quebec's overcrowded left wing.
Where the CAQ dominated, however, was in the critical francophone vote, which determines who will rule the province.
While most pollsters cautiously predicted a possible CAQ minority government, they low-balled the possibility of a CAQ majority. But pollsters also say 33 per cent of Quebecers do not decide until the last weekend of the election, so it is possible they missed the wave.
Basking in her win, Massé struggled Monday to speak to a cheering crowd in Montreal.
"Québec solidaire is not the party of the Plateau-Mont-Royal," Massé told a packed hall. "You have given Quebecers the desire to walk again."
QS correctly understood a sea change was about to happen and ran with it. According to Quebec's chief electoral office, 28 per cent of the eligible voting population was between the ages of 18 and 35, and for the first time in many years they turned out to vote.
Described as unprecedented in recent Quebec history, the campaign broke ground on a number of levels. It was the first fixed-date election in the province - a situation that created almost a year of pre-campaign jockeying.
It also broke records for the number of female candidates. Out of 940 candidates seeking office, 47 per cent were women - an increase from 2014, when the total was 29.8 per cent. In nine ridings, all candidates were women.

Full text: Quebecers have decided to try on a new shade of blue.
Fuelled by a desire for change, the Coalition Avenir Québec deftly heaved the governing Liberals out of office Monday with enough seats to form a majority government.
And despite predictions of a nail-biter of an election( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-welcome-to-the-battle-for-quebec-with-sovereignty-off-the-table ), or even a minority regime, it was all over early - around 8:30 p.m. - with the CAQ winning a stunning 73 seats as the pale-blue wave that started in the east washed across the province.
The Liberals were reduced from 68 seats in the house to their core ridings in Montreal and a scattering of others for a total of 32, as francophones turned massively to the CAQ in nearly all regions of Quebec. The Liberals will form the official opposition.
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard, who was re-elected in his riding of Roberval, conceded victory early, calling CAQ Leader and Premier-elect François Legault to offer his co-operation for a smooth transition of power.
J'ai eu l'occasion de m'entretenir avec François Legault pour le féliciter. Je lui lègue un Québec en santé financière et prêt à faire face à tous les défis. Je contribuerai à une transition harmonieuse pour le bien de la population québécoise.
- Philippe Couillard (@phcouillard) October 2, 2018( https://twitter.com/phcouillard/status/1046928701861109760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

"I am not bitter," Couillard told the sullen crowd. "I ask you not to be either. I am proud and I ask you to be too."
"Together we did what we had to do. I finish my mandate as premier with my head held high."
As for the once-mighty Parti Québécois, it was a telling blow as the party fell from 28 seats in the house to about 10 - the final chapter of a fall from grace that started way back in 1998. It risks losing official status in the legislature.
Worse, PQ Leader Jean-François Lisée lost in his home riding of Rosemont as Québec solidaire challenger and former La Presse columnist Vincent Marissal, who was ridiculed for making the leap into politics, trumped him.

QS candidate Catherine Dorion won in the Quebec City riding of Taschereau, Sol Zanetti won in the riding of Jean-Lesage and Christine Labrie took Sherbrooke, where the student vote turned out in droves.
QS was also fighting the good fight against a Liberal cabinet minister in the northern riding of Rouyn-Noranda, where voters seized QS as the best party for the environment and the working class.

He is expected to move quickly with his plans, calling back the legislature before Christmas to present key pieces of legislation and either an economic update or a new budget.

Not just a luxury, an Off-Island fireplace is a hedge against freezing

Full text: Despite the unexpected late-summer heat wave we've enjoyed this past week, the first vivid patches of red and orange are beginning to appear, and there's a new little chill in the early morning air hinting at the cooler autumn days to come.
Although I'll miss summer days lounging by the pool and hanging out on sunny terrasses, I'm looking forward to chilly nights cozied up by the fireplace, playing games, reading books, strumming my guitar, visiting with friends or just staring into the flames.
My neighbours and I will soon be preparing for fireplace season: splitting and stacking cords of wood, sweeping chimneys free of creosote, and clearing out old ashes.
When you live Off-Island, a wood-burning fireplace or stove isn't just a luxury. For those of us without backup generators, having a fireplace and a good stash of well-seasoned wood is a practical hedge against freezing during our all-too-frequent winter power failures.
In the few short years we've lived here, I've lost count of the winter nights we've spent bundled up in darkness, playing board games by the fire while we waited for the lights to come back on. Thanks to the fireplace, those chilly days without power have been some of the best. Now, when the power flickers, the kids get excited to roll out sleeping bags by the fireplace and break out the Yahtzee and Monopoly.
For many Montrealers, however, snuggling up by an old-fashioned wood-burning fireplace will soon be a thing of the past. As of Oct. 1, a new city of Montreal bylaw( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/oct-1-wood-burning-deadline-turns-up-the-heat-on-montreals-fireplace-owners ) goes into effect that will ban the use of wood-burning appliances that don't meet strict emissions standards. Those who ignore the ban could face fines ranging from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars for repeat offenders. For now, however, the ban only applies to the city's 19 boroughs, not demerged municipalities or Off-Island.
Perhaps one day the fireplace ban will spread to the rest of the West Island and across the bridge. The environmental argument against wood-burning fireplaces is hard to refute. In Montreal, it's estimated that 60 per cent of winter smog is due to burning wood. According to the Quebec environment ministry, wood smoke is ahealth hazard( http://www.mddefp.gouv.qc.ca/air/chauf-bois/index-en.htm ), both inside and outside the home.
But foolishly, and a little selfishly, I'm glad I can still look forward to lighting mine up this fall. We humans are not always logical creatures. It may be bad for me, but I can't resist the appeal of a crackling fire. I want to enjoy it as long as I can.

Quebec election: Lisée promises $800 million for seniors' housing

Full text: RIVIÈRE DU LOUP - After a summer in which heat waves rolled across Quebec, killing dozens of seniors, Jean-François Lisée says it's time for the government to take action.
The Parti Québécois leader pledged Wednesday to have air-conditioning in all provincially run elder care centres by next summer. He says the measure will save lives and would cost the government about $100 million.
"From the moment we form a government, we're calling the hospitals and the elder care centres and telling them, 'Call the contractors, start making plans'," said Lisée, while visiting a senior's club in Rimouski. "Get the work started. We think it'll cost less than $100 million but that's what we're putting aside."
Study after study suggests sweltering summers like the one Quebecers just experienced will only get worse as the effects of global warming worsen.
Physicians say seniors are one of the most at risk groups during heat waves. But most of the deaths last summer were concentrated in Montreal apartments and not senior centres.
Even so, Lisée says giving seniors a comfortable place to live should be the central plank of any electoral platform.
"Our society isn't adapting to an aging population ... elders dying during a heat wave, what kind of society allows that," said Harold Lebel, the PQ's candidate in Rimouski. "We talk a lot about what it means to die in dignity but what about living in dignity?"
On Tuesday, the PQ launched a series of attack ads that target the Liberals management of elder care centres. One involves a sort of call and response joke that gets booed by a comedy club audience:
"What does an elder care resident say after his bath? See you next week!"
A government evaluation of all Quebec's elder care centres found that one in four were either in "bad" or "very bad" condition.
The PQ wants to invest an extra $200 million to renovate the centres and improve the ratio of nurses and specialists to patients. That would cost $500 million over four years and Lisée said the PQ would pump $10 million into the centres as of this fall. With the $100 million for air conditioning, that comes to $800 million.
The Coalition Avenir Québec has promised to invest $1 billion to create a network of "more humane" senior homes during its first mandate. The government would build 30 and replace all existing senior centres by the year 2038.
At every stop during his campaign, Lisée has told seniors that it will take a generation for the CAQ's plan to take effect.
"Our seniors need their homes now, not in 20 years," Lisée said.
Also on Wednesday, the PQ leader pledged to add 900,000 hours of home care each year - a 30 per cent increase over current levels.
Last year, a report tabled at the National Assembly found that Liberal budget cuts reduced the amount of home care by one per cent between 2015 and 2016. The report suggests that about 18 per cent of elders need home care but fewer than half actually have access to it.
Throughout the 14-day campaign, Lisée has promised to freeze a $2 billion pay raise to Quebec's doctors and invest the money in home care instead.
It's unclear if that would be possible given that the contract guaranteeing that pay raise has already been signed.

Full text: RIVIÈRE DU LOUP - After a summer in which heat waves rolled across Quebec, killing dozens of seniors, Jean-François Lisée says it's time for the government to take action.
The Parti Québécois leader pledged Wednesday to have air-conditioning in all provincially run elder care centres by next summer. He says the measure will save lives and would cost the government about $100 million.
"From the moment we form a government, we're calling the hospitals and the elder care centres and telling them, 'Call the contractors, start making plans'," said Lisée, while visiting a senior's club in Rimouski. "Get the work started. We think it'll cost less than $100 million but that's what we're putting aside."
Study after study suggests sweltering summers like the one Quebecers just experienced will only get worse as the effects of global warming worsen.
Physicians say seniors are one of the most at risk groups during heat waves. But most of the deaths last summer were concentrated in Montreal apartments and not senior centres.
Even so, Lisée says giving seniors a comfortable place to live should be the central plank of any electoral platform.
"Our society isn't adapting to an aging population ... elders dying during a heat wave, what kind of society allows that," said Harold Lebel, the PQ's candidate in Rimouski. "We talk a lot about what it means to die in dignity but what about living in dignity?"
On Tuesday, the PQ launched a series of attack ads that target the Liberals management of elder care centres. One involves a sort of call and response joke that gets booed by a comedy club audience:
"What does an elder care resident say after his bath? See you next week!"
A government evaluation of all Quebec's elder care centres found that one in four were either in "bad" or "very bad" condition.
The PQ wants to invest an extra $200 million to renovate the centres and improve the ratio of nurses and specialists to patients. That would cost $500 million over four years and Lisée said the PQ would pump $10 million into the centres as of this fall. With the $100 million for air conditioning, that comes to $800 million.
The Coalition Avenir Québec has promised to invest $1 billion to create a network of "more humane" senior homes during its first mandate. The government would build 30 and replace all existing senior centres by the year 2038.
At every stop during his campaign, Lisée has told seniors that it will take a generation for the CAQ's plan to take effect.
"Our seniors need their homes now, not in 20 years," Lisée said.
Also on Wednesday, the PQ leader pledged to add 900,000 hours of home care each year - a 30 per cent increase over current levels.
Last year, a report tabled at the National Assembly found that Liberal budget cuts reduced the amount of home care by one per cent between 2015 and 2016. The report suggests that about 18 per cent of elders need home care but fewer than half actually have access to it.
Throughout the 14-day campaign, Lisée has promised to freeze a $2 billion pay raise to Quebec's doctors and invest the money in home care instead.
It's unclear if that would be possible given that the contract guaranteeing that pay raise has already been signed.

Allison Hanes: Will air-conditioned Montreal schools become inevitable?

Full text: The new school year is only in its second week, but for the second time already, Montreal is under a severe heat warning( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) that is turning classrooms into saunas.
Shortly after noon Tuesday, the temperature climbed to 25 C. With the humidex, it felt more like 40 C. Wednesday is expected to be just as hot, if not hotter. It was the same scenario for the first part of last week, as well.
While many adults have the luxury of retreating to chilled offices, workplaces, retail outlets or vehicles, our kids and their teachers are forced to sweat it out in classrooms that feel more like steam rooms. Few Montreal schools are equipped with air conditioning, so students and staff have to tough out sweltering days like these with water bottles, fans and maybe some extra time outdoors. Some schools even relax their dress codes a little to help kids beat the heat.
In the past, it never made sense to put air conditioning in schools. The handful of times at the beginning and end of the year when the mercury soared high enough to make classrooms uncomfortable never seemed worth the cost and effort. Our school calendar is structured to shut down in the sizzling summer months. These early and late summer heat waves are supposed to be a temporary inconvenience.
But as our climate changes, so, too, does our consideration of what is a necessity when it comes to basic infrastructure.
Hot spells, like the one we are experiencing, could soon become more common - even in northern climates like Canada. Data made public earlier this year by the Prairie Climate Centre( https://climateatlas.ca/ ) at the University of Winnipeg showed that Montreal could go from having about eight days a year where the thermometer rises above 30 C to about 24 a year in the near term and about 50 a year over a longer horizon.
Inevitably, more of those hot days may start to occur during the school year, requiring a response.
The consequences of a hotter city hit home tragically this summer, with more than 70 deaths across Quebec and upwards of 50 in Montreal during a heat wave in early July. Most of those who succumbed were vulnerable seniors who lived alone and had underlying health conditions.
But children, especially young ones, are susceptible to the effects of extreme heat, too. They tend to move and jump and run more than adults. And they don't always listen to their bodies' warning signs when it comes to dehydration and heat exhaustion. Educators can do their best to keep an eye out and remind them to rest or drink frequently, however the heat can get to them quickly.
My daughter came home from her first day of school with a headache and spent the following one in bed - hot, clammy, lethargic, nauseous and slightly delirious. Was this a bug she picked up on Day 1? Given how stuffy her school is and how warm it was on the first day back, it's also within the realm of possibility she was suffering from heat exhaustion. It's hard to tell and she fortunately recovered quickly.
In Montreal especially, the unexpected heat and lack of air conditioning in schools are also exacerbated by other factors.
Across the province, schools are in disrepair. A recent government report found 55 per cent of primary schools and 47 per cent of high schools are in poor or very poor condition Quebec-wide. The situation is more pronounced in Montreal, where there are numerous heritage buildings that badly require upgrades. Poorly ventilated classrooms are of, course, all the more suffocating during periods of extreme heat.
As the government begins to reinvest in modernizing Quebec's school infrastructure, it would be wise to ensure these efforts include measures to prepare for a hotter future. But it's not just air conditioning.
Another area of concern is schoolyards. Many of those in Montreal are constructed of asphalt. In the central boroughs, in particular, there are few trees and little grass. Play areas resemble parking lots with more creative paint jobs. Asphalt schoolyards only intensify the heat on scorching days, offering no respite for from the stifling conditions indoors.
Quebec's public health department( https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/extreme-heat-public-health-1.4808861 ) this weekend called for a strategy to combat the urban heat island effect in response to the dangers underscored by this summer's hot weather. The province's paved schoolyards would certainly be a good place to start.
In this winter city, it would be unthinkable not to heat our schools. In a not-so-distant future, it may become just as unfathomable not to cool them.

Full text: Quebec followed one of its hottest months on record( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-damn-july-was-one-of-hottest-on-record-in-montreal ) with a swelteringly hot and humid August.
According to Environment Canada, the average temperatures in August were two to three degrees above normal in all regions of the province other than the far north. Record temperatures were reached in Montreal, Bagotville and La Pocatière.
In Montreal, the average temperature in August was 22.9 degrees, roughly three degrees more than normal.
Humidity was also high, especially in the south of the province. The humidex exceeded 30 degree for an "abnormal" number of days.
August was also a notably dry month. In Montreal, only 59 millimetres of precipitation were recorded compared to the average of 94 millimetres.
Environment Canada says the summer of 2018 is among the three hottest in Quebec history.
Another heat wave is expected in early September before season temperatures return. However, another heatwave is forecasted for the end of September.

Quebec election: CAQ would replace 'dreaded' CHSLDs with senior homes

Full text: SALABERRY-DE-VALLEYFIELD - A Coalition Avenir Québec government would overhaul Quebec's entire CHSLD nursing home network and replace it with a new series of senior homes.
The CAQ is describing the idea, called the "Maisons des Aînés," as a "project of a generation." It estimates the first phase of the project would cost $1 billion, followed by $245 million a year in operating expenses.
The party says the idea is "destined to replace the CHSLDs that everyone dreads," calling the current model "obsolete, out-of-date and poorly adapted to users' needs."
Quebec's CHSLDs, the government network of nursing homes known as Centres d'hébergement de soins de longue durée, has been criticized( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/nursing-home-class-action-gathers-steam-as-more-than-100-patients-come-forward ) by some for poor care and lengthy waits.
The CAQ says its new senior homes would be "warm, peaceful and comfortable" and be adequately staffed to "take good care" of residents. Each home would have bigger, air-conditioned rooms.
The party said there are currently 2,600 Quebecers waiting for a spot in a CHSLD. A CAQ government would start meeting with users, staff and architects to build 30 of the new homes to meet that demand during its first mandate.
CAQ leader François Legault made the announcement outside an old CHSLD in the Beauharnois riding, southwest of Montreal.
"The state has a responsibility to house our seniors and we need a new direction," Legault said. "We must do it in a humane way. We owe it to our elders who built Quebec."
The party says the project is a 20-year plan and that all CHSLDs would be replaced by 2038. The new proposed homes would house between 70 and 130 people each.
As for current CHSLDs, Legault said he would make sure he would address any current concerns over lack of air conditioning by next summer, saying he would ensure each one is equipped with a common space that has air conditioning in case of heat waves.
But Legault said the new homes built under a CAQ government would all come with air conditioning in each room.
Reminded of a statement he made in 2002 as health minister in a Parti Québécois government, in which he said heat waves only last a few days a year and he had bigger priorities than ensuring CHSLD's had air conditioning, Legault said you can't compare today's summers to those of 16 years ago.
"The planet is getting warmer," he said. "We have heat waves that last longer and are more frequent."
Legault was to visit with seniors Friday morning.
This report will be updated.

Good evening,
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Pope vows to stop sexual abuse by clergy, pens unprecedented letter
Pope Francis issued a letter to Catholics around the world Monday condemning the crime of priestly sexual abuse and its cover-up and demanding accountability. The letter comes in response to a Pennsylvania grand jury report last week, which said at least 1,000 children were victims of some 300 priests over the past 70 years and that generations of bishops failed to protect children and punish the rapists. Francis begged for forgiveness for the pain suffered by the victims, writing, "We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them."
Debra Soh writes that Horror and disgust shouldn't be our only response to pedophilia: "Shutting the discussion down out of discomfort, as many of us would understandably prefer to do, doesn't eliminate the problem, but only sends it underground."
Montreal calling on feds to ban handguns, assault weapons
Montreal's city council unanimously adopted a motion on Monday calling for the federal government to ban handguns and assault weapons across the country. It comes a month after Toronto's city council requested a ban on handguns following a mass shooting that shook Canada's largest city. The Montreal motion calls on Ottawa to strengthen its gun-control bill, known as C-71, which currently doesn't prohibit the private ownership of handguns or assault-style weapons.
After 40 years, sovereignty off the table in Quebec election
Quebec is heading into an election campaign in which for the first time in 40 years, sovereignty is not the major defining issue. Each of the main contenders for the coming Oct. 1 vote agree that Quebec independence is not a point of contention, including the Parti Québécois. However, voters still want change, although it's not clear how they'll get it from the available political options.
A few days before the campaign beings, the Coalition Avenir Québec is leading in the polls with a nationalist agenda, which includes calling for new powers in immigration and culture. The Conservative Party of Canada is officially staying neutral on the election, but has picked up on CAQ's proposals to tailor the platform it will present to Quebec voters in the 2019 federal election. It seems there would be a natural alliance between the two parties.
Wildfire smoke blanketing much of B.C. causing health concerns, traffic warnings
From his home on the Stellat'en First Nation in B.C., about 160 kilometres west of Prince George, David Luggi can usually see the nearby Fraser Lake and trees on the shoreline. Now, those landmarks are shrouded by wildfire smoke that has blanketed much of B.C. and spread through neighbouring Alberta and beyond. It is the result of hundreds of fires burning around the province forcing thousands to evacuate. The smoke is putting many cities under air quality advisories, causing health concerns, traffic warnings and pushing pollution to dangerous levels.
Crews reported that they made some headway over the weekend. There weren't many lightning strikes over the weekend and that gave crews a chance to concentrate on some of the 54 blazes currently threatening people or property.
A study published Monday shows scorching summer heatwaves and downpours are set to become more extreme in the northern hemisphere as global warming makes weather patterns linger longer in the same place. The extremes can lead to drought, wildfires or flooding.
Has social media usage around the world peaked?
Share prices of three of the largest social networks tumbled in recent weeks after missing expectations. But there is a more troubling trend: Social media use may be reaching its peak as the market becomes saturated. Facebook added no new users in Canada and the U.S. and lost users in Europe in the second quarter while it had it slowest global growth since analysts began tracking the measure in 2011. Twitter and Snapchap both lost users and none of these companies can expect to look to emerging markets for growth.
Ottawa revisits fuel standards plans as Trump moves to roll back U.S. rules
Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna on Monday released a paper that evaluates the existing fuel-efficiency standards for the years 2021-25, which were put in place in partnership with the previous U.S. administration in 2014. The Trump administration proposed freezing fuel-efficiency regulations at 2020 levels and declared California no longer has the right to set its own standards, a decision that state has vowed to fight in court. Now, Ottawa is conducting a review and watching to see if there will be one weakened federal standard in the U.S., or two competing ones in which California is joined by other states. Canada typically harmonizes its vehicle efficiency regulations with the United States.

WHAT'S TRENDING ON SOCIAL
Trudeau defends his reaction to heckler, pledges to call out ‘hate speech'
At a rally on Sunday, a woman was shouting at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking him when Ottawa would repay Quebec for costs incurred as a result of an influx of "illegal immigrants." Mr. Trudeau responded by accusing her of intolerance and racism. On Monday when asked if his comments went too far, Mr. Trudeau vowed to steer clear of such hate speech. He said he fears the rise in extreme populism, particularly surrounding immigration issues, with some feeding fear and intolerance using partial truths and "outright lies."
TALKING POINTS
In extreme heat, landlords should be required to keep tenants cool
"In Montreal, authorities noted that most of the people who died during this year's heat wave were above the age of 50, lived alone and had existing physical or mental health issues. And a Toronto Public Health study in 2010 found that while 85 per cent of residents in the city have AC, the 15 per cent who don't are more likely to be people who rent, immigrants, those classified as low income, living in community housing and those who have difficulty with transportation. As The Guardian noted in a feature about heat waves around the world, heat is becoming the next big inequality issue." - Abdullah Shihipar, Toronto-based freelance writer and incoming masters student at Brown University's School of Public Health
Ottawa needs to prepare for a long trade war with the United States
" Two in five Americans are willing to accept higher prices on household products in exchange for the promise of more U.S. jobs. So there is willingness to accept some short-term pain. This is not changing in response to tariff retaliation, at least not yet. Indeed, the data also show that half of Americans are consistently unaware of trade retaliation." - Danielle Goldfarb , head of global research at RIWI Corp .
Do women really need their own weed?
"There is, in fact, a feminist angle to this historic decriminalization, one that has the potential to end a war on drugs that has ruined countless lives, especially those of racialized women and their families. The trouble is, it's being overshadowed by dollars." - Denise Balkissoon

LONG READS FOR A LONG COMMUTE
The man inside: A wounded policeman's life on the frontier of consciousness
Hilary and Ian Jordan tied the knot 45 years ago when she was a rosy-cheeked brunette and he a strapping young man with a passion for bagpipes. But for two-thirds of their marriage Ian has been in a barely conscious state, unable to speak. It was the result of a traumatic brain injury suffered in a car accident in 1987 at the end of a night shift as a police officer in Victoria. For 30 years Hilary visited Ian, covering the walls with pictures of their son. His eyes brightened when she talked and at times he would smile or groan as if he had something to say. As Adriana Barton reports, patients like Ian fall into a medical mystery zone.
‘Cupids is divided terrible': The Newfoundland cove where 17th-century history meets a 21st-century mess
More than 400 years ago, the scenic town of Cupids in the eastern part of Newfoundland was the first permanent English settlement - or was it? Documents addressed to The Globe claim the name of the town doesn't appear in historical records. The controversy has created factions in the romantically-named town and led to four mayors in two years, half of the council resigning and RCMP having to defuse an altercation between two councilors. Jessica Leeder examines how locals created a booming business that then became a battleground over history, money, power and pride.

Full text: Toronto-based freelance writer and an incoming masters student at Brown University's School of Public Health
Last month, as a heat wave baked parts of the country, people flocked to beaches and neighbourhood pools in an attempt to seek respite from the stifling weather. But as the temperatures climbed so, too, did the death toll. In Ontario, three heat-related deaths were reported. In Quebec, the picture was far worse with more than 90 people dying from heat-related causes over the span of a week.
While the death toll in Ontario could be higher as the province has stricter definitions on what consists of a "heat-related death," the staggering amount of lives lost in Quebec can be attributed to something more than just a difference in definitions.
According to officials in Montreal, of the 53 people who died in the city, none of them had air conditioning in their places of residence.
These numbers make one thing clear: With air conditioning, deaths could have been prevented.
As a result of climate change, temperatures across Canada have increased over the past few decades. Data collected by Environment Canada show that between 1961 and 2014, the temperature of Canada's land mass increased by 1.6 degrees C. National summer temperatures are projected to be 3.5 degrees C higher between 2040-2070 than between 1981-2010. While Canadian cities have rules addressing extreme cold, they have yet to properly address the increasing danger from extreme heat.
Extreme heat can have detrimental effects on the body - heat exhaustion is common, with symptoms including headache and dizziness. Things can get much worse with the onset of heat stroke, which often brings with it unconsciousness and requires medical attention.
People's mental health can also take a toll in the heat; researchers in Britain for instance, found that there is a link between higher temperature and the frequency of suicides.
According to 2015 figures from Statistics Canada, only 53 per cent of households in Quebec have air conditioning, 83 per cent in Ontario and 57 per cent nationwide.
Despite the plethora of evidence demonstrating the need to keep people cool, housing regulations in Canada have yet to catch up.
In Toronto for instance, landlords aren't required to install AC systems. There are regulations for landlords who do have units with air conditioning; they must maintain a temperature below 26 degrees, but this is only if the rental agreement specifies the use of AC.
There have been moves to change the rules in Toronto. Last year, city councillors called for a review of the bylaws after a September heat wave left many tenants sweltering. Council subsequently passed a motion asking the city to review the bylaws, and this past May, the city's licensing and standards committee delivered a report which, among other things, recommended the creation of a working group to look into requiring residences to have AC.
In Montreal, authorities noted that most of the people who died during this year's heat wave were above the age of 50, lived alone and had existing physical or mental-health issues.
And a Toronto Public Health study in 2010 found that while 85 per cent of residents in the city have AC, the 15 per cent who don't are more likely to be people who rent, immigrants, those classified as low income, living in community housing and those who have difficulty with transportation. As The Guardian noted in a feature about heat waves around the world, heat is becoming the next big inequality issue.
The city of Hamilton has proposed a potential solution; it's looking into distributing air conditioners to people with low incomes who have pre-existing health conditions that are made worse by the heat. But this is not enough. As climate change makes weather patterns unpredictable, we can no longer rely on antiquated bylaws that don't account for extreme temperatures. If we hold parents accountable when a child dies in a hot car, then surely we must make landlords responsible for the internal temperatures of their units.
Air conditioning isn't a magical long-term solution to the problems we face from climate change - changing how we design buildings and addressing global emissions are far bigger issues - but it is a necessary step to mitigate the effects we are feeling at the moment. Extreme heat is a serious public-health issue.
It's time we started treating it like one.

Linking elders and youth strengthens our communities; Members of different generations can learn from and support one another, Don Rosenbaum says

Full text: This summer's multiple deaths in Quebec from the heat wave illustrate the terrible price of social isolation. Most of the victims were elderly, alone and largely without support.
Yet there is a remedy, a strategy that could make a world of difference. Making intergenerational connections - linking elders and young people in a variety of ways - reduces isolation, and enhances a sense of belonging, of community and civic responsibility for both groups.
We see evidence of this in the anglophone sector with Quebec's network of Community Learning Centres. Financed by minoritylanguage funding from the federal government, these CLCs offer learning and leisure activities to a multi-generational clientele, but only occasionally do the age groups mix.
The real benefit is when the generations connect, learn from one another and support one another. There are many wonderful examples at present, including seniors volunteering at a daycare centre, schoolchildren visiting nursing homes, teens teaching grandparents to navigate the internet and intergenerational cafés bringing elders and high school students together for conversation. In several schools, elders run the breakfast club, help with reading circles and extracurricular activities such as the knitting and chess clubs.
With seniors outnumbering young people, and many remaining fit and active in their post-retirement years, there is a tremendous potential for elders to provide service to others, even as some need services. However we need pathways for the generations, schools and seniors'organizations to connect.
One such effort is underway in Montreal with the development of WIN - the West-end Intergenerational Network. The group currently includes educators from the English Montreal School Board, representatives from seniors'organizations such as the N.D.G. Senior Citizens Council, Extra Miles Senior Visiting Program, faculty members from Concordia University, the director of the P'tit Profs'CPE and students.
WIN was started last fall to facilitate collaboration among community partners, to raise awareness about intergenerational practice and its benefits, promote connections and encourage the creation of innovative programs. This is particularly timely, since many schools now include service learning and volunteer work as a requirement for graduation.
What is needed to realize this potential fully are people in place to facilitate the recruitment, vetting and deployment of volunteers, and to help teachers, schools and seniors'centres to connect. A good example of this is S.K.I.P. in Brantford, Ont. S.K.I.P. - Seniors and Kids Intergenerational Programs - has developed over a decade, with a partnership that includes school boards, a service club, and corporate sponsors.
For WIN, this may be possible in the short term with grants and donations, but the ultimate solution is for much closer collaboration among key provincial ministries to support intergenerational approaches in health, education and social services. A small example - which would bring joy into seniors'residences - would be to require those of substantial size to have a small daycare embedded or adjacent - either through incentives or regulation.
Another would be to encourage and financially support more of our public schools to be truly community schools.
These provide points of service for medical and social services such as vaccination and flu clinics and referrals, as well as contact zones for intergenerational activities. Instead of serving a narrow slice of the population for 200 days a year, these publicly funded institutions could be serving people across the life span 12 months a year.
Intergenerational practice contributes to more inclusive, cohesive communities, the breakdown of barriers and stereotypes, and volunteer activities that contribute to the public good (such as community gardens, environmental projects, library volunteers). And - in a crisis, such as a heat wave or a snowstorm - such communities will be more resilient and responsive, and likely save lives.
But it will require political leadership and creative thinking among the policy-makers in key ministries to tap the potential for the welfare of all. Don Rosenbaum, 70, is a founding member of WIN.

New measures taken against further blackouts at MUHC super hospital; Consortium led by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin tight-lipped about specifics

Full text: Nearly three weeks after a blackout forced surgeons to use flashlights during operations at the MUHC superhospital, authorities have completed their investigation and are now reviewing contingency plans in the event of another outage.
The private consortium in charge of maintaining the electrical system is also carrying out "corrective measures to our existing processes to prevent a similar situation from arising again." The consortium, led by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, did not specify the measures, beyond replacing a transfer switch.
Although only one out of 11 power generators failed during the blackout on the afternoon of July 23, the impact was disproportionate and wide-ranging, raising questions about the capacity of the backup systems. The most essential clinical areas of the three-year-old superhospital were affected, with all of the ORs and the emergency room plunged into darkness for nearly an hour during a heat wave.
The MUHC also disclosed for the first time Friday - in response to questions by the Montreal Gazette - that in addition to surgery being disrupted when the generator failed to kick in, two radiotherapy machines went down, delaying cancer treatment for some patients.
The Central Users Committee of the MUHC, representing patients and their families, has been cataloguing various power-shortage issues at the $1.3-billion superhospital in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce that opened in the spring of 2015.
"This was a major event that deserves our attention," said Pierre Hurteau, a long-standing member of the users committee.
Nicolas Ryan, a spokesperson for SNC-Lavalin, insisted that despite the generator failure, "the Glen site meets all applicable standards and codes, including its power distribution and backup system."
"The investigation is completed and it has confirmed the hypothesis that a faulty electrical component was responsible for the 51-minute power outage in some of the Glen site's sectors," he explained.
"A transfer switch did not function correctly, which led to one of 11 generators not starting. All transfer switches and generators were verified following this incident and all are now in good working order. We can also confirm that the generators have enough capacity to power all essential services at the facility."
"A thorough investigation into the incident resulted in our teams taking corrective measures to our existing processes to prevent a similar situation from arising again," Ryan added, without elaborating further.
Gilda Salomone, a public-relations official for the MUHC, issued a statement on Friday asserting that "all generator systems have since been verified and are again in ready mode. As with any such event, a risk analysis has been conducted and contingency plans are being reviewed."
Salomone was unable to provide details of the contingency plans, saying that's the responsibility of the consortium.
Salomone added that the blackout "affected two out of six linear accelerators used in radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients.
Treatments resumed after power was restored, and no treatments were cancelled as a result."

Full text: Osheaga enthusiast Juliana Yang was heartened to learn that plastic drinking straws would not be allowed at the 2018 edition of the music festival. "A step in the right direction," the Montrealer called it.
And she was pleased to hear of other green initiatives announced in July by concert promoter Evenko - among them the presence of a tanker truck to supply the festival with free drinking water, to reduce the use of individual bottles and encourage the use of reusable containers. The initiative was undertaken with the National Bank.
But Yang was disappointed to see "disturbing amounts of plastic water bottles and cups" littering the grounds at Parc Jean-Drapeau during last weekend's festival. The 20-year-old University of Edinburgh architecture student photographed the scene on Sunday, the final day of the three-day festival, and sent an image to the Montreal Gazette.
The culprit was the heat, said Philip Vanden Brande, Evenko's manager of public and media relations.
When organizers learned that an extreme heat warning would be in effect last weekend, it was decided that the security team would undertake a mass distribution of bottles of water, he said. "Because it was so hot, we did give away a lot of bottles.
"What's important to remember is that the security and safety of festivalgoers is Evenko's priority. At the end of the day, we will do what we have to to keep people safe."
It was Yang's third year at Osheaga, "and I have never stepped on water bottles every two steps the way I did this year," she said in an interview Tuesday.
It was particularly disappointing to see "such an appalling amount of plastic" in light of the fact organizers had promoted their efforts to be more eco-friendly, she said. "People walking around were commenting, 'There are a lot of water bottles.'" Yang said the five water stations in place were awkwardly located and difficult to access, and that they often had long lineups. With 45,000 concertgoers per day, more water stations were needed - even without a heat wave, she said.
Vanden Brande acknowledged the lineups, but said "a lot had to do with the weather."
As in prior years, food vendors at Osheaga were required to use compostable containers, cups and utensils, and some offered eco-cups for which concertgoers paid a refundable deposit, he said. As well, some eco-friendly bottles were distributed for use at the filling stations, he added.
As in the past, waste sorting centres to encourage recycling and composting were in place, and "it is definitely something we want to increase."
Although festival co-ordinators were "extremely pleased" with eco-conscious efforts to date, "we always want to get better," Vanden Brande said.
"Festivalgoers have a responsibility, too," he said. "There were 45,000 people a day on the grounds. We do a lot with garbage and recycling bins and composting, but I do think it is an effort for everyone to make - concertgoers, concessions, everyone."
"Being eco-responsible means taking concrete action, year after year, to minimize the ecological footprint of our events," Evenko said in a statement in July, when the ban on straws was announced. The ban also applied to other summer festivals, including the ÎleSoniq electronic-music festival taking place at Parc Jean-Drapeau Friday and Saturday.
ShazamFest in the Eastern Townships is far smaller than Osheaga, but the festival is known for its efforts to minimize waste. The 13th edition drew nearly 2,000 people over four days in July and, after sorting, there were only 12 bags of garbage - not even 100 grams of garbage per person. Eight recycling bins were filled, and five compost bins.
"We don't create a lot of garbage," founder Ziv Przytyk said of the festival, which takes place on his organic family farm. "There is hardly any garbage anywhere."
But it was a process, he said. "You have to create a culture. It happens slowly.
"I talk about encouraging less waste. I tell people, 'Thank you for coming; please keep the place clean.'" There is free access to potable water, and people can bring their own bottles, he said. No water is sold at the festival. Actual plates are used, washed and reused - there are about 200, said Przytyk - and there are compostable cups.
Przytyk and his brother started to sort the garbage back in the third or fourth year of the festival. Today, there is a trash-sorting party after the festival ends, to separate the trash from what can be recycled and composted - and there's free beer and food for anyone who helps.
Most of what makes up the trash is non-recyclable food wrapping, Przytyk said. And the item recycled more than any other? Plastic water bottles. sschwartz@postmedia.com

Full text: 'Get moving' on wet shelters for Montreal's homeless, advocates demand( https://montrealgazette.com/news/homeless-advocates-call-on-city-to-get-moving-on-wet-shelter-plan )
The city of Montreal is working on a wet shelter feasibility study exploring best practices in cities that have wet shelters in place. And while advocates say it's important to get the project right, they worry the process - which began under the Denis Coderre administration in 2015 - is taking far too long.
Last April, the city released a preliminary report on wet shelters citing 17 studies on the subject. By and large, the research suggests having a safe, controlled environment for problem drinkers is an effective tool for harm reduction. Mayor Valérie Plante made a further commitment in March as part of a $7.8-million plan to fight homelessness( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-to-create-950-housing-units-for-homeless-people ).
The current feasibility study is being conducted with Old Brewery Mission, Accueil Bonneau and the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS) du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. It will be published in April.
"When I heard the study would be coming out in April, I thought, 'Really? Next April? That seems excessive,'" said Matthew Pearce, executive director of the Old Brewery Mission. "There are some complexities, in a legal context, I'm not blind to that. But we need to get moving on this."
Analysis: Liberals aim for longer election campaign to destabilize the CAQ( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/analysis-liberals-aim-for-longer-election-campaign-to-destabilize-the-caq )
The province's fixed date law was supposed to take the suspense out of elections and level the playing field between the parties. But a lesser understood clause of the law - one that allows wiggle room on the length of the actual campaign - has suddenly become a factor on the big political chessboard.
On Tuesday, Liberal insiders confirmed the party is seriously examining a possible early election launch - it could be as soon as Aug. 23 or the weekend of Aug. 25-26. Until now, the conventional thinking was that Premier Philippe Couillard would kick off the campaign Wednesday, Aug. 29, which would mean a 33-day campaign.
The Liberals have their reason for wanting a longer runway. For one thing, it would mean their rival François Legault, leader of the Coalition Avenir Québec, has to face the media more often to answer tricky policy questions. A long campaign means more opportunities for Legault - who is leading in the polls - to slip up.
Premier Philippe Couillard speaks with CAQ leader François Legault at the end of the spring session in 2015 at the legislature in Quebec City.
Liberals quietly killed Montreal General expansion in 2014: document( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/liberals-quietly-killed-montreal-general-expansion-in-2014-document )
Health Minister Gaétan Barrette was all smiles when he announced a $300-million expansion( https://montrealgazette.com/news/modernization-project-will-lift-montreal-general-out-of-dark-ages ) of the Montreal General Hospital more than a week ago - two months before the upcoming Oct. 1 provincial election. But two months after winning the last election in 2014, the Liberal government quietly killed a $380-million expansion of the same hospital that had already been approved years earlier, according to a government document obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
The Montreal General would have a new, enlarged emergency room by now if the government had stuck to its original plans. In the past decade, however, staff at the Montreal General have complained that the hospital has fallen into disrepair through neglect, and some fear the latest announcement might be nothing more than a shallow pre-electoral promise, given that a feasibility study must first be conducted before approving the expansion yet again.
Marie-Claude Lacasse, a ministry spokesperson, acknowledged that the government had previously decided not to invest in the Montreal General expansion, but she suggested that such a decision was made almost a decade earlier. "The government never authorized a major project at the Montreal General hospital before this year," Lacasse said.
Mount Royal pilot project 'having an impact on safety,' group says( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mount-royal-pilot-project-having-an-impact-on-safety-group-says )
Inadequate communication, bad planning and a lack of public transit have resulted in an overall loss of accessibility to Mount Royal, says a group charged with promoting and protecting the mountain.
"The presumption that eliminating cars will make the place safer - I don't think you can draw that conclusion, because it takes one bad driver or cyclist who doesn't observe safety rules," said Helene Panaioti, the director of communications, advocacy and community engagement for Les amis de la montagne. "This pilot project did not provide for road safety enhancement by any other means than by removing cars."
Since June, cars can drive up Camillien-Houde Way or Remembrance Rd. and park either at Beaver Lake or Smith House. They are not permitted to drive between the two parking lots, except when guided by security guards when one of those lots is full. Buses, pedestrians and cyclists can travel between the two sites. The ban is part of a pilot project the city has embarked on from June to October in an effort to improve safety at the site.
Panaioti said motorists disregard the signs that ban transiting traffic, even though police presence on the site has been beefed up. When the Montreal Gazette visited Mount Royal last Friday, 14 cars drove through the no-enter signs in the span of an hour, some driving by a police car with lights flashing to do so. Having cars driving through an area where they are not expected is dangerous, Panaioti added.
An almost empty Camillien-Houde Way is seen in an aerial view on July 19, 2018.
Hot summer gave Quebec farmers 'one of the worst seasons on record'( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-summer-gave-quebec-farmers-one-of-the-worst-seasons-on-record )
The June hay harvest at Marcel Groleau's dairy and cattle farm in Thetford Mines was 40 per cent smaller than usual due to a lack of rain, putting him in the rare and financially undesirable position of having to buy hay to feed his 350 cows. "Animals that are more fragile suffer in the heat, just as humans do," said Groleau, who is also president of the Union des producteurs agricoles, Quebec's farmers union, which represents 42,000 producers.
Quebec's hot, dry summer has plagued many of the province's farmers, particularly those who raise cattle, pigs, sheep and other animals who rely on hay, Groleau noted. Many reported hay harvests that were 60 or 70 per cent below average, forcing them to buy at high prices. Those without the financial liquidity to spend thousands on feed could be forced to stop production, and potentially go under, Groleau said. Roughly 80 per cent of farmers in the province are covered by crop insurance, but it remains to be seen if coverage will be sufficient. Growers of crops like cauliflower, broccoli, kale and romaine lettuce were hit hard as well, forcing food merchants to import the produce.
Strawberry and raspberry crops were relatively robust and above average in quality. But high temperatures caused them to ripen quickly, and with manpower shortages on many farms, much of the crop rotted before it could be harvested. Scorching temperatures kept many away from pick-your-own establishments.

Full text: Nearly three weeks after a blackout forced surgeons to use flashlights( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muhc-surgeons-forced-to-use-flashlights-during-blackout-sources ) during operations at the MUHC superhospital, authorities have completed their investigation and are now reviewing contingency plans in the event of another outage.
The private consortium in charge of maintaining the electrical system is also carrying out "corrective measures to our existing processes to prevent a similar situation from arising again." The consortium, led by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, did not specify the measures, beyond replacing a transfer switch.
Although only one out of 11 power generators failed during the blackout on the afternoon of July 23, the impact was disproportionate and wide-ranging, raising questions about the capacity of the backup systems. The most essential clinical areas of the three-year-old superhospital were affected, with all the ORs and the emergency room plunged into darkness for nearly an hour during a heat wave.
The MUHC also disclosed for the first time Friday - in response to questions by the Montreal Gazette - that in addition to surgery being disrupted when the generator failed to kick in, two radiotherapy machines also went down, delaying cancer treatment for some patients.
The Central Users Committee of the MUHC, representing patients and their families, has been cataloguing various power-shortage issues at the $1.3-billion superhospital in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce that opened in the spring of 2015.
"This was a major event that deserves our attention," said Pierre Hurteau, a longstanding member of the users committee.
Nicolas Ryan, a spokesperson for SNC-Lavalin, insisted that despite the generator failure, "the Glen site meets all applicable standards and codes, including its power distribution and backup system."
"The investigation is completed and it has confirmed the hypothesis that a faulty electrical component was responsible for the 51-minute power outage in some of the Glen site's sectors," he explained.
"A transfer switch did not function correctly, which led to one of 11 generators not starting. All transfer switches and generators were verified following this incident and all are now in good working order. We can also confirm that the generators have enough capacity to power all essential services at the facility."
"A thorough investigation into the incident resulted in our teams taking corrective measures to our existing processes to prevent a similar situation from arising again," Ryan added, without elaborating further.
Gilda Salomone, a public-relations official for the MUHC, issued a statement on Friday asserting that "all generator systems have since been verified and are again in ready mode. As with any such event, a risk analysis has been conducted and contingency plans are being reviewed."
Salomone was unable to provide details of the contingency plans, saying that's the responsibility of the consortium.
Salomone added that the blackout "affected two out of six linear accelerators used in radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients. Treatments resumed after power was restored, and no treatments were cancelled as a result."
She reiterated that Dr. Pierre Gfeller, the newly appointed executive director of the MUHC, oversaw the joint investigation, and is "working diligently with our partner ... to reduce the risk to zero of a similar event from occurring."
Electrical problems have hampered the Glen site since before it opened, starting with faulty wiring that had to be replaced in the ORs. In July 2016, a crow that was electrocuted on an electrical line indirectly caused a two-hour blackout, resulting in the cancellation of surgeries as the ventilation and other systems rebooted.
And during this summer's heat waves, staff in the cafeteria have resorted to placing cold, wet towels around their necks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/power-limitations-force-muhcs-glen-site-to-selectively-cut-off-central-air ) when the air conditioning was turned off on purpose because of power limitations. Staff have also reported headaches when the air exchanges are turned off for periods overnight.

Full text: The June hay harvest at Marcel Groleau's dairy and cattle farm in Thetford Mines was 40 per cent smaller than usual due to a lack of rain, putting him in the rare and financially undesirable position of having to buy hay to feed his 350 cows.
With dry conditions through June and July and higher gas prices inflating transportation costs, hay prices doubled in many regions of Quebec. Meanwhile, productivity declined as his overheated herds dozed more and ate less. Prolonged heat waves led to increased mortality rates on his farm.
"Animals that are more fragile suffer in the heat, just as humans do," said Groleau, who is also president of the Union des producteurs agricoles, Quebec's farmers union, which represents 42,000 producers. "Because of the heat we had starting early in June, we saw a lot of that effect. I think it was one of the worst seasons on record."
Quebec's hot, dry summer has plagued many of the province's farmers, particularly those who raise cattle, pigs, sheep and other animals who rely on hay, Groleau noted. Many reported hay harvests that were 60 or 70 per cent below average, forcing them to buy at high prices. Those without the financial liquidity to spend thousands on feed could be forced to stop production, and potentially go under, Groleau said. Roughly 80 per cent of farmers in the province are covered by crop insurance, but it remains to be seen if coverage will be sufficient. Growers of crops like cauliflower, broccoli, kale and romaine lettuce were hit hard as well, forcing food merchants to import the produce.
Strawberry and raspberry crops were relatively robust and above average in quality. But high temperatures caused them to ripen quickly, and with manpower shortages on many farms, much of the crop rotted before it could be harvested. Scorching temperatures kept many away from pick-your-own establishments.
At Quinn Farm on Île-Perrot, just off the western tip of the island of Montreal, the strawberry crop was strong, but attendance was not.
"The crowds weren't there, due to the extreme heat - they weren't coming out to pick," said farm general manager Gabrielle Dumas. "On Canada Day weekend, almost no one showed up. Normally we have thousands of people."
Much of the strawberry crop was sold instead at market, or made into jam.
Owner Phil Quinn estimated he had lost $100,000 in you-pick revenues by mid-July. The farm's 35-million-litre irrigation pond was nearly dried up, forcing owners to spend $50,000 on additional irrigation infrastructure, including a new well. The farm had to irrigate apple orchards it had never had to water since the farm opened in the 1980s.
Environment Canada said July was the hottest recorded in Montreal in 97 years, but not the driest. The island received 97 millimetres of rain, which is eight millimetres above average. Most of it fell within the space of three days.
The Montreal and southern Quebec regions fared relatively well compared to the hardest-hit spots in the north and eastern areas of the province. The regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean and Abitibi were the most affected by drought.
Things have improved since July, with more rainfall in August. Corn crops are looking full, although there is worry that ears may be smaller than usual.
The farmers union is in talks with the provincial government to ensure hard-hit farmers will receive financial compensation.
"We are well aware of the difficulties agricultural producers are experiencing due to dry conditions," said Christine Harvey, press attaché for Agriculture Minister Laurent Lessard. "We are therefore working actively with the Financière agricole (the Quebec body that organizes insurance and financial aid for farmers) to intervene rapidly with programs already in place, notably crop insurance."
Quebec's growing season for vegetables and fruits has lengthened by 20 days a year since the 1970s due to global warming, noted Groleau, and extended the growing territory of some crops like corn all the way northward to Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.
At Quinn Farm, Dumas said the blueberry crop is looking strong and is ready for picking, as is sweet corn. In a sign of the summer's imminent demise, apple picking begins on Aug. 18.

Full text: The June hay harvest at Marcel Groleau's dairy and cattle farm in Thetford Mines was 40 per cent smaller than usual due to a lack of rain, putting him in the rare and financially undesirable position of having to buy hay to feed his 350 cows.
With dry conditions through June and July and higher gas prices inflating transportation costs, hay prices doubled in many regions of Quebec. Meanwhile, productivity declined as his overheated herds dozed more and ate less. Prolonged heat waves led to increased mortality rates on his farm.
"Animals that are more fragile suffer in the heat, just as humans do," said Groleau, who is also president of the Union des producteurs agricoles, Quebec's farmers union, which represents 42,000 producers. "Because of the heat we had starting early in June, we saw a lot of that effect. I think it was one of the worst seasons on record."
Quebec's hot, dry summer has plagued many of the province's farmers, particularly those who raise cattle, pigs, sheep and other animals who rely on hay, Groleau noted. Many reported hay harvests that were 60 or 70 per cent below average, forcing them to buy at high prices. Those without the financial liquidity to spend thousands on feed could be forced to stop production, and potentially go under, Groleau said. Roughly 80 per cent of farmers in the province are covered by crop insurance, but it remains to be seen if coverage will be sufficient. Growers of crops like cauliflower, broccoli, kale and romaine lettuce were hit hard as well, forcing food merchants to import the produce.
Strawberry and raspberry crops were relatively robust and above average in quality. But high temperatures caused them to ripen quickly, and with manpower shortages on many farms, much of the crop rotted before it could be harvested. Scorching temperatures kept many away from pick-your-own establishments.
At Quinn Farm on Île-Perrot, just off the western tip of the island of Montreal, the strawberry crop was strong, but attendance was not.
"The crowds weren't there, due to the extreme heat - they weren't coming out to pick," said farm general manager Gabrielle Dumas. "On Canada Day weekend, almost no one showed up. Normally we have thousands of people."
Much of the strawberry crop was sold instead at market, or made into jam.
Owner Phil Quinn estimated he had lost $100,000 in you-pick revenues by mid-July. The farm's 35-million-litre irrigation pond was nearly dried up, forcing owners to spend $50,000 on additional irrigation infrastructure, including a new well. The farm had to irrigate apple orchards it had never had to water since the farm opened in the 1980s.
Environment Canada said July was the hottest recorded in Montreal in 97 years, but not the driest. The island received 97 millimetres of rain, which is eight millimetres above average. Most of it fell within the space of three days.
The Montreal and southern Quebec regions fared relatively well compared to the hardest-hit spots in the north and eastern areas of the province. The regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean and Abitibi were the most affected by drought.
Things have improved since July, with more rainfall in August. Corn crops are looking full, although there is worry that ears may be smaller than usual.
The farmers union is in talks with the provincial government to ensure hard-hit farmers will receive financial compensation.
"We are well aware of the difficulties agricultural producers are experiencing due to dry conditions," said Christine Harvey, press attaché for Agriculture Minister Laurent Lessard. "We are therefore working actively with the Financière agricole (the Quebec body that organizes insurance and financial aid for farmers) to intervene rapidly with programs already in place, notably crop insurance."
Quebec's growing season for vegetables and fruits has lengthened by 20 days a year since the 1970s due to global warming, noted Groleau, and extended the growing territory of some crops like corn all the way northward to Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.
At Quinn Farm, Dumas said the blueberry crop is looking strong and is ready for picking, as is sweet corn. In a sign of the summer's imminent demise, apple picking begins on Aug. 18.

Full text: It has been seriously hot for much of the summer, with no fewer than five heat waves. And that means we should be looking out for neighbours who are elderly and isolated.
That's the word this week from the Réseau québécois de villes et villages en santé( http://www.rqvvs.qc.ca/ ) (RQVVS), a not-for-profit organization which implemented the Voisins solidaires( http://voisinssolidaires.ca ) movement in Quebec. The movement is modelled on one created in France after thousands of citizens, many of them isolated and elderly, died in the wake of extreme temperatures.
"It starts by knowing who our neighbours are, by being present," said RQVVS director Chloé Dodinot. Call or knock on their door. Often, they don't go out when it is hot, so offer to run errands or walk their dog. Ask what you can do to help them.
Among suggestions from the RQVVS and Voisins solidaires:
Drink six to eight glasses of water or the equivalent, and eat even if you're not hungry. (Salads and cold soups are good sources of water and electrolytes.)
Stay out of the sun, and don't do too much - seek out air-conditioned spaces like cinemas or shopping centres.
Avoid outings between noon and 4 p.m., and walk in the shade when you do go out. Carry water.
Keep the home cool by closing curtains or lowering blinds during the day. Use ceiling fans to circulate the air, and dim the lights.
Take a cool shower or bath.
Wear lightweight clothing. (Older people can sometimes be overly cautious and stay too covered up.)
The goal of Voisins solidaires is to encourage neighbours to connect, to break the isolation of those who are alone and lonely, and to create neighbourhoods in which residents feel a sense of belonging and mutual support.
Those who stand to benefit most are the recently arrived, young families and especially the elderly, 15 per cent of whom live in a state of social isolation, according to the RQVVS. More than 85 per cent of Quebec's population in 225 municipalities belongs to the organization, launched in 1988.
Looking out for your neighbours helps everyone, said Dodinot of RQVVS. Certainly it helps the neighbours, "but it's not a one-way street," she said. An older neighbour can help out, too, by looking after young children while a parent runs an errand, for instance.
Asking how your neighbours are doing, making sure they're hydrated and staying cool, "these are small gestures which can save lives," said Marie-Claude Savard, a Quebec television personality and spokesperson for Voisin solidaires.

Full text: The Montreal area could experience heavy downpours and thunderstorms in the late afternoon or evening, according to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ).
The national meteorological agency warned that since the storms are moving slowly, significant amounts of rain could fall locally. Flash floods and ponding - when giant pools of water form - could happen on roads as commuters make their way home.
The statement was issued for the Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil regions.

Osheaga fan appalled by plastic bottles littering festival grounds

Author: Schwartz, Susan

Full text: Osheaga( https://www.osheaga.com/en/info ) enthusiast Juliana Yang was heartened to learn that plastic drinking straws would not be allowed at the 2018 edition of the music festival. "A step in the right direction," the Montrealer called it.
And she was pleased to hear of other green initiatives announced in July by concert promoter Evenko( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/osheaga-bans-plastic-straws-other-evenko-music-fests-to-follow-lead ) - among them the presence of a tanker truck to supply the festival with free drinking water, to reduce the use of individual bottles and encourage the use of reusable containers. The initiative was undertaken with the National Bank.
But Yang was disappointed to see "disturbing amounts of plastic water bottles and cups" littering the grounds at Parc Jean-Drapeau during last weekend's festival. The 20-year-old University of Edinburgh architecture student photographed the scene on Sunday, the final day of the three-day festival, and sent an image to the Montreal Gazette.
The culprit was the heat, said Philip Vanden Brande, Evenko's manager of public and media relations.
When organizers learned that an extreme heat warning would be in effect last weekend, it was decided that the security team would undertake a mass distribution of bottles of water, he said. "Because it was so hot, we did give away a lot of bottles.
"What's important to remember is that the security and safety of festival-goers is Evenko's priority. At the end of the day, we will do what we have to to keep people safe."
It was Yang's third year at Osheaga, "and I have never stepped on water bottles every two steps the way I did this year," she said in an interview Tuesday.
It was particularly disappointing to see "such an appalling amount of plastic" in light of the fact that organizers had promoted their efforts to be more eco-friendly, she said. "People walking around were commenting, 'There are a lot of water bottles.' "
Yang said the five water stations in place were awkwardly located and difficult to access, and that they often had long lineups. With 45,000 concertgoers per day, more water stations were needed - even without a heat wave, she said.
Vanden Brande acknowledged the lineups, but said "a lot had to do with the weather."
As in prior years, food vendors at Osheaga were required to use compostable containers, cups and utensils, and some offered eco-cups for which concertgoers paid a refundable deposit, he said. As well, some eco-friendly bottles were distributed for use at the filling stations, he added.
As in the past, waste sorting centres to encourage recycling and composting were in place, and "it is definitely something we want to increase."
Although festival co-ordinators were "extremely pleased" with eco-conscious efforts to date, "we always want to get better," Vanden Brande said.
"Festival-goers have a responsibility, too," he said. "There were 45,000 people a day on the grounds. We do a lot with garbage and recycling bins and composting, but I do think it is an effort for everyone to make - concertgoers, concessions, everyone."
"Being eco-responsible means taking concrete action, year after year, to minimize the ecological footprint of our events," Evenko said in a statement in July, when the ban on straws was announced. The ban also applied to other summer festivals, including the ÎleSoniq( https://www.ilesoniq.com/en ) electronic-music festival taking place at Parc Jean-Drapeau Friday and Saturday.
Just 12 bags of garbage were generated during ShazamFest in the Eastern Townships in July. Close to 2,000 people attended the four-day festival. Seen here is Francesca Yeats, a student employee.
ShazamFest( http://www.shazamfest.com ) in the Eastern Townships is far smaller than Osheaga, but the festival is known for its efforts to minimize waste. The 13th edition drew nearly 2,000 people over four days in July and, after sorting, there were only 12 bags of garbage - not even 100 grams of garbage per person. Eight recycling bins were filled, and five compost bins.
"We don't create a lot of garbage," founder Ziv Przytyk said of the festival, which takes place on his organic family farm. "There is hardly any garbage anywhere."
But it was a process, he said. "You have to create a culture. It happens slowly.
"I talk about encouraging less waste. I tell people, 'Thank you for coming; please keep the place clean.' "
There is free access to potable water, and people can bring their own bottles, he said. No water is sold at the festival. Actual plates are used, washed and reused - there are about 200, said Przytyk - and there are compostable cups.
Przytyk and his brother started to sort the garbage back in the third or fourth year of the festival. Today there is a trash-sorting party after the festival ends, to separate the trash from what can be recycled and composted - and there's free beer and food for anyone who helps.
Most of what makes up the trash is non-recyclable food wrapping, Przytyk said. And the item recycled more than any other? Plastic water bottles.

Full text: Environment Canada maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area Monday, and added a severe thunderstorm watch in the early afternoon.
The federal agency had predicted daytime highs near 30 C and humidex values( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ) near 40 C - it reached those temperatures by noon Monday.
It warned storms could blow in with gusts, large hail and heavy rain in the afternoon and evening. The storm watch covered Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil and came with the agency's standard message: "When thunder roars, go indoors!"
Environment Canada's public weather alerts page( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/index_e.html ) showed heat, storm and air-quality warnings covering quite a bit of the country.

Full text: With an average temperature of 24.2 degrees Celsius, Montreal just completed its warmest July since 1921( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-damn-july-was-one-of-hottest-on-record-in-montreal ).
While the heat wave of 2018 might harken back to that summer, a lot has changed in the intervening decades.
Let's revisit that summer, shall we?
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, Médric Martin was the city's mayor.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the city had a population of 618,506.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, red and white had still not been declared Canada's colours.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the city looked like this:
Montreal as seen from Île Ste-Hélène in 1921.
St-François Xavier St. looking south from what is now St-Antoine St. in 1921.
Mind you, the last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the Habs had just missed the playoffs. Clearly, the key to a comfortable summer is a good hockey team.

Hot damn! July one of hottest on record

Full text: This July was the hottest the island of Montreal has experienced in nearly 100 years.
The month's average temperature of 24.2 C fell just half a degree shy of the all-time high of 24.7 C, recorded 97 years ago in 1921.
"It's not a record-breaking month, but it's close to the maximum ever recorded in Montreal," said Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault. "We can definitely say we're in the Top 3 in the Montreal area."
The 2018 average is also three degrees above the mean July temperature of 21.2 C.
From day to day, a three-degree increase might not seem like a lot, but over a month, Legault said, it makes a difference. He explained that means monthly temperatures tend to vary by one degree year to year, so a difference of three degrees is "way (above) normal for a month-long period."
Dominique Paquin, a climate simulation and analysis specialist with research consortium Ouranos, said it's too early to definitively attribute the waves of extreme heat that spread across the northern hemisphere in July to climate change, "but we know that with climate change, the number of days with extreme heat will increase."
"We can't formally attribute it to climate change based on statistics," she said, "but it's clear that it gives us a look at what will become the norm."
In efforts to mitigate the effects of extreme heat, Paquin said new regulations are being implemented across Quebec to combat heat islands, which are described by the city of Montreal as spaces that absorb and store heat, including parking lots and flat rooftops. Increased green spaces and green infrastructure are crucial, she said.
And that is not lost on the city.
In its 2015-2020 Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Agglomeration of Montreal, the city said that heat islands cover 28 per cent of the island, making it particularly susceptible to extreme heat.
One measure the city hopes to implement as part of the action plan is a regulation that dictates the ratio of green to built spaces in the city. How the plan has progressed since it was announced in 2015 is unclear.
While it's too early to predict what August will be like as a whole, Legault said it is shaping up to be around the norm - despite starting with a short hot spell this weekend. Unlike the early-July extreme heat that is reported to have caused the deaths of 54 Montrealers, Legault expects the upcoming heat wave to be "normal," with temperatures at or slightly above 30 C and with milder humidity.
The level of humidity and how long the high temperatures last are the biggest differences between normal and extreme heat waves, Legault explained. We also tend to become acclimated to new norms, he said, so while it will be hot, it might not feel as bad compared to what July put us through.

In efforts to mitigate the effects of extreme heat, Paquin said new regulations are being implemented across Quebec to combat heat islands, which are described by the city of Montreal as spaces that absorb and store heat, including parking lots and flat rooftops. Increased green spaces and green infrastructure are crucial, she said.
And that is not lost on the city of Montreal. In its 2015-2020 Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Agglomeration of Montreal, the city said that heat islands cover 28 per cent of the island, making it particularly susceptible to extreme heat. One measure the city hopes to implement as a part of the action plan is a regulation that dictates the ratio of green to built spaces in the city. How the plan has progressed since it was announced in 2015( https://montrealgazette.com/news/the-city-of-montreal-unveils-its-climate-change-action-plan?video_autoplay=true ) is unclear.
While it's too early to predict what August will be like as a whole, Legault said it is shaping up to be around the norm - despite starting with a short hot spell this weekend. Unlike theearly-July extreme heat that is reported to have caused the deaths of 54 Montrealers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends ), Legault expects the upcoming heat wave to be "normal," with temperatures at or slightly above 30 C and with milder humidity.
The level of humidity and how long the high temperatures last are the biggest differences between normal and extreme heat waves, Legault explained. We also tend to become acclimated to new norms, he said, so while it will be hot, it might not feel as bad compared to what July put us through.

Full text: Busy Thursday? Here's the day's news.
The Quebec government will block the province's association of dental surgeons from pulling out of the public health-care system( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-dentists-prepare-to-leave-public-health-care-system ). Health Minister Gaétan Barrette made the announcement in Montreal Thursday afternoon. Earlier in the day, the dental-surgeons association officially filed the paperwork to withdraw 2,000 of its members from the public health-care system. The notices were delivered to the offices of the Régie de l'assurance-maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and Premier Philippe Couillard. The withdrawal would take effect in 30 days. On Tuesday, the association asked Couillardto intervene in negotiations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/quebec-dentists-threaten-to-leave-public-system-due-to-tense-contract-negotiations/wcm/4f3b0bd3-4d31-4c2b-a8b0-67b8c1d4b0c9 ) with the government, contending that the talks with Barrette are taking place in a climate of threats and intimidation. The agreement between the association and Quebec expired in April 2015. A large-scale withdrawal of dentists from the public system would affect about 620,000 people, depriving them of free dental care except in case of emergency. The association argues it has done its part in making compromises and accuses Barrette of trying to impose a cut in compensation to its members, whose average annual income is about $180,000.
Authorities are investigating after operating rooms at the MUHC superhospital were plunged into darkness( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/power-limitations-force-muhcs-glen-site-to-selectively-cut-off-central-air ). Apart from potential issues with at least one backup generator, there are limitations to the power at the MUHC's Glen site in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Montreal Gazette has learned. During a heat wave, the Glen site cuts off the air conditioning on purpose in the cafeteria and atrium to keep the clinical areas cool. During record-breaking temperatures this month, cafeteria workers have resorted to placing wet towels around their necks to cope with the stifling heat. Julia Asselstine, assistant director of communications and engagement at the MUHC, explained the rationale behind cutting off the air conditioning in the packed cafeteria used by employees, patients and their families. "In the event that the chilled water temperature gets too hot inside clinical areas, there is a predetermined sequence of load shedding that is automatically engaged by the building control system," Asselstine said in an emailed statement.
Electrical problems have bedevilled the Glen site since even before it opened, starting with faulty wiring that needed to be replaced in the ORs. In July 2016, a crow that was electrocuted on a power line in Hampstead indirectly caused a two-hour blackout at the $1.3-billion superhospital, resulting in the cancellation of surgeries as the ventilation and other systems rebooted. That same month, a power flicker lasting only a few milliseconds was enough to trigger the rebooting of the same systems, leading to an internal review to prevent similar problems in the future. Last month, in an incident reminiscent of the electrocuted crow, a squirrel that accidentally touched two wires( https://montrealgazette.com/news/unlucky-squirrel-caused-power-outage-muhc-network-failure ) in a circuit breaker box on de Maisonneuve Blvd. knocked out six servers in the Glen site's computer centre, which in turn caused a network failure for 45 minutes. The Glen site, like all hospitals in Montreal, has backup generators that are supposed to kick in during blackouts. On Monday, a gas leak just north of the superhospital on Girouard and Monkland Aves. forced Hydro-Québec to cut power for 8,000 customers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-quebec-crew-deployed-as-power-failure-hits-muhc ) in the area. However, one of the Glen site's 11 backup generators failed to activate, cutting off power to several adult clinical areas, ORs and the emergency room for 51 minutes.
Quebec, a new report suggests, has lost hundreds of thousands of young people to other provinces in the past 35 years( https://montrealgazette.com/business/quebec-losing-young-people-to-interprovincial-migration-report-shows ). Between 1981 and 2017, Quebec lost 229,700 people below the age of 45 to interprovincial migration, according to a new report published by the Montreal Economic Institute. While the number of people under 45 increased in Quebec between 2010 and 2017, the province is still losing people to interprovincial migration, and report author Marcel Boyer warns that if things don't change, "we're going to face significant social problems later on." The report comes as employers in Quebec increasingly say they're facing a shortage of workers. "There is a major problem here. We're not addressing it sufficiently," he said. Between 1981 and 2010, the number of people under 15 in Quebec decreased by 177,300, a 12.6-per-cent decline, according to Boyer's analysis of Statistics Canada data. During that same period, the number of people under 15 in Ontario increased by 309,000, a 16.2-per-cent increase.
Robert Lepage's upcoming play Kanata has been cancelled( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepages-controversial-play-about-indigenous-people-kanata-has-been-cancelled ). The announcement comes in the wake of a meeting last Thursday between Robert Lepage, Ariane Mnouchkine and the signatories of an open letter published July 14 in Le Devoir. Kanata looks at Canadian Indigenous history, including the residential school system and missing and murdered Indigenous women( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women ). However, the production has come under fire for a lack of First Nations' input in the play as well as the decision not to feature Indigenous actors. This latest controversy came hard on the heels of Lepage's now-cancelled production of SLAV( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ), which included songs created by black slaves performed by a mostly white cast. A statement issued Thursday morning by Ex Machina, Lepage's theatre company, noted that "the infinitely complex and often aggressive controversy surrounding (Kanata) has in the meantime reached the North American co-producers that were interested in it, and certain ones have now announced their withdrawal." It adds: "Considering what we recently went through, we certainly understand their concerns. But without their financial support, we are unable to finish creating Kanata with Théâtre du Soleil. Therefore, we are putting an end to the project."

Between 1981 and 2017, Quebec lost 229,700 people below the age of 45 to interprovincial migration, according to a new report published by the Montreal Economic Institute.
While the number of people under 45 increased in Quebec between 2010 and 2017, the province is still losing people to interprovincial migration, and Boyer warns that if things don't change, "we're going to face significant social problems later on."
The report comes as employers in Quebec increasingly say they're facing a shortage of workers.
"There is a major problem here. We're not addressing it sufficiently," he said.
Between 1981 and 2010, the number of people under 15 in Quebec decreased by 177,300, a 12.6-per-cent decline, according to Boyer's analysis of Statistics Canada data.
During that period, the number of people under 15 in Ontario increased by 309,000, a 16.2-per-cent increase.
The soccer ball Putin gave Trump has a chip that transmits to phones( https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/the-soccer-ball-that-putin-gave-to-trump-has-a-chip-inside-that-transmits-to-nearby-phones/wcm/d82b5502-5f2c-4284-ae09-9d10f7bfc49c )
Russian President Vladimir Putin's gift of a soccer ball to U.S. President Donald Trump last week set off a chorus of warnings - some of them only half in jest - that the World Cup souvenir could be bugged. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina even tweeted, "I'd check the soccer ball for listening devices and never allow it in the White House."
It turns out they weren't entirely wrong. Markings on the ball indicate that it contained a chip with a tiny antenna that transmits to nearby phones.
But rather than a spy device, the chip is an advertised feature of the Adidas AG ball. Photographs from the news conference in Helsinki, where Putin handed the ball to Trump, show it bore a logo for a near-field communication tag. During manufacturing, the NFC chip is placed inside the ball under that logo, which resembles the icon for a WiFi signal, according to the Adidas website.
Adidas declined to comment on whether the chip could be a vector of a Russian hack. There is no suggestion that such balls or their chips have any security vulnerabilities. The chip itself can't be modified, according to the product description on the Adidas website. "It is not possible to delete or rewrite the encoded parameters," it says.
While the logo on the ball advertised the presence of the chip, it couldn't be determined from the photos whether the chip might have been removed, replaced with actual spy gear, or, even more remotely, whether the entire ball itself was fabricated for the event and only resembled the Adidas model in question.
"The security screening process that is done for all gifts was done for the soccer ball," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in an email. "We are not going to comment further on security procedures." The White House declined to say whether any modifications to the ball had been identified or where the ball would be kept going forward.
Power limitations force MUHC's Glen site to selectively cut off central air( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/power-limitations-force-muhcs-glen-site-to-selectively-cut-off-central-air )
A faulty backup generator at the superhospital of the McGill University Health Centre that plunged the operating rooms into darkness for nearly one hour Monday has prompted authorities to launch an investigation into possible causes.
But apart from potential issues with at least one generator, there are limitations to the power at the MUHC's Glen site in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Montreal Gazette has learned. During a heat wave, the Glen site cuts off the air conditioning on purpose in the cafeteria and atrium to keep the clinical areas cool.
During record-breaking temperatures this month, cafeteria workers have resorted to placing wet towels around their necks to cope with the stifling heat. When the superhospital opened in 2015, MUHC officials boasted of the state-of-the-art facilities that included central air conditioning.

"In the event that the chilled water temperature gets too hot inside clinical areas, there is a predetermined sequence of load shedding that is automatically engaged by the building control system," Asselstine said in an emailed statement.
"The cafeteria/atrium ventilation system is among the systems that are temporarily stopped so that the temperatures in the more critical spaces of the Glen can be rapidly lowered."

"We can assert that one of the 11 generators did not function properly," the MUHC said in a statement. "Current hypotheses point to a faulty electrical component coupled with a possible human error in the building control room. All generator systems were verified Monday afternoon and are again in ready mode."
"The MUHC considers the 51-minute power outage a serious event and is working diligently with its partner GISM (Groupe immobilier de santé McGill) to significantly reduce the risk of a similar event from occurring," the statement added.
GISM is the private consortium, led by engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, that designed and built the superhospital. It's also responsible for the maintenance for the next 30 years.
Nicolas Ryan, a spokesperson for both SNC-Lavalin and the consortium, attributed Monday's blackout to a faulty electrical component in one of the generators and did not mention possible human error.
"The generators provide enough power to maintain all essential services," he said.
Asked why some parts of the Glen site were deprived of air conditioning this month, Ryan confirmed Asselstine's explanation. "The temperatures never exceeded the applicable standards in any part of the hospital during the heat wave," Ryan added.
The blackout on Monday resulted in some patients experiencing delays or having "their care plans modified." MUHC officials did not elaborate on whether some surgeries might have been cancelled.
Both the MUHC and GISM are now conducting a "full analysis" of potential generator problems.
Asselstine explained that during a blackout, the backup generators are "restricted to maintaining essential services only" and "there is reduced cooling/heating and dehumidification capacity." Some equipment, including medical imaging, remains idle during blackouts, she added.
During this summer's heat waves, some older hospitals - like Sacré-Coeur in north-end Montreal - have run into problems with air conditioning, with temperatures in some rooms reaching as high as 32 C. But poor air conditioning has reported to be much less of a problem or non-existent in newer facilities. aderfel@postmedia.com twitter.com/Aaron_Derfel

But poor air conditioning has reported to be much less of a problem or non-existent in newer facilities.

Full text: Montreal might be catching a break - even if just for a day.
A heat warning issued by Environment Canada was set to be removed Tuesday evening as Wednesday's temperatures were forecasted to drop below 33 C, the base temperature for what the agency considers to be extreme heat.
Warmer weather is set to move back into the city on Thursday, but Jean-Philippe Begin, meteorologist with Environment Canada, said that while the temperatures will approach the extreme-heat level, they won't be as bad as they were on Monday and Tuesday.
A heat warning from Environment Canada had said the "warm and humid air mass covering southern Quebec ... will persist through Wednesday evening. The temperatures combined with the humidity will produce humidex values of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius.
Moreover, minimum temperatures will remain above 20 degrees overnight (Tuesday)."
The warning noted that the excessive heat represents potential health risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
David Kaiser, a physician with Santé Montréal, said the city's public health agencies go into what they call "active watch" mode when Environment Canada issues a heat warning. Current weather conditions do not meet the city's threshold for a heat wave, but the public health department is still issuing messages about prevention and reviewing health data daily to make sure they don't see abnormal rates of hospital visits, deaths and other indicators.
"It's a little stepped up from a regular summer day, but because we don't expect, from a publichealth perspective, that there are going to be population-level impacts, we're not in intervention phase," Kaiser said.
An intervention phase involves first responders and health professionals knocking on people's doors to check on them and moving people to air-conditioned facilities, among other measures.
The city of Montreal goes into the intervention phase when there are at least three consecutive days of 33 C or more during the day, and the temperature doesn't go below 20 C at night, Kaiser said.
The most important thing Montrealers can do is check on vulnerable neighbours and members of their community, Kaiser said. Elderly people and people with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of suffering from the heat, becoming dehydrated and ending up in hospital and possibly dying.
"The way to protect those people on all of the hot days in the summer is really social solidarity. It's making sure that those people have someone who checks on them, if they're not mobile, if they have difficulty getting around, that there's somebody who can help them," Kaiser said, adding that even offering cold towels or helping people spend some time in a cool place can make a difference.

Full text: There may be little in the way of sunshine in the forecast for Wednesday, but Montrealers will still be feeling the heat.
Environment Canada reinstated a heat warning for the Montreal area early Tuesday, noting that the "warm and humid air mass covering southern Quebec today will persist through Wednesday evening. The temperatures combined with the humidity will produce humidex values of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius. Moreover, minimum temperatures will remain above 20 degrees overnight (Tuesday)."
The warning notes that the excessive heat represents potential health risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
While the weather will remain hot and humid until the weekend, Jean-Philippe Begin, meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the agency will probably remove the heat warning after Tuesday evening, as Wednesday's forecast is below the 33 C criteria.
"(The temperatures) will be close, but not as bad," he said of the rest of the week's forecast.
David Kaiser, a physician with Santé Montréal, said the city's public health agencies go into what they call "active watch" mode when Environment Canada issues a heat warning. Current weather conditions do not meet the city's threshold for a heat wave, but the public health department is still issuing messages about prevention and reviewing health data daily to make sure they don't see abnormal rates of hospital visits, deaths and other indicators.

The city of Montreal is in the intervention phase when there are at least three consecutive days of 33 C or more during the day and the temperature doesn't go below 20 C at night, Kaiser said.
The most important thing Montrealers can do during heat like this week's, Kaiser said, is check on vulnerable neighbours and members of their community. Elderly people and people with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of suffering from the heat, becoming dehydrated and ending up in hospital and possibly dying.
"The way to protect those people on all of the hot days in the summer is really social solidarity.

The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and the risk of a thunderstorm in the evening and a high of 28 C with a humidex of 36 C.

The humidex: Canadians didn't invent humidity, but we labeled it

Author: Juhl, Hayley

Full text: If engineer and inventor Willis Carrier was the Thomas Edison of air-conditioning, then J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson were the Archimedes of the humidex.
Although Canadians had coined the term "humidex" in 1965, Masterton and Richardson were the Atmospheric Environment Service scientists who created the formula for it in 1979. The service has since morphed into Environment Canada, but the formulation remains essentially the same, producing a "scale of discomfort" that Canadians cling to with frustration and pride - as we do with the wind chill factor on the flip side of the calendar.
High humidex readings are rare outside southern Quebec, Ontario and parts of Manitoba because the weather systems that impregnate the air with moisture are generally part of systems that arrive via the Caribbean or Mexico. The highest recorded humidex reading was in Carman, Man., on July 25, 2007. With the humidity, it hit 53 degrees Celsius.
We perceive the temperature to be higher than it is when there's so much moisture in the air that our sweat doesn't evaporate quickly, leaving our bodies slick and sticky.
What if you're an optimist who'd rather use the wind-chill factor? That's not something meteorologists do when the temperature is above 5 C, but for argument's sake: Montreal is expected to hit a high of 28 C on Tuesday, with a humidex of 33 and wind gusts up to 39 km/hr. Add in the wind chill (subtract the wind chill?) and it'll feel more like ... 32 C or so.
Hair grows up to three per cent faster in high humidity. But it can also give you the frizzies.
Good hair day?
Hair grows up to three per cent faster in high humidity, according to an Environment Canada brochure from the mid-1990s that also uses the word "frizzies" to describe what can happen to curly hair in moist air, and notes that those with straight hair might find it even more limp than usual.
"Hair is such a reliable indicator of good or bad weather, in fact, that it is the primary element of the hair hygrometer, an instrument that was used for years to measure humidity," says the Environment Canada brochure. "Invented in 1783, it was used until more sophisticated technology was developed in the 1960s. For its time, it was a very accurate humidity-measuring device, although not in widespread meteorological use today."
Here's what the humidex numbers mean
Less than 29 C: No discomfort
30 to 39 C: Some discomfort
40 to 45 C: Great discomfort; avoid exertion
Above 45 C: Dangerous
Above 54 C: Heat stroke imminent
If you'd rather calculate it on your own, you can click here( https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Functions/Heat_stress/heat_humidex.shtml ) for the formula.
The dog-star days of summer
The dog days of summer are probably not exactly what you think. Colloquially used to describe the most sizzling, sweltering part of summer, the dog days are actually named for a star. Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is the nose of the constellation Canis Major, Orion's dog.
It's most visible in the northern hemisphere in the wintertime, according to Space.com. However, it rises with the sun from July 3 to Aug. 11, making those - more or less - the dog days of summer. You can try to catch a glimpse of it this week when it rises just after 5:30 a.m. or sets around 8:30 p.m. You can install the open-source program Stellarium( http://www.stellarium.org/ ) on your mobile device for help finding Sirius or any other celestial body.
Orion's belt points to the star Sirius, which is the tip of his dog's nose.

Full text: Forecasting that the humidex value is expected to reach 40 C, Environment Canada extended its heat warning for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Châteauguay-La Prairie through to Wednesday evening.
In the warning, issued Monday morning, the federal agency noted that a "warm and humid air mass from the United States will track into southern Quebec today. High temperatures combined with humidity will produce humidex values hovering around 40," adding that "uncomfortable conditions will be particularly felt in these areas."
The high Monday was expected to be 31 C, feeling like 40 when combined with the humidity. There was a 40 per cent chance of showers through the evening. The temperature was not expected go below 20 C overnight - a criteria for a heat warning, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Steve Boily.
Although the current forecast predicts similar temperatures for Thursday night, Boily said he doesn't anticipate the weather warning will extend past Wednesday evening.
Boily explained that Montrealers are feeling the residual effects of thunderstorms in the Gulf of Mexico and around the Florida peninsula. He said the warm weather is blowing in from the south and southeast, bringing with it clouds and humidity.
There is also a chance of showers overnight Tuesday to Wednesday, Boily said.
Extreme heat can present risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.
Youssef Amane, a spokesperson for the city's executive committee, said officials will be watching forecasts closely for the next few days but do not intend to issue an alert or an intervention for extreme heat.
The average predicted temperatures are not expected to be as high as the heat wave this month when more than 50 heat-related deaths were recorded in Quebec.

Full text: There may be little in the way of sunshine in the forecast for the next 48 hours, but Montrealers will still be feeling the heat.
Environment Canada reinstated a heat warning for the Montreal area early Tuesday, noting that the "warm and humid airmass covering Southern Quebec today will persist through Wednesday evening. The temperatures combined with the humidity will produce humidex values of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius. Moreover, minimum temperatures will remain above 20 degrees overnight tonight."
The warning notes that the excessive heat represents potential health risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
The forecast for Tuesday calls for showers and the risk of a thunderstorm in the evening and a high of 28 C with a humidex of 36 C.

Heat-wave death toll for Montreal reaches 53

Full text: Fifty-three deaths in Montreal were potentially caused by the record-breaking heat wave that took over the city in early July, says a new report by the public-health department released Wednesday. But that number could continue to rise.
The total presented in the department's preliminary report does not include deaths that occurred in hospitals, only those that occurred within the community from June 30 to July 8, said Dr. David Kaiser, a physician with Santé Montréal. They still have to go through hospital records to determine which deaths may have been heat-related.
He expects that most cases will be of people who were brought to hospitals after being exposed to the heat and died shortly after. More than 5,400 people were taken to hospitals by ambulance throughout the heat wave, says the public health department's report. At the time, Urgences-Santé reported that the number of calls they received was up 30 per cent.
Kaiser said he doesn't expect the death toll to increase substantially. After the 2010 heat wave, which saw temperatures of more than 35 C for five days, he said only 15 per cent of the 106 deaths occurred in hospitals.
Overall, Kaiser said, Montreal saw 10 to 15 more deaths per day during the recent heat wave. As of July 9, another 34 deaths were reported elsewhere in Quebec. The province's Ministry of Health and Social Services said a final province-wide death toll will be released in the fall.
The report says three-quarters of people who died lived alone and that a significant portion of the deaths were related to drug and alcohol consumption. It also says that vulnerable populations were hit the hardest, and recommends that the public-health department collaborate with community groups to protect these individuals as heat waves become more common.
Kaiser said the department looks for three elements to determine whether a death was heat-related. First, he said, they look for underlying medical conditions, both physical and mental, or whether the person had a history of drug or alcohol abuse.
The next indicator would be the environment the person was found in, which Kaiser said was most often apartments without air conditioning located in hotter areas of the city. kelitwin@postmedia.com

SAQ stores reopen, but more strike days planned if negotiations stall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/saq-stores-reopen-but-more-strike-days-planned-if-negotiations-stall )
Société des alcools du Québec stores are open again Wednesday after unionized store workers went on strike Tuesday.
Simon Desjardins, an SAQ worker and union representative, said Tuesday's strike showed the employer the union was serious, but said it's still too early to assess the action's impact on contract negotiations.
"There's another day at the negotiation table" Thursday, Desjardins said. "It's really then that we'll see whether what we did will change anything," he said.
The union says they will determine whether they plan to use their five additional strike days after Thursday's negotiations.

Full text: Montreal health authorities now say 53 deaths in the city may be attributable to a heat wave earlier this month.
The new number could mean as many as 89 Quebeckers died as a result of heat-related complications between June 30 and July 7.
On July 9, a spokesperson with the Quebec Health Department said up to 70 people across the province may have died because of the sweltering temperatures that smothered much of Central and Eastern Canada.
That number included 34 people in Montreal.
Those who died in Montreal were mostly elderly men who lived alone as well as people with cardiovascular or breathing problems.
In Ontario, chief coroner Dirk Huyer said on July 10 that three deaths in the province may have been related to heat.
Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, said heat-related data are collected in that province's heat warning and information system report but added that document does not collect statistics on deaths.

Full text: Fifty-three deaths in Montreal were potentially caused by the record-breaking heat wave that took over the city in early July, says a new report( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/actualites/2018/07_juillet/BilanCanicule2018VF.pdf ) by the public health department released Wednesday. But that number could continue to rise.
The total presented in the department's preliminary report does not include deaths that occurred in hospitals, only those that occurred within the community from June 30 to July 8, said Dr. David Kaiser, a physician with Santé Montréal. They still have to go through hospital records to determine which deaths may have been heat-related.
He expects that most cases will be of people who were brought to hospitals after being exposed to the heat and died shortly after. More than 5,400 people were taken to hospitals by ambulance throughout the heat wave, says the public health department's report. At the time, Urgences-Santé reported that the number of calls they received was up 30 per cent.
Kaiser said he doesn't expect the death toll to increase substantially. After the 2010 heat wave, which saw temperatures of more than 35 C for five days, he said only 15 per cent of the 106 deaths occurred in hospitals.
Overall, Kaiser said Montreal saw 10 to 15 more deaths per day during the recent heat wave. As of July 9, another 34 deaths were reported elsewhere in Quebec. The province's Ministry of Health and Social Services said a final province-wide death toll will be released in the fall.
The report says three-quarters of people who died lived alone and that a significant portion of the deaths were related to drug and alcohol consumption. It also says that vulnerable populations were hit the hardest, and recommends that the public health department collaborate with community groups to protect these individuals as heat waves become more common.
Kaiser said the department looks for three elements to determine whether a death was heat-related. First, he said, they look for underlying medical conditions, both physical (such as heart disease and diabetes) and mental, or whether the person had a history of drug or alcohol abuse.
The next indicator would be the environment the person was found in, which Kaiser said was most often apartments without air conditioning located in hotter areas of the city. A map included in the report shows Montreal's largest "heat islands" to be around the city's southeastern edge.
Finally, Kaiser said they try to determine whether the individual was socially isolated, which he said tends to occur the most to individuals who live in rooming houses.

Many stores running out of air conditioning units

Full text: Heat-weary Montrealers who are finally breaking down and trying to purchase an air conditioner may be in for more frustration as they find many local retailers are out of stock.
"We are out," said Pierre Gagnon, manager of the electrical department at Montreal's largest Home Depot store, in St-Henri.
The store normally orders enough air conditioners to satisfy customer demand throughout the summer, stocking brands like LG, Toshiba, Danby and Comfort-Aire, normally only running out when they start stocking heaters. The stores order based on sales from the year before, Gagnon said.
But this summer, the prolonged heat wave that hit Montreal from June 29 to July 5, with temperatures reaching a high of 35 C on July 2, wiped out his stock. About a week after that, the store got another delivery, and that load was wiped out about an hour after the store opened, he said.
Gagnon said it is pretty much the same story at all Home Depots across Montreal, as well as other retailers.
"We all take our inventory from (the same) suppliers," he added. "Sales would normally be spread out over the whole summer. Now it all happened in one shot. We got emptied. Nobody saw it coming."
He said reordering from the manufacturers is not an option, since orders must be placed months in advance.
"This is all imported. So to get stuff from China into Canada, into the distribution (system) ... by the time it hits the store, it is months and months and months of planning, so it's not like (more units) are readily available."
It was the same story at stores like Walmart and Canadian Tire.
Montreal's downtown Canadian Tire outlet had only three Noma brand 9000 BTU 3-in-1 portable air conditioning units on sale for $449 Tuesday afternoon; by 6 p.m., they were gone. The Canadian Tire on Crémazie Blvd. E. had 11 Noma 5000 BTU window units ($199) left on Tuesday evening, while the other Montreal-area outlets were out or were down to single digits. The Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue store had one, there were two left at the LaSalle store, and one remained in the St-Laurent store.
Mike Powers, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said the heat wave that hit Montreal was indeed exceptional. While it is normal to get a four-day stretch of temperatures above 30 C with a high humidex at some point every summer, "this time we got seven days, which is pretty rare."
The temperature is returning to around normal for this time of year, with daytime highs of 25 and 27 C respectively on Wednesday and Thursday (the average high at this time of year is 26.5), and nighttime lows of 15 and 16.
On Friday the temperature is expected to reach 30 C again, but with normal humidity, Powers said. And rain on Saturday night and Sunday should bring some relief.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Former mayor Applebaum appeals his ban from real estate profession( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-mayor-applebaum-barred-from-real-estate )
Disgraced former mayor Michael Applebaum is going to court to try to get his real estate licence back.
Applebaum has been trying to be readmitted to his former profession as a real estate agent since he was paroled from prison in June 2017, after serving two months of a one-year sentence for eight counts of fraud against the government, conspiracy to commit fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy to commit breach of trust.
Last fall, the organization regulating Quebec's real estate brokers rejected Applebaum's application to get his licence back, saying his crimes would taint the integrity of the profession and harm the public's confidence in real estate brokers.
Now, Applebaum is appealing the decision of the Organisme d'autoréglementation du courtage immobilier du Québec (OACIQ) in Quebec Court, saying he deserves a chance to rehabilitate himself and practice the profession he exercised for 22 years.
The OACIQ revoked his licence on April 30, 2017, three months after his conviction. Its rules specify it can refuse a licence to anyone guilty of a criminal act that is linked to their real estate practice.
Applebaum's lawyer, Pierre Teasdale, said in an interview that his crimes were not connected to his real estate practice, and that the OACIQ has allowed other people to practice as real estate brokers despite past criminal convictions.
Teasdale said Applebaum, 55, who has refused all interviews and kept a low profile since his release, has been going through a difficult time. "He's looking for a job. It's not easy," he said.
Applebaum's case is so public that he would never try to act illegally or unethically if allowed to sell real estate again, Teasdale argued.
"His case is so well-known, it's an additional protection for the public," he said.
The case will be heard on Oct. 16, according to Marie-Pierre Laflamme, a communications consultant for the OACIQ.
Montreal police officer to face trial in 2016 death of Montreal North man( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-officer-charged-with-manslaughter-will-go-to-trial )
A Montreal police officer charged with manslaughter in the death of a 46-year-old black man in 2016 will finally go to trial.
Quebec Superior Court Judge Pierre Labelle announced in a decision Tuesday that there was enough evidence to warrant a trial for Christian Gilbert, a police officer charged in connection with the death of Jean-Pierre Bony.
Bony was killed during a police raid in a Montreal North apartment complex on March 31, 2016. He had been hit by a rubber bullet. During the raid, Fredy Villanueva's brother Dany was arrested.
His death led to unrest in the borough - including a violent night of protest during which the local police station was vandalized - and renewed calls for improved race relations in Montreal North.
Labelle's decision concludes a months-long preliminary inquiry that began in February.
No date has been set for the trial.

Meteorologist shrugs off Montreal's dry July as 'a normal variable'

Full text: Despite sweat-inducing humidity, July has been an exceptionally dry month in Montreal.
By Sunday, Montreal received 0.4 mm of rain - a far cry from the monthly average of about 90 mm. By the same date last year, the island had received 50.6 mm of rain, according to historical data from Environment Canada.
This year's dryness is the result of cooler weather systems passing northwest of the city, said Simon Legault, a meteorologist with the agency. It's nothing more than a normal variation in weather patterns, he said.
"The general pattern of the atmosphere right now is causing the (low temperatures) to (travel) that way."
Legault offered last summer's cooler weather as an example of how different weather patterns affect temperatures and precipitation.
"That's a normal variable from year to year," he said.
Legault said that although Montreal hasn't received as much rain as it has in the past, that wasn't necessarily the case for the rest of the province.
"You can have the (expected) amount of rain in some places, but the next city won't get as much."
Legault also said Montreal will have warm weather through the end of the week, but it will dryer compared with the Monday humidex value of 38. The heat wave,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/montreal-heat-wave-more-searing-weather-in-the-forecast-next-weekend ) which is said to have caused the deaths of 74 people in the province at the beginning of the month, is not related to the lack of rain, Legault said.
"We're just not seeing the systems that bring rain and colder temperatures."
Showers were expected overnight Monday and while they would not make up for the dry two weeks, "we're going to get a little bit closer to (the monthly average)," Legault said.
Montreal was expected to see between 10 and 20 mm of rain, with 30 to 40 mm possible in some parts of the region. The difference, Legault said, is because of breaks in the weather systems. The rain was expected help push the warmer air out of the region.
He also said the rain will "wash the air," reducing the smog in the atmosphere. During the heat wave at the beginning of the month, Environment Canada issued a smog warning for the city( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/smog-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-enters-last-gasp ). Smog is caused by high concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere, made worse by warm weather.

Full text: Despite sweat-inducing humidity, July has been an exceptionally dry month in Montreal.
By Sunday, Montreal received 0.4 millimetres of rain - a far cry from the monthly average of about 90 mm. By the same date last year, the island had received 50.6 mm of rain, according to historical data from Environment Canada.
This year's dryness is the result of cooler weather systems passing northwest of the city, said Simon Legault, a meteorologist with the agency. It's nothing more than a normal variation in weather patterns, he said. "The general pattern of the atmosphere right now is causing the (low temperatures) to (travel) that way."
Legault offered last summer's cooler weather as an example of how different weather patterns affect temperatures and precipitation.
"That's a normal variable from year to year," he said.
Legault said that although Montreal hasn't received as much rain as it has in the past, that wasn't necessarily the case for the rest of the province.
"You can have the (expected) amount of rain in some places, but the next city won't get as much."
Legault also said Montreal will have warm weather through the end of the week, but it will be dryer compared with the Monday humidex value of 38. The heat wave, which is said to have caused the deaths of 74 people in the province at the beginning of the month, is not related to the lack of rain, Legault said.
"We're just not seeing the systems that bring rain and colder temperatures."
Showers were expected overnight Monday, and while they won't make up for the dry two weeks, "we're going to get a little bit closer to (the monthly average)," Legault said.
Montreal was expected to see between 10 and 20 mm of rain, with 30 to 40 mm possible in some parts of the region. The difference, Legault said, is because of breaks in the weather systems. The rain was expected to help push the warmer air out of the region.
He also said the rain will "wash the air," reducing the smog in the atmosphere. During the heat wave at the beginning of the month, Environment Canada issued a smog warning for the city. Smog is caused by high concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere, made worse by warm weather. Legault said rain and wind are crucial to blow the pollutants out of the atmosphere and down to the ground.
Meanwhile, farmers in the province are hoping for rain. Marcel Groleau, president of the Union des producteurs agricoles, told Presse Canadienne on Friday in certain regions the situation is critical, notably in Lanaudière and the south of Quebec, Groleau said.

Fitness: Don't let heat and humidity hamper your workout

Full text: While most of us were cozying up to our air conditioners during the recent heat wave, Athletics Canada held the Canadian Track and Field Championships at Terry Fox Stadium in Ottawa.
Temperatures were in the mid-30s for the first few days, with the humidity making it feel even hotter. Under the direction of Athletics Canada's chief operating officer, Mathieu Gentes, meet officials put several measures in place to help the athletes keep cool, including misting stations, additional water stations and cooling tubs filled with icy water. There was also a sponging station at the finish where volunteers swabbed down athletes as they crossed the line. Additional medical staff were also at the ready to attend to any participant overcome by the heat.
Runners cool down after their 800-metre race at the Canadian Track and Field Championships in Ottawa on July 5, 2018.
If you're a summer athlete, you have probably encountered circumstances where you weren't able to heed recommendations by health officials to limit physical exertion during periods of high heat and humidity. Sports leagues don't cancel their games. Runners, cyclists and triathletes still put in the training miles under the blazing summer sun. This necessitates strategies not just to maximize performance during extreme conditions, but to avoid being sidelined by heat stress or illness.
In most conditions, the body copes with hot weather by sweating more and accelerating the flow of blood toward the skin to burn off excess heat. But with so much extra effort needed to cool the body, less energy is available to fuel activity, hence the tendency for heart rates to rise and performance to suffer during periods of high heat and humidity.
With more exposure to hot conditions, however, the body becomes more efficient at cooling itself. Depending on the type of training, environment and whether you're an elite or recreational athlete, it takes anywhere from seven to 14 days for the body to acclimatize to the heat. This is why so many Canadian athletes search out hot climates in the months leading up to their competitive summer season.
As counterintuitive as it may seem, exercising in the heat improves your ability to exercise in the heat. The trick is to do it in a controlled manner; don't wait until your first game or race in the hot sun to test out your ability to withstand a spike in temperature.
Short bouts of exercise are the way to start. Slowly increase the length of your workout as your body adjusts to the heat. Within about a week, you'll start sweating sooner and producing greater quantities of sweat. Your heart rate will settle down to normal exercise levels, too. No need to worry about additional measures to cope with humidity; research indicates heat acclimatization works in both dry and humid conditions. That said, you may feel more uncomfortable in humidity and need to include additional external cooling strategies to manage your comfort level.
Be sure to include a hydration plan into your workout schedule. The effects of a heat wave are cumulative, with hydration levels typically dipping below normal as hot days take their toll, so make sure you drink often, even when you're not training or competing.
Plan your workouts to coincide with the time of day when you are most likely to compete. Often, event organizers won't schedule competitions during the hottest part of the day, opting instead for early start times. In the event that you are forced to be out in the full sun, however, make sure you expose yourself to controlled, hot conditions before trying to push your limits in a race or competition.
Finally, always ere on the side of caution. Being felled by the heat can affect your ability to compete for the rest of the summer. Here are some additional tips to help you work up a sweat in the dogs days of summer.
Tips for exercising in the summer
Get used to the heat
Include a two-week acclimatization plan in your training if you have an upcoming summer competition. Work your way up to 60 minutes or more of exercise in conditions similar to those in which you will be competing. Training in a hot room is as effective as training outdoors. Monitor your heart rate during the acclimatization period; you should notice less of an exercise-related spike as your body becomes better at adapting to the heat.
Drink up
Drink water before, during and after your workout, as it's not unusual for athletes to begin a summer workout already dehydrated. In most cases, drinking to quell thirst is sufficient, but during prolonged, higher intensity bouts of exercise, it may be necessary to drink ahead of thirst. Drinking six millilitres of water per kilogram of body weight every two to three hours is a good general recommendation. Heavy sweaters may want to add salt to their fluid intake.
Take every opportunity to cool off
Pre-cooling strategies include iced towels, commercially available ice vests, fans or sponging down with cold water before extended workouts. Cold beverages or slushies can be used during exercise to promote internal cooling. Be sure to test out any in-competition cooling methods during training.
Exercise more caution if you've been sick
Be especially careful in the heat if you recently suffered from the flu, diarrhea or any other illness because your ability to dissipate heat may be adversely affected.

Summer is the time to get out and play in the water; Parks throughout the city offer families a watery break from the sweltering heat

Full text: When it's hot in the city, where can you take the kids to get some relief? How about one of the many splash pads that have popped up in city parks in recent years. In no particular order, here are some Montreal Gazette picks for places to cool off and get wet. St Michel Park Corner of Laurier Ave. E. and St-Dominique St., Plateau Mont Royal Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until early October When temperatures rise, Plateau families flock to the splash pad at St Michel Park to cool off.
One of the highlights for the little ones is a "tube" you can run through made of four red hoops that spray water. There are some tall structures (one shaped like a palm tree) that offer showers from above, as well as jets that shoot up from the ground. The soft, rubbery padding underfoot offers some relief when excited kids running in all directions inevitably collide. Young kids will be impatient for their turn to climb all over the big plastic frog and the alligator.
When the novelty of water features is exhausted, try out the play structures (one for two-to-five year olds; another for five-to-12 year olds). Parents can relax on a big plastic lounge chair in the "beach" area (no, this is nowhere near any real body of water) featuring permanent umbrella structures as kids dig in the sand.
This park is easy to get to via transit (either the St-Laurent bus or the Laurier métro will bring you relatively close), but be forewarned that finding parking will be a feat. There are no public toilets, but if you herd the kids over to nearby Guillaume (5134 St-Laurent Blvd.) for a delicious pastry treat when you need a break, you can probably take advantage of their facilities. - Emma McKay Valois Park 40 Baie de Valois Ave., Pointe Claire Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily during the summer An intense amount of water awaits you at the Valois Park splash pad that opened in Pointe-Claire last year. It has everything you would expect: rubber floors, a changing room and picnic tables nearby (one of those tables is even accessible for wheelchairs). What it doesn't have a lot of is shade for those who don't want to get wet.
The standout feature of the park has to be the dumping wheel, called the super wave, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water. But younger kids who shy away from big splashes can also find plenty of structures to play with.
The splash pad is well situated near St John Fisher Elementary School, and Valois Park also has a swimming pool near the splash pad. It's accessible by transit, with buses that stop nearby and the Valois train station just a short walk away, and there is plenty of parking on nearby streets. If you want to make an outing of it, there are places to eat and shop in the Valois Village. - Jason Magder Trenholme Park 6800 Sherbrooke St. W., Notre Dame de Grâce Open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily until Aug. 19 The old wading pool at this venerable park in western Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was perfectly fine. The recently renovated/reopened version is perfect.
Among the neat, new touches are private family changing rooms and an outdoor shower to rinse off; a communal box of water toys; and a couple of splash-pad-type structures for kids who want to do a little more than just wade.
A "quick" recent visit to the stillgleaming pool with a four year old and a two year old in tow lasted for more than two hours - and would have gone on even longer if they had had their way! It was also extended by a visit to Ca Lem, the wonderful and popular ice-cream shop located just west of the park on Sherbrooke St.
Ample street parking is available around the park, and you could easily while away an afternoon with a pool visit, a pop-in to the adjacent playground and a picnic in the park.
One note though: because wading pools require lifeguards, the Trenholme pool's opening hours are not as copious as those for splash pads. (The lifeguards also vigorously police the pool's nophotos policy. Don't ask how I know.) - Basem Boshra Walters Park Corner of Pine Beach Blvd. and Lakeshore Rd. in Dorval Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until September This splash pad boasts a view of Lac St-Louis so pastoral it will soothe the soul of harried parents arriving for a day of fun in the sun, lugging sunscreen and hats and folding camp chairs and towels and a cooler filled with snacks and water bottles. At least there's parking, so shlepping all that stuff is easier.
Be smart: place yourself strategically to face the shoreline AND the splash pad, so the children can be watched as they zigzag back and forth across the streaming jets of water while you daydream about sailing off into the distance. The splash pad is so colourful and playful, it reminds me of a sculpture garden you'd stumble upon at a museum.
Best feature: the umbrellas that little kids can crouch under, waiting for the water to surge; and for the bigger kids, the pendulous buckets that swing like upside down bells until they unleash their icy refreshment. Toddlers love the green frog's gentle jets. My children would squeal in delight aiming the zebra-faced water cannon at me. (I really didn't mind.)
There's no pool at this park, but the play structures clustered around the splash pad are popular. I have fond memories of my son at the music station, beating the drums to his heart's content. Consider ending the day on a sweet note: stop by Non Solo Pane bakery at 455 Lakeshore Rd. on the way home. - Enza Micheletti

The standout feature of the park has to be the dumping wheel, called the super wave, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water. But younger kids who shy away from big splashes can also find plenty of structures to play with.
The splash pad is well situated near St-John Fisher Elementary School, and Valois Park also has a swimming pool near the splash pad. It's accessible by public transit, with buses that stop nearby and the Valois train station just a short walk away, and there is plenty of parking on nearby streets. If you want to make an outing of it, there are places to eat and shop in the Valois Village.

The standout feature of the splash pad at Pointe-Claire's Valois Park is the dumping wheel, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water.
Trenholme Park
6800 Sherbrooke St. W., Notre-Dame-de-Grâce
Open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily until Aug. 19
The old wading pool at this venerable park in western Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was perfectly fine. The recently renovated/re-opened version is perfect.
Among the neat, new touches are private family changing rooms and an outdoor shower to rinse off; a communal box of water toys; and a couple of splash pad-type structures for kids who want to do a little more than just wade.
A 'quick' recent visit to the still-gleaming pool with a four-year-old and a two-year-old in tow lasted for more than two hours - and would have gone on even longer if they had had their way! It was also extended by a visit to Ca Lem, the wonderful and popular ice-cream shop located just west of the park on Sherbrooke St.
Ample street parking is available around the park, and you could easily while away an afternoon with a pool visit, a pop-in to the adjacent playground and a picnic in the park.
One note though: because wading pools require lifeguards, the Trenholme pool's opening hours are not as copious as those for splash pads. (The lifeguards also vigorously police the pool's no-photos policy. Don't ask how I know...)

Walters Park
Corner of Pine Beach Blvd. and Lakeshore Rd. in Dorval
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until September
This splash pad boasts a view of Lac St-Louis so pastoral it will soothe the soul of harried parents arriving for a day of fun in the sun lugging sunscreen and hats and folding camp chairs and towels and a cooler filled with snacks and water bottles. At least there's parking, so shlepping all that stuff is easier.
Be smart: place yourself strategically to face the shoreline AND the splash pad, so the children can be watched as they zigzag back and forth across the streaming jets of water while you daydream about sailing off into the distance. The splash pad is so colourful and playful, it reminds me of a sculpture garden you'd stumble upon at a museum.
Best feature: the umbrellas that little kids can crouch under waiting for the water to surge; and for the bigger kids, the pendulous buckets that swing like upside bells until they unleash their cold load of icy refreshment. Toddlers love the green frog's gentle jets. My children would squeal in delight aiming the zebra-faced water cannon at me. A confession: I really didn't mind.
There's no pool at this park, but the play structures clustered around the splash pad are popular. I have fond memories of my son at the music station, beating the drums to his heart's content. Consider ending the day on a sweet note: stop by Non Solo Pane bakery at 455 Lakeshore Rd. on the way home. The gelato is worth the detour.

Full text: When it's hot in the city, where can you take the kids to get some relief? How about one of the many splash pads that have popped up in city parks in recent years. In no particular order, here are some Montreal Gazette picks for places to cool off and get wet.
St-Michel Park
Corner of Laurier Ave. E. and St-Dominique St., Plateau-Mont-Royal
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until early October
When temperatures rise, Plateau families flock to the splash pad at St-Michel Park to cool off.
One of the highlights for the little ones is a "tube" you can run through made of four red hoops that spray water. There are some tall structures (one shaped like a palm tree) that offer showers from above, as well as jets that shoot up from the ground. The soft, rubbery padding underfoot offers some relief when excited kids running in all directions inevitably collide. Young kids will be impatient for their turn to climb all over the big plastic frog and the alligator.
When the novelty of water features is exhausted, try out the play structures (one for two- to five-year-olds; another for five- to 12-year-olds). Parents can relax on a big plastic lounge chair in the "beach" area (no, this is nowhere near any real body of water) featuring permanent umbrella structures overhead as kids dig in the sand.
This park is easy to get to via public transit (either the St-Laurent bus or the Laurier métro will bring you relatively close), but be forewarned that finding parking will be a feat. There are also no public toilets. However, if you herd the kids over to nearby Guillaume (5134 St-Laurent Blvd.) for a delicious pastry treat when you need a break, you can probably take advantage of their facilities.

Valois Park
40 Baie de Valois Ave., Pointe-Claire
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily during the summer
An intense amount of water awaits you at the Valois Park splash pad that opened in Pointe-Claire last year. It has everything you would expect: rubber floors, a changing room and picnic tables nearby (one of those tables is even accessible for wheelchairs). What it doesn't have a lot of is shade for those who don't want to get wet.
The standout feature of the park has to be the dumping wheel, called the super wave, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water. But younger kids who shy away from big splashes can also find plenty of structures to play with.
The splash pad is well situated near St-John Fisher Elementary School, and Valois Park also has a swimming pool near the splash pad.

Bill Zacharkiw: Beat the heat with a glass of Quebec cider

Full text: I read the heat wave warning posted on Environment Canada's website last week and noticed they suggest keeping alcohol intake to a minimum. Alcohol is a diuretic; it makes your kidneys work harder and you urinate more often, causing your body to lose more fluid. Combined with sweating, this effectively increases the possibility of dehydration.
I guess it's best to keep your martini drinking to air-conditioned rooms. My solution is to drink lower-alcohol beverages, and there are none better than cider. Whether sparkling or still, most ciders come in at under eight per cent alcohol by volume. And there are so many really good Quebec-made examples.
Although the province's wine industry has made great strides of late, cider has a much longer history. In apple-growing regions like France's Normandy and northern Spain, drinking cider is part of day-to-day life. Yet in apple-rich Quebec, it never caught on.
The reason can be traced back to a government oversight. In 1921, when the Quebec liquor commission was established, cider was not included in the law, making it effectively illegal to produce or sell. This led to bootlegging and a lack of investment in both technology and technique. Lots of bad cider was produced, which turned the population off the beverage.
Things have changed. There are now over 80 artisanal cider producers in Quebec, and the SAQ carries more than 130 varieties, not including ice-cider. A number of cider houses are planting different types of apple to create even better products. Hopefully, this will attract more Quebecers to cider. Even if it doesn't, there are plenty of opportunities outside of the province. According to the Beverage Trade Network, worldwide cider consumption has increased by 50 per cent over the past decade.
Ciders are also relatively inexpensive, most under $16. The vast majority of local production is in sparkling ciders, which can range from relatively dry to off-dry. One of the best introductions to sparkling ciders is the Crémant from Cidrerie du Minot( https://www.saq.com/page/en/saqcom/sparkling-cider/cidrerie-du-minot-cremant-de-pomme/245316 ). At 2.5 per cent alcohol, its lightness and explosion of fruit make it a great aperitif.
If you want something a little drier, try the Vergers de la Colline's Les Russet( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/les-vergers-de-la-colline-les-russet/13107641?selectedIndex=52&searchContextId=266762767410519997 ) or the Cidre mousseux( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/union-libre-cidre-mousseux-2014/12641948?selectedIndex=70&searchContextId=266762767410742678 ) from Union Libre. If you want a rosé, both Domaine Lafrance( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/domaine-lafrance-cidre-mousseux-rose-2016/13258289 ) and Michel Jodoin( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/michel-jodoin-cidre-rose-petillant/13514297 ) make great examples. The Jodoin comes in 330-millilitre bottles as well.
One of the most exciting aspects of this new age in Quebec cider is the derivative products, especially the aromatic ciders which are fermented with other fruits. I love both the cranberry( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/entre-pierre-et-terre/12030291 ) and strawberry Spritz( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/spritz-entre-pierre-et-terre-cocktail-au-cidre-petillant/13612663?selectedIndex=7&searchContextId=2667627674103330100 ) from Entre Pierre et Terre, as well as the raspberry from Coteau Rougemont( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-aromatise/coteau-rougemont-rose-framboise-cidre-aromatise/12358173?selectedIndex=18&searchContextId=2667627674102918427 ). If you are a fan of Campari and soda, try using these instead of soda.

Full text: When it's hot in the city, where can you take the kids to get some relief? How about one of the many splash pads that have popped up in city parks in recent years. In no particular order, here are some Montreal Gazette picks for places to cool off and get wet.
St-Michel Park
Corner of Laurier Ave. E. and St-Dominique St., Plateau-Mont-Royal
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until early October
When temperatures rise, Plateau families flock to the splash pad at St-Michel Park to cool off.
One of the highlights for the little ones is a "tube" you can run through made of four red hoops that spray water. There are some tall structures (one shaped like a palm tree) that offer showers from above, as well as jets that shoot up from the ground. The soft, rubbery padding underfoot offers some relief when excited kids running in all directions inevitably collide. Young kids will be impatient for their turn to climb all over the big plastic frog and the alligator.
When the novelty of water features is exhausted, try out the play structures (one for two- to five-year-olds; another for five- to 12-year-olds). Parents can relax on a big plastic lounge chair in the "beach" area (no, this is nowhere near any real body of water) featuring permanent umbrella structures overhead as kids dig in the sand.
This park is easy to get to via public transit (either the St-Laurent bus or the Laurier métro will bring you relatively close), but be forewarned that finding parking will be a feat. There are also no public toilets. However, if you herd the kids over to nearby Guillaume (5134 St-Laurent Blvd.) for a delicious pastry treat when you need a break, you can probably take advantage of their facilities.

Valois Park
40 Baie de Valois Ave., Pointe-Claire
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily during the summer
An intense amount of water awaits you at the Valois Park splash pad that opened in Pointe-Claire last year. It has everything you would expect: rubber floors, a changing room and picnic tables nearby (one of those tables is even accessible for wheelchairs). What it doesn't have a lot of is shade for those who don't want to get wet.
The standout feature of the park has to be the dumping wheel, called the super wave, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water. But younger kids who shy away from big splashes can also find plenty of structures to play with.
The splash pad is well situated near St-John Fisher Elementary School, and Valois Park also has a swimming pool near the splash pad. It's accessible by public transit, with buses that stop nearby and the Valois train station just a short walk away, and there is plenty of parking on nearby streets. If you want to make an outing of it, there are places to eat and shop in the Valois Village.

The standout feature of the splash pad at Pointe-Claire's Valois Park is the dumping wheel, which soaks users with a comically large amount of water.
Trenholme Park
6800 Sherbrooke St. W., Notre-Dame-de-Grâce
Open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily until Aug. 19
The old wading pool at this venerable park in western Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was perfectly fine. The recently renovated/re-opened version is perfect.
Among the neat, new touches are private family changing rooms and an outdoor shower to rinse off; a communal box of water toys; and a couple of splash pad-type structures for kids who want to do a little more than just wade.
A 'quick' recent visit to the still-gleaming pool with a four-year-old and a two-year-old in tow lasted for more than two hours - and would have gone on even longer if they had had their way! It was also extended by a visit to Ca Lem, the wonderful and popular ice-cream shop located just west of the park on Sherbrooke St.
Ample street parking is available around the park, and you could easily while away an afternoon with a pool visit, a pop-in to the adjacent playground and a picnic in the park.
One note though: because wading pools require lifeguards, the Trenholme pool's opening hours are not as copious as those for splash pads. (The lifeguards also vigorously police the pool's no-photos policy. Don't ask how I know...)
- Basem Boshra
Axel Bousette, 3, runs through the spray at the splash pad at Walters Park. Among the Dorval splash pad's attractions are animal-faced water cannons.
Walters Park
Corner of Pine Beach Blvd. and Lakeshore Rd. in Dorval
Open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily until September
This splash pad boasts a view of Lac St-Louis so pastoral it will soothe the soul of harried parents arriving for a day of fun in the sun lugging sunscreen and hats and folding camp chairs and towels and a cooler filled with snacks and water bottles. At least there's parking, so shlepping in all that stuff is easier.
Be smart: place yourself strategically to face the shoreline AND the splash pad, so the children can be watched as they zigzag back and forth across the streaming jets of water while you daydream about sailing off into the distance. The splash pad is so colourful and playful, it reminds me of a sculpture garden you'd stumble upon at a museum.
Best feature: the umbrellas that little kids can crouch under waiting for the water to surge; and for the bigger kids, the pendulous buckets that swing like upside bells until they unleash their cold load of icy refreshment. Toddlers love the green frog's gentle jets. My children would squeal in delight aiming the zebra-faced water cannon at me. A confession: I really didn't mind.
There's no pool at this park, but the play structures clustered around the splash pad are popular. I have fond memories of my son at the music station, beating the drums to his heart's content. Consider ending the day on a sweet note: stop by Non Solo Pane bakery at 455 Lakeshore Rd. on the way home. The gelato is worth the detour.

Full text: From the magnificent Harrods Food Hall in London to the impossibly chic Freds at Barneys in New York, department store dining has always been a treat. Montrealers have long enjoyed such noshing. Eaton's Ninth Floor Restaurant( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/of-eatons-ninth-floor-and-a-great-gal-named-winnie ), that still-shuttered art deco palace, is the epitome of the genre, and the classic Woolworth's lunch counter a distant but fun memory for those of us who watched Laverne & Shirley( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074016/ ) and bought ice cream at Perrette (ask your parents). Despite the obvious demise of department stores, the ultraposh ones that sell Prada blouses and Crème de la Mer skin care still have a place in our city, and with them come chic restaurants to feed famished fashionistas or perhaps entertain those of us who know Manolos not as our personal footwear choice but as the stilettos Melania Trump wears( https://nationalpost.com/news/world/melania-trump-floats-above-it-all-in-stilettos-why-changing-into-sneakers-in-texas-doesnt-signal-empathy ) to visit hurricane victims.
Here are two cafés, one new, one semi-new. Enjoy some beautiful food, people-watch, or take a break before forking over for that Judith & Charles dress you've been longing for.
Ssense's cement-framed space was designed by London-based David Chipperfield Architects.
Ssense Café ?? out of ???? $$
418 St-Sulpice St. (at St-Paul St.)
Phone: 514-289-1906
Price range: Small plates $8-$15; desserts $5-$6.
Located in Old Montreal in the new, and impossibly branché Ssense global flagship store, this sleek café has garnered plenty of buzz since opening in early May thanks to its edgy design and talented operators. The look is all modern-art-meets-concrete-and-steel, fronted by the original 1866 façade.
Upon entering you'll be told to head upstairs. On the second floor, you encounter clothes (think $600 Comme des Garçons skirts and $1,500 Alexander McQueen hoodies). On the third and fourth floor, you'll find changing rooms and consultants/personal shoppers. Finally, on the fifth floor, you'll see a series of art books and the rather bunker-like Ssense Café.
Designed by London-based David Chipperfield Architects (responsible for the entire store, actually), the dark, cement-framed space is amazing. There's seating for 34 at the bar, as well as a central communal concrete table. Visiting on a recent heat-wave day, I admired the way the sun played with the lighting scheme, creating stripes through the slim windows in the ceiling. The throbbing heat was definitely battling with the air conditioning, yet I still found the effect captivating.
Lunch started with a cold-pressed juice made with beets, juniper and pomegranate.
The menu is equally alluring, thanks to Kabir Kapoor and Jason Morris, the duo behind the deeply creative Le Fantôme restaurant as well as the recently opened (yet not yet reviewed) Pastel. I just love their style, best described as reinvented classics that push even further into the realm of deliciousness. This menu has a bit of that as well, but in a more subtle way, with eight savoury dishes and three desserts.
Arriving for lunch, I found a room sparsely populated with only one waitress on duty. She handed us the menu and let us know that because of a reception the previous evening, several of the dishes weren't available. Bummer - but we still tasted five and began with two, cold-pressed drinks: a beet, juniper and pomegranate juice, and a carrot, orange and coconut juice. Served on ice, the juices were very good, though the carrot juice would have been less bitter had they peeled the carrots (for $8, are peeled carrots too much to ask?).
The radicchio salad was flavoured with white balsamic vinegar and coffee grounds.
We ordered three dishes, a radicchio salad, a shrimp salad and a shakshuka, which unfortunately took about half an hour to make an appearance. Our waitress was also on juice duty, which means service lagged throughout the meal. Considering six people were in the dining room, that sort of long wait at lunch time was a downer. On a brighter note, the dishes were exquisite looking and generally appealing.
Served in a round, the shrimp salad featured sliced shrimp, peas, celery and sprouts in a sort of light mayonnaise sauce. Everything from the look and the seasoning to the technique on display in this dish was perfect. The radicchio salad was made up of full radicchio leaves mixed with pomegranate seeds and baby spinach, the whole flavoured with white balsamic vinegar and coffee grounds. I'm a fan of bitter flavours, but halfway through this salad, the bitterness of the radicchio was overwhelming.
Sadly, the shakshuka didn't really fly. Served on a large square of soft bread, the composition included a red tomato sauce and a green tomatillo sauce along with two slow-cooked eggs. I like a little kick in shakshuka, and I also like some drippy egg yolks to meld into the sauces and enrich all those acidic flavours. This version was blah. I saw a single coriander leaf floating around in there and wondered, why not more?
Coffee and desserts, a tiny cheesecake and a rice pudding filled choux bun, brightened my spirits as both were excellent. Made in a cannelé mould, the cheesecake was sprinkled with pulverized, freeze-dried fruit that tasted like Jell-O powder (and that's a good thing). As for the choux bun, though obviously not made fresh that day, its dense texture was saved by its delicious coconut/cinnamon flavour.
My sense on Ssense Café is that it's not quite there yet, because of the service issues and some unexpected blandness in the food. Hopefully, this talented team can soon make the food as swoon-worthy as the setting.

When Colette Grand Café opened in March, the art on the walls was the only change made to the decor. Bigger changes will come when Holt Renfrew moves into the Ogilvy space sometime in 2020.
Colette Grand Café (in Holt Renfrew)
?? out of ????
$$-$$$
1300 Sherbrooke St. W.
Phone: 514-282-3750
Website: colettegrandcafe.com( https://www.colettegrandcafe.com/location/montreal/ )
Price range: Starters $7-$17; salads, sandwiches and large plates $17-$28; desserts $8-$10.
In 2005, Holt Renfrew, the chic Montreal department store known for featuring top-notch imported fashion, added a new name to its roster of designers: Paris's most famous bread, Poilâne. With that acquisition came a new menu at the Holt Café, featuring open-faced toasted sandwiches known as tartines. I liked this new incarnation, yet over time, the tartine concept seemed to fade away as quietly as their in-store specialty food section. A shame, but then again, importing loaves of bread at $14 per quarter loaf might be de trop even for Holt's, especially in a city filled with fabulous bakers like ours.
Post Poilâne, I had zero impression of the place other than it felt like an oasis for fashionistas on a lunch break. But last December, I received a news release announcing Holt Renfrew was partnering with the Toronto-based Chase Hospitality Group to replace Holt Cafés across Canada with the new "Colette Grand Café." The restaurant would be "French-inspired" and the photos with the release featured a sort of French country design.
The chef's salad, featuring bacon, apple, avocado, grapes, quinoa and walnuts, had just enough blue cheese dressing to tie it all together.
Upon arrival last week, instead of French country, we got ... the old Holt's Café. When the restaurant was reopened as Colette in March, the art on the walls was the only change made to the decor. The bigger renos( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mccord-museum-inherits-ogilvys-iconic-holiday-windows ) will come when Holt moves into the Ogilvy space sometime in 2020.
The menu is new, though, and offers a sort of greatest hits mishmash without falling into poutine and mac 'n' cheese territory (this is Holt's after all). There's steak/frites, poulet rôti, omelette and salade Niçoise, but there's also kale salad, a burger, rigatoni, panzanella and the inevitable avocado toast. So much for the Gallic overhaul. I guess this is the definition of a French-inspired menu from - cough, cough - Toronto. As for drinks, there's a small, commercial selection of wines with steep prices, and six $15 cocktails, several of which were not available when we were there due to missing ingredients. This isn't so much wine list as hospitality group beverage program.
We opted for two salads, a panini and a dessert. Sipping a lovely non-alcoholic basil/lime/cucumber cooler, I plowed my fork into my friend's chef's salad with smoked bacon, apple, avocado, grapes, quinoa and walnuts. That may all sound a little too healthy, but it was laced with just enough blue cheese dressing to tie it all together. Highly recommended.
The rhubarb crumble is topped with ice cream - and more crumble.
I also enjoyed my plate of roasted pears with hazelnut and arugula, flavoured with lemon vinaigrette. A little goat's cheese would have been welcome, but it was enjoyable just the same. Following that came a panini with chicken, fior di latte, tomato confit and a pesto aioli that hit all the right notes. Frankly, the ingredients used are aimed to please and the results, although in no way edgy or surprising, are satisfying nonetheless.
To end, we chose the rhubarb crumble topped with ice cream topped with more crumble. Very nice, but there is such a thing as too much crumble. After settling our bill quickly, thanks to the friendly and efficient wait staff, we exited back up the stairs into the sunlight, while new shoppers descended for a snack, to organize the goods, look over some bills and decide whether to call it a day or head upstairs for more.

Watch: Other than constant misery, what is a heat wave?

Full text: We all have some intuitive sense of what constitutes a heat wave.
It's like the meteorological version of Potter Stewart's "I know it when I see it" approach to jurisprudence.
But what actually constitutes a heat wave?
Officially, it's when the maximum temperature for five days exceeds the average maximum temperature by nine degrees.
So you're not wrong to think that a heat wave is when the city feels like an oven. It's just that there's some more math involved.
The way 2018 is going, this is probably not the last time you'll be hearing about heat waves.
Don't forget to stay hydrated, andlook after yourself and your furry friends during these hot times( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/how-to-help-pets-stay-cool-and-safe-during-intense-heat ).

Deadly heat wave a wake-up call for a woefully ill-prepared city

Full text: Montrealers spend much of the year longing for the dog days of summer to keep us going through the deep freeze of winter.
So when the city sizzles through an oppressive hot spell, many of us just shut up and sweat it out, since summer is as fleeting as it is occasionally unbearable.
But last week's punishing heat wave, when the mercury soared about 30 degrees Celsius and stayed stuck there for seven days, was a wake-up call for citizens of this winter city.
For starters, it was a tragedy, blamed for claiming more than 70 lives across Quebec, 34 of them in Montreal. From what we know, most of the dead were the elderly, sick and vulnerable, who didn't have air conditioning and often expired in excruciating fashion and alone, some found only days later because of the smell emanating from their sweltering homes.
It was a stark reminder that summer isn't all fun and games. It has a dark side we don't often see when we experience it elsewhere as gleeful tourists, or during the relatively few days a year the sun typically beats down on Montreal. We've had hints of this before, namely the sultry summer of 2010, when more than 100 died. But last week's smothering heat was an urgent warning, a harbinger of a hotter future for which Montreal is ill-prepared.
According to data recently published by the Prairie Climate Centre at the University of Winnipeg, Montreal - along with much of the rest of the country - must brace for more prolonged hot spells, the likes of which we endured last week. The Climate Atlas of Canada allows the public to take stock of the potential impact of human-caused climate change in their own backyards.
The data on Montreal shows that the average annual number of very hot days (when the temperature rose to 30 C or greater) was a manageable eight between 1976 and 2005.
But an analysis projects that the total could jump to a mean of 24 each year between 2021-50 and 50 per year from 2051-80 if carbon emissions continue at their current rate.
The same scientific analysis suggests the number of 30 C and hotter days would be reduced slightly in a low-carbon scenario, if emissions are kept in check.
But either way, Montreal ought to be bracing for such heat waves to become longer, more intense and more common.
This comes as heat records worldwide are being shattered this year.
And yet, Montreal is woefully ill-equipped to handle the havoc summer could throw our way. Some hospital wings and longterm care homes don't have air conditioning, as patients recovering from surgery at Notre-Dame Hospital found out the hard way. Some brought their own fans or had to cover themselves with wet towels.
A few hot days last September underscored the fact that very few schools have air conditioning. This may be unsurprising in central Montreal, where many school buildings are old, crumbling and in need of renovation. But not all new schools are constructed with AC, either - which is short-sighted, in light of what we know about the local effects of global warming.
Cities around the world are taking stock of and planning for the fallout from climate change, from higher sea levels to wild weather. Part of this is preparing for and working to avoid disasters, like the flooding we saw in parts of the Montreal region last spring, or the wildfires that scorched Fort McMurray in 2016.
The other part of it is developing policies, protocols and regulations to make cities more resilient, so they can withstand various climate-related phenomenon to begin with. From zoning that protects natural assets like wetlands, investments in green space, and updated building codes that take into account the future needs of residents, such critical measures are required to mitigate what lies in store.
The city of Montreal adopted its first five-year climate adaptation strategy in 2015 to tackle many of these issues head on. But when it comes to the resources and the basic means for dealing with heat, we're starting from way behind. Sending firefighters door to door and imploring the public to check on their neighbours is a crisis response. That's not going to cut it long-term, when broiling summers become the norm.
In Montreal we know winter.
We know wind chill and flurries, ice storms and blizzards. We know snow plowing, salting and de-icing. In other words, we have the experience, the know-how, infrastructure and the accompanying budgets to handle almost anything winter throws at us.
But as last week's events clearly demonstrate, we now must treat summer with the same seriousness. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: Brace yourselves for another heat wave, Montreal.
Last week's brutal heat wave is now linked to a total of 74 deaths, including 34 in Montreal, most of them elderly people living alone in sweltering apartments, and many with underlying health conditions.
Outside of Montreal, Quebec public health authorities provided a breakdown of heat-related deaths as follows: Quebec, three; Mauricie, eight; Eastern Townships, nine; Laval, five; Montérégie, nine; Lanaudière, one; and Laurentians, one.
Following a few days of cooler temperatures, another string of searing hot days is to begin next weekend, according to weather forecast reports.
David Kaiser, a physician with Montreal's health department, said at risk are small children, the elderly, and those with health conditions who are often taking medications that affect their ability to recognize thirst, which means they cannot get rid of the accumulated heat in their bodies. "And after three or four days of heat, people's coping mechanisms are just overwhelmed," he said.
That's a different scenario, for example, than a marathon runner whose body temperature jumps from 37 C to 42 C during an hour of exercise and suffers a deadly heat stroke, he said.
"If you can't get out of the heat, that ends up being a big problem," Kaiser said, especially for the atrisk fragile population. "Heat stress is often what tends to put them over the edge. They may have been doing fine with their heart disease and then you put four or five days of heat on that and their heart fails because the stress on the system is so important."
Following the 106 deaths related to the 2010 Montreal heat wave, the province began keeping realtime tabs to be able to intervene more rapidly based on reports of "potential heat-related deaths" from a spike in ambulance calls and admissions to hospital emergency rooms. That's when an emergency phase response is launched, for example, going door to door, and opening urban cooling stations with air conditioning.
The final death toll in 2010 was based on an in-depth evaluation of hospital charts, coroner's reports and all other records currently not available in real time, he said. A similar report will be done at the end of this summer for the current heat wave, and only then will the two heat waves be compared.
Meanwhile, officials in Ontario, which had a similar heat wave, said that heat-related deaths are usually declared by the coroner.
However, the coroner does not investigate every heat-related death "as many of them don't come to the attention of our office," said Cheryl Mahyr, manager of the Ontario Chief Coroner's office.
Generally, a reported death would be investigated when described as accidental, unnatural and/or sudden and unexpected.
"Deaths of persons (many of whom may be elderly) with one or more medical conditions that may make them more sensitive to the effects of hot weather, and perhaps lack of access to air conditioning, may never come to our attention as their deaths would be categorized as natural," she said.
As far as Quebec health authorities are concerned, none of the deaths during the extreme heat wave occurred in a public long-term care nursing home, a centre d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée (CHSLD), or in a hospital.
However, staff and patients in some Montreal-area nursing facilities and hospitals have complained of suffocating conditions. Patients have been told to bring in their own fans and air conditioners. On Monday, in response to a health advocate calling for an independent investigation into any sudden deaths, an association of private nursing home owners said it was "horrified" by what it said was a scandal-in-the-making.
"It is indecent, misplaced and dangerous to suggest that CHSLDs are hiding deaths linked to the heat wave," Annick Lavoie, head of the Association des établissements privés conventionnés, said in a statement.
The association accused patients rights advocate Paul Brunet, head of the Conseil pour la protection des malades, of attempting to create a scandal where there isn't one.
But Brunet said he's simply calling for an independent investigation into whether people died because of extreme heat in rooms without air conditioners. cfidelman@postmedia.com

Last week's brutal heat wave is now linked a total of 74 deaths, including 34 in Montreal, most of them elderly men and women living alone in sweltering apartments, and many with underlying health conditions.
Outside Montreal, Quebec public health authorities provided a breakdown of heat-related deaths as follows: Quebec (3), Mauricie (8), Eastern Townships, (9), Laval, (5), Montérégie (9), Lanaudière (1), and Laurentians (1).
Following a few days of cooler temperatures, next weekend is to begin another string of searing hot days, according to weather forecast reports.
David Kaiser, a physician with Montreal's health department, said at risk are small children, the elderly and those with health conditions, often taking medications that affect their ability to recognize thirst, which means they cannot get rid of the accumulated heat in their bodies. "And after three or four days of heat, people's coping mechanisms are just overwhelmed," he said.

Brunet appealed to families to signal to the coroner any "sudden and rapid degradation of health leading to death" in public nursing homes between June 28 and July 5.
Brunet chided government for failing to provide for patients while giving doctors annual salary increases of eight per cent.
"Don't tell me you don't have the money to put air conditioners in patients' rooms. These are facilities where people live, and these should be decent living conditions," Brunet said, while most nursing home administrators work in air-conditioned offices.

Full text: Health authorities say up to 70 people may have died in Quebec as a result of heat-related complications since the beginning of an early July heat wave that saw temperatures climb to more than 40 C with the humidex. Temperatures have since cooled off across the provinc.
Most of the deaths occurred in Montreal, with 34 cases reported to authorities. The city's morgue became so overcrowded during the heat wave that it partnered with a funeral home, where it sent bodies for storage.
Montreal's public-health office says the majority of people who died during the heat wave were older than 60 and suffered from chronic illnesses.

Full text: Montrealers spend much of the year longing for the dog days of summer to keep us going through the deep freeze of winter.
So when the city sizzles through an oppressive hot spell, many of us just shut up and sweat it out, since summer is as fleeting as it is occasionally unbearable.
But last week's punishing heat wave, when the mercury soared about 30 degrees and stayed stuck there for seven days, was a wake-up call for citizens of this winter city. For starters, it was a tragedy, blamed for claiming more than 70 lives across Quebec, 34 of them in Montreal. From what we know, most of the dead were the elderly, sick and vulnerable, who didn't have air conditioning and often expired excruciatingly and alone, some found only days later because of the smell emanating from their sweltering homes.
It was a stark reminder that summer is not all fun and games. It has a dark side we don't often see when we experience it elsewhere as gleeful tourists or during the relatively few days a year the sun typically beats down on Montreal. We've had hints of this before, namely the sultry summer of 2010 when more than 100 died. But last week's smothering heat was an urgent warning, a harbinger of a hotter future for which Montreal is ill-prepared.
According to data recently published( https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-atlas-shows-projected-impact-of-climate-change-across-canadas/ ) by the Prairie Climate Centre at the University of Winnipeg, Montreal, along with much of the rest of the country, must brace for more prolonged hot spells, the likes of which we endured last week. The Climate Atlas of Canada( https://climateatlas.ca/ ) allows the public to take stock of the potential impact of human-caused climate change in their own backyards.
The data on Montreal( ///Users/ahanes/Downloads/Municipality%20Montr%C3%A9al.pdf ) shows that the average annual number of very hot days (when the temperature rose to 30 C or greater) was a manageable eight between 1976 and 2005. But an analysis projects that the total could jump to a mean of 24 each year between 2021 and 2050 and 50 per year from 2051 to 2080 if carbon emissions continue at their current rate. The same scientific analysis suggests the number of 30 C-plus days would be reduced slightly in a low-carbon scenario, if emissions are kept in check. But either way, Montreal ought to be bracing for such heat waves to become longer, more intense and more common.
This comes as heat records worldwide( https://globalnews.ca/news/4311444/heat-wave-weather-across-the-world/ ) are being shattered so far this year.
And yet Montreal is woefully ill-equipped to handle the havoc summer could throw our way. Some hospital wings and long-term care homes don't have air conditioning, as patients recovering from surgery at Notre-Dame Hospital found out the hard way. Some brought their own fans or had to cover themselves with wet towels.
A few hot days last September underscored the fact very few schools have air conditioning. This may be unsurprising in central Montreal, where many school buildings are old, crumbling and in need of renovation to begin with. But not all new schools are constructed with AC, either - which is short-sighted in light of what we know about the local effects of global warming.
Cities around the world( https://www.iisd.org/faq/building-a-climate-resilient-city/ ) are taking stock of and planning for the fallout from climate change, from higher sea levels to wild weather. Part of this is preparing for and working to avoid disasters, like the flooding we saw in parts of the Montreal region last spring, or the wildfires that scorched Fort McMurray in 2016. The other part of it is developing policies, protocols and regulations to make cities more resilient, so they can withstand various climate-related phenomenon to begin with. From zoning that protects natural assets like wetlands, investments in green space, and updated building codes that take into account the future needs of residents, such critical measures are required to mitigate what lies in store.
The city of Montreal adopted its first, five-year climate-adaptation strategy( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7237,75085661&_dad=portal&_schema=portal ) in 2015 to tackle many of these issues head on. But when it comes to the resources and the basic means for dealing with heat, we are starting from way behind. Sending firefighters door to door and imploring the public to check in on their neighbours is a crisis response. That's not going to cut it long term, when broiling summers become the norm.
In Montreal we know winter. We know wind chill and flurries, ice storms and blizzards. We know snow plowing, snow clearing, salting and de-icing. In other words, we have the experience, the know-how, infrastructure and the accompanying budgets to handle almost anything winter throws at us.
But as last week's events clearly demonstrate, we now must treat summer with the same seriousness.

Full text: Was that so hard?
In its annual closing news conference, Saturday, the Montreal International Jazz Festival did what neither SLAV director Robert Lepage( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ) nor singer Betty Bonifassi appeared able to over the past two weeks: they apologized.
For more than 30 minutes, jazz fest president and general director Jacques-André Dupont sat before reporters, fielded questions, and admitted that mistakes had been made in the festival's reaction to the uproar surrounding the controversial production.
The "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," featuring a white director and mostly white cast, drew charges of cultural appropriation and was officially cancelled on Wednesday.
It's not every year that most of the jazz fest wrap-up session is spent talking about a single show. It's usually a rather tame and convivial affair, with programmers touting their personal highlights and media lobbing softballs about attendance, and whether the musically diverse event can still be considered a jazz fest.
Dozens of protesters demonstrated in front of Theatre du Nouveau Monde during the three performances of SLAV that went ahead before it was cancelled.
But this year was like no other in memory. SLAV began its run on June 26, two nights before the beginning of the festival. And though it played for only three of the scheduled 16 performances, the debate surrounding the show extended right up to the jazz fest's final day.
With a heat wave blanketing Montreal for much of the festival, it felt like the city was the setting for a reboot of Spike Lee's 1989 film Do The Right Thing, in which racial unrest consumes New York on the hottest day of the year.
Dupont extended his support to Lepage and Bonifassi, but also expressed his and the festival's understanding of the dissent expressed by Montreal's black community.
He and the jazz fest's VP of programming Laurent Saulnier emerged from a four-hour meeting with members of the black community on Friday with a greater appreciation of the latter's concerns.
"We're being told that the world is changing, that we should listen more," Dupont said, "that some subjects we don't understand well - that there are issues for Montreal's black community that we don't get.
"It was about having a real discussion. Some things that were said were hard, but at the same time, it was really constructive. I was really happy, because we want to do more, and I want us to do better."
And with that simple mea culpa, Dupont and the jazz fest added welcome nuance to a debate that has too often been framed as an assault on artistic freedom.
The only hiccup in the festival's stance was the admission that its real reasons for cancelling the show on Wednesday were Bonifassi's injury( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says?video_autoplay=true ) - she broke her ankle after the third performance, June 28 - and public security.
Dupont did well to specify that the festival was concerned for the safety of jazz fest attendees, artists and "the people who come to protest on the site - the security of everyone."
But he went on to single out the "aggressiveness" of some protestors, specifying that "though some people protested in an extremely correct, pacifist manner, some people were very aggressive, and the festival feared that if we continued, there could be (incidents)."
While the broader safety concerns are credible, it is worth noting that the only violent acts documented during the protests occurred when an elderly white woman entering the theatre slapped a young black female protestor on opening night; following which, police pushed away Montreal singer-songwriter Pierre Kwenders.
American rock band The War On Drugs performed a free outdoor show before a packed crowd, Saturday, to close out the 39th Montreal International Jazz Festival.
The 39(th) jazz fest came to a close Saturday night as throngs of music-lovers swarmed a packed festival site to take in the soaring sounds of Grammy-winning American rock band The War On Drugs.
This critic's personal highlights included the infectious energy of Toronto R&B upstart Jessie Reyez( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/jazz-fest-free-outdoor-blowout-review-jessie-reyez-brings-the-heat-to-the-streets ), who headlined the mid-fest free outdoor blowout; the mischievous spirit of innovative American jazz vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant and the spell cast by Belgian chanteuse Melanie De Biasio.
Among jazz fest VP Saulnier's favourites were Seal, British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings' band Sons of Kemet, as well as a flurry of local acts including Montreal-Brooklyn collective Megative, Nomadic Massive and Haitian-Québécoise artists Dominique Fils-Aimé and Mélissa Laveaux.
George Thorogood works the crowd during a performance on July 1.
Festival co-founder André Ménard's list included Ry Cooder, George Thorogood, jazz fest faves Gogo Penguin, John Medeski, Montrealer Jordan Officer and New York's Too Many Zooz.
Ménard also made a special mention of the emotional performance by veteran Montreal jazz singer Ranee Lee, who took the stage Friday evening at L'Astral despite having just lost her husband of 46 years and longtime collaborator, guitarist Richard Ring.
"Rather than stay home, she decided to do a concert," Ménard said, going on to reveal that he invited Lee back, on the spot, to play next year's 40(th) edition, June 27 to July 7, 2019, which will be Ménard's last.

Tips to help pets stay cool and safe during record-breaking temperatures

Full text: Paige Theng doused her dog Duke in cold water multiple times on each walk they took during last week's heat wave in Montreal. She bought an air conditioner for her N.D.G. home - something she wouldn't have done had it not been for Duke. But the dog still got diarrhea and struggled through the record-breaking temperatures.
Furry animals like dogs and cats have a limited capacity to sweat, according to Dr. Carole-Anne Laurin, a veterinarian at SPCA Montreal. That leaves them more susceptible than humans to heat stroke.
Some pets are even more sensitive to the heat, including shortnosed dogs and animals that are obese. Pay extra close attention for signs of heat stroke in these animals.
When walking a dog, keep your strolls shorter than usual and avoid going out in the hot afternoons. Walk in the shade and along the grass, and avoid giving the dog intense physical exercise. Laurin says hot weather offers a good opportunity to focus on mental stimulation. Fifteen minutes of mental stimulation - such as teaching your dog tricks or playing games - can be equivalent to one hour of running for a dog, according to the veterinarian.
Other ways to keep an animal cool include taking them swimming in a lake or pitching a kiddie pool in your backyard. Offer them frozen treats. Try filling a balloon with water, freezing it, then removing the balloon and giving the ball of ice to them like a big frozen lollipop.
If you think your pet might have heat stroke, take them to a veterinarian immediately. On the way, wrap them in a cold towel, but don't put ice or ice packs directly on their body.
Never leave your dog in a parked car. "The temperature can get up to 20 degrees higher within 10 minutes even in a parked car or a car that has the windows down. You're risking your animal's life when you're leaving them in a parked car," Laurin said.
It's usually not recommended to shave your animal, Laurin said.
"The fur protects them from UV rays and it seems to have insulating properties even against the heat," said Laurin.
If you have shaved your animal, make sure to apply sunscreen before bringing them outside.
As for birds, snakes and other animals, keep their cages out of direct sunlight and don't put them directly next to air conditioning units.

Full text: Was that so hard?
In its annual closing news conference, Saturday, the Montreal International Jazz Festival did what neither SLAV director Robert Lepage( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ) nor singer Betty Bonifassi appeared able to over the past two weeks: they apologized.
For more than 30 minutes, jazz fest president and general director Jacques-André Dupont sat before reporters, fielded questions, and admitted that mistakes had been made in the festival's reaction to the uproar surrounding the controversial production.
The "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," featuring a white director and mostly white cast, drew charges of cultural appropriation and was officially cancelled on Wednesday.
It's not every year that most of the jazz fest wrap-up session is spent talking about a single show. It's usually a rather tame and convivial affair, with programmers touting their personal highlights and media lobbing softballs about attendance, and whether the musically diverse event can still be considered a jazz fest.

Among jazz fest VP Saulnier's favourites were Seal, British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings' band Sons of Kemet, as well as a flurry of local acts including Montreal-Brooklyn collective Megative, Nomadic Massive and Haitian-Québécoise artists Dominique Fils-Aimé and Mélissa Laveaux.

Full text: Was that so hard?
In its annual closing news conference, Saturday, the Montreal International Jazz Festival did what neither SLAV director Robert Lepage( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ) nor singer Betty Bonifassi appeared able to over the past two weeks: they apologized.
For more than 30 minutes, jazz fest president and general director Jacques-André Dupont sat before reporters, fielded questions, and admitted that mistakes had been made in the festival's reaction to the uproar surrounding the controversial production.
The "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," featuring a white director and mostly white cast, drew charges of cultural appropriation and was officially cancelled on Wednesday.
It's not every year that most of the jazz fest wrap-up session is spent talking about a single show. It's usually a rather tame and convivial affair, with programmers touting their personal highlights and media lobbing softballs about attendance, and whether the musically diverse event can still be considered a jazz fest.
Dozens of protesters demonstrated in front of Theatre du Nouveau Monde during the three performances of SLAV that went ahead before it was cancelled.
But this year was like no other in memory. SLAV began its run on June 26, two nights before the beginning of the festival. And though it played for only three of the scheduled 16 performances, the debate surrounding the show extended right up to the jazz fest's final day.
With a heat wave blanketing Montreal for much of the festival, it felt like the city was the setting for a reboot of Spike Lee's 1989 film Do The Right Thing, in which racial unrest consumes New York on the hottest day of the year.
Dupont extended his support to Lepage and Bonifassi, but also expressed his and the festival's understanding of the dissent expressed by Montreal's black community.
He and the jazz fest's VP of programming Laurent Saulnier emerged from a four-hour meeting with members of the black community on Friday with a greater appreciation of the latter's concerns.
"We're being told that the world is changing, that we should listen more," Dupont said, "that some subjects we don't understand well - that there are issues for Montreal's black community that we don't get.
"It was about having a real discussion. Some things that were said were hard, but at the same time, it was really constructive. I was really happy, because we want to do more, and I want us to do better."
And with that simple mea culpa, Dupont and the jazz fest added welcome nuance to a debate that has too often been framed as an assault on artistic freedom.
The only hiccup in the festival's stance was the admission that its real reasons for cancelling the show on Wednesday were Bonifassi's injury( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says?video_autoplay=true ) - she broke her ankle after the third performance, June 28 - and public security.
Dupont did well to specify that the festival was concerned for the safety of jazz fest attendees, artists and "the people who come to protest on the site - the security of everyone."
But he went on to single out the "aggressiveness" of some protestors, specifying that "though some people protested in an extremely correct, pacifist manner, some people were very aggressive, and the festival feared that if we continued, there could be (incidents)."
While the broader safety concerns are credible, it is worth noting that the only violent acts documented during the protests occurred when an elderly white woman entering the theatre slapped a young black female protestor on opening night; following which, police pushed away Montreal singer-songwriter Pierre Kwenders.
American rock band The War On Drugs performed a free outdoor show before a packed crowd, Saturday, to close out the 39th Montreal International Jazz Festival.
The 39(th) jazz fest came to a close Saturday night as throngs of music-lovers swarmed a packed festival site to take in the soaring sounds of Grammy-winning American rock band The War On Drugs.
This critic's personal highlights included the infectious energy of Toronto R&B upstart Jessie Reyez( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/jazz-fest-free-outdoor-blowout-review-jessie-reyez-brings-the-heat-to-the-streets ), who headlined the mid-fest free outdoor blowout; the mischievous spirit of innovative American jazz vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant and the spell cast by Belgian chanteuse Melanie Di Blasio.
Among jazz fest VP Saulnier's favourites were Seal, British saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings' band Sons of Kemet, as well as a flurry of local acts including Montreal-Brooklyn collective Megative, Nomadic Massive and Haitian-Québécoise artists Dominique Fils-Aimé and Mélissa Laveaux.
George Thorogood works the crowd during a performance on July 1.
Festival co-founder André Ménard's list included Ry Cooder, George Thorogood, jazz fest faves Gogo Penguin, John Medeski, Montrealer Jordan Officer and New York's Too Many Zooz.
Ménard also made a special mention of the emotional performance by veteran Montreal jazz singer Ranee Lee, who took the stage Friday evening at L'Astral despite having just lost her husband of 46 years and longtime collaborator, guitarist Richard Ring.
"Rather than stay home, she decided to do a concert," Ménard said, going on to reveal that he invited Lee back, on the spot, to play next year's 40(th) edition, June 27 to July 7, 2019, which will be Ménard's last.

Watch: How to help pets stay cool and safe during intense heat

Full text: Paige Theng doused her dog Duke in cold water multiple times on each walk they took during last week's heat wave in Montreal. She bought an air conditioner for her N.D.G. home - something she wouldn't have done had it not been for Duke. But the dog still got diarrhea and struggled through the record-breaking temperatures.
Furry animals like dogs and cats have a limited capacity to sweat, according to Dr. Carole-Anne Laurin, a veterinarian at SPCA Montreal. That leaves them more susceptible than humans to heat stroke.
Some pets are even more sensitive to the heat, including short-nosed dogs and animals that are obese. Pay extra close attention for signs of heat stroke in these animals.
When walking a dog, keep your strolls shorter than usual and avoid going out in the hot afternoons. Walk in the shade and along the grass, and avoid giving the dog intense physical exercise. Laurin says hot weather offers a good opportunity to focus on mental stimulation. Fifteen minutes of mental stimulation - such as teaching your dog tricks or playing games - can be equivalent to one hour of running for a dog, according to the veterinarian.
Other ways to keep an animal cool include taking them swimming in a lake or pitching a kiddie pool in your backyard. Offer them frozen treats. Try filling a balloon with water, freezing it, then removing the balloon and giving the ball of ice to them like a big frozen lollipop.
If you think your pet might have heat stroke, take them to a veterinarian immediately. On the way, wrap them in a cold towel, but don't put ice or ice packs directly on their body.
Never leave your dog in a parked car. "The temperature can get up to 20 degrees higher within 10 minutes even in a parked car or a car that has the windows down. You're risking your animal's life when you're leaving them in a parked car," Laurin said.
It's usually not recommended to shave your animal, Laurin said.
"The fur protects them from UV rays and it seems to have insulating properties even against the heat," said Laurin.
If you have shaved your animal, make sure to apply sunscreen before bringing them outside.
As for birds, snakes and other animals, keep their cages out of direct sunlight and don't put them directly next to air conditioning units.

Full text: Busy day? Here's what you might have missed.
The Montreal morgue has become crowded as a direct result of the heatwave that swept across Quebec over the past week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-morgue-filled-to-capacity-due-to-heat-related-deaths ). La Presse has reported that the coroner's office had to make an agreement with a funeral home( http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/201807/06/01-5188633-la-morgue-de-montreal-deborde.php ) to house some of the remains. Over the past week, public health officials have emphasized how the intense heat leaves elderly people who live alone at risk. Many of the bodies examined by coroners in recent days were in a state of advanced decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat in a dwelling before being found, according to Jean Brochu, a Montreal coroner. All deaths associated with the heat wave are considered "traumatic" and are the subject of a coroner's inquest. The data collected is used to establish trends and is likely to influence public health interventions in the future. Unclaimed bodies occupy a significant amount of the 128 places available at the morgue, Brochu said.
A Montreal firefighter fell to his death on Pakistan's treacherous K2 mountain( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/canadian-climber-dies-in-fall-on-pakistans-treacherous-k2/wcm/8360e6e6-ccb5-48bb-aca4-97cd689f2141 ). Serge Dessureault, 53, had been a captain with Montreal's fire department, according to a spokesman for the city's firefighters' association. He was leading the nine-member "K2-Broad Peak" expedition up the mountain, which is extremely steep and attracts notoriously bad weather. Karrar Haidri, the secretary of Alpine Club of Pakistan, said Dessureault's body was brought to the mountain's advance base camp and would be transported to Islamabad. A Facebook page following the climb of Dessureault and two other climbers said Dessureault "took a fall near camp 2 at 6,700 metres" early Saturday. "It is with an indescribable sadness that we announce Serge's death this morning," read the message on the page Serge Dessureault, Maurice Beausejour et Nathalie Fortin au K2.
C'est avec une grande tristesse et un immense regret que le SIM a appris le décès du capitaine Serge Dessureault, de la caserne 19, suite à une chute mortelle à proximité du sommet du K2. Nos plus sincères condoléances à la famille ainsi qu'aux collègues pompiers.

Montreal International Jazz Festival organizers say they "could do better" when it comes to racial issues( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jazz-fest-wraps-up ). "We're just starting to listen," jazz fest CEO Jacques-André Dupont said at the festival's closing press conference on Saturday. "It's a very complicated conversation and I haven't started understanding everything." Much of the event centred on SLAV, the cancelled "theatrical odyssey based on slave songs" led by a white director and star. Dupont said that he and Laurent Saulnier, the festival's vice-president for programming, spent four hours Friday speaking with members of the city's black community who approached them to discuss SLAV and the issues black Montrealers face. "We were told that the world is changing ... that we should listen more, that we don't understand some subjects well," he said. Organizers said they did not pre-approve any festival content beforehand and they were "initally surprised" by the negative reactions to SLAV. Dozens of protesters demonstrated in front of the Théatre du Nouveau Monde( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/protesters-denounce-predominantly-white-performance-at-montreal-jazz-festival ) during the three performances of SLAV that went ahead before it was cancelled. Dupont said that a minority of protesters who became violent contributed to the decision to cancel the show. Another factor was the fitness of Bonifassi, who injured her ankle( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/two-performances-of-controversial-show-slav-cancelled-due-to-singers-broken-ankle-jazz-fest-says ) and told organizers she was in no condition to continue performing. In a statement, organizers of the festival said that despite the cancellation of the show, they were proud to be associated with Ex Machina and the show's director, Robert Lepage.

Full text: A total of 33 people have died in Montreal since the beginning of the heat wave, according to public health officials.
The number climbed from yesterday's 28 reported deaths because more bodies were discovered and physicians determined that the deaths occurred at some point during the heat wave, said David Kaiser of Santé Montréal.
The public health agency is still on alert to heat-related health risks but expects a downward trend in the data they use to gauge the level of danger, which includes information on hospitalizations, ambulance transfers and the total number of deaths in the city.
"What we have from this morning seems to indicate that we're trending toward a resolution of the highest level of risk," said David Kaiser of Santé Montréal.
All 33 deaths have occurred in private apartments or seniors' residences, Kaiser said.
"The age and sex profile are essentially what we've been seeing and all of them have, when we have information, some underlying medical condition," Kaiser said.
This story will be updated.

Full text: Despite the much-needed cooler weather, public health officials were still on high alert Friday as the weeklong heat wave that contributed to the deaths of 54 Quebecers comes to an end. The new death toll, up from 33 the day before, was confirmed by a press attaché for Lucie Charlebois, the provincial minister for public health.
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday afternoon, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. The others occurred in the Eastern Townships (9), Mauricie (7), Montérégie (6), Quebec City/Chaudière-Appalaches (1), Lanaudière (1), Laurentians (1) and Laval (1). Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department, explained that physicians and first responders who declare deaths look for one of two things when determining whether they're potentially heat-related.
The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week.
The majority of deaths, Kaiser said, have been cases of someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home. None of the 28 deaths have occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified. Kaiser continued that the individuals who have died due to heat are identified in a variety of ways. Some deaths are discovered more quickly, after an individual does not come down from their room in a residence for breakfast, whereas others take longer, such as cases in which a person is socially isolated, he said.
Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and dayold storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday.
The temperature was expected to drop to 13 C overnight Friday.
The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years. However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation.
The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé. Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said.
The city's heat intervention plan will remain in place until the city indicates otherwise, according to Marilyne Laroche, a spokesperson for the city of Montreal. Presse Canadienne contributed to this report.

Heat Wave More Evidence Of Montreal'S Split Personality

Full text: Welcome home after your weeklong holiday in Death Valley, Quebec, during the hottest, longest stretch of thermonuclear heat since 1946.
It was so muggy Thursday afternoon, you needed a straw to breathe, as if the air was a milkshake. It was so humid, birds were plummeting from the sky with heat stroke, squirrels were spontaneously bursting into flames - and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were spotted stuck in traffic on Décarie Blvd.
But looking back, we did learn a bit about ourselves and our times from the Great Heat Wave of 2018. Just look at: Weather Wealth: The heat wave revealed an important new gap between haves and have-nots, as climate change increases - the haves can afford air conditioning, while the have-nots have nowhere to retreat from the heat.
Fortunately, that's the group the city targeted all week. Montreal police, firefighters and City Hall did a great job going door to door like anti-heat SWAT teams - helping people in apartmentsturned-saunas.
But it has me wondering: If this is our new climate, maybe landlords should be required to put air conditioners in every apartment, as an essential service - like heating. Is air conditioning a basic right in our new global warming world? Until then, perhaps we should just share the air. My son left his apartment and moved back into our house's cooler climate - bringing a friend trapped in an apartment that felt like a furnace. So we took them in as weather refugees.
Maybe there should be a government program urging everyone to adopt-a-heat-refugee next time the temperature soars. I'd be happy to take in a few myself as long as they promise not to clean up anything in my messy office. Weather tech: The city used weather technology well, issuing updated heat advisories, alerts and other emergency warnings.
But I'm not sure we were well served by our own personal addiction to weather technology. It's bad enough we spend all winter staring at our phones'weather apps obsessing over arctic cold fronts, the windchill factor or the latest polar vortex.
Now we're obsessed in summer, too. Last week almost everyone I met was glued to their phones having conversations like this: "Omigod! It's 35 degrees outside, but with the humidex and the UV factor it's actually 47 degrees - and with the 'real feel'index it could be up to 80 C! "There's no way I'm stepping outside without sunblock 600 and a heat shield."
I think weather technology is part of the reason some Montreal municipalities cancelled Canada Day celebrations last Saturday, or postponed them to "fun days" later in the year.
Yes, I realize there were at least 28 heat-related deaths in Montreal in the past week, but these were largely vulnerable people stuck indoors - not outdoors at Canada Day events. Were municipalities anxious about legal risks? If so, why not just issue a warning: "Canada Day festivities will take place as usual, but a heat warning is in effect. Come celebrate at your own risk."
In fact, while I spent recent days working in my air-conditioned office, I lived a pretty normal week otherwise, biking or playing tennis late afternoons, when it was somewhat cooler. Why? Because I shut off my weather apps and refused to judge the weather until I had experienced it. It's hot enough out there at 30-plus degrees without having to worry that it "really feels" 15 degrees hotter.
I know this was a difficult week for many. But we complain about the cold from November through April, so when the heat arrives I think most people should take a break - unless they are an air conditioning have-not.
In addition, our weather apps should have restricted-use warnings like this: "Sorry Josh, you have consulted this app 49 times in the last seven minutes. No further access permitted for the next 53 minutes." On the plus side, huge crowds turned out at the jazz fest every night, especially for Wednesday's megaconcert, where tens of thousands crammed up against each other. Amid all those sweating, breathing, screaming people, it did "really feel" seven degrees hotter than anywhere else. Weather schizophrenia: The heat wave was more evidence that our city has a split personality - summer Montrealer and winter Montrealer - alter egos living opposite lives, because they reside in opposite climates.
Winter Montreal is a voracious eater who loves stews, steak, smoked meat and poutine - which summer Montrealer barely touches. Like many in last week's heat wave, I went vegetarian seeking salads, smoothies, iced coffee, iced tea and ice cream. I've lost five pounds on my Great Heat Wave of 2018 Diet, though I don't know whether that's from eating less, or just perspiring more. Whatever the reason, I suspect summer Montreal weighs 10,000,000 pounds less than winter Montreal. Meanwhile, enjoy the cooler air while it lasts. I hear an inverse summertime UV bombogenesis thundersnow tsunami solar blast heat storm is coming our way.
So duck and cover!

Montreal morgue filled to capacity due to heat-related deaths

Full text: The Montreal morgue has become crowded as a direct result of the heatwave that swept across southern Quebec over the past week.
La Presse has reported that the coroner's office had to make an agreement with a funeral home( http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/201807/06/01-5188633-la-morgue-de-montreal-deborde.php ) to house some of the remains.
Over the past week, public health officials have emphasized how the intense heat leaves elderly people who live alone at risk. Many of the bodies examined by coroners in recent days were in a state of advanced decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat in a dwelling before being found, according to Jean Brochu, a Montreal coroner.
All deaths associated with the heat wave are considered "traumatic" and are the subject of a coroner's inquest. The data collected is used to establish trends and is likely to influence public health interventions in the future.
Unclaimed bodies occupy a significant amount of the 128 places available at the morgue, Brochu said.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Quebec's week-long heat wave contributed to 54 deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends )
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday morning, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department, explained that physicians and first responders who declare deaths look for one of two things when determining whether they're potentially heat-related. The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week.

Environment Canada lifted its week-old heat warning for the Montreal area early Friday. The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years. However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first. The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé. Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
Merchants at Jean-Talon Market decried a plan to replace part of a parking lot with an outdoor seating area( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jean-talon-merchants-oppose-plan-to-build-public-square-in-parking-lot )
The city announced a plan last month to permanently close Shamrock Ave. to cars and make it a place for people to walk and sit, with several seating areas, a picnic area and newly planted trees and plants. Construction on the project began last month and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. However, merchants are miffed that the pedestrianization of Shamrock will result in a new public sitting area near the market's Casgrain Ave. entrance. Lino Birri, whose stall is right near the planned square, said its construction will necessitate removing about 10 parking spots, some of which he uses regularly for deliveries, and others that are used by his customers. Birri, who employs 50 people at the market and another 100 in his fields around Montreal, said the city should be adding, not removing parking spaces to an area that's already difficult to access by car. Charles Gingras, the manager of Chez Louis, another longtime shop on the market's southern end, said the city has known for years that parking is a problem in the area but has not put in place any meaningful solutions. "For people who want to come and buy a lot of stuff, it's too complicated," Gingras said. Although the city recently built a 50-space indoor lot under the SAQ shop on the western side of the market, it doesn't help those with mobility issues because a promised elevator still has not been built - three years after the parking lot opened.
Montreal International Jazz Festival cancelled the remaining performances of SLAV on Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/jazz-fest-cancels-remaining-slav-performances?video_autoplay=true )
Billed as "a theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," the show had been accused of cultural appropriation and insensitivity. Its director, Robert Lepage, and star, Betty Bonifassi, are both white. A swiftly-organized protest on the first night of the run, Tuesday, June 26, set in motion a wave of reactions in the press and online. Social media exploded with debate on the topic. Two shows were cancelled last Friday after Bonifassi fractured her ankle. Two days turned into four, as Monday and Tuesday's performances were subsequently cancelled. But it was L.A. post-soul singer Moses Sumney's decision to pull out of the jazz fest and instead perform an off-festival show at La Sala Rossa, Tuesday night (which turned into two shows after the first one sold out), that may have been the tipping point. Tuesday afternoon, Sumney made public his letter to the jazz fest( http://mosessumney.tumblr.com/post/175516153503/i-recently-decided-to-pull-out-of-the-montreal ) explaining in detail why he would not be performing at the event. On Wednesday morning, an open letter of protest( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK2rgBhNjQSQy8LWtu7y9ClVGl_XFsv57A8FNIqZzuPjvHeg/viewform ) against the show was released, bearing over 1,500 signatures.
"Since the beginning of SLAV performances, the festival team has been shaken and strongly affected by all the comments received," the jazz fest said in a statement Wednesday. "We would like to apologize to those who were hurt. It was not our intention at all. For the Montreal International Jazz Festival, inclusion and reconciliation between communities are essential."Lepage said the move was a "direct blow to artistic freedom( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav )." Hours after his statement was released, the Parti Québécois threw its support behind Lepage, with leader Jean-François Lisée likening the cancellation to censorship and MNA Maka Kotto describing it as "intellectual terrorism."
Montreal Canadiens defenceman will be out until mid-December after knee surgery( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-shea-weber-out-until-mid-december-after-knee-surgery )
The Canadiens announced that Weber had arthroscopic surgery last month to repair a meniscal tear in his right knee and the veteran defenceman's recovery period is expected to be six months. Weber also had surgery in March to repair tendons in his left foot. The knee surgery was performed by Dr. Robert LaPrade, an orthopedic surgeon in Vail, Colo. Said Canadiens general manger Marc Bergevin in the team's news release: "We were very disappointed to learn that this knee injury will extend Shea's recovery period. Unfortunately, this is out of our control and we have to fully trust the medical group in these situations. We are confident that his recovery will go as scheduled and that Shea will return to action as soon as possible." Weber missed one game last season against the Minnesota Wild on Nov. 9 at the Bell Centre because of the knee injury. The other 54 games he missed were because of his foot injury. In the 26 games Weber played, he posted 6-10-16 totals and was minus-8 while averaging a team-high 25:21 of ice time.
Friday marked the five-year anniversary of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/lac-megantic-growing-up-after-a-tragedy )
For youth from Lac-Mégantic, where the train derailment and explosion killed 47, grief has been a formative experience. A recent study examined the impact of the fatal train derailment on young people in Lac-Mégantic. Although it draws some stark conclusions, one of its authors says the overall message is a hopeful one. Although 25 per cent of the children surveyed showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the rate among adults was 50 per cent, according to Danielle Maltais, a humanities professor at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. "These kids are incredibly resilient, and the adults in their lives have done a great job at caring for them in an impossible situation," Maltais said. The study, however, does hint at a link between the tragedy and self-harming behaviour. Some 39 per cent of teenage respondents said they had suicidal thoughts in the last year - roughly twice the provincial average. Twenty-one per cent of high school students seriously considered harming themselves. That's three times higher than the Quebec average. If they didn't lose a parent or a loved one, the youth in Lac-Mégantic lost their town square - a place that contained memories of St-Jean Baptiste celebrations in the park or trips to the ice cream parlour.

In fact, while I spent recent days working in my air-conditioned office, I lived a pretty normal week otherwise, biking or playing tennis late afternoons, when it was somewhat cooler. Why? Because I shut off my weather apps and refused to judge the weather until I had experienced it. It's hot enough out there at 30-plus degrees without having to worry that it "really feels" 15 degrees hotter.
I know this was a difficult week for many. But we complain about the cold from November through April, so when the heat arrives I think most people should take a break - unless they are an air conditioning have-not.
In addition, our weather apps should have restricted-use warnings like this: "Sorry Josh, you have consulted this app 49 times in the last 7 minutes. No further access permitted for the next 53 minutes." On the plus side, huge crowds turned out at the jazz fest every night, especially for Wednesday's mega-concert, where tens of thousands crammed up against each other. Amid all those sweating, breathing, screaming people, it did "really feel" seven degrees hotter than anywhere else.
Weather schizophrenia: The heat wave was more evidence that our city has a split personality - summer Montrealer and winter Montrealer - alter egos living opposite lives, because they reside in opposite climates.
Winter Montreal is a voracious eater who loves stews, steak, smoked meat and poutine - which summer Montrealer barely touches. Like many in last week's heat wave, I went vegetarian seeking salads, smoothies, iced coffee, iced tea and ice cream. I've lost five pounds on my Great Heat Wave of 2018 Diet, though I don't know whether that's from eating less, or just perspiring more. Whatever the reason, I suspect summer Montreal weighs 10,000,000 pounds less than winter Montreal. Meanwhile, enjoy the cooler air while it lasts. I hear an inverse summertime UV bombogenesis thundersnow tsunami solar blast heat storm is coming our way.
So duck and cover!

The week-long heat wave is now over, but the death toll in Quebec climbed to 54 on Friday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends ). A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday morning, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. The majority of deaths involved someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home, said Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department. None of the 28 deaths occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified. Environment Canada lifted its week-old heat warning for the Montreal area early Friday. The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years. However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first. The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé. Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
Brace for a traffic nightmare centring on the Décarie Expressway in N.D.G.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/traffic-nightmares-forecast-for-decarie-expressway-in-n-d-g ) Starting Monday at 5 a.m., construction work on the Décarie Expressway and Highway 15 will force the closure of the Sherbrooke St. entrance to the Décarie Expressway northbound, and the exit leading to Sherbrooke St. off of the Décarie northbound. Drivers who usually exit there are being advised to take the Côte-St-Luc/Queen Mary exit, which is already heavily used. "This could be the worst," said Notre-Dame-de-Grâce city councillor Peter McQueen, which is saying a lot coming from a neighbourhood so negatively affected by the reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange it has spawned headlines like "Escape from N.D.G." But McQueen added a light at the end of the tunnel. The Sherbrooke St. entrance to the Décarie is expected to re-open in September. The Sherbrooke St. exit will reopen at the end of October. And the lane reductions are expected to be completed by November, said Transports Québec spokesman Martin Girard.

The Parti Québécois is backing director Robert Lepage following the cancellation of SLAV, his jazz fest show( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ). Lepage broke his silence over a decision by the Montreal International Jazz Festival to shut down his controversial production after just three performances, saying the move was a "direct blow to artistic freedom." Hours after his statement was released, the Parti Québécois threw its support behind Lepage, with leader Jean-François Lisée likening the cancellation to censorship and MNA Maka Kotto describing it as "intellectual terrorism." PQ MNA Pascal Bérubé called on Quebec Culture Minister Marie Montpetit to take a stand, saying the shuttering of the show sets "a precedent that will leave its mark on creators and artists." Friday afternoon, Montpetit weighed in, calling on Lepage and festival officials to begin a dialogue. "Freedom of expression and creation are fundamental elements in our society and should always be protected," she tweeted. "However, we can't control or judge the way people feel." The production, which features songs composed by slave cultures including black slaves in the United States, was criticized for having a mostly white cast and a white director. Protesters accused the show of appropriation of black culture.
Construction entrepreneur Antonio Accurso has filed a request to be released from a penitentiary while he appeals his conviction for his role in Laval's municipal corruption( https://montrealgazette.com/news/accurso-asks-for-release-while-he-appeals-laval-corruption-conviction ). Accurso, 66, received a four-year prison term for taking part in the system of collusion created by former Laval mayor Gilles Vaillancourt through which contracts were awarded, between 1996 and 2010, to dozens of companies before they were put to tender. Accurso's lawyer, Marc Labelle, said he expects to be able to argue for Accurso's release before the Quebec Court of Appeal in Montreal on Tuesday. As part of his arguments in his request to be released, Accurso states he wants to be free while he deals with his other legal woes, including two impaired driving-related cases he faces at the municipal courthouse in Deux-Montagnes, the city where he resides. In one case, that dates back to 2011, he is accused of driving while impaired. The other case, filed last year, alleges Accurso refused to submit to a breathalyzer test after being pulled over just before midnight on May 15, 2017.

Heat wave death toll reaches 54 in Quebec

Full text: Despite the much-needed cooler weather, public health officials were still on high alert Friday as the week-long heat wave that contributed to the deaths of 54 Quebecers comes to an end.
The new death toll, up from 33 the day before( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ), was confirmed by a press attaché for Lucie Charlebois, the provincial minister for public health.
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday afternoon, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. The others occurred in the Eastern Townships (9), Mauricie (7), Montérégie (6), Quebec City/Chaudière-Appalaches (1), Lanaudière (1), Laurentians (1) and Laval (1).
Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department, explained that physicians and first responders who declare deaths look for one of two things when determining whether they're potentially heat-related.
The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week.
The majority of deaths, Kaiser said, have been cases of someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home. None of the 28 deaths have occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified.
Kaiser continued that the individuals who have died due to heat are identified in a variety of ways. Some deaths are discovered more quickly, after an individual does not come down from their room in a residence for breakfast, whereas others take longer, such as cases in which a person is socially isolated, he said.
Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and day-old storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday.
The temperature was expected to drop to 13 C overnight Friday.
The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years.
However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first.
The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé.
Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
"Today, we're not expecting a decrease in the number of transports," Overhoff said.
Kaiser explained that is because it can take longer for someone who lives with a pre-existing condition to return to their regular temperature after several consecutive days in the extreme heat.
"Their body gradually just gets overwhelmed, so the heat stress just adds to the underlying disease," he said. "That will take a few days of more normal temperatures to get back to normal."
Santé Montréal director Mylène Drouin confirmed on Twitter that the city will be continuing its door-to-door checks on vulnerable residents.

The city's heat intervention plan( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-gives-update-on-heat-wave ) will remain in place until the city indicates otherwise, according to Marilyne Laroche, a spokesperson for the city of Montreal.

Quebec focuses on heat-wave lessons: Elderly and the ill hit hardest as 54 die in province where many lack air conditioning

Full text: With the end of a brutal heat wave that is being blamed for the deaths of 54 people, many of them elderly men and women who died alone in sweltering apartments, Quebec publichealth authorities are turning to trying to find solutions to prevent such tragedies in the future.
They will zero in on each death to try to determine how the lives of people at risk can be spared as heat spells become more frequent.
"Despite what we put in place in the last four, five days, some of the most vulnerable people are not being reached, and that is the central focus of the work we have to do," said David Kaiser, a physician with Montreal's health department.
The largest loss of lives happened in Montreal, where 28 died and many others were left reeling during the week of scorching weather. Calls for ambulance services shot up 30 per cent as paramedics treated people for ailments ranging from exhaustion to breathing difficulties to confusion. Often, medics entered apartments that felt like ovens.
"There was no air. It was suffocating," said Stefan Overhoff, an operational chief with the Urgences Santé ambulance service who worked all week. "Think of temperatures 43 C, 45 C. You open a window and nothing happens."
He said Friday that many calls were to people in upper floors of buildings where hot air became trapped. "Some people don't have the means to get a good fan or air conditioner."
According to figures released Friday, 40 per cent of the deaths in Montreal were women, all of them 60 or more years of age.
Could air-conditioning habits have played a role in Quebec's death toll? Ontario is not releasing figures on fatalities related to this week's heat, which also rolled over parts of that province. However, Ontario residents can more readily rely on air conditioners to survive extreme temperatures. Only 53 per cent of households in Quebec have air conditioning, compared with 83 per cent in Ontario and 57 per cent nationwide, according to 2015 figures from Statistics Canada.
Physicians say those most sensitive to extreme heat are the elderly, young children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases.
"But those who live on low incomes - those who don't have access to air conditioning, pools or cool spaces - are most vulnerable particularly when a heat wave is prolonged as it has been this week," says Jean Zigby, a Montreal physician and past president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.
The group cited a report showing Montreal can expect more heat waves as a result of climate change. Before 2005, Montreal had an average eight days a year with temperatures hotter than 30 C. By 2050, the number is forecast to jump to 50 days a year.
One of the biggest factors that can determine life or death in situations such as heat waves is whether individuals have access to a support system of friends or family, said David Wachsmuth, Canada Research Chair in urban governance at McGill University in Montreal.
"There is a really large social component to this," Mr. Wachsmuth said. "The quality of their social networks is a gigantic factor in predicting who is going to come out okay."
Rather than leaving it up to chance, he said it's up to cities to create programs that can target people who live alone, have underlying health problems or are otherwise at risk during extreme heat events. Urban centres face unique challenges during heat waves because they become "heat islands" - meaning they get hotter than rural areas. A number of factors, including reduced green space and the fact concrete absorbs the sun's energy, can make cities a few degrees hotter than outlying areas.
The temperature in Montreal this week climbed into the mid 30s, but drenching humidity made it feel as hot as in the mid 40s. The city got a reprieve from the intense heat Friday as daytime temperatures dipped below 20 C.
With a report from Carly Weeks
URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT
Urban centres tend to be a few degrees hotter than outlying areas, which experts say is attributable to several causes. Concrete roads and buildings absorb sunlight, allowing heat to accumulate throughout the day. Cities also don't have as many trees or green spaces, which means they don't experience the cooling effect these provide. A lack of airflow from tall buildings, pollution and other factors also make cities hotter than the country.

The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week.
The majority of deaths, Kaiser said, have been cases of someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home. None of the 28 deaths have occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified.
Kaiser continued that the individuals who have died due to heat are identified in a variety of ways. Some deaths are discovered more quickly, after an individual does not come down from their room in a residence for breakfast, whereas others take longer, such as cases in which a person is socially isolated, he said.
Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and day-old storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday.
The forecast for Friday calls for a high of 25 C and a humidex of 31 C. The temperature is expected to drop to 13 C Friday night.
The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years.
However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first.
The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé.
Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
"Today, we're not expecting a decrease in the number of transports," Overhoff said.
Kaiser explained that is because it can take longer for someone who lives with a pre-existing condition to return to their regular temperature after several consecutive days in the extreme heat.
"Their body gradually just gets overwhelmed, so the heat stress just adds to the underlying disease," he said. "That will take a few days of more normal temperatures to get back to normal."
Santé Montréal director Mylène Drouin confirmed on Twitter that the city will be continuing its door-to-door checks on vulnerable residents.

Beating the heat takes a community; City's response has been solid, but we all have a duty to reach out to others

Full text: Sprinklers, sticky Popsicles and community pools - these are some of the things that come to mind when I recall my childhood summers. Growing up mostly without AC, we'd bear the summer heat while staying hydrated as best as we could.
In the days long before splash pads, a sprinkler was enough to entertain us for hours at a time. We'd run through it shrieking with excitement. If we wanted to be particularly festive, we might even rip up a garbage bag to slide on with water from the hose. Yes, the slip and slide existed back then, but was a frivolous purchase when garbage bags could suffice.
Adult life, however, brings greater responsibilities. As a member of what has come to be called the sandwich generation, I have found myself in a sticky predicament during the recent heat wave. I have been concerned about my elderly father's health and well-being without proper air conditioning and about my children staying hydrated and not being overly exposed to the heat. We have opened our air-conditioned home up to friends and family needing a place to cool down over the past week and have tried calling relatives to make sure they are taken care of.
It's been more critical than ever before to reach out to our loved ones to make sure they are safe, cool and hydrated during the intense heat that as of Thursday, had cost 33 lives across Quebec. While Friday promises a return to normal seasonal temperatures, chances are that we'll suffer at least one more heat wave before the end of the summer.
This time around, I have been impressed with the city of Montreal's proactive response; it should become standard practice. Opening up municipal buildings, extending pool and splash pad hours and even setting up city sprinklers for residents to cool off at have been excellent initiatives.
Even so, some people may not know about local community efforts, or may not avail themselves of them for any number of reasons. Those who are isolated, experiencing health problems, mentally unstable or lonely may not consider forcing themselves out of their homes to escape the heat. That's why outreach to our friends and neighbours, as Mayor Valérie Plante urged, is so important.
Another municipal official who made the right call was Pierrefonds-Roxboro Borough Mayor Jim Beis. When Beis announced he would be cancelling the Canada Day parade out of concern for the well-being of participants, he drew the ire of some residents. They complained that city officials were overly cautious and that if they merely gave out water, we should be OK to proceed. However, the sweltering weather on Canada Day proved that the city had in fact, made the right call in cancelling a parade that would have had volunteers and entertainers walk the four-kilometre course in heavy non-breathable costumes.
This is not a whole lot different than a severe cold snap. Any form of severe weather can be deadly. As for how to deal with stubborn family members who insist they are OK without air conditioning: Taking them to the movies, inviting them over for a meal or just taking them to the mall are great excuses to make sure everyone stays safe. When the temperature soars, we all need to play a role in reaching out to our friends and family. Generally speaking, people don't want to impose. Sometimes merely posting on social media for family and friends to reach out if they don't have air conditioning can go a long way.
So when there's a heat wave, continue sipping on the slushy drinks, but be sure to check in to make sure your loved ones are safe, as if their lives depended on it. Because they do.

Of these, 18 died in Montreal from heat-related complications, up from 12 a day earlier; Montérégie had two deaths, the Eastern Townships had seven, Laval one and Mauricie five.
Most of the victims were men between the ages of 50 and 85 who lived alone in "heat islands" in highrise apartments with no air conditioning, or suffered from chronic health or precarious living conditions, including homelessness, mental health issues and substance use.
Even one death is too many, said Lucie Charlebois, the provincial public health minister, at a press conference Thursday. But some people are more vulnerable than others to extreme heat and smog, she said.
Charlebois defended the province's emergency approach in the face of record-breaking temperatures.
None of the deaths occurred in a public long-term care nursing home, a centre d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée or in a hospital. Those who died were already suffering from health problems, she said.
Montreal's civil protection agency door-to-door campaign visited more than 3,400 homes. Urgences-Santé logged 30 per cent more calls for help since the weekend. It responded to more than 1,200 calls and dispatched 695 ambulances.
"We're doing the best we can," Charlebois said. "All deaths are regrettable. We'd like to have no deaths at all, but every day people die."
As for patients in hospitals and palliative care centres who are being told to bring their own fans, Charlebois said provisions have been made to move them into cooler common areas with air conditioning for a couple of hours a day to minimize the impact of the heat.
A 10-year plan to improve older, dilapidated facilities is now underway, Charlebois said. "But nothing can be done in 10 minutes."
Meanwhile, everything is being done to ensure the comfort of patients and workers in health facilities without air conditioning, she said.
The criticism from the Coalition Avenir Québec and Parti Québécois Wednesday that her government failed to respond quickly enough to the heat wave, for example, by putting cooling units in every facility, "is indecent," Charlebois said. The opposition is playing petty politics on the backs of the most vulnerable segment of the population, she said.
According to Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, the extreme heat intervention plan was launched a day early because of a spike in visits to hospital emergency rooms. However, until the provincial coroner investigates, it will be difficult to say with certainty what caused the current wave of deaths, she added.
It's not clear why Quebec seems to have had more deaths than provinces like Ontario, which is also in the grip of extreme heat and humidity. Quebec remains vigilant about recording heat-related deaths, but other provinces may have different reporting systems, Drouin said.
But those most at risk include the elderly and individuals with health conditions who are living in inner-city hot spots - areas with lots of asphalt and little vegetation. These heat islands can register temperatures five to 10 degrees higher than at the Dorval weather station, she said.
Floods, tornadoes, heat waves and extreme cold in winter are only expected to become more common, Drouin said. "Because we know that the vulnerable population has the most difficulties, we have to work on social determinants (of health) to lower poverty and make sure that those people have the resources to adapt to extreme events."
The temperature in Montreal reached a high of 34 degrees Celsius on Thursday with a humidex value of 43 C, according to Environment Canada.
The heat wave was expected to break overnight Thursday to Friday. Dr. Horacio Arruda, assistant deputy minister of health and social services, said warning signs of dehydration include dry skin and lips, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, dark urine and sunken eyes. Individuals should drink six to eight glasses of water per day, avoid alcoholic beverages, spend about two hours in a cool, air-conditioned environment and limit physical activities.

It warned that atmospheric conditions were favourable for the formation of strong storms, warning of the possibility of strong wind gusts that could "toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles."
Meteorologist Alexandre Parent said that storms could appear this evening as a cold front moved into the region, signalling the end to the heat wave that scorched the city all week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ).

Quebec's lethal heat wave claims at least 33 lives: Most of those who died in Montreal were lone, older men found in stifling apartments

Full text: Quebec's lethal heat spell is coming to an end with a bleak tally of at least 33 deaths and a sharper picture of those whose lives it claimed: Mostly lone, older men who were found in stifling apartments with temperatures as hot as 35 C.
Details on the victims emerged as public-health officials focused on how to deal with weather disasters such as heat waves that are expected to increase in frequency.
"With climate change, heat waves will probably be much more frequent, and we'll have to adapt," Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, said in an interview on Thursday. "Most people will survive them without any problem.
But for others with risk factors, they can kill them." The extreme weather was forecast to peter out on Friday after blanketing swaths of Quebec in stifling heat and humidity for a week. Thursday offered no respite, with temperatures rising to a record-breaking 34 C in Montreal and the humidex factor making it feel like a punishing 45 C.
Health officials put the province's death toll at 33 on Thursday, and Dr. Arruda said he expects the number to keep climbing in coming days as reports from front-line health workers filter in.
In the meantime, the profile of the 18 who died in Montreal has become clearer.
They were overwhelmingly men aged 53 to 85 who lived alone and had health issues such as schizophrenia or heart disease.
Their housing conditions increased their vulnerability. Most lived on the upper floors of multistorey buildings, where heat rose and became trapped.
When ambulance technicians entered their apartments, they found smothering conditions with no air conditioning and temperatures exceeding 30 and even 35 degrees.
For someone with a chronic disease, "it's highly likely that heat is what put them over the edge," said David Kaiser, a physician with Montreal's public-health department.
Dr. Arruda said the victims were alone. "If you have health problems, you might not realize you're in the process of deteriorating."
Geography mattered as well.
Most of the homes were in heat islands - zones with little greenery and expanses of concrete that trap heat. They were in densely built neighbourhoods such as Parc Extension and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that ring central and eastern Montreal.
"If you live in the suburbs in a house with a pool and air conditioning, you're not facing the same conditions as someone who's unemployed and living in downtown Montreal in a small apartment on the fourth floor, where it's very, very hot," Dr. Arruda said.
Parts of Ontario have also been baking in sweltering temperatures but, unlike Quebec, the province has not declared any heat-related deaths. That may be because the two provinces differ in their approach to this week's weather disaster.
In Quebec, as soon as meteorologists predicted a searing heat wave early in the week, publichealth authorities directed frontline workers to pass along reports of deaths they considered heat-related.
The measure was intended to help officials target their prevention efforts as the heat wave progressed.
For example, firefighters in Montreal were dispatched to knock on thousands of doors to check on residents of zones considered at risk.
"It let us activate our prevention measures more rapidly," Dr.
Arruda said. The figures were made public "from a principle of transparency."
Ontario is not releasing data on deaths during the heat wave.
Officials say they do not conclude a cause of death until autopsies are performed, a process that could take at least three months.
"I can't confirm any deaths due to the heat wave," said Cheryl Mahyr, spokesperson for Ontario's Office of the Chief Coroner. "Otherwise, you're asking our office to speculate, and we don't deal in speculation."
Heat waves such as those endured by Central and Eastern Canada this week are expected to become more intense, more common and stretch to larger parts of the planet because of climate change. They are also expected to have increasingly deadly effects. Studies have found that the number of lives lost in heat waves has increased.
Environment Canada is calling for a high of 23 C in Montreal on Friday, and temperatures below 30 C in the early part of next week.

Good evening,
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Quebec health officials attribute 33 deaths in province to heat
At least 33 deaths in Quebec have been attributed to the heat wave that has been ravaging the province for the past six days, as the furnace-like temperatures reached into the mid-40s with the humidity on Thursday.
Montreal's public health director, Mylène Drouin, said that 18 of the people who have died since the heat wave began last week lived in Montreal. The living conditions of the deceased, experts say, may have played a role: Most of the victims, aged 53 to 85, lived on the upper floors of building units without air conditioning. These developments are also in areas of the city known as heat islands, which are urban areas where there is little vegetation and large expanses of heat-retaining concrete.
As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no other heat-related deaths reported in other provinces, though Environment Canada says the heat warning for Southern Ontario, Atlantic Canada and Quebec will remain in effect until Friday morning with the weather agency adding smog warnings for some parts of southern Quebec.

Ex-Quebec construction mogul Tony Accurso gets four-year prison term
Since the Quebec's anti-corruption police force, Unité permanente anti-corruption (UPAC), was created in 2011, prosecutors have laid criminal charges against 331 people and companies, but have achieved only about 114 convictions as of July 1, according to UPAC's annual statistics and 2018 reports. The bulk of the remaining suspects await trial, sometimes for years, while a few others have been acquitted or had cases thrown out or charges dropped.
Today, however, marks a rare moment of celebration of the UPAC force's efforts, as former Quebec construction mogul Tony Accurso received a four-year prison term following his conviction on fraud and corruption charges. A jury had recently found Mr. Accurso guilty on all five charges laid against him, all of which stemmed from a scheme dating back to the late 90s that was orchestrated by a former mayor of Laval and involved a kickback scheme where companies paid off city officials in exchange for public contracts.
New human remains found in Bruce McArthur investigation, Toronto police say
Police confirmed on Thursday that new human remains were found during Wednesday's investigation of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur at a Toronto ravine near a property where they previously found the remains of seven men in planters. The 66-year-old alleged serial killer was arrested last January and charged with the first-degree murders of eight men with ties to Toronto's Gay Village; the remains of the eighth person he is accused of murdering, Majeed Kayhan, have yet to be found.
When police discovered the planters in January, they had attempted to search the Leaside property, where Mr. McArthur had worked as a landscaper for years, but found the earth was too hard and cold to break through. Police confirmed that they will continue working at the site for several more weeks, as there were additional sites flagged by cadaver dogs as points of interest.
Read about the lives of the eight victims of the alleged serial killer who preyed for years on the city's Gay Village in this report from Tu Thanh Ha and Justin Ling.
U.S. ‘opening fire' on world with tariff threats, China says
With the initial round of U.S. tariffs against China set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Friday, China has accused Trump's administration of "opening fire" on the world. The two largest economies will be facing off against one another starting tomorrow, with China warning they will respond immediately to the duties on $34-billion in Chinese goods with tariffs on American goods that they say will disrupt the supplies of components and assembly work of American and foreign companies operating in China.
The trade war could further escalate, as Trump has promised to counter to any response from China with tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Meanwhile, Canada won the bulk of a ruling at the World Trade Organization on Thursday in a dispute over U.S. duties on Canadian exports of supercalendered paper, which is used in glossy magazines and catalogues. Canada filed the complaint in 2016, saying Washington was wrong to penalize Canada for subsidizing its paper industry, but the final ruling can be appealed by either side.
Ontario says federal government should pay for housing ‘mess' caused by border crossers
A spokesman for Premier Doug Ford said the federal government is encouraging people to cross into Canada illegally and is responsible for the housing crisis "mess" and should therefore bear 100 per cent of the cost.
Trudeau met with Ford in Toronto this afternoon, and said afterwards he spent some time explaining to the premier how the asylum-seeking system works, stressing the need for collaboration from both levels of government.
Toronto shelters have recently been overwhelmed by the thousands of migrants who have entered Canada through Manitoba and Quebec and are seeking refuge in the city's emergency housing system. The federal government has previously said they couldn't provide direct assistance to Ontario until Ford's Conservative government was sworn in, but they did pledge $50 million to Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba to help offset some of the costs from the influx in asylum seekers crossing at the Canada-U.S. border.
MARKET WATCH
Canada's main stock index edged lower on Thursday, led by declines in energy stocks due to a drop in oil prices. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 38.11 points, or 0.23 per cent, at 16,266.61. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 182.74 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 24,357.56, the S&P 500 gained 23.51 points, or 0.87 per cent, to 2,736.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.75 points, or 1.12 per cent, to 7,586.43.
Wall Street's major indexes rose as reports that the United States and the European Union may agree to withdraw auto tariffs fostered optimism on international trade relations among investors.

WHAT'S TRENDING ON SOCIAL
Canadians likely to cut U.S. travel, boycott U.S. goods and retailers in trade war with Americans
According to a new poll conducted for The Globe and Mail by Nanos Research, nearly three in four Canadians say they are likely, or somewhat likely, to stop travelling to the United States because of the cross-border conflict started by the U.S. President.
More than seven in 10 Canadians also say they are likely, or somewhat likely, to boycott U.S.-made goods, the poll found. Nearly the same percentage also say they are likely or somewhat likely to stop shopping at U.S. retailers in Canada.
TALKING POINTS
More police are not the solution to Toronto's gun violence
"When the cyclical problem of gun violence strikes Toronto, it's often too easy for the numbers and percentages to become abstractions, rather than individual tragedies affecting far too many families and communities across this city. If there's to be any conversation about what can be done, it has to begin and end with those families, and with those communities." - Andray Domise, freelance writer based in Toronto
Hands off migrants' DNA
"That's the most basic thing about DNA - you share it with your relatives. And black, Latino and other racialized families have plenty of bad history with doctors and police wielding new technology, from being made the unwitting subjects of experiments, to having planted evidence used to frame them. RAICES made the right decision, and the 100 black and brown workers of Bayham, Ont., are justified in feeling abused." - Denise Balkissoon
Toronto can look to Vancouver for what's sadly next in gun violence
"Toronto is a big, sprawling, multi-ethnic community that, in many ways, is a bigger version of Surrey. The wave of gun violence in the city is undoubtedly the result of many things, the clash of gangs being among them. Shootings are often incited by turf wars and retaliations. Sometimes they are touched off by personal grudges or the littlest perceived slight. And if Surrey's gun violence history is any indication, these shooting sprees often come in unexplainable waves." - Gary Mason
LIVING BETTER
It took Katherine Laidlaw 32 years to find the right scent for her everyday application. Once she found her go-to formula - something she described as "the least perfume-like perfume I'd ever worn" - she discovered the reason why she had been wearing the wrong fragrance for the past few decades: She was making her selections based on other people's preferences, not her own. Though it took a cancer scare for her to uncover this truth about herself, she now she basks in the fact that she smells like "unwashed, sun-baked summer skin."
LONG READS FOR A LONG COMMUTE
‘It is about Xi as the leader of the world': Former detainees recount abuse in Chinese re-education centres
Authorities in China's far western Xinjiang province have made loyalty to President Xi Jinping a central part of an extensive political re-education campaign that requires detainees to swear allegiance to the Communist Party while denouncing a Muslim faith that they are told to repeat is "stupid." Researchers estimate the total number of people that have been placed in these re-education centres, many of whom are minority Muslim Uyghurs and Kazakhs, are in the hundreds of thousands. Asia correspondent Nathan VanderKlippe interviews people who have been in those centres and reveals through their conversations how China's current leader occupies a place of singular importance in China's efforts to rectify what it deems errant thinking.
The ups and downs of a multigen family vacation in Tuscany
Day one of writer Johanna Schneller's family vacation to Tuscany with her eight family members did not start out well. She had rented a villa in Tuscany for two weeks with travellers ranging in age from their early 20s to late 80s, making for an interesting mix of contradictory hopes, follies and neuroses. It only took cramming the whole motley crew into an enormous white standard-shift Fiat van to realize that sometimes the trip you don't plan for can make for the most memorable experience. Being forced to change her travel pace taught her to embrace a more vivid, memorable holiday and by the end of the vacation she had achieved a rare feat: the family was all at the same level of blissed-out travel harmony, all at the same moment.

Full text: Plus: Montreal sees at least 17 heat-related deaths, and Purdue Pharmaceuticals ceases marketing of pain pills
Good morning,
These are the top stories:
Toronto's death toll from gun-related violence reached 25
Police announced Wednesday that a man shot over the weekend had died in hospital, bringing Toronto's death toll from gun violence to 25 this year. Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders and Mayor John Tory believe the majority of shootings to be gang-related. According to Paulos Gebreyesus, executive director of the Regent Park Community Health Centre, this weekend's shootings are "interconnected," and the product of "geographic conflicts" between neighbourhoods in Toronto that date back decades.
Here's our editorial board's take: "no amount of special police task forces will ever put an end to gang violence in Toronto, because the problem is far more complex than the number of officers on the street, the number of raids and arrests that are carried out, and the number of people who are carded. What is needed, what has always been needed, is for the city to address the abundant and self-evident social issues that lead young people to participate in gangs."

At least 17 have died in Quebec due to a week-long heat wave
Montreal prepares for its seventh day of dangerous heat on Thursday, with humidity expected to make the already high temperatures feel like the mid-40's C. Twelve of the 17 victims were found in Montreal, while five died in other regions across the province. All of the victims were in vulnerable social positions: all lived in apartments without air conditioning, most lived alone, and many had underlying conditions such as mental illness or heart and lung disease. Intense heat has also swept Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada, but neither region has reported any deaths. Montreal, unlike other jurisdictions, has a heat-response plan. David Kaiser, specialist with Montreal's public-health department, says this has "allowed us to work better" than in 2010, when a heat wave caused more than 100 deaths in the city.
Canadians are prepared to boycott U.S. brands in retaliation against Trump's trade war
A new poll by Nanos Research finds that over seven in ten Canadians are likely or somewhat likely to boycott U.S.-made goods in response to the tariffs Donald Trump placed on Canadian aluminum and steel (for subscribers). Nearly three in four Canadians are likely or somewhat likely to stop travelling to the U.S. for the same reason. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the trade war a threat to Canada's national security, and has urged citizens to "discover our extraordinary country, to take vacations here at home, to continue to buy Canadian."
Purdue Pharma announced that it has stopped marketing opioids in Canada
After the federal government called on all drug companies to suspend marketing and advertising activities associated with opioids, the pharmaceutical giant's CEO, David Pidduck, announced that it ceased promotion "relating to our prescription opioids" on June 20. The company triggered an overdose epidemic across North America with the creation and marketing of its prescription pain pill OxyContin in 1996. While the drug was pulled from the market in 2012, a range of other drugs have since taken its place, including fentanyl, which appeared on the streets that same year. In 2017, more than 4,000 Canadians died from opioid-related overdoses. Purdue is one of five drug companies to make this move in response to the federal government's request.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Two British citizens fell ill to nerve agent used to poison a former Russian spy
After visiting Salisbury, a town where the spy and his daughter were struck in March, britons Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were critically sickened by Novichok, a nerve agent that authorities believe presents an unpredictable threat to the public. A witness to the victims' poisoning says he saw Ms. Sturgess exhibit symptoms like pinpoint pupils, seizures, frothing at the mouth and hallucinations. Though police do not know whether the recent attack is connected to the one in March, the government of Britain has accused the Russian government of committing the attack. Neil Basu, Assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police says "the Counter Terrorism Policing Network is now leading the investigation into this incident," with approximately 100 detectives currently working on the case.
MORNING MARKETS
Markets mixed
European shares headed for a third day of gains on Thursday, as reassuring economic data from Germany and a report that its big car makers could be spared from U.S. tariffs offset another gloomy session for Asia. Tokyo's Nikkei lost 0.8 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.2 per cent, and the Shanghai Composite 0.9 per cent. In Europe, London's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and the Paris CAC 40 were up by between 0.3 and 1.1 per cent by about 5:40 a.m. ET. New York futures were up. The Canadian dollar was holding steady at about 76 US cents. Oil fell after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded OPEC cut crude prices.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Profit vs. prudence: Food sector prepares for edible cannabis
"All it takes is one child eating a cannabis-infused product, and the damage to that food company would be irreversible. It is critical that a regulatory framework be put in place, which would include proper labelling of edibles, complete with THC content and intoxicant warnings, to assure both the public and industry that edibles and humans can co-exist safely. " - Sylvain Charlebois
Justice is not blind for Indigenous youth
"To correct its unjust youth justice system, Canada must shift responsibility for its philosophy and program delivery to Indigenous professionals. Its ultimate vision should be to have select institutions led by Indigenous professionals in every region, with a mandate to decolonize and heal Indigenous young offenders. This idea has been successful in places such as New Zealand, fed up with high Indigenous incarceration rates. When youth learn where they come from, understand how and why colonization happened and how it affects them today, and are supported in charting a better path for themselves, they have more chances to break cycles of crime." - Max FineDay
In the tariff wars, VW's build-cars-everywhere strategy now looks clever
"Most auto executives have zero interest in Rwanda and probably couldn't find it on a map. And why would they? One of the smallest and poorest countries in Africa, it has no car industry and almost no car sales. The few who can afford cars pick up imported, second-hand bangers and drive them into the ground. Rwanda wasn't too small to escape the attention of Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota for status as the world's biggest - and most globalized - auto maker. Late last month, VW opened Rwanda's first car plant in Kigali, the capital, where it will assemble a cheapo version of the small Polo hatchback. ... If the tariff battle evolves into a global tariff war - there is no telling where it will go as tariffs breed retaliatory tariffs - VW no doubt will shift production to sites where tariffs can be avoided." - Eric Reguly (for subscribers)
LIVING BETTER
A parent's airplane etiquette rules - for other adults
Flying can be stressful. Flying in a seat next to someone who has little knowledge of airplane etiquette won't help. From heavy sighers to in-air groomers, there are a few classic archetypes of impolite plane neighbours. Here's what they look like, and how to avoid becoming one.
MOMENT IN TIME
Historical status requested for birthplace of hip hop
When Clive Campbell, known as DJ Kool Herc, was turning tables at 1520 Sedgewick Ave. in August, 1973, he had no idea that the Bronx apartment building would later be recognized as the birthplace of hip hop - much less that he'd be given credit for it. Trying out a new sound at his sister's back-to-school party, he began "breaking" - emphasizing the percussive beat - and scratching his record so people could dance longer, while fellow performer Coke La Rock began rapping over the music. Thus, the sound that defined hip hop was born. But it wasn't until July 5, 2007, that the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation requested that the building be deemed a historical entity. It was granted a few weeks later. Located along the Cross Bronx Expressway, a major freeway that displaced many residents, the building became known as an emblem of the affordable housing crisis in New York. After a struggle to keep it out of the hands of local real estate developers, it was purchased by Workforce Housing Group in 2011, which renovated the building and kept it as affordable housing. - Audrey Carleton

Heat wave: 33 Quebecers have died, 18 in Montreal, health officials say

Full text: As Environment Canada issued a smog and heat warning( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/smog-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-enters-last-gasp ) for the Montreal area Thursday, the number of potential deaths linked to the extreme heat wave hitting the province jumped to 33, Quebec public health officials said.
Of these, 18 died in Montreal from heat-related complications, up from 12 a day earlier; Montérégie had two deaths, the Eastern Townships had seven, Laval one and Mauricie five.
Most of the victims were men between the ages of 50 and 85 who lived alone in "heat islands" in high-rise apartments with no air conditioning, or suffered from chronic health or precarious living conditions, including homelessness, mental health issues and substance use.
Even one death is too many, said Lucie Charlebois, the provincial public health minister, at a press conference Thursday. But some people are more vulnerable than others to extreme heat and smog, she said.
Charlebois defended the province's emergency approach in the face of record-breaking temperatures.
None of the deaths occurred in a public long-term care nursing home, a centre d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée or in a hospital. Those who died were already suffering from health problems, she said.
Montreal's civil protection agency door-to-door campaign visited more than 3,400 homes. Urgences-Santé logged 30 per cent more calls for help since the weekend. It responded to more than 1,200 calls and dispatched 695 ambulances.
"We're doing the best we can," Charlebois said. "All deaths are regrettable. We'd like to have no deaths at all, but every day people die."
As for patients in hospitals and palliative care centres who are being told to bring their own fans( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bring-your-own-fan-no-ac-in-patient-rooms-at-verdun-general-hospital ), Charlebois said provisions have been made to move them into cooler common areas with air conditioning for a couple of hours a day to minimize the impact of the heat.
A 10-year plan to improve older, dilapidated facilities is now underway, Charlebois said. "But nothing can be done in 10 minutes."
Meanwhile, everything is being done to ensure the comfort of patients and workers in health facilities without air conditioning, she said.
The criticism from the Coalition Avenir Québec and Parti Québécois Wednesday that her government failed to respond quickly enough to the heat wave, for example, by putting cooling units in every facility, "is indecent," Charlebois said. The opposition is playing petty politics on the backs of the most vulnerable segment of the population, she said.
According to Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, the extreme heat intervention plan was launched a day early because of a spike in visits to hospital emergency rooms. However, until the provincial coroner investigates, it will be difficult to say with certainty what caused the current wave of deaths, she added.
It's not clear why Quebec seems to have had more deaths than provinces like Ontario, which is also in the grip of extreme heat and humidity. Quebec remains vigilant about recording heat-related deaths, but other provinces may have different reporting systems, Drouin said.
But those most at risk include the elderly and individuals with health conditions who are living in inner-city hot spots - areas with lots of asphalt and little vegetation. These heat islands can register temperatures five to 10 degrees higher than at the Dorval weather station, she said.
Floods, tornados, heat waves and extreme cold in winter are only expected to become more common, Drouin said. "Because we know that the vulnerable population has the most difficulties, we have to work on social determinants (of health) to lower poverty and make sure that those people have the resources to adapt to extreme events."
The temperature in Montreal reached a high of 34 degrees Celsius on Thursday with a humidex value of 43 C, according to Environment Canada.
The heat wave is expected to break overnight Thursday to Friday.
Dr. Horacio Arruda, assistant deputy minister of health and social services, said warning signs of dehydration include dry skin and lips, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, dark urine and sunken eyes. Individuals should drink six to eight glasses of water per day, avoid alcoholic beverages, spend about two hours in a cool, air-conditioned environment and limit physical activities.

Fariha Naqvi-Mohamed: Beating Montreal's heat wave is a community effort

Full text: Sprinklers, sticky Popsicles and community pools - these are some of the things that come to mind when I recall my childhood summers. Growing up mostly without AC, we'd bear the summer heat while staying hydrated as best as we could.
In the days long before splash pads, a sprinkler was enough to entertain us for hours at a time. We'd run through it shrieking with excitement. If we wanted to be particularly festive, we might even rip up a garbage bag to slide on with water from the hose. Yes, the slip and slide existed back then, but was a frivolous purchase when garbage bags could suffice.
Adult life, however, brings greater responsibilities. As a member of what has come to be called the sandwich generation, I have found myself in a sticky predicament during the recent heat wave. I have been concerned about my elderly father's health and well-being without proper air conditioning and about my children staying hydrated and not being overly exposed to the heat. We have opened our air-conditioned home up to friends and family needing a place to cool down over the past week and have tried calling relatives to make sure they are taken care of.
It's been more critical than ever before to reach out to our loved ones to make sure they are safe, cool and hydrated during the intense heat that as of Thursday, had cost 33 lives across Quebe( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say )c. While Friday promises a return to normal seasonal temperatures, chances are that we'll suffer at least one more heat wave before the end of the summer.
This time around, I have been impressed with the city of Montreal's proactive response; it should become standard practice. Opening up municipal buildings, extending pool and splash pad hours and even setting up city sprinklers for residents to cool off at have been excellent initiatives.
Even so, some people may not know about local community efforts, or may not avail themselves of them for any number of reasons. Those who are isolated, experiencing health problems, mentally unstable or lonely may not consider forcing themselves out of their homes to escape the heat. That's why outreach to our friends and neighbours, as Mayor Valérie Plante urged, is so important.
Another municipal official who made the right call was Pierrefonds-Roxboro Borough Mayor Jim Beis. When Beis announced he would be cancelling the Canada Day parade out of concern for the well-being of participants, he drew the ire of some residents. They complained that city officials were overly cautious and that if they merely gave out water, we should be OK to proceed. However, the sweltering weather on Canada Day proved that the city had in fact, made the right call in cancelling a parade that would have had volunteers and entertainers walk the four-kilometre course in heavy non-breathable costumes.

As Montreal heat wave continues, emergency teams going door to door( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-gives-update-on-heat-wave )
This is not a whole lot different than a severe cold snap. Any form of severe weather can be deadly.
As for how to deal with stubborn family members who insist they are OK without air conditioning: Taking them to the movies, inviting them over for a meal or just taking them to the mall are great excuses to make sure everyone stays safe.
When the temperature soars, we all need to play a role in reaching out to our friends and family. Generally speaking, people don't want to impose. Sometimes merely posting on social media for family and friends to reach out if they don't have air conditioning can go a long way.
So when there's a heat wave, continue sipping on the slushy drinks, but be sure to check in to make sure your loved ones are safe, as if their lives depended on it. Because they do.

Full text: Public-health officials in Quebec say that 33 people have died because of the week-long heat wave in the province.
They say 18 of those deaths were on the island of Montreal.
The temperature in Montreal was expected to reach a high of 35 degrees Celsius on Thursday with a humidex value of 45 C, according to Environment Canada.
The heat wave is expected to break overnight Thursday to Friday.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada issued a smog warning( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/smog-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-enters-last-gasp ) and maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area and recommends individuals drink six to eight glasses of water par day, avoid alcoholic beverages, take at least one shower or cool bath per day and cool their skin several times per day with wet towels and limit physical activities.
This story will be updated.

Full text: During a heat wave that's breaking records for July temperatures, the Montreal Gazette talked with some Montrealers whose jobs give them no relief - and one that still requires a jacket and tuque.
CONSTRUCTION
Mike Lasorsa is installing ceramic walls and floors on the sixth floor of an apartment building. It's so hot at work he changes his shirt three times a day.
People who live in the apartments he's helping to renovate bring him Popsicles and Mr. Freeze Pops.
"People see you're sweating a lot.
They're very supportive," Lasorsa said. "If I see any of my co-workers who might look like it's too much for him, I'll tell him to go sit down and make sure he's hydrated. We look out for each other."
Working with ceramics, Lasorsa uses a lot of water to wash off walls and glue. That's one of the reasons he prefers working in the heat to the winter, when the water and his hands will freeze.
"The most important thing is to always keep yourself hydrated, compared to when it's freezing cold and you have a hard time feeling your fingertips," Lasorsa said.
For Jocelyn Boucher, who's building concrete frames inside a building in Ahuntsic, heat waves slow down the pace of construction work. He and his coworkers start at 6 a.m. to finish around 2 p.m., working fewer than eight hours per day, and take two or three more breaks than usual. He'll drink at least four litres of water before noon.
Boucher wears steel-toed boots, a helmet and safety goggles that fog up from the heat and humidity. If he works outdoors, he'll wear long sleeves to protect his arms.
"In the direct sun, it's really horrible," Boucher said.
The hardest part of working during a heat wave, Boucher said, is starting up again after eating lunch.
After work, Boucher goes "right away to the pool. It's the first thing." COMPOST "It's a physical job, it's one where you do have to use your strength and you do have to hustle," said Gabriel Michaud of Compost Montreal.
Compost collectors with his organization travel between businesses to pick up organic waste, then bring it to their compost site and clean out their trucks.
"The effect of the heat can be very draining on the person, even when you're used to it," Michaud said.
When their customers leave their brown compost bins outside, the sun heats up the bins, speeds up decomposition and attracts fruit flies. The smells and insects make it harder for collectors, so they appreciate bins kept indoors or in the shade and kept clean. FOOD TRUCKS At a food truck in downtown Montreal, the truck's interior was 15 or 20 degrees hotter than outside, according to Mitchell Litwin of Le Cheese. Le Cheese serves treats like grilled cheese and Philly cheese steak, but tucked away in freezers and refrigerators, Litwin said the cheese was in no danger from the heat. As for the workers, they rotate to make sure no one person stays in "the hot corner" grilling food for too long, Litwin said. They drape their necks in cold, wet towels and drink lots of water.
Parked in Dorchester Square to serve the lunch crowd, Litwin said he wouldn't trade it for a job inside.
"We're serving suits all day long, and it's like, oh my god. Take your AC, I'd rather be out here," Litwin said. CRAFT ICE While many Montrealers are taking precautions against heat stroke this week, there's one type of worker guarding against the threat of catching a cold: people who make ice.
At Les Marchands, a company that makes ice cubes shaped for cocktails, a small team breaks down large chunks of ice in a room set to -18 C. Inside they wear insulated windbreakers and pants, boots and tuques.
"You don't want to get the flu in the middle of July just because you weren't dressed enough working in the cold room," said Pierre-Olivier Prince of Les Marchands.
"Working in the cold room is pretty cool in the summertime," Prince said.

Heat wave's death toll climbs to 18 in Quebec; Temperatures are expected to return to seasonal norms by Friday

Full text: The number of deaths in southern Quebec linked to the ongoing heat wave climbed to 18 as of Wednesday night.
In Montreal, the heat wave had claimed 12 lives, doubling the total from the day before. The victims were all between the ages of 50 and 80.
Urgences-santé pleaded with the public to call 911 only in case of a genuine emergency, and Mayor Valérie Plante called on Montrealers to look out for neighbours vulnerable to the effects of the recordbreaking temperatures. Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, said the deaths were linked to the extreme heat and noted that Urgencessanté had logged the same jump in ambulance transports as had been recorded during the deadly heat wave of 2010, when more than 100 people died in the Montreal area.
While every death will be investigated, Drouin said that "for the moment, they conform exactly to the characteristics we've described - people with chronic illness, mental health problems, people living alone, people living in apartment blocks between four to six storeys and without air conditioning, those living in high heat areas of the city. These are the same criteria we've been using with our partners to decide where to conduct door-to-door checks."
Montreal's civil protection agency has launched a door-todoor campaign to check on those deemed most vulnerable to the heat to ensure their safety and provide tips on how to stay safe during the heat wave. An emergency co-ordination centre has also been set up to monitor the situation on a daily basis and react accordingly.
Despite those measures, Plante reminded Montrealers on Wednesday to show solidarity with their more vulnerable neighbours and take the time to ensure they were safe.
"If you know people with respiratory problems or people who are elderly, don't hesitate to visit them or give them a phone call to see if they need anything," she said during a meeting of the city's executive committee.
Plante also said the city had prolonged operating hours of local pools and community centres equipped with air conditioning.
The heat wave has triggered a wave of calls to 911 - and apparently stretched the resources of Urgences-santé to the limit, compelling the paramedic service to urge citizens to take some simple precautions to deal with the heat rather than wait until they need an ambulance.
Between midnight and 7 p.m.
Wednesday, Urgences-santé had received 1,100 calls - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal, said spokesperson Jean-François Coornaert. Of those calls, Coornaert said only 18 were "directly related" to the extreme weather, while many others were "indirectly related," with patients citing respiratory issues, among others.
Since the heat wave began last Saturday, Urgences-santé has received approximately 1,200 calls per day. The agency says that some genuine emergency-call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911. The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road, and some are working overtime to handle the workload. It is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health-information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
"What we're experiencing right now is pretty extraordinary," said Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way, we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air-conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as five deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat. One death in the Mauricie region is also suspected as having been caused by the heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's airquality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a smog warning for the Montreal area as a record-breaking heat wave enters its sixth and perhaps final day.
The federal agency says high concentrations of ozone are expected and will result in poor air quality with high concentrations of pollutants expected to persist through Thursday evening.
The warning notes that smog particularly affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease, and recommends these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the warning is lifted.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada has maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area and recommends individuals drink six to eight glasses of water par day, avoid alcoholic beverages, take at least one shower or cool bath per day and cool their skin several times per day with wet towels and limit physical activities.
Thursday's forecast calls for a high of 35 degrees Celsius and a humidex of 45 C. There is a risk of thunderstorms Thursday night with clearing expected Friday morning and a forecast high of 23 C with a humidex of 25 C.

Full text: During a heat wave that's breaking records for July temperatures, the Montreal Gazette talked with some Montrealers whose jobs give them no relief - and one that still requires a jacket and toque.
Construction
Jocelyn Boucher bores into concrete at his work site in Ahuntsic on Wednesday, July 4, 2018.
Mike Lasorsa is installing ceramic walls and floors on the sixth floor of an apartment building. It's so hot at work he changes his shirt three times a day.
People who live in the apartments he's helping to renovate bring him Popsicles and Mr. Freeze Pops.
"People see you're sweating a lot. They're very supportive," Lasorsa said.
"If I see any of my co-workers who might look like it's too much for him, I'll tell him to go sit down and make sure he's hydrated. We look out for each other," Lasorsa said.
Working with ceramics, Lasorsa uses a lot of water to wash off walls and glue. That's one of the reasons he prefers working in the heat to the winter, when the water and his hands will freeze.
"The most important thing is to always keep yourself hydrated, compared to when it's freezing cold and you have a hard time feeling your fingertips," Lasorsa said.
For Jocelyn Boucher, who's building concrete frames inside a building in Ahuntsic, heat waves slow down the pace of construction work. He and his coworkers start at 6 a.m. to finish around 2 p.m., working fewer than eight hours per day, and take two or three more breaks than usual. He'll drink at least four litres of water before noon.
Boucher wears steel-toed boots, a helmet and safety goggles that fog up from the heat and humidity. If he works outdoors, he'll wear long sleeves to protect his arms.
"In the direct sun, it's really horrible," Boucher said.
The hardest part of working during a heat wave, Boucher said, is starting up again after eating lunch.
After work, Boucher goes "right away to the pool. It's the first thing."
Compost
Compost bins at Beaubien and Clark Sts.
"It's a physical job, it's one where you do have to use your strength and you do have to hustle," said Gabriel Michaud of Compost Montreal.
Compost collectors with his organization travel between businesses to pick up organic waste, then bring it to their compost site and clean out their trucks.
"The effect of the heat can be very draining on the person, even when you're used to it," Michaud said.
When their customers leave their brown compost bins outside, the sun heats up the bins, speeds up decomposition and attracts fruit flies. The smells and insects make it harder for collectors, so they appreciate bins kept indoors or in the shade and kept clean.
Food trucks
At a food truck in downtown Montreal, the truck's interior was 15 or 20 degrees hotter than outside, according to Mitchell Litwin of Le Cheese. Le Cheese serves treats like grilled cheese and Philly cheese steak, but tucked away in freezers and refrigerators, Litwin said the cheese was in no danger from the heat. As for the workers, they rotate to make sure no one person stays in "the hot corner" grilling food for too long, Litwin said. They drape their necks in cold, wet towels and drink lots of water.
Parked in Dorchester Square to serve the lunch crowd, Litwin said he wouldn't trade it for a job inside.
"We're serving suits all day long, and it's like, oh my god. Take your AC, I'd rather be out here," Litwin said.
Craft ice
Conrad Pomerleau of Les Marchands loads up his shoulders with bags of ice for a Montreal restaurant.
While many Montrealers are taking precautions against heat stroke this week, there's one type of worker guarding against the threat of catching a cold: people who make ice.
At Les Marchands, a company that makes ice cubes shaped for cocktails, a small team breaks down large chunks of ice in a room set to minus-18 degrees Celsius. Inside they wear insulated windbreakers and pants, boots and tuques.
"You don't want to get the flu in the middle of July just because you weren't dressed enough working in the cold room," said Pierre-Olivier Prince of Les Marchands.
"Working in the cold room is pretty cool in the summertime," Prince said.

Heat wave: Death toll in Quebec climbs to 18

Full text: The number of deaths in southern Quebec linked to the ongoing heat wave climbed to 18 as of Wednesday night.
In Montreal, the heat wave had claimed 12 lives, doubling the total from the day before. The victims were all between the ages of 50 and 80.
Urgences-santé pleaded with the public to call 911 only in case of a genuine emergency, and Mayor Valérie Plante called on Montrealers to look out for neighbours vulnerable to the effects of the record-breaking temperatures.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, said the deaths were linked to the extreme heat and noted that Urgences-santé had logged the same jump in ambulance transports as had been recorded during the deadly heat wave of 2010, when more than 100 people died in the Montreal area.
While every death will be investigated, Drouin said that "for the moment, they conform exactly to the characteristics we've described - people with chronic illness, mental health problems, people living alone, people living in apartment blocks between four to six storeys and without air conditioning, those living in high heat areas of the city. These are the same criteria we've been using with our partners to decide where to conduct door-to-door checks."
Montreal's civil protection agency has launched a door-to-door campaign to check on those deemed most vulnerable to the heat to ensure their safety and provide tips on how to stay safe during the heat wave. An emergency co-ordination centre has also been set up to monitor the situation on a daily basis and react accordingly.
Despite those measures, Plante reminded Montrealers on Wednesday to show solidarity with their more vulnerable neighbours and take the time to ensure they were safe.
"If you know people with respiratory problems or people who are elderly, don't hesitate to visit them or give them a phone call to see if they need anything," she said during a meeting of the city's executive committee.
Plante also said the city had prolonged operating hours of local pools and community centres equipped with air conditioning.
The heat wave has triggered a wave of calls to 911 - and apparently stretched the resources of Urgences-santé to the limit, compelling the paramedic service to urge citizens to take some simple precautions to deal with the heat rather than wait until they need an ambulance.
Between midnight and 7 p.m. Wednesday, Urgences-santé had received 1,100 calls - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal, said spokesperson Jean-François Coornaert. Of those calls, Coornaert said only 18 were "directly related" to the extreme weather while many others were "indirectly related," with patients citing respiratory issues, among others.
Since the heat wave began last Saturday, Urgences-santé has received approximately 1,200 calls per day. The agency says that some genuine emergency call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911.
The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road, and some are working overtime to handle the workload. It is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
"What we're experiencing right now is pretty extraordinary," said Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way, we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air-conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as five deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat. One death in the Mauricie region is also suspected as having been caused by the heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road, and some are working overtime to handle the workload. It is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
"What we're experiencing right now is pretty extraordinary," said Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way, we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air-conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as five deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Full text: During a heat wave that's breaking records for July temperatures, the Montreal Gazette talked with some Montrealers whose jobs give them no relief - and one that still requires a jacket and toque.
Construction
Jocelyn Boucher bores into concrete at his work site in Ahuntsic on Wednesday, July 4, 2018.
Mike Lasorsa is installing ceramic walls and floors on the sixth floor of an apartment building. It's so hot at work he changes his shirt three times a day.
People who live in the apartments he's helping to renovate bring him Popsicles and Mr. Freeze Pops.
"People see you're sweating a lot. They're very supportive," Lasorsa said.
"If I see any of my co-workers who might look like it's too much for him, I'll tell him to go sit down and make sure he's hydrated. We look out for each other," Lasorsa said.
Working with ceramics, Lasorsa uses a lot of water to wash off walls and glue. That's one of the reasons he prefers working in the heat to the winter, when the water and his hands will freeze.
"The most important thing is to always keep yourself hydrated, compared to when it's freezing cold and you have a hard time feeling your fingertips," Lasorsa said.
For Jocelyn Boucher, who's building concrete frames inside a building in Ahuntsic, heat waves slow down the pace of construction work. He and his coworkers start at 6 a.m. to finish around 2 p.m., working fewer than eight hours per day, and take two or three more breaks than usual. He'll drink at least four litres of water before noon.
Boucher wears steel-toed boots, a helmet and safety goggles that fog up from the heat and humidity. If he works outdoors, he'll wear long sleeves to protect his arms.
"In the direct sun, it's really horrible," Boucher said.
The hardest part of working during a heat wave, Boucher said, is starting up again after eating lunch.
After work, Boucher goes "right away to the pool. It's the first thing."
Compost
Compost bins at Beaubien and Clark Sts.
"It's a physical job, it's one where you do have to use your strength and you do have to hustle," said Gabriel Michaud of Compost Montreal.
Compost collectors with his organization travel between businesses to pick up organic waste, then bring it to their compost site and clean out their trucks.
"The effect of the heat can be very draining on the person, even when you're used to it," Michaud said.
When their customers leave their brown compost bins outside, the sun heats up the bins, speeds up decomposition and attracts fruit flies. The smells and insects make it harder for collectors, so they appreciate bins kept indoors or in the shade and kept clean.
Food trucks
At a food truck in downtown Montreal, the truck's interior was 15 or 20 degrees hotter than outside, according to Mitchell Litwin of Le Cheese. Le Cheese serves treats like grilled cheese and Philly cheese steak, but tucked away in freezers and refrigerators, Litwin said the cheese was in no danger from the heat. As for the workers, they rotate to make sure no one person stays in "the hot corner" grilling food for too long, Litwin said. They drape their necks in cold, wet towels and drink lots of water.
Parked in Dorchester Square to serve the lunch crowd, Litwin said he wouldn't trade it for a job inside.
"We're serving suits all day long, and it's like, oh my god. Take your AC, I'd rather be out here," Litwin said.
Craft ice
Conrad Pomerleau of Les Marchands loads up his shoulders with bags of ice for a Montreal restaurant.
While many Montrealers are taking precautions against heat stroke this week, there's one type of worker guarding against the threat of catching a cold: people who make ice.
At Les Marchands, a company that makes ice cubes shaped for cocktails, a small team breaks down large chunks of ice in a room set to minus-18 degrees Celsius. Inside they wear insulated windbreakers and pants, boots and toques.
"You don't want to get the flu in the middle of July just because you weren't dressed enough working in the cold room," said Pierre-Olivier Prince of Les Marchands.
"Working in the cold room is pretty cool in the summertime," Prince said.

Full text: The number of deaths in southern Quebec linked to the ongoing heat wave climbed to 17 as of Wednesday evening.
In Montreal, the heat wave had claimed 12 lives, doubling the total from the day before. The victims were all between the ages of 50 and 80.
Urgences-santé pleaded with the public to call 911 only in case of a genuine emergency, and Mayor Valérie Plante called on Montrealers to look out for neighbours vulnerable to the effects of the record-breaking temperatures.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, said the deaths were linked to the extreme heat and noted that Urgences-santé had logged the same jump in ambulance transports as had been recorded during the deadly heat wave of 2010, when more than 100 people died in the Montreal area.
While every death will be investigated, Drouin said that "for the moment, they conform exactly to the characteristics we've described - people with chronic illness, mental health problems, people living alone, people living in apartment blocks between four to six storeys and without air conditioning, those living in high heat areas of the city. These are the same criteria we've been using with our partners to decide where to conduct door-to-door checks."
Montreal's civil protection agency has launched a door-to-door campaign to check on those deemed most vulnerable to the heat to ensure their safety and provide tips on how to stay safe during the heat wave. An emergency co-ordination centre has also been set up to monitor the situation on a daily basis and react accordingly.
Despite those measures, Plante reminded Montrealers on Wednesday to show solidarity with their more vulnerable neighbours and take the time to ensure they were safe.
"If you know people with respiratory problems or people who are elderly, don't hesitate to visit them or give them a phone call to see if they need anything," she said during a meeting of the city's executive committee.
Plante also said the city had prolonged operating hours of local pools and community centres equipped with air conditioning.
The heat wave has triggered a wave of calls to 911 - and apparently stretched the resources of Urgences-santé to the limit, compelling the paramedic service to urge citizens to take some simple precautions to deal with the heat rather than wait until they need an ambulance.
Between midnight and 7 p.m. Wednesday, Urgences-santé had received 1,100 calls - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal, said spokesperson Jean-François Coornaert. Of those calls, Coornaert said only 18 were "directly related" to the extreme weather while many others were "indirectly related," with patients citing respiratory issues, among others.
Since the heat wave began last Saturday, Urgences-santé has received approximately 1,200 calls per day. The agency says that some genuine emergency call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911.
The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road, and some are working overtime to handle the workload. It is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
"What we're experiencing right now is pretty extraordinary," said Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.

Quebec's death toll climbs amid unrelenting heat wave: At least 17 succumb to sweltering temperatures across the province as meteorologists say combination of hot spell and humidity in Montreal has been exceptional

Full text: Montreal endured its sixth straight day of furnace-like temperatures as heat-related deaths across Quebec climbed to at least 17 and wilting humidity was expected to deliver weather that feels like the mid-40 C range on Thursday.
Authorities attributed 12 deaths in Montreal to the double blow of intense heat and humidity. The remaining deaths were reported in regions across the province.
All the deaths struck those most vulnerable during heat waves: People with underlying conditions such as mental illness or heart and lung disease. All of the victims were in apartments without air conditioning, and most lived alone.
Heat waves have also swept Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada, and places such as Ottawa, where the humidex was at 39 C, and Toronto have bathed in sweltering heat for days - yet those jurisdictions have had no reported deaths.
Ontario's Office of the Chief Coroner has received no reports of heat-related deaths as of Wednesday, a spokesperson said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the heat waves hitting parts of Canada: "My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have died in Quebec during this heat wave. The record temperatures are expected to continue in central & eastern Canada, so make sure you know how to protect yourself & your family."
One thing that distinguishes Montreal from other jurisdictions is an established system that requires front-line health providers to systematically report health-related deaths.
Montreal became, in 2002, one of the first cities in North America to adopt a heat-response plan, and a 2010 heat wave that caused more than 100 deaths led officials to fine-tune their preparedness, said David Kaiser, a specialist with Montreal's public-health department.
"A hundred deaths was 100 deaths too many. It allowed us to work better," Dr. Kaiser said.
"The heat wave in 2010 was an important test for us."
Still, meteorologists say Montreal's cloying cocktail of heat and humidity has been exceptional.
The base temperature in Montreal exceeded 31 C for the sixth day in a row on Wednesday, and it's expected to rise to 35 C on Thursday - 46 C with the humidex, according to Environment Canada. (By comparison, the mercury didn't rise above 30 C a single day in Montreal last summer.)
It has felt like close to 40 C for several days in Montreal, leaving the city resembling an open-air steam bath.
"This is what is out of the ordinary - the humidity and the duration of the heat wave," said Alexandre Parent, an Environment Canada meteorologist. The last time a heat wave lasted this long was 1946.
Other causes might explain the fatal impact of the heat wave. Nights have cooled to only the low 20s, depriving the body of its ability to recover. Dr. Kaiser says homes without air conditioners can expose the body to 10 or 12 hours of heat without relief, especially for those at risk. "At night, they have no way to get out of the heat," he said.
Montreal's heat-preparedness plan kicked in on Tuesday when Montreal shifted to its highest level of alert, dispatching fire crews to knock on the doors of the vulnerable and urging citizens to check on neighbours.
The fire department has visited 20,000 addresses since the alert went into effect. The city also extended pool hours, opened cooling hubs in health clinics and sent water to groups helping the homeless.
The city's responsiveness also comes in the context of a new reality of killer heat waves around the world. In France, 15,000 people died in 2003 after a crushing wave of heat, many of them isolated and elderly. It may help explain why Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and publichealth officials have urged people to check in on neighbours and loved ones in recent days.
Those most at risk are often people living alone.
"Think about your neighbours; think about your family members, grandpa, grandma; think about your kids, your friends," said Mélissa Généreux, the director of public health in the Eastern Townships. "Why not give them a call, a visit, take them out of the house ... a bit of cool air could do some good and save lives," Dr. Généreux said.
The city is expected to finally get a break in the weather on Friday, when temperatures dip to 24 C.

Full text: Also: A heat wave has led to at least six deaths in Montreal
Good morning,
These are the top stories:
Toronto is calling for provincial and federal support to combat gang violence
The city has been hit with 208 shootings so far this year, a jump of nearly a fifth compared to 2017. Mayor John Tory said the police force is hiring 200 new officers this year to "redouble our efforts to get these gangsters, round them up, get them off the street." At least 10 people have been shot in Toronto in the past five days including three in the downtown entertainment district on Saturday and four in the Kensington Market area on Sunday.
In Surrey, B.C., children as young as 10 are being recruited into gangs
"It's fair to say that kids in elementary school are susceptible to gang recruitment," Surrey RCMP assistant commissioner Dwayne McDonald said. Officials say police enforcement will be bolstered as they work to prevent kids from joining gangs. Two teens, aged 16 and 17, were found dead on a Surrey street last month.

A heat wave has led to at least six deaths in Montreal
Temperatures of 40 C with humidity have prompted officials in Montreal to increase emergency measures, including door-to-door checks of at-risk residents by firefighters. Drop-in cooling centres have been set up as part of an "extreme heat" plan that includes distributing water to the homeless. In 2010, a heat wave in Montreal caused more than 100 deaths. This string of hot weather is expected to continue until Friday, with cities from Toronto to Halifax issuing heat warnings.
While it's not possible to demonstrate a direct link to this heat wave, experts say the increasing number of extreme weather events are patterns that can be attributed to climate change.
Former detainees recount the abuse they faced in Chinese re-education centres
"Xi Jinping is great! The Communist Party is great! I deserve punishment for not understanding that only President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party can help me." That's just one of the refrains an Uyghur woman was forced to repeat while detained at one of China's facilities designed to address "incorrect thinking" it considers a public-health crisis. And it's the latest example of Xi's consolidation of power not seen in China since Mao Zedong.
Hundreds of thousands have been sent to the camps, including scores of Uyghurs ordered to forswear their Muslim faith. Ex-detainees said authorities followed their every move, including into toilets. Some received unknown medicines, while others attempted suicide (and were subsequently punished for those attempts).

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
England ended its penalties curse with a World Cup win over Colombia
Until yesterday, England had lost all three times it had to play in a shootout at the World Cup. With the 4-3 victory, England advances to the quarter-finals against Sweden on Saturday.
Here's Cathal Kelly's take on the match: "The result will be celebrated in England like a modern V-E Day. Not because the English won, but because they lifted a curse. It will be rued in Colombia for a generation."
MORNING MARKETS
Markets mixed
Global stocks were dragged lower on Wednesday by growing anxiety ahead of Washington's end-of-week deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, while the yuan rebounded after China's central bank moved to calm investors. Tokyo's Nikkei fell 0.3 per cent, Hong Kong's 1.1 per cent, and Shanghai Composite 1 per cent. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were down 0.2 per cent by about 5:20 a.m. ET, while the Paris CAC 40 was up 0.1 per cent. New York markets are closed for July 4. The Canadian dollar was at about 76 US cents.
WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT
Mr. Trudeau's ‘negative interaction'
"Selective amnesia can be handy. When confronted with some awkward incident, you can always claim you don't remember. Memory loss enables you to cast doubt on whether the incident happened at all, without having to actually lie about it. It allows you to evade responsibility for circumstances you really do not want to explain. But sometimes it's not all that convincing. That's the problem with Justin Trudeau's carefully crafted response to charges that he groped a reporter back in 2000, when he was a 28-year-old teacher attending a beer-and-music festival in Creston, B.C. Asked about it directly on Sunday, he replied, ‘I remember that day in Creston well ... I had a good day that day. I don't remember any negative interactions that day at all.' ... Hands up if you suspect something happened that Mr. Trudeau would prefer not to own up to today. Hands up, if you think it's not likely he forgot it." - Margaret Wente
Despite the fiery rhetoric, here's why the softwood trade dispute is much ado about nothing
In the rhetorical battles that accompany a trade war, each tariff and retaliatory duty is an economy-wrecking job killer, a misguided policy that punishes the end consumer as well as the targeted foreign industry. In the case of the softwood-lumber tariff, in place since late 2017, an exceptionally strong U.S. housing market has created a different set of truths. Canadian lumber producers seem to have recouped the entirety of the tariff from their customers, U.S. builders that have in turn passed along the costs to the American home buyer. And because of the small amount of lumber in the typical U.S. house, the end impact is not nearly as punishing as the U.S. home-building industry claims. For now, in this environment, the economics suggest the lumber tariffs are much ado about not much at all." - David Milstead (for subscribers)
Sweet bedlam: Portrait of a Toronto soccer bar during the World Cup
The consensus at the Football Factory, a downtown Toronto bar and restaurant, is it's a pity Mexico is out of this World Cup. The fans of Mexico were the best, the most deliriously cheerful and good-natured of them all. The fans of Iran weren't far behind. There's a precious, lovely space to be located between being at a World Cup in the host country and simply watching it at home on your TV. That special space is the bars of Toronto, this most poly-cultural of cities." - John Doyle
LIVING BETTER
How to stay in shape while away from the gym during the summer
There are plenty of workouts you can turn to when you're away from home this summer. Grab an affordable suspension training system to do pull-ups and dozens of other exercises. Or buy a $2 jump rope, which can easily replace the use of an expensive elliptical machine.
MOMENT IN TIME
Statue of Liberty crown reopens after security threats
July 4, 2009: The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most potent symbol in the United States of those "yearning to breathe free," as the poem on the monument reads. Its importance also made it a potential terrorism target on Sept. 11, 2001. That morning, all of Liberty Island, where Lady Liberty stands, was closed to the public. The island re-opened 100 days later, but no one was allowed into the statue. The base finall y re-opened in the summer of 2004. But it took a few more years for the crown to welcome the public back inside the statue. Security concerns were cited, but park services also said it had been considering the safety of the crown before the terror attack. The cramped space, they said, was originally designed for maintenance workers, not the public, and could be a fire hazard. Still, on July 4, 2009, visitors were let in again. Ten people at a time, guided by a National Park Service Ranger, were allowed to climb the 168-step double-helix staircase to reach the top. Reopening the crown on Independence Day felt symbolic, too, signifying that while the threat of terrorism still existed, we might all be able to breathe just a little bit easier again. - Dave McGinn

Good evening,
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Heat wave death toll in Quebec rises to at least 17
The number of deaths being attributed to an intense heat wave in Quebec has climbed to at least 17, prompting public-health officials to warn people at risk to take precautions to avoid heat-related illness.
Authorities say 11 people in Montreal have died due to a spike in temperatures that began on Saturday. The temperature in Montreal reached 40 C today when factoring in the humidity, and the heat is expected to last until Friday. Public-health officials in Quebec's Eastern Townships report five deaths suspected of being caused by the heat.
Montreal city hall unveiled an "extreme heat" plan yesterday that includes distributing water to groups working with the homeless. Mayor Valérie Plante urged people to check on vulnerable neighbours, including seniors.
Toronto police resume dig at property where Bruce McArthur worked as landscaper
For the second time in the Toronto police investigation of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, cadaver dogs have indicated the possible presence of human remains at a Leaside property - this time, in multiple locations.
The home where police found planters containing human remains in January was retaped off today and readied for excavation. Police dogs trained to sniff out remains had earlier indicated several spots of concern at the property where McArthur worked for years as a landscaper.
McArthur has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of eight men who had connections to Toronto's Gay Village, but police have located only seven sets of remains. The body of Majeed Kayhan, who disappeared in 2012, has yet to be accounted for.
Enbridge sells Canadian natural gas assets to Brookfield group in $4.3-billion deal
Enbridge is selling its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing business in a $4.31-billion deal with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners and other investors, as the pipeline giant seeks to cut debt and fund growth.
It's the latest in a string of deals by Enbridge, which has sold $7.5-billion worth of assets this year, more than double a target of $3-billion.
The company received long-awaited approval in Minnesota last week for its massive Line 3 oil pipeline, removing the final regulatory hurdle for the $9-billion Alberta-to-Wisconsin expansion. There were concerns Enbridge would need to tap markets to fund that and other projects, said Laura Lau, portfolio manager at Brompton Funds. That seems less likely now, she said.
Enbridge shares rose on the TSX today, extending a rally that has seen the stock jump more than 25 per cent in two months. (for subscribers)
Ontario Premier Doug Ford fires province's chief scientist
Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have dismissed Ontario's chief scientist, Molly Shoichet, only days after taking office.
The award-winning professor at the University of Toronto was appointed last November in what Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government said was a move to create a voice for science at the top level of government. Ms. Shoichet was told yesterday that she had been let go.
"I was dismissed. I don't think it was about me or even about the chief scientist position, but rather an out with the old and in with the new, even though, for me, I had just been there for six months," she told The Globe and Mail in an e-mail.
Unlike Wynne, Ford does not have a cabinet minister with the words science or research in their title. A spokesman for Ford has yet to respond to questions about Ms. Shoichet's dismissal.

MARKET WATCH
Canada's main stock index edged higher today, helped by gains for heavily weighted energy shares and Enbridge Inc after the company said it would sell natural gas assets. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose 0.26 per cent, or 41.56 points, to 16,304.72. The Canadian dollar steadied against its U.S. counterpart, trading nearly unchanged at $1.3142 to the greenback, or 76.09 U.S. cents.
It was a quiet day in markets as U.S. exchanges were closed for the July 4th holiday.

WHAT'S TRENDING ON SOCIAL
Remaining performances of Robert Lepage's show SLAV have been cancelled by the Montreal Jazz Festival, following criticism because it featured a white woman singing songs composed by black slaves. The show was mired in controversy from the start as protesters denounced Lepage and singer Betty Bonifassi as "racist."
In examining the trouble with Lepage's colour-blind show about slavery, the Globe's Robert Everett-Green writes: "We're not talking about a fictional contemporary narrative that includes characters who are black. SLÃV is a show built on real artifacts of a people's suffering."
TALKING POINTS
In the tariff wars, VW's build-cars-everywhere strategy now looks clever
"VW's global footprint strategy comes with an added benefit. It allows the German car giant to play the new tariff game to its advantage. At last count, VW had 122 plants scattered around the planet. The vast geographic portfolio means the company can shift production to the markets in which it sells cars, a process made all the easier by the use of common platforms. For instance, VW's vast plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, pumps out three SUV models with the same platform - the VW Touareg, Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne. If the tariff battle evolves into a global tariff war - there is no telling where it will go as tariffs breed retaliatory tariffs - VW no doubt will shift production to sites where tariffs can be avoided." - Eric Reguly (for subscribers)
Khill verdict should make us think twice about our self-defence laws
"We need to examine whether the 2012 changes to our self-defence laws have made it too easy for people to use guns to defend property, self and others. Prior law often stressed the need to use no more force than was necessary. These issues are also related to confidence in the police and their response to 911 calls. At the end of the day, another Indigenous man, a father of two, is dead." - Kent Roach, professor of law at the University of Toronto
The norm for working hours may be that there is no norm
"If we are talking about technology and work, here is what a lot of people would apparently think is ideal: Get a bunch of smart, personable robots, teach them to do what we do and send them to do the jobs that we are all bored with. Then, let the bots pick up the paycheques and hand them over to us. Say thank you, and everyone is happy. And, honestly, we are part way there. Robots, or at least technological change, is galloping toward doing a chunk of the job functions that we have done for years. A mechanical arm can now scoop French fries, and clever robot doctors can do surgery, so that part is fine. The trouble is, no one seems to be able to figure out how to get the robot-pay direct deposited into the bank accounts of the would-be fast food worker or surgeon." - Linda Nazareth, economist and author
Why some homeowners will pay more than expected to renew their mortgage
"New accounting rules adopted by the banks mean they're paying closer attention than ever before to your financial situation and your home's value when you renew a mortgage. Mortgage renewals used to be utterly routine - a virtual rubber stamp. Now, if your credit score has taken a hit or your home has fallen in value, you might not qualify for the best available rates." - Rob Carrick
LIVING BETTER
Missed your connecting flight? Avoid the herd mentality - the best thing to do may not be queuing up to rebook. Instead, if you have status with the airline or hold a higher-end travel credit card, you'll have a reserved number to call in cases like this. Whoever you deal with, be polite: A kind word can go a long way and may even get you a better flight or seat. And consider taking your cause to social media. Even if you don't have a huge following, a tweet or public Facebook message can get you immediate response.
LONG READS FOR A LONG COMMUTE
In the shadow of Canada's biggest city, the piping plover struggles to survive
Endangered they may be, but this summer two piping plovers are raising a family of tiny chicks on a Toronto beach where the species has not successfully nested in more than 80 years - all within sight of downtown skyscrapers, hungry predators and airplanes taking off overhead. Starting on June 20, a total of four eggs hatched in the couple's nest on the sand at Hanlan's Point on Toronto Island, Ivan Semeniuk writes. Looking no bigger than fuzzy golf balls on toothpicks, the hatchlings have been scurrying around under their parents' watchful gaze ever since. If the chicks manage to survive another few weeks - by which time they should be able to take flight and fend for themselves - it will mark the first time piping plovers have successfully bred on the island since 1934.
The Stanley Cup visits the Capital Gazette newsroom
Craig (Woody) Leydig, assistant equipment manager of the Stanley Cup-champion Washington Capitals, had just finished a phone interview with a Capital Gazette reporter last week when a gunman entered the newsroom, killing five staff members. As a member of the NHL team, Leydig was granted one day with the Stanley Cup, Ian Bailey writes. His day was yesterday, which he spent visiting the Capital Gazette staff at a temporary newsroom in Annapolis, Md., as well as the local police and fire departments. Capital Gazette reporter Chase Cook said the visit was a "wonderful, beautiful gesture. ... "It was one of those moments where we all felt comfortable to smile and laugh," Cook said in an interview. "It felt good."

Heat wave in Quebec has claimed 17 lives, authorities say

Full text: The number of deaths in southern Quebec linked to the ongoing heat wave climbed to 17 as of Wednesday evening.
In Montreal, the heat wave had claimed 12 lives, doubling the total from just a day before. The victims were all between the ages of 50 and 80.
Urgences-santé pleaded with the public to call 911 only in case of a genuine emergency, and Mayor Valérie Plante called on Montrealers to look out for neighbours vulnerable to the effects of the record-breaking temperatures.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, said the deaths were linked to the extreme heat and noted that Urgences-santé had logged the same jump in ambulance transports as had been recorded during the deadly heat wave of 2010, which claimed the lives of more than 100 people in the Montreal area.
While every death will be investigated, Drouin said that "for the moment, they conform exactly to the characteristics we've described - people with chronic illness, mental health problems, people living alone, people living in apartment blocks between four to six storeys and without air conditioning, those living in high heat areas of the city. These are the same criteria we've been using with our partners to decide where to conduct door-to-door checks."
Montreal's civil protection agency has launched a door-to-door campaign to check on those deemed most vulnerable to the heat to ensure their safety and provide tips on how to stay safe during the heat wave. An emergency co-ordination centre has also been set up to monitor the situation on a daily basis and react accordingly.
Despite those measures, Plante reminded Montrealers on Wednesday to show solidarity with their more vulnerable neighbours and take the time to ensure they were safe.
"If you know people with respiratory problems or people who are elderly, don't hesitate to visit them or give them a phone call to see if they need anything," she said during a meeting of the city's executive committee.
Plante also said the city had prolonged operating hours of local pools and community centres equipped with air conditioning.
The heat wave has triggered a wave of calls to 911 - and apparently stretched the resources of Urgences-santé to the limit, compelling the paramedic service to urge citizens to take some simple precautions to deal with the heat rather than wait until they need an ambulance.
Between midnight and 7 p.m. Wednesday, Urgences-santé had received 1,100 calls - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal, said spokesperson Jean-François Coornaert. Of those calls, Coornaert said only 18 were "directly related" to the extreme weather while many others were "indirectly related," with patients citing respiratory issues, among others.
Since the heat wave began last Saturday, Urgences-santé has received approximately 1,200 calls per day. The agency says that some genuine emergency call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911.
The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road, and some are working overtime to handle the workload. It is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
"What we're experiencing right now is pretty extraordinary," said Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way, we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air-conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as five deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Parent said forecasts are still pointing to the heat breaking by Friday morning, when temperatures will return to seasonal norms, around 25 C.
"The end of a heat wave is pretty easy to forecast. There's no chance that it's going to be delayed by a day or two," he said. "On Friday morning when people go out of their houses to go to work, they're really going to feel a different air mass."
While temperatures might go up again at the beginning of next week, Parent said the 30 C weather will not be anywhere near as bad as the current spell, with humidity levels much lower than what we're currently experiencing.
"The chances of experiencing something like that again are, however, not zero in July, but pretty low."
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way, we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air-conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as five deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Full text: During a heat wave that's breaking records for July temperatures, the Montreal Gazette talked with some Montrealers whose jobs give them no relief - and one that still requires a jacket and toque.
Construction
Jocelyn Boucher bores into concrete at his work site in Ahuntsic on Wednesday, July 4, 2018.
Mike Lasorsa is installing ceramic walls and floors on the sixth floor of an apartment building. It's so hot at work he changes his shirt three times a day.
People who live in the apartments he's helping to renovate bring him Popsicles and Mr. Freeze Pops.
"People see you're sweating a lot. They're very supportive," Lasorsa said.
"If I see any of my co-workers who might look like it's too much for him, I'll tell him to go sit down and make sure he's hydrated. We look out for each other," Lasorsa said.
Working with ceramics, Lasorsa uses a lot of water to wash off walls and glue. That's one of the reasons he prefers working in the heat to the winter, when the water and his hands will freeze.
"The most important thing is to always keep yourself hydrated, compared to when it's freezing cold and you have a hard time feeling your fingertips," Lasorsa said.
For Jocelyn Boucher, who's building concrete frames inside a building in Ahuntsic, heat waves slow down the pace of construction work. He and his coworkers start at 6 a.m. to finish around 2 p.m., working fewer than eight hours per day, and take two or three more breaks than usual. He'll drink at least four litres of water before noon.
Boucher wears steel-toed boots, a helmet and safety goggles that fog up from the heat and humidity. If he works outdoors, he'll wear long sleeves to protect his arms.
"In the direct sun, it's really horrible," Boucher said.
The hardest part of working during a heat wave, Boucher said, is starting up again after eating lunch.
After work, Boucher goes "right away to the pool. It's the first thing."
Compost
Compost bins at Beaubien and Clark Sts.
"It's a physical job, it's one where you do have to use your strength and you do have to hustle," said Gabriel Michaud of Compost Montreal.
Compost collectors with his organization travel between businesses to pick up organic waste, then bring it to their compost site and clean out their trucks.
"The effect of the heat can be very draining on the person, even when you're used to it," Michaud said.
When their customers leave their brown compost bins outside, the sun heats up the bins, speeds up decomposition and attracts fruit flies. The smells and insects make it harder for collectors, so they appreciate bins kept indoors or in the shade and kept clean.
Food trucks
At a food truck in downtown Montreal, the truck's interior was 15 or 20 degrees hotter than outside, according to Mitchell Litwin of Le Cheese. Le Cheese serves treats like grilled cheese and Philly cheese steak, but tucked away in freezers and refrigerators, Litwin said the cheese was in no danger from the heat. As for the workers, they rotate to make sure no one person stays in "the hot corner" grilling food for too long, Litwin said. They drape their necks in cold, wet towels and drink lots of water.
Parked in Dorchester Square to serve the lunch crowd, Litwin said he wouldn't trade it for a job inside.
"We're serving suits all day long, and it's like, oh my god. Take your AC, I'd rather be out here," Litwin said.
Craft ice
Conrad Pomerleau of Les Marchands loads up his shoulders with bags of ice for a Montreal restaurant.
While many Montrealers are taking precautions against heat stroke this week, there's one type of worker guarding against the threat of catching a cold: people who make ice.
At Les Marchands, a company that makes ice cubes shaped for cocktails, a small team breaks down large chunks of ice in a room set to minus-18 degrees Celsius. Inside they wear insulated windbreakers and pants, boots and toques.
"You don't want to get the flu in the middle of July just because you weren't dressed enough working in the cold room," said Pierre-Olivier Prince of Les Marchands.
"Working in the cold room is pretty cool in the summertime," Prince said.

Full text: The number of deaths attributable to Montreal's ongoing heatwave climbed to 11 as of Wednesday morning, as Urgences-Santé pleaded with the public only to call 911 in case of a genuine emergency and Mayor Valerie Plante called upon Montrealers to look out for neighbours vulnerable to the effects of the record-breaking temperatures.
Santé Montreal confirmed the death toll Wednesday morning, a total that stood at six just a day before.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, head of the regional health authority, confirmed the deaths were attributable to the extreme heat and noted that Urgences-Santé had logged the same jump in ambulance transports as had been recorded during the deadly heat wave of 2010 that claimed the lives of more than 100 people in the Montreal area.
While every death will be investigated, Drouin said that "for the moment, they conform exactly to the characteristics we've described - people with chronic illness, mental health problems, people living alone, people living in apartment blocks between four to six storeys and without air conditioning, those living in high heat areas of the city. These are the same criteria we've been using with our partners to decide where to conduct door-to-door checks."
Montreal's civil protection agency has launched a door-to-door campaign aimed at checking in on those deemed most vulnerable to the heat to ensure their safety and provide tips on how to stay that way during the heat wave. An emergency co-ordination centre has also been set up to monitor the situation on a daily basis and react accordingly.
Despite those measures, Plante reminded Montrealers on Wednesday to show solidarity with their more vulnerable neighbours and take the time to ensure they were safe.
"If you know people with respiratory problems or people who are elderly, don't hesitate to visit them or give them a phone call to see if they need anything," she said during a meeting of the city's executive committee.
Plante also said the city had prolonged operating hours of local pools and community centres equipped with air conditioning.
The heat wave has also triggered a wave of calls to 911 - and apparently stretched the resources of Urgences-Santé to the limit, compelling the paramedic service to urge citizens to take some simple precautions to deal with the heat rather than wait until they need an ambulance.
Urgences Santé estimates it has received about 1,200 calls a day - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal since the heat wave began last Saturday, and that some genuine emergency call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911.
The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road. Management and the rank and file are working overtime to handle the workload. And it is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professionals during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as four deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transport de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Urgences Santé estimates it has received about 1,200 calls a day - 30 per cent more than usual - from citizens in Laval and Montreal since the heat wave began last Saturday, and that some genuine emergency call responses have been delayed because of the number of non-urgent calls flooding 911.
The agency has increased the number of paramedics on the road. Management and the rank and file are working overtime to handle the workload. And it is pleading with citizens confronted with minor health problems to call the 811 health information line rather than the 911 emergency line where every second counts.
In Quebec City, Premier Philippe Couillard praised the work done by health professional during the heat wave.
"It's tragic, but each time there is a heat wave like this - and by the way we're going to have more of them because of climate change - it is the weak and vulnerable who are affected first," he said. "Public health authorities - particularly in Montreal - have taken the matter in hand very well. We have to make sure that our elderly in particular are well hydrated, that they have access to air conditioned areas, even if it's just to cool off.
"The good news is that according to the weather reports, this heat wave will break in a few days. But we have to expect episodes like this every year."
Meanwhile, in the Eastern Townships, as many as four deaths are suspected of being linked to the extreme heat.
Last Friday, on the eve of the heat wave, the Société de transports de Montréal announced it will hand out 40,000 free, two-way tickets to ride the transit system in an effort to reduce the smog expected to accompany the high temperatures.
But the city of Montreal's air quality website suggests that while air quality never dropped below the level of "acceptable" when the humidex stood at 44 C on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the quality actually began to improve since Tuesday, being recorded as "good" as of Wednesday morning.

Full text: Six Montrealers have died of causes related to this week's heat wave, public health authorities said Tuesday as Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante announced stepped-up measures to help vulnerable residents like seniors and people with chronic diseases.
Plante said firefighters and police have started going door to door to visit at-risk Montrealers to ensure they are taking such precautions as drinking plenty of water and accessing the services they need during the extreme weather.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, Montreal's regional director of public health, said there were six deaths related to the heat wave, although the total number of deaths in the city for all causes has not risen beyond the normal level of 10 per day.
Authorities are targeting areas of the city with high populations of seniors and low-income residents and a high proportion of heat islands, caused by expanses of concrete and asphalt as well as tall buildings, she said. On Monday, emergency teams visited 1,300 addresses in the downtown, Villeray and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve districts and they were to visit another 5,000 on Tuesday.
"Our teams are on the ground and are following the situation closely to adapt their actions according to the needs of the public," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance, who is the co-ordinator of public safety for the Montreal agglomeration.
Of the 1,300 people visited Monday, only one had to be taken to a hospital, he said.
Plante urged Montrealers to keep an eye on neighbours who are elderly, isolated or sick and to make sure they have access to a place to cool off.
"There's nothing like being a good neighbour," she said.
"If you have an older neighbour and you wonder if she's safe, please go and knock on the door, and just find out if the person is OK," she said.
Drouin said public health authorities established Montreal's strategy for extreme heat episodes after the heat wave of early July 2010, when 106 people died of weather-related causes.
"We learned our lesson from 2010," she said.
The very young and very old, and people suffering from mental illness or drug dependencies, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat, as are those with chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and respiratory illnesses, Drouin said.
And she reminded the public never to leave a child or pet in a car, even for a minute.
The CAA warned Tuesday that a vehicle's cabin turns into an oven in the hot sun. At 22 degrees Celsius, the inside temperature of the vehicle reaches 50 C; at 35 C, it reaches 66; and at 41 C, it reaches 100, the boiling point for water.
Commuter trains delayed
The heat has also resulted in delays on the Exo (formerly Réseau de transport métropolitan) Deux-Montagnes commuter train line Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson for the agency said the high temperature and humidity affected the wires in the signals at the Mont-Royal tunnel and that CN employees fixed the problem around 5:15 p.m, during rush hour.
She continued that because of the extreme weather and the tunnel's old age, they cannot control how humidity affects the equipment.
Stay hydrated and cool
On Friday, the city implemented the first stage of its intervention strategy for extremely hot weather by extending hours for municipal swimming pools and urging residents to:
Drink plenty of water, without waiting until you feel thirsty.
Take cool baths or showers to cool off.
Spend a few hours in air-conditioned environments like shopping centres, libraries, movie theatres, etc.
Limit physical activity.
Wear light clothing.
Drouin said authorities are deploying the additional measures because the hot, humid weather that began on the weekend is expected to last until at least Thursday. Environment Canada has maintained a heat warning for most of southern Quebec, Ontario and parts of the Maritimes.
More heat to come
Despite the record-breaking weekend, meteorologist with Environment Canada Antoine Petit said the worst is not over yet. With more southerly winds expected for Thursday, Montrealers will feel a substantial increase in humidity. He said that will make the forecast of 34 C feel closer to 45.
The good news: thunderstorms overnight Thursday to Friday will lead to a cold break, bringing the city back down to its normal seasonal temperatures of around 25 C just before the weekend, Petit continued.
Petit said the last time Montreal saw a prolonged heat wave like this was in the 1970s.
With climate change, these episodes are becoming increasingly common, Drouin noted.
CLSCs open
Air-conditioned rooms in 19 CLSCs across the city are being opened to vulnerable members of the public. If you need a place to cool off or know an elderly or vulnerable person who does, call 811 and you will be directed to the appropriate resources.
Drouin said Urgences-santé received 1,200 calls for ambulances Monday - up from the normal 950. Ambulances transported 631 people to hospitals, compared with the normal average of 536.
She acknowledged that some patients in local hospitals and chronic-care institutions are in rooms without air conditioning. Patients in those settings should be taken out of their rooms twice a day, for two hours at a time, to an air-conditioned part of the building. They should also be provided with other measures to keep cool, like towels moistened with cold water, she said.
Plante said the city has distributed 17,000 litres of bottled water to organizations working with the homeless and another 25,000 litres to boroughs, other island communities and emergency services.

If you need information about health symptoms caused by the heat( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=9657,125797604&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL ), call 811 or, for an emergency, call 911.
On Monday, the temperature reached 35.2 C in Montreal, with a humidex of 45. By noon Tuesday, it was 30 C with a humidex of 38, according to the weather office.
Humidex values in the Montreal area could reach 40 on Wednesday and could go over 40 on Thursday, Environment Canada said.

It's high time to dump July 1 as moving day; This Quebec custom makes for hellish moves even when there's no heat wave

Full text: Call it an inconvenient custom, one that Quebecers should toss to the curb.
I'm talking about the July 1 moving day in Quebec. You know what I mean, particularly here in Montreal. Mountains of rotting garbage and discarded junk on the sidewalks.
Bottlenecks on narrow streets as moving vans and trucks jostle awkwardly for space, particularly in high-density neighbourhoods like the Plateau or downtown. Movers, up since dawn, some of them on their second, third or sometimes even fourth job of the day, hauling boxes, heavy appliances and furniture up and down Montreal's spiral staircases. Maybe worst of all is the number of pets abandoned around moving day every year.
Blessedly, I haven't had to endure the hell of a July 1 residential move in some time, but I've never been more grateful than this year, when the mercury spiked to a mind-melting 35 C, or 43 C with the humidity.
Every year, I ask myself the same question: Why do Quebecers put up with this? I still don't have an answer. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a sovereignist "complot" to diminish Canada Day celebrations in Quebec. As the Gazette's Jacob Serebrin explained ("Brace yourself, Moving Day is almost here" Montreal Gazette, June 29), the official July 1 moving date is a practice with origins in the French colonial period, when leases were to expire May 1, to prevent tenants from being evicted in the winter. In time, the law required urban leases to begin on May 1 and end on April 30. Fast forward to 1973, when the Liberal government abolished the law and pushed moving day back to July 1, in part to prevent children being pulled out of school before the end of the year. Since then, Quebec's fixed moving day has not been law, but tradition.
While a lease can be signed with any dates that both parties agree to, the bulk of old leases end on June 30 and new leases begin July 1.
So, in the year 2018, Quebecers just unquestioningly abide by an artificially fixed moving date that is essentially a hangover from colonial times, and is a phenomenon that seems to be unique in North America.
I don't get it. This affects a lot of us, by the way. Quebecers and Montrealers have one of the lowest homeownership rates in Canada. Approximately 63 per cent of Montrealers rent their homes. This year, Radio Canada reported that some 200,000 Quebec households are estimated to have shuffled homes on or around that fixed date, approximately 70,000 of them in Montreal.
The ritual of the July 1 move has been romanticized in books and film. We joke about it in the same way that we joke about our ubiquitous potholes and orange cones, inconveniences that are just an inevitable part of living here, one of those things that makes us different.
Even the international media gets a kick out of exploring this little quirk of ours.
But is it worth it? My concern isn't so much about moving day in Quebec coinciding with Canada Day - although, there is that, too - it's that the whole process is unnecessarily expensive, stressful and chaotic for renters, landlords and residents in general.
Finding a moving company can be impossible unless you book months in advance. When demand exceeds supply, prices go up, and renters can end up paying three times as much for a moving company on July 1. Eliminating the fixed moving date would mean lower rates, less competition and a smoother transition for all involved.
The July 1 moving day in Quebec is an artificial rental timetable. It's no longer the law, but rather an inconvenient custom that serves little purpose. There are many traditions worth saving, but I can't think of a single reason to salvage this one. I say phase it out. It's time to move on. Twitter.com/CooperCeline

Drouin said Urgences-santé received 1,200 calls for ambulances Monday - up from the normal 950. Ambulances transported 631 people to hospitals, compared with the normal average of 536.
She acknowledged that some patients in local hospitals and chronic-care institutions are in rooms without air conditioning. Patients in those settings should be taken out of their rooms twice a day, for two hours at a time, to an air-conditioned part of the building. They should also be provided with other measures to keep cool, like towels moistened with cold water, she said.
Plante said the city has distributed 17,000 litres of bottled water to organizations working with the homeless and another 25,000 litres to boroughs, other island communities and emergency services.

Full text: Six Montrealers have died of causes related to this week's heat wave, public health authorities said Tuesday as Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante announced stepped-up measures to help vulnerable residents like seniors and people with chronic diseases.
Plante said firefighters and police have started going door to door to visit at-risk Montrealers to ensure they are taking such precautions as drinking plenty of water and accessing the services they need during the extreme weather.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, Montreal's regional director of public health, said there were six deaths related to the heat wave, although the total number of deaths in the city for all causes has not risen beyond the normal level of 10 per day.
Authorities are targeting areas of the city with high populations of seniors and low-income residents and a high proportion of heat islands, caused by expanses of concrete and asphalt as well as tall buildings, she said. On Monday, emergency teams visited 1,300 addresses in the downtown, Villeray and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve districts and they were to visit another 5,000 on Tuesday.
"Our teams are on the ground and are following the situation closely to adapt their actions according to the needs of the public," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance, who is the co-ordinator of public safety for the Montreal agglomeration.
Of the 1,300 people visited Monday, only one had to be taken to a hospital, he said.
Plante urged Montrealers to keep an eye on neighbours who are elderly, isolated or sick and to make sure they have access to a place to cool off.
"There's nothing like being a good neighbour," she said.
"If you have an older neighbour and you wonder if she's safe, please go and knock on the door, and just find out if the person is OK," she said.
Drouin said public health authorities established Montreal's strategy for extreme heat episodes after the heat wave of early July 2010, when 106 people died of weather-related causes.
"We learned our lesson from 2010," she said.
The very young and very old, and people suffering from mental illness or drug dependencies, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat, as are those with chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and respiratory illnesses, Drouin said.
And she reminded the public never to leave a child or pet in a car, even for a minute.
The CAA warned Tuesday that a vehicle's cabin turns into an oven in the hot sun. At 22 degrees Celsius, the inside temperature of the vehicle reaches 50 C; at 35 C, it reaches 66; and at 41 C, it reaches 100, the boiling point for water.
Commuter trains delayed
The heat has also resulted in delays on the Exo (formerly Réseau de transport métropolitan) Deux-Montagnes commuter train line Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson for the agency said the high temperature and humidity affected the wires in the signals at the Mont-Royal tunnel and that CN employees fixed the problem around 5:15 p.m, during rush hour.
She continued that because of the extreme weather and the tunnel's old age, they cannot control how humidity affects the equipment.
Stay hydrated and cool
On Friday, the city implemented the first stage of its intervention strategy for extremely hot weather by extending hours for municipal swimming pools and urging residents to:
Drink plenty of water, without waiting until you feel thirsty.
Take cool baths or showers to cool off.
Spend a few hours in air-conditioned environments like shopping centres, libraries, movie theatres, etc.
Limit physical activity.
Wear light clothing.
Drouin said authorities are deploying the additional measures because the hot, humid weather that began on the weekend is expected to last until at least Thursday. Environment Canada has maintained a heat warning for most of southern Quebec, Ontario and parts of the Maritimes.
More heat to come
Despite the record-breaking weekend, meteorologist with Environment Canada Antoine Petit said the worst is not over yet. With more southerly winds expected for Thursday, Montrealers will feel a substantial increase in humidity. He said that will make the forecast of 34 C feel closer to 45.
The good news: thunderstorms overnight Thursday to Friday will lead to a cold break, bringing the city back down to its normal seasonal temperatures of around 25 C just before the weekend, Petit continued.
Petit said the last time Montreal saw a prolonged heat wave like this was in the 1970s.
With climate change, these episodes are becoming increasingly common, Drouin noted.
CLSCs open
Air-conditioned rooms in 19 CLSCs across the city are being opened to vulnerable members of the public. If you need a place to cool off or know an elderly or vulnerable person who does, call 811 and you will be directed to the appropriate resources.
Drouin said Urgences-santé received 1,200 calls for ambulances Monday - up from the normal 950. Ambulances transported 631 people to hospitals, compared with the normal average of 536.

Plante said firefighters and police have started going door to door to visit at-risk Montrealers to ensure they are taking such precautions as drinking plenty of water and accessing the services they need during the extreme weather.
Dr. Mylène Drouin, Montreal's regional director of public health, said there were six deaths related to the heat wave, although the total number of deaths in the city for all causes has not risen beyond the normal level of 10 per day.
Authorities are targeting areas of the city with high populations of seniors and low-income residents and a high proportion of heat islands, caused by expanses of concrete and asphalt as well as tall buildings, she said. On Monday, emergency teams visited 1,300 addresses in the downtown, Villeray and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve districts and they were to visit another 5,000 on Tuesday.
"Our teams are on the ground and are following the situation closely to adapt their actions according to the needs of the public," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance, who is the co-ordinator of civil security for the Montreal agglomeration.
Of the 1,300 people visited Monday, only one had to be taken to a hospital, he said.
Plante urged Montrealers to keep an eye on neighbours who are elderly, isolated or sick and to make sure they have access to a place to cool off.
"There's nothing like being a good neighbour," she said.
"If you have an older neighbour and you wonder if she's safe, please go and knock on the door, and just find out if the person is OK," she said.
Drouin said public health authorities established Montreal's strategy for extreme heat episodes after the heat wave of early July 2010, when 106 people died of weather-related causes.
"We learned our lesson from 2010," she said.
The very young and very old, and people suffering from mental illness or drug dependencies, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat, as are those with chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and respiratory illnesses, Drouin said.
And she reminded the public never to leave a child or pet in a car, even for a minute.
The CAA warned Tuesday that a vehicle's cabin turns into an oven in the hot sun. At 22 degrees Celsius, the inside temperature of the vehicle reaches 50 C; at 35 C, it reaches 66; and at 41 C, it reaches 100, the boiling point for water.
The heat has also resulted in delays on the Exo (formerly Réseau de transport métropolitan) Deux-Montagnes commuter train line Tuesday afternoon. The agency says the high temperature caused technical issues with the signals at the Mont-Royal tunnel and that CN employees are working to resolve the problem ahead of rush hour.
On Friday, the city implemented the first stage of its intervention strategy for extremely hot weather by extending hours for municipal swimming pools and urging residents to:
* Drink plenty of water, without waiting until you feel thirsty.
* Take cool baths or showers to cool off.
* Spend a few hours in air-conditioned environments like shopping centres, libraries, movie theatres, etc.
* Limit physical activity.
* Wear light clothing.
Drouin said authorities are deploying the additional measures because the hot, humid weather that began on the weekend is expected to last until at least Thursday. Environment Canada has maintained a heat warning for most of southern Quebec, Ontario and parts of the Maritimes.
Despite the record breaking weekend, meteorologist with Environment Canada Antoine Petit said the worst is not over yet. With more southerly winds expected for Thursday, Montrealers will feel a substantial increase in humidity. He said that will make the forecast of 34 C feel closer to 45 C.
The good news: thunderstorms overnight Thursday to Friday will lead to a cold break, bringing the city back down to its normal seasonal temperatures of around 25 C just before the weekend, Petit continued.
Petit said the last time Montreal saw a prolonged heat wave like this was in the 1970s.
With climate change, these episodes are becoming increasingly common, Drouin noted.
Air-conditioned rooms in 19 CLSCs across the city are being opened to vulnerable members of the public. If you need a place to cool off or know an elderly or vulnerable person who does, call 811 and you will be directed to the appropriate resources.
Drouin said Urgences-santé received 1,200 calls for ambulances Monday - up from the normal 950. Ambulances transported 631 people to hospitals, compared with the normal average of 536.
She acknowledged that some patients in local hospitals and chronic-care institutions are in rooms without air conditioning. Patients in those settings should be taken out of their rooms twice a day, for two hours at a time, to an air-conditioned part of the building. They should also be provided with other measures to keep cool, like towels moistened with cold water, she said.
Plante said the city has distributed 17,000 litres of bottled water to organizations working with the homeless and another 25,000 litres to boroughs, other island communities and emergency services.

On Monday, the temperature reached 35.2 C in Montreal, with a humidex of 45. By noon Tuesday, it was 30 C with a humidex of 38, according to the weather office.
Humidex values in the Montreal area could reach 40 degrees Tuesday and could go over 40 on Thursday, Environment Canada said.

"Our teams are on the ground and are following the situation closely to adapt their actions according to the needs of the public," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance, who is the coordinator of civil security for the Montreal agglomeration.
Environment Canada says the hot, humid weather that began over the weekend will last in southern Quebec until at least Thursday. A heat warning is still in effect for most of southern Quebec, Ontario, and parts of the Maritimes.
On Monday, the temperature reached 35.2 degrees Celsius in Montreal, with a humidex of 45. By noon Tuesday, it was 30 degrees with a humidex of 38, according to Environment Canada.
Humidex values in the Montreal area could go as high as 40 degrees Celsius Tuesday and may go over 40 C on Thursday, Environment Canada says.

Heat has emergency crews scrambling; Urgences-santé asks Montrealers to call 911 only in life-threatening situations

Full text: On the hottest day of the year, Urgences-santé said its crews were struggling to respond to an increased number of emergency calls in the Montreal area.
The organization urged people on Monday to call 911 only in the case of a life-threatening emergency.
Spokesperson Benoit Garneau said people can dial 811 to contact Info-santé if they have non-urgent health problems.
"If people are capable of standing, if they're conscious and alert and have minor problems, they shouldn't call 911," he said.
More than 1,200 people in the Montreal area called 911 on Sunday - approximately 200 more than usual.
At least 30 of those calls were directly related to the heat.
At the end of the day, Urgencessanté said paramedics responded to more calls Monday - and more heat-related emergencies - than Sunday.
The week ahead seemed to promise more of the same.
Urgences-santé increased the number of ambulances it has operating in the Montreal area to about 90.
Even with more crews, delays have increased, Garneau said, especially for calls that aren't lifethreatening.
"If your situation is urgent, and you call us, you're going to have an ambulance, but unfortunately we have ambulances that are on nonurgent calls when they shouldn't be," he said.
Montreal police and firefighters were also busy Monday going door-to-door making sure the city's elderly weren't overburdened by the heat.
According to the Montreal fire department, the city has a list of 55,000 addresses of people who are considered vulnerable during a heat wave.
SPVM spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant said officers were asked to pay special attention to the elderly and the homeless during the heat wave.
René Heroux, a meteorologist at Environment Canada, said the warm, tropical air mass hovering over the city this week comes from the southern United States. He said the temperatures aren't rare for Montreal, but the high humidity is.
"The humidity we're having is unusual," he said. "When you combine high temperatures with high humidity, you get a high level of discomfort."
On Monday, temperatures climbed to 35 C but felt like 43 with the humidity factored in. Hot, indeed, but not yet a record: On July 2, 1931, the mercury shot up to 36 C in the city at a time when air conditioning was not widespread.
On Friday, the city warned Montrealers to drink lots of water, stay out of the heat and avoid physical activity as much as possible during the heat wave.

Verdun hospital patients advised to bring their fans

Full text: After spending the weekend at the Verdun General Hospital with her brother, Point-St-Charles resident Wylma Cobb had some advice for others who might have to make a similar trip during this week's heat wave: "Bring your own fan."
In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, patients on the upper floors of the Verdun General Hospital do not have access to air conditioning in their rooms or the halls just outside.
The emergency room is wonderful, Cobb said, but patients who have been moved to beds on upper floors can be found sitting in the hallways in front of industrial fans or with damp cloths on their foreheads and necks. Buckets of melting ice sit outside patient rooms.
"It's like hell up there," Cobb said. "To me, it's just totally inhumane."
Her brother, Derek, 66, was brought to the hospital by ambulance after developing an infection at his residence on Saturday. He has difficulty communicating, and Cobb said that is probably why he was brought to the Verdun General instead of the Glen, where his medical records are.
"Sometimes you don't end up in the right place, and that shouldn't be," Cobb said. "You should be able to go to any hospital and be served (under the same conditions)."
Taking the advice of a nurse, Cobb purchased a fan for her brother's room. Others on the upper floors have done the same, evidenced by the tags that have yet to be removed, she pointed out. Cobb said that when Derek is released, she plans on leaving his fan for other patients who do not have the means to get one of their own.
After reading a Montreal Gazette article about individuals who were sent to local emergency rooms because they were suffering from heat stroke, Wylma said she needed to vent her frustrations.
"I just think it's appalling," she said. "Nobody comes (to the hospital) for a vacation."
A spokesperson for Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS), the government group that operates the hospital, confirmed there is no air conditioning in patient rooms in some of their centres. She continued that there are climatecontrolled public spaces within the centres for patients and their visitors, though she was unable to specify where they could be found at the Verdun General Hospital.
After walking around, Cobb, who lives with a respiratory illness, said the only place that felt cooler to her was on the hospital's first floor.
That area, however, is not easily reachable for Derek, who is quadriplegic and effectively confined to his bed without additional assistance.
"It's not enough. My brother can't get out of bed," she said, adding that there are probably others like him who aren't mobile enough to reach these spaces.
"Sick people should be treated better," Cobb said as she dampened another cloth for Derek's neck.
Improvements are set to be made to the Verdun General Hospital. In 2014, a project to modernize and expand the hospital was included in the Quebec government's 2014-2024 infrastructure plan. In it, the government pledged almost $17 billion over 10 years to improve about a dozen health-care facilities across the province.
In the project's description of the current state of the hospital, noise and heat are listed as causes of patient discomfort in the care and intensive care units. Improving therapeutic conditions is also one of the project's goals. As of the beginning of July, the project's web page shows that it is still in the planning phase. kelitwin@postmedia.com twitter.com/kelseylitwin

Full text: More than 36,000 clients of Hydro-Québec were waking up Tuesday morning without power - and air conditioning - as a record breaking heat wave continued to crush parts of the province.
As of 7 a.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting that 36,640 customers didn't have electricity - 6,495 of them in the Outaouais( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/outaouais.html#bis ) region, 14,209 in the Lanaudière( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/lanaudiere.html#bis ) and 8,815 in the the Laurentians.
The outages were caused by a chain of severe thunderstorms that swept through Monday evening, Hydro-Québec said.
By contrast, only 80 customers lost power in Montreal, which was narrowly missed by the storms but was put under a severe thunderstorm warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/severe-thunderstorm-warning-issued-for-montreal-and-surrounding-areas ) Monday evening.
Hydro-Québec said that it was too early to say when power would be restored to all its customers.
The outages continue on a day when temperatures are expected to climb as high as 32 C with a humidex of 37.

Missing elderly Quebec couple found in N.B., 850 kilometres from home( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/missing-elderly-quebec-couple-found-in-n-b-850-kilometres-from-home ):
An elderly Quebec couple who had been missing since Saturday night were found late Sunday night in Rockport, N.B., almost 850 kilometres from home.
Irène Bolduc, 83, and Laurier Dupuis, 81, appeared to be confused, and police could not explain why they had strayed so far off course while driving home to St-Gédéon-de-Beauce, a region south of Quebec City.
The couple had attended a family reception in Shannon, near Quebec City, on Saturday but did not return home afterward. Family members contacted police on Sunday morning to report them missing.
They were found in their Dodge Caravan after Dupuis stopped in Rockport to ask a local resident for directions. The resident noticed the elderly man seemed confused and alerted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP contacted the Sûreté du Québec, which identified the two seniors as the missing Quebec couple.
The SQ did not know why the couple wandered so far from home, other than to say they must have gotten lost.
Inmate escapes from Amos prison:( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/inmate-escapes-from-amos-prison )
The minister of public security confirmed Monday afternoon that a detainee at Amos prison escaped Sunday night.
Earlier in the day, Mathieu Lavoie, president of the union of Quebec correctional officers, said an inmate in a temporary modular building had escaped.
Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Dominic Houle, 38, was reported missing from the Amos facility around 8 a.m. Monday. According to Lavoie, Houle tricked guards into believing he was in bed, and he climbed the two fences that surround the prison.
Lavoie said Houle was in prison on accusations of fraud. He received a suspended sentence, which means he was serving part of his sentence in the community, but he violated the conditions of his sentence and was then incarcerated in Amos.
By mid-afternoon Monday, the Sûreté du Québec said no arrests had been made in connection with the escape.

Even with more crews, delays have increased, Garneau said, especially for calls that aren't life-threatening.
"If your situation is urgent and you call us, you're going to have an ambulance, but unfortunately we have ambulances that are on non-urgent calls when they shouldn't be," he said.
Montreal police and firefighters were also busy Monday going door-to-door making sure the city's elderly weren't overburdened by the heat.
According to the Montreal fire department, the city has a list of 55,000 addresses of people who are considered vulnerable during a heat wave.
SPVM spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant said officers were asked to pay special attention to the elderly and the homeless during the heat wave.
René Heroux, a meteorologist at Environment Canada, said the warm, tropical air mass hovering over the city this week comes from the southern United States. He said the temperatures aren't rare for Montreal, but the high humidity is.
"The humidity we're having is unusual," he said. "When you combine high temperatures with high humidity, you get a high level of discomfort."
On Monday, temperatures climbed to 35 C but felt like 43 with the humidity factored in. Hot, indeed, but not yet a record: On July 2, 1931, the mercury shot up to 36 C in the city at a time when air conditioning was not widespread.
On Friday, the city warned Montrealers to drink lots of water, stay out of the heat and avoid physical activity as much as possible during the heat wave.

Full text: Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Montreal, Laval, Châteauguay, and Longueuil areas just before 5 p.m. Monday. By 6 p.m. the organization ended the warning.
According to their website( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#173820044815079580201807020504wu1070cwul ), meteorologists were tracking a line of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.
This warning comes after Environment Canada issued a severe heat warning for the same areas earlier Monday.
"Lightning kills and injures Canadians every year. Remember, when thunder roars, go indoors!"

'Bring your own fan': No AC in patient rooms at Verdun General

Full text: After spending the weekend at the Verdun General Hospital with her brother, Point-St-Charles resident Wylma Cobb had some advice for others who might have to make a similar trip during this week's heat wave: "Bring your own fan."
In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, patients on the upper floors of the Verdun General Hospital do not have access to air conditioning in their rooms or the halls just outside.
The emergency room is wonderful, Cobb said, but patients who have been moved to beds on upper floors can be found sitting in the hallways in front of industrial fans or with damp cloths on their foreheads and necks. Buckets of melting ice sit outside patient rooms.
"It's like hell up there," Cobb said. "To me, it's just totally inhumane."
Her brother, Derek, 66, was brought to the hospital by ambulance after developing an infection at his residence on Saturday. He has difficulty communicating, and Cobb said that is probably why he was brought to the Verdun General instead of the Glen, where his medical records are.
"Sometimes you don't end up in the right place, and that shouldn't be," Cobb said. "You should be able to go to any hospital and be served (under the same conditions)."
Taking the advice of a nurse, Cobb purchased a fan for her brother's room. Others on the upper floors have done the same, evidenced by the tags that have yet to be removed, she pointed out. Cobb said that when Derek is released, she plans on leaving his fan for other patients who do not have the means to get one of their own.
After reading a Montreal Gazette article( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/at-least-15-montrealers-transported-to-hospital-for-heat-related-injuries-urgences-sante ) about individuals who were sent to local emergency rooms because they were suffering from heat stroke, Wylma said she needed to vent her frustrations.
"I just think it's appalling," she said. "Nobody comes (to the hospital) for a vacation."
A spokesperson for Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux (CIUSSS), the government group that operates the hospital, confirmed there is no air conditioning in patient rooms in some of their centres. She continued that there are climate-controlled public spaces within the centres for patients and their visitors, though she was unable to specify where they could be found at the Verdun General Hospital.
After walking around, Cobb, who lives with a respiratory illness, said the only place that felt cooler to her was on the hospital's first floor. That area, however, is not easily reachable for Derek, who is quadriplegic and effectively confined to his bed without additional assistance.
"It's not enough. My brother can't get out of bed," she said, adding that there are probably others like him who aren't mobile enough to reach these spaces.
"Sick people should be treated better," Cobb said as she dampened another cloth for Derek's neck.
Improvements are set to be made to the Verdun General Hospital. In 2014, a project to modernize and expand the hospital( https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/nos-installations/centre-hospitalier-de-soins-generaux-et-specialises-chsgs/hopital-de-verdun/projet-de-modernisation-et-dagrandissement-de-lhopital-de-verdun/ ) was included in the Quebec government's 2014-2024 infrastructure plan( https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/PDF/budget_depenses/14-15/PQI2014_2024.pdf ). In it, the government pledged almost $17 billion over 10 years to improve about a dozen health-care facilities across the province.
In the project's description of the current state of the hospital, noise and heat are listed as causes of patient discomfort in the care and intensive care units. Improving therapeutic conditions is also one of the project's goals. As of the beginning of July, the project's web page shows that it is still in the planning phase.

Full text: On the hottest day of the year, Urgences-santé said its crews were struggling to respond to an increased number of emergency calls in the Montreal area.
The organization urged people on Monday to only call 911 in the case of a life-threatening emergency.
Spokesperson Benoit Garneau said people can dial 811 to contact Info-santé if they have non-urgent health problems.
"If people are capable of standing, if they're conscious and alert and have minor problems, they shouldn't call 911," he said.
More than 1,200 people in the Montreal area called 911 on Sunday - approximately 200 more than usual. At least 30 of those calls were directly related to the heat.
Urgences-santé increased the number of ambulances it has operating in the Montreal area to about 90.
Even with more crews, delays have increased, Garneau said, especially for calls that aren't life-threatening.
"If your situation is urgent and you call us, you're going to have an ambulance, but unfortunately we have ambulances that are on non-urgent calls when they shouldn't be," he said.

Full text: On the hottest day of the year, Urgences-santé said its crews were struggling to respond to an increased number of emergency calls in the Montreal area.
The organization urged people on Monday to only call 911 in the case of a life-threatening emergency.
Spokesperson Benoit Garneau said people can dial 811 to contact Info-santé if they have non-urgent health problems.
"If people are cable of standing, if they're conscious and alert and have minor problems, they shouldn't call 911," he said.
More than 1,200 people in the Montreal area called 911 on Sunday - approximately 200 more than usual. At least 30 of those calls were directly related to the heat.
Urgences-santé increased the number of ambulances it has operating in the Montreal area about 90.
Even with more crews, delays have increased, Garneau said, especially for calls that aren't life-threatening.
"If your situation is urgent and you call us, you're going to have an ambulance, but unfortunately we have ambulances that are on non-urgent calls when they shouldn't be," he said.
Garneau said some of Monday's 911 calls were related to the heat, and that they were on track for another 1,200 calls.
The humid air mass that stifled Montreal all weekend will hover over the city until late this week.
On Monday, temperatures climbed to 35 C but felt like 43 with the humidity factored in, according to Environment Canada. Hot, indeed, but not yet a record: On July 2, 1931, the mercury shot up to 36 C in the city at a time when air conditioning was not widespread.
On Friday, the city warned Montrealers to drink lots of water, stay out of the heat and avoid physical activity as much as possible during the heat wave.

Full text: At least 15 Montrealers had to be hospitalized Sunday due to the extreme heat, according to Urgences-Santé.
Jean-François Coornaert, a spokesperson for the organization, said that they transported several people to hospital who were suffering from heat stroke. He said that most of those cases weren't serious and were the result of people overexerting themselves outside.
Urgences-Santé is expecting the number of heat stroke cases to increase over the next few days.
"We're preparing for more," Coornaert said. "There's emergency plans that are going to be put in place to deal with the heat."
Coornaert said that mitigation plans for the heat will likely be issued by municipal authorities in the coming days. On June 29, the city of Montreal announced that municipal pools would stay open late during the heatwave( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ). The city also encouraged residents to drink lots of water and to avoid outdoor physical activity.
Temperatures got up to 33 C Sunday but felt more like 44 C with the humidity factored in, making it the hottest day of the year.
But the heat isn't record breaking: in 1931, temperatures reached 36 C on Canada Day, according to Environment Canada archives.
Montrealers can expect even hotter weather in the coming week. Temperatures are set to climb as high as 34 C Monday, 32 C Tuesday and 35 C on Wednesday and Thursday according to Environment Canada.
Friday the mercury is still expected to hover in the low thirties, but the agency is forecasting a relatively frigid 27 C for Saturday.

Canadiens top prospects trying to stay cool during Montreal heat wave

Full text: The Bell Sports Complex in Brossard wasn't a bad place to be Saturday morning for fans who showed up to watch the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
With the temperature already at 27C and rising by noon - and late-afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast during Montreal's first heat wave of the summer - the Canadiens' air-conditioned practice facility was nice and cool.
Of course, it wasn't so cool for the players who were sweating it out on the ice during morning practice sessions and off-ice workouts before a 4 p.m. scrimmage that ended in a 1-1 tie with defenceman T.J. Melancon scoring for the Red team and centre Ryan Hughes scoring for the White.
Ryan Poehling( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=191764 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at the 2017 NHL Draft (25th overall), was still sweating when he met with the media on the facility's indoor soccer field after the morning practice ended.
"In Minnesota, it gets pretty hot," Poehling said about his home city of Lakeville, Minn. "But this soccer field in general is super hot."
Poehling, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound centre, added that the ice conditions on the rink were fine.
"That's the beauty about hockey, it doesn't change much," he said while wiping sweat off his forehead. "The ice is always going to be the same indoors, so that's nice."

Jesperi Kotkaniemi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=207533 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at this year's NHL Draft (third overall), said it was "weird" playing hockey when it was so hot outside.
"It's so hot all the time when you're on the ice," the 6-foot-2, 182-pound centre said.
Summer hockey is something new to Kotkaniemi, who never played it as a young boy growing up in Finland. Instead, the 17-year-old played soccer during the summer as a striker. Kotkaniemi gave up soccer when he was 12 to focus on hockey.
Poehling did play summer hockey in Minnesota, but said it was only for fun on Triple-A teams he put together with his buddies. He grew up near a three-on-three rink called Total Hockey and would also play there.
"I used to play in leagues two or three times a week where I played three-on-three and then also there would be tournaments where you could play five or six games in one day," he recalled. "It's pretty fun.

"Nothing too crazy," Poehling added about the competition level of his summer hockey. "That's what I liked and enjoyed about being young guys. It's not about getting better when you're that young. It will just come and you realize that. It's about the relationships you create and I think that was the biggest part for myself. I created so many relationships when I was playing Triple-A that still stand today. It was for fun ... as it should be. I love it (three-on-three). It's fun. The rink's a little shorter, so it's not as much skating. It's more handling (the puck) and getting guys open. But I do enjoy three-on-three."
After this evaluation camp, Poehling is planning to take a break and visit his family's cabin for the July 4 Independence Day holiday in the U.S. After that, he will head to the U.S. 2018 World Junior Summer Showcase from July 28-Aug. 4 in Kamloops, B.C., in preparation for next season's world junior championship. Poehling will be returning to St. Cloud State University next season for his third year after posting 14-17-31 totals in 36 games last season.
To retain his NCAA eligibility, Poehling has to pay his own way to attend the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
"Right now, I'm not a professional," the 19-year-old said. "It's not my job yet. As much as I would like to make it that way, I can't. I have a bunch of schooling to do. I'm still young and I got schooling to do, I have friends to hang out with. There's just so much that goes into the summer. Obviously, I do a lot of working out, five days a week, and then I also stick-handle a lot off the ice. But actually on the ice, I don't do that much (during the summer)."

Neither does Kotkaniemi, who said he hadn't been on skates for three weeks before the evaluation camp started on Thursday.
"It was so tough. It was terrible to me," he said with a laugh about getting back on the ice. "It's getting better. Today was a better day."
Kotkaniemi, who will turn 18 on July 6, will return home to Finland after the evaluation camp wraps up with a 9:30 a.m. scrimmage on Sunday and will enjoy a two-week break before he starts practising with his Finnish Elite League teammates with the Assat Pori team. Playing in the professional league last season as a 17-year-old against men, Kotkaniemi posted 10-19-29 totals in 57 games. His father coaches the team.
Poehling said one of the most important things at this Canadiens evaluation camp is to stay hydrated.
"We don't skate much in the offseason," he said. "All of sudden, you get thrown into camp and you've got two skates a day and one workout. So the fluids are key, especially at night. You just got to drink them and stay hydrated."

Full text: Max Domi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130519 ) will wear No. 13 next season with the Canadiens as a tribute to former Toronto Maple Leafs star Mats Sundin.( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=5252 )
His first choice would have been No. 16 as a tribute to former Philadelphia Flyers captain Bobby Clarke( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=1019 ), but that number has been retired by the Canadiens in honour of Hall of Famers Henri Richard( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=4547 ) and Elmer Lach.( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=2887 )
Domi's father, Tie( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=1391 ), was Sundin's teammate with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Sundin - a future Hall of Famer - became like an uncle to Domi while he was growing up. When Domi first started playing organized hockey, he chose Sundin's No. 13 instead of his father's No. 28 and he also developed Sundin's offensive skills instead of playing his father's tough-guy role.
But after Domi was diagnosed with having Type 1 diabetes( http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/living-with-type-1-diabetes ) at age 12, he switched to No. 16 because Clarke was also a diabetic and it didn't stop him from playing 15 seasons with the Flyers, winning two Stanley Cups and making it into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Domi had worn No. 16 ever since, including the last three seasons with the Arizona Coyotes before being traded to the Canadiens on June 15 in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk.

"As a Type 1 diabetic, every single day is a battle to a certain extent and there's a lot of adversity that goes with that," said Domi, a left-winger who is 5-foot-10 and 195 pounds. "But when you think of a person of that calibre (Clarke) that was doing it before we have all the technology that we have now .... geez, like how the heck did you do that? So you have just that much respect and when you're living it every day you know what that the grind is like.
"The first question I asked (after being diagnosed with diabetes) was if I could still play hockey," Domi added. "And as soon as they said yes, nothing else really fazed me. ... So just do whatever I have to do to make sure I can get to the NHL. When you have a guy that's done it before - way before your time and you have someone to look up to and kind of paved the path for you - it makes it that much smoother to get to. Playing in the NHL, you have to have pretty much perfect control of it (diabetes). Definitely proud to say that I've got a pretty good hold on things."

Domi now hopes he can inspire other young people with diabetes.
"You get a voice when you have a certain platform and you're playing in the NHL - or any type of professional athlete - and you can do whatever you want with that," Domi said. "Some guys like it, some guys don't, and everyone's kind of got their own feel and opinion on that. I've chosen to make the most of that and try and repay the diabetic community in the same way that Mr. Clarke did for me. If I can show some kids down the line that I'm living proof that you can do whatever you want, you can achieve your dreams, then that's kind of why I"m here. So it's pretty cool."
Domi also thought it was pretty cool to try on his new Canadiens jersey in the team's Brossard locker room Saturday afternoon as he dropped in on the club's evaluation camp during a 24-hour visit to Montreal.
"It's a little bit weird to see 13 with the last name Domi on the back of a Habs jersey," he said. "But I think it looks great. It's a great number."

Now Domi is hoping to put up better numbers with the Canadiens than he did last season with the Coyotes, when he posted 9-36-45 totals in 82 games with four of his goals being empty-netters. It was his second straight nine-goal season after scoring 18 during his rookie NHL campaign after being selected by the Coyotes in the first round (12th overall) at the 2013 NHL Draft. The Canadiens are hoping a change of scenery will help Domi and the Coyotes are hoping the same thing for Galchenyuk.
Domi grew up in a crazy Original Six hockey market and now he's happy to get to play in one.
"This is where I wanted to be and I couldn't be happier," he said. "Super excited. Everyone is different, of course. Some people might not want to play in a market like this, other people might want to, other people might not care. I'm definitely truly excited to be here and I want to be here. I'm hoping that this brings out the best in me."
Domi still remembers sleeping with a hockey stick when he was a young boy, dreaming about one day playing in the NHL, just like his father. But he never used his father's stick.
"He was a righty, so I didn't get to use his stick," said Domi, who shoots left. "His curve was terrible, anyways. The thing's like a shovel. It's more of like a dump-and-chase stick."
That drew a lot of laughs from the media in the Canadiens' locker room before Domi added: "You know what? He actually had a lot of skill."
But not as much as Mats Sundin or Bobby Clarke.

Full text: The Bell Sports Complex wasn't a bad place to be Saturday morning for fans who showed up to watch the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
With the temperature already at 27C and rising by noon - and late-afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast during Montreal's first heat wave of the summer - the Canadiens' air-conditioned practice facility was nice and cool.
Of course, it wasn't so cool for the players who were sweating it out on the ice during morning practice sessions and off-ice workouts before a 4 p.m. scrimmage that ended in a 1-1 tie with defenceman T.J. Melancon scoring for the Red team and centre Ryan Hughes scoring for the White.
Ryan Poehling( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=191764 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at the 2017 NHL Draft (25th overall), was still sweating when he met with the media on the facility's indoor soccer field after the morning practice ended.
"In Minnesota, it gets pretty hot," Poehling said about his home city of Lakeville, Minn. "But this soccer field in general is super hot."
Poehling, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound centre, added that the ice conditions on the rink were fine.
"That's the beauty about hockey, it doesn't change much," he said while wiping sweat off his forehead. "The ice is always going to be the same indoors, so that's nice."

Jesperi Kotkaniemi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=207533 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at this year's NHL Draft (third overall), said it was "weird" playing hockey when it was so hot outside.
"It's so hot all the time when you're on the ice," the 6-foot-2, 182-pound centre said.
Summer hockey is something new to Kotkaniemi, who never played it as a young boy growing up in Finland. Instead, the 17-year-old played soccer during the summer as a striker. Kotkaniemi gave up soccer when he was 12 to focus on hockey.
Poehling did play summer hockey in Minnesota, but said it was only for fun on Triple-A teams he put together with his buddies. He grew up near a three-on-three rink called Total Hockey and would also play there.
"I used to play in leagues two or three times a week where I played three-on-three and then also there would be tournaments where you could play five or six games in one day," he recalled. "It's pretty fun.

"Nothing too crazy," Poehling added about the competition level of his summer hockey. "That's what I liked and enjoyed about being young guys. It's not about getting better when you're that young. It will just come and you realize that. It's about the relationships you create and I think that was the biggest part for myself. I created so many relationships when I was playing Triple-A that still stand today. It was for fun ... as it should be. I love it (three-on-three). It's fun. The rink's a little shorter, so it's not as much skating. It's more handling (the puck) and getting guys open. But I do enjoy three-on-three."
After this evaluation camp, Poehling is planning to take a break and visit his family's cabin for the July 4 Independence Day holiday in the U.S. After that, he will head to the U.S. 2018 World Junior Summer Showcase from July 28-Aug. 4 in Kamloops, B.C., in preparation for next season's world junior championship. Poehling will be returning to St. Cloud State University next season for his third year after posting 14-17-31 totals in 36 games last season.
To retain his NCAA eligibility, Poehling has to pay his own way to attend the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
"Right now, I'm not a professional," the 19-year-old said. "It's not my job yet. As much as I would like to make it that way, I can't. I have a bunch of schooling to do. I'm still young and I got schooling to do, I have friends to hang out with. There's just so much that goes into the summer. Obviously, I do a lot of working out, five days a week, and then I also stick-handle a lot off the ice. But actually on the ice, I don't do that much (during the summer)."
Neither does Kotkaniemi, who said he hadn't been on skates for three weeks before the evaluation camp started on Thursday.
"It was so tough. It was terrible to me," he said with a laugh about getting back on the ice. "It's getting better. Today was a better day."
Kotkaniemi, who will turn 18 on July 6, will return home to Finland after the evaluation camp wraps up with a 9:30 a.m. scrimmage on Sunday and will enjoy a two-week break before he starts practising with his Finnish Elite League teammates with the Assat Pori team. Playing in the professional league last season as a 17-year-old against men, Kotkaniemi posted 10-19-29 totals in 57 games. His father coaches the team.
Poehling said one of the most important things at this Canadiens evaluation camp is to stay hydrated.
"We don't skate much in the offseason," he said. "All of sudden, you get thrown into camp and you've got two skates a day and one workout. So the fluids are key, especially at night. You just got to drink them and stay hydrated."

Marshmallows not included: Campfire ban lifted in Southern Quebec

Full text: Cottage-goers are able to enjoy campfires over the long weekend as the Quebec Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks has lifted their open-air fire ban for the south of the province.
The ministry said the decision was made to end the ban in the Outaouais, Laurentian, Lanaudière and parts of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue regions after preventative measures and increased rainfall has reduced risks of wildfires.
The ban, which had been in effect since Tuesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bonfire-ban-covers-vast-areas-of-quebec-including-cottage-country ), still covers northern parts of the province, including the Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Mauricie, Abitibi and Vallée-de-l'Or areas.

Full text: Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the island of Montreal and surrounding areas Saturday.
The agency warns of conditions "favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and torrential rain."
The watch is in effect until 11:00 p.m. and comes as a result of a warm, humid airmass hovering over Southern Quebec( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ) this weekend.
The agency also issued a heat warning for the Montreal area Saturday and reminded people to drink plenty of water and limit physical activity outside.
"Never leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly aerated room, even for a few minutes," the agency warned. "Check on your loved ones, especially those vulnerable or living alone."

Full text: Indoors Saturday
Kamasi Washington (8:30 p.m. Metropolis, $49 to $70) - This L.A. saxophone visionary has been ushering in a new era of jazz since the release of his aptly titled 2015 double-album The Epic. His new EP, The Choice, shows more of the sweeping grandeur and creativity that has seen him sit in with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Herby Hancock. Outdoors Saturday
Spanish Harlem Orchestra (9 and 11 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne Mance St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) - There will be dancing in the streets as this venerable New York/Nuyorican salsa ensemble brings the fire to the outdoor main stage. And they're calling for a heat wave? Of course they are.
Ghost Note feat. MonoNeon (10 p.m., Club Jazz Casino de Montreal, corner Bleury St. and René-Lévesque Blvd., free) - Two nights after rocking Metropolis with funky fusion jazz band Snarky Puppy, drummer Robert "Sput" Searight and percussionist Nate Werth present their new project Ghost Note, accompanied by bass fiend MonoNeon, a.k.a. Dywane Thomas Jr., who was among the last people to play with Prince. Indoors Sunday
Vinícius Cantuária (10 p.m., L'Astral, $42) - Veteran Brazilian singer-guitarist Vinícius Cantuária keeps the bossa nova torch alive, infusing it with the subtle jazz sensibility that has seen him collaborate with Brian Eno, Marc Ribot, David Byrne and Bill Frisell. In 2015, he released an album of covers of bossa godfather Antonio Carlos Jobim, including the essential Garota de Ipanema. Outdoors Sunday
The Suffers (9 and 11 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne Mance St. and De Maisonneuve Blvd., free) - Texas jazz-funk-soul-pop crew The Suffers are part of the new wave of infectious crossover acts with real chops. Vocalist Kam Franklin conjures the spirit of namesake Aretha by way of Alabama Shakes'Brittany Howard. A prime example of the world-class free fare available nightly at the jazz fest.
La Chiva Gantiva (10 p.m., Scène du Monde, corner Clark St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) - A trio of Colombians living in Brussels round up an eclectic crew to create a simmering groove unit mixing Latin, funk, world and hip-hop styles, singing and rapping en espagnol and en français. Their 2017 album Despegue features cameos from rapper Speech of '90s group Arrested Development, and Martin Perna of New York Afrobeat ensemble Antibalas. Indoors Monday
Herbie Hancock, Thundercat (7:30 p.m., Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Place des Arts, $82.85 to $105.85) - Rightfully promoted as a double bill, this meeting between jazz legend Herbie Hancock and wild-man singer-bassist-producer Thundercat has old-school-meetsnew-school written all over it. Thundercat has worked with Kendrick Lamar, Kamasi Washington, Erykah Badu, and Childish Gambino, aside from releasing his own psychedelic R&B. Outdoors Monday
Delgres (7 p.m., Hyundai Blues Stage, corner Clark St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) - Guadeloupian blues - what more do we need to say? France-born singer-guitarist Pascal Danaë has toured with Gilberto Gil, Peter Gabriel and Youssou N'Dour. He and his trio bring funky African flavours to his distinctly modern interpretation of the blues. Perhaps the best thing you'll catch on the blues stage this week.
Nomadic Massive (9 and 11 p.m., TD Stage, free) - Montreal's sprawling jazz-funk-hip-hop collective never fails to get the party going, mixing politics with dance floor antics. This is multiculti urban music with a thrillingly all-inclusive mash-up vibe. It's no wonder the jazz fest rewarded them with a prestigious main stage slot to close out the long weekend.
AT A GLANCE The Montreal International Jazz Festival continues through July 7. For more info, visit montrealjazzfest.com

Montreal prepares for hottest recorded Canada Day as heat wave rolls in

Full text: Stock up on frozen treats and turn on your air conditioner; a heat wave is rolling into Montreal this weekend, bringing with it the city's hottest recorded July 1 temperatures.
Temperatures of up to 35 C - which will feel closer to 40 with humidity- are expected for Canada Day (and Moving Day) on Sunday.
That's 10 degrees above the average daily high for July 1, according to historical data from Environment Canada, thus beating out 2014 as the hottest recorded Canada Day in Montreal since 1942.
"If the forecasted temperature is right, we will break a record, definitely," Environment Canada meteorologist Steve Boily confirmed.
The hot streak will likely continue until the end of next week, Boily said.
"It's going to become more and more uncomfortable," he continued, adding that Sunday and Monday will likely be the worst days.
According to Boily, Montreal has an average of nine to 10 days in July with temperatures above 30 C. This year, he said, we might hit that number earlier than in past years, as the hottest days normally begin at the end of July.
Because of the heat, the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro has already cancelled their Canada Day parade( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,43117560&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&id=30341&ret=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/url/page/prt_vdm_en/rep_annonces_ville/rep_communiques/communiques ), though they will continue with other planned activities( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=8417,94697648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&_piref8417_94697654_8417_94697648_94697648.strutsAction=/cal/publique/detailEvenement.cal&langue=EN&gid=58182&portlet=recherche&entite=CALEND_PIERREFONDS&typeContenu=EVEN_GENERIQUE&returnTo=/cal/publique/resultatsRecherche.cal&date=allTime&DateDebut=&DateFin= ).
The Demi-Marathon RBC de Sherbrooke, which is scheduled for Saturday, has also announced they will be monitoring the weather closely to see if changes need to be made to their 21-kilometre race to ensure safety. Check the race's Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/courirsherbrooke/posts/1659053370856622 ) for updates.
Many boroughs in the cities of Montreal and Longueuil( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/communiques/2018/chaleur-accablante-prolonge-heures-ouverture-ses-piscines-ses-pataugeoires-rappelle ) have also extended the hours of municipal swimming pools later into the evening, giving Montrealers more time to cool off.
Confederation Pool at 6265 Biermans Ave. in N.D.G. and Lasalle Pool at 475 10th Ave. in Lachine will remain open until 8:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., respectively.
Montrealers can find more information about their neighbourhood pools and splash pads from the Banque d'info 311 at ville.montreal.qc.ca( http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/banque311/content/%E2%96%BA-arrondissements-%E2%80%93-plages-piscines-ext%C3%A9rieures-pataugeoires-et-jeux-deau ), whereas Longueuil residents can find which of the city's more than 20 pools is closest to them on www.longueuil.quebec/fr/ete( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/ete ).
In anticipation of the upcoming heat wave, Santé Montreal has also issued a reminder( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/index.php?id=4554 ) to help citizens identify symptoms of heat exhaustion:
Dry mouth, which is a sign of dehydration
Headache
Dizziness
Confusion
Fainting
The agency said the best ways to beat the heat are to drink water even before you feel thirsty, stay in a cool, air-conditioned environment for at least a few hours a day, and - sorry to those moving on July 1( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/moving-day-still-strong-though-movers-hope-it-will-fade?video_autoplay=true ) - reduce physical activity as much as you can.
If ever you feel any of the above symptoms, call 811 for Info-Santé. A fever could be a sign of heatstroke, in which case Montrealers should call 911.

Because of the heat, the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro has already cancelled their Canada Day parade( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,43117560&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&id=30341&ret=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/url/page/prt_vdm_en/rep_annonces_ville/rep_communiques/communiques ), though they will continue with other planned activities( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=8417,94697648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&_piref8417_94697654_8417_94697648_94697648.strutsAction=/cal/publique/detailEvenement.cal&langue=EN&gid=58182&portlet=recherche&entite=CALEND_PIERREFONDS&typeContenu=EVEN_GENERIQUE&returnTo=/cal/publique/resultatsRecherche.cal&date=allTime&DateDebut=&DateFin= ).
The Demi-Marathon RBC de Sherbrooke, which is scheduled for Saturday, has also announced that they'll be monitoring the weather closely to see if changes need to be made to their 21-kilometre race to ensure safety. Check the race's Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/courirsherbrooke/posts/1659053370856622 ) for updates.
Many boroughs in the cities of Montreal and Longueuil( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/communiques/2018/chaleur-accablante-prolonge-heures-ouverture-ses-piscines-ses-pataugeoires-rappelle ) have also extended the hours of municipal swimming pools later into the evening, giving Montrealers more time to cool off.
Confederation Pool at 6265 Biermans Ave. in N.D.G. and Lasalle Pool at 475 10th Ave. in Lachine will both remain open until 8:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., respectively.
Montrealers can find more information about their neighbourhood pools and splash pads here( http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/banque311/content/%E2%96%BA-arrondissements-%E2%80%93-plages-piscines-ext%C3%A9rieures-pataugeoires-et-jeux-deau ), whereas Longueuil residents can find which of the city's more than 20 pools is closest to them on the city's website( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/ete ).
In anticipation of the upcoming heat wave, Santé Montreal has also issued a reminder( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/index.php?id=4554 ) to help citizens identify symptoms of heat exhaustion:
Dry mouth, which is a sign of dehydration
Headaches
Dizziness
Confusion
Fainting
The agency says the best ways to beat the heat are to drink water, even before you feel thirsty, stay in a cool, air-conditioned environment for at least a few hours a day, and - sorry to those moving July 1( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/moving-day-still-strong-though-movers-hope-it-will-fade?video_autoplay=true ) - reduce physical activity as much you can.

Full text: For those who are courageous - and hydrated - enough to brave the heat on Sunday, here is a list of some of the activities on and off the island in celebration of Canada Day. Be warned: Environment Canada has issued a heat wave for the Montreal region for Canada Day weekend, with daytime highs of 30 to 35 C feeling more like 40 because of the humidity. The agency advises taking part in outdoor activities during the cooler hours of the day.
DAYLONG PARTIES TOPPED OFF WITH FIREWORKS
From 11:30 a.m. to just after 10 p.m., Montrealers can enjoy family-friendly activities such as street hockey, inflatable games, airbrush tattoos and photo booths in the Old Port at 333 de la Commune St. W.
For those who'd like to learn more about the nation, they can partake in virtual reality workshops about Canada's Armed Forces and watch a swearing-in ceremony of new Canadians.
Attendees will be treated to an evening of music before capping off the night with a firework display from the Jacques-Cartier pier at 10 p.m. More information at: canadadaymontreal.org.
On the North Shore, a similar event is taking place at Centre de la nature at 901 du Parc Ave. in Laval, starting at noon with music at 8 p.m. and fireworks at 10 p.m.
In Longueuil, a parade will travel about four kilometres from René-Veillet Park (1050 de Parklane St.) to Empire Park (195 Empire St.), leading residents to a party full of games, street performers and workshops. A concert beginning at 5:30 p.m. will lead up to fireworks, starting at 9:30 p.m.
CANADA DAY PARADE THROUGH DOWNTOWN
The Canada Day parade will travel through downtown, beginning at the corner of Fort and Ste-Catherine Sts. at 11 a.m., and travel east along Ste-Catherine St. and end at Place du Canada, near René-Lévesque Blvd. and Peel St. There, attendees will be treated to free slices of a giant cake between 1:30 and 2 p.m. More details at montrealcanadadayparade.com.
MUSIC AND A BARBECUE IN MONTREAL WEST
Montreal West will host a barbecue with music and games at 4 p.m. at Strathearn Park, on the corner of Strathearn Ave. N. and Parkside St.
The town will have its own fireworks at 10 p.m., just down the street from the earlier festivities at Hodgson Field on Bedbrook Ave.
ART IN THE CENTRE-SUD
For a change of pace, Montrealers can walk through Mtl en Arts, an open-air art exhibit featuring 90 artists, along Ste-Catherine St. between St-Hubert St. and Papineau Ave. between noon and 6 p.m..

Full text: Stifling heat will probably affect Canada Day activities, according to Environment Canada.
The agency issued a special weather statement Wednesday morning for the greater Montreal area, saying rain showers Wednesday evening and Thursday are expected to clear by the weekend as a warm and humid air mass moves into the province.
Temperatures were forecast to hit 27 degrees Celsius Wednesday, with a UV index of 8 - very high.
The heat wave will last into next week. Daytime highs are expected to hit 30 to 35 degrees and might feel like 40 because of the humidity. The weather statement covers most of southern Quebec as well as parts of Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I.
The agency said heat warnings may be issued for the weekend.

The location - a parking lot in the Quartier des Spectacles - had been promised to the McCord Museum, which is looking to build a new $150-million home.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration decided to build a park there instead to make up for the loss of nearby Jardin Domtar, a green space that Domtar has sold to Groupe Canvar, which plans to build a condo/hotel tower there.
The new park will go on land bounded by de Maisonneuve Blvd., President-Kennedy Ave., and Bleury and Jeanne-Mance Sts.
On Friday, Plante announced the city has asked the Montreal Urban Ecology Centre to develop planning guidelines for the new park by consulting downtown residents and other stakeholders.
Consultations are expected to start this summer and be completed by year-end.
The city wants to increase green space downtown "to offer residents, workers and visitors a new place to relax in the heart of the Quartier des Spectacles," Plante said in a press release.
"We are committed to making Montreal a greener city. With this new space, we will continue the fight against heat islands." HEAT-ISLAND EFFECT The heat-island effect occurs when large concrete or paved areas absorb heat, increasing the temperature in the surrounding area.
"With the revegetation envisioned, the frequency, duration and intensity of extreme heat waves affecting urban health can be reduced," Plante said.
Plante said Domtar and Canvar "have committed to contribute financially" to create the new park.
A city spokesperson did not respond to a request for information about the timing of the park's opening and the amount the two companies are expected to donate.
As recently as late May, the Mc-Cord was still holding out hope that it could convince the city to let it use the parking lot, offering to create green space in and around a new building at the site.
Montreal initially told the Mc-Cord that no other city land was available for the McCord's planned new home. But in May the city told the museum that it would look for other city properties that meet the museum's criteria.
The McCord - a social history museum that welcomes 200,000 visitors annually - says it has run out of space at its current location on Sherbrooke St., across from Mc-Gill University. ariga@postmedia.com twitter.com/andyriga

Full text: By spring standards, it was nothing short of a heat wave.
Montreal terrasses filled with sun-seekers Wednesday as temperatures soared to 27 C at 4 p.m., just short of the record hit in 1979 with 30.7 C.
But the start of the al fresco season elation is expected to damper down for the rest of the week: The balmy weather won't last, Environment Canada says.
The agency is calling for showers on Thursday, a dip in temperatures on Friday with a high of 13 C, then more rain for the weekend.
The average high for this time of the year is 17.5 C.

Study on cellphones and cancer is reassuring; Actually, rats exposed to phones lived longer than the control group, Christopher Labos writes

Full text: If anyone ever tried to convince you that cellphones cause brain cancer, they probably referred to the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP). In 2016, the NTP published preliminary results suggesting that cellphones increased the risk of brain and heart cancer. The wave of concerned headlines was predictable.
Many criticisms could be made about the study, but the main one was that the final data had not been published.
Fortunately, we now have the final report and can look at the data more carefully.
A few things to mention before we begin: The positive finding occurred in rats, but not mice. The positive finding occurred in male rats, but not female rats. There were no humans in this experiment. The authors used the word "equivocal" a lot.
Now, let's examine the data.
The scientists exposed their animals (starting when they were embryos) to cellphones for nine hours a day, every day for two years. They then examined them for several kinds of cancer.
Ultimately, the only positive finding was an increased incidence of cardiac schwannomas, a rare form of cancer you probably have never heard of.
Contrary to what is being reported, the study did not show an increased risk of brain cancer (see Table 22 on Page 102 of the report if you don't believe me). There were too few cases to demonstrate a statistical trend, and in fact the rates of brain cancer went down as cellphone power output was increased, which is nonsensical.
Finally, the report actually showed that those rats exposed to cellphones lived longer than the control group. Thus a more appropriate headline could have been, "Cellphones make you live longer" rather than "Cellphones cause cancer."
The problem with the cellphone-cancer discussion is that it lacks biological plausibility. Cellphones emit radio frequency waves, which is actually quite different from what most people understand as "radiation." Energy exists on a spectrum, of which we are only able to perceive a very narrow band, visible light. We can see red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet light, but nothing else.
Beyond violet light we have we have ultraviolet or UV radiation, which is emitted principally by the sun. Beyond that, we have X-rays and gamma rays. All these forms of radiation are called ionizing because they are high-energy waves and have the ability to damage DNA when passing through human tissue. Ionizing radiation is well known to cause cancer.
But at the other end of the spectrum, beyond red light, are infrared light, microwaves, radio waves and TV signals. These are nonionizing radiation. They are low-energy signals and do not have the ability to alter or damage DNA. Non-ionizing radiation, like radio frequency waves, can heat up body tissues exposed long enough (that is how your microwave works), but cannot disrupt DNA. So if someone wants to posit that cellphones cause cancer, they must first explain how, exactly.
So why did this study show a positive result if cellphones don't cause cancer? Remember the association was only in rats, not mice, and only in male rats, not females. Also they tested nine different forms of cancer in four groups of animals, which led to 36 comparisons. If you accept a five per cent false positive rate (standard in medical statistics), the probability that you would have at least one false positive here is about 84 per cent. Given that we have a single positive finding among many negative analyses, I think we can assume it was a false positive.
If the statistics are not enough to reassure you, remember that this study probably doesn't apply to you anyway. You probably don't talk on your cellphone for nine hours a day. Also you are probably a human, and not a rat. Christopher Labos is a Montreal doctor and an associate with the Office for Science and Society. He also co-hosts a podcast called The Body of Evidence. twitter.com/drlabos christopher.labos@mail.mcgill. ca

Given that we have a single positive finding among many negative analyses, I think we can assume it was a false positive.
If the statistics are not enough to reassure you, remember that this study probably doesn't apply to you anyway. You probably don't talk on your cellphone for nine hours a day. Also you are probably a human, and not a rat.

Abstract: According to Rolland Dean Winters of Homesync, a company that specializes in integrating smart technology into homes, "Today, about 30 per cent of homes in North America have some kind of smart device installed." "Everything is controllable from an app, be it on an iOS or Android," he says and goes on to demonstrate the remote control of a large dual sided gas fireplace, that heats the dining room, as well as a seating area on the other side. Guido Caso, Marketing and Sales VP at Brivia Group, the real estate development company behind YUL, agrees that the energy efficiency is a big selling point.

Full text: Imagine yourself on the métro, checking your notes on the way to a very important meeting when, suddenly, you're hit by the dreaded question: "Did I turn off the stove top?"
Maybe you'd continue to your meeting, distracted by nagging worry. Or maybe you wouldn't be able to help yourself and would rush home to check only to realize you had actually turned off the stove top. Of course you did.
Or maybe, you're one of the people who are riding the wave of smart home devices, so you would simply check an app on your phone to determine whether or not you had left your home safe and sound. And maybe you might even be able to tap an app to remotely control the stove top.
In a scenario like this, it's easy to see the value of increasingly popular smart-home devices. The ability to control aspects of our home remotely is one of the smart home's greatest appeals. Home automation, by definition, puts the power in the hands of the homeowner, whether from home or away.
Rolland Dean Winters displays the audio, video, internet, cable and security recording equipment at the Cordahi home.
How common?
According to Rolland Dean Winters of Homesync, a company that specializes in integrating smart technology into homes, "Today, about 30 per cent of homes in North America have some kind of smart device installed."
And, he adds, that percentage is expected to increase.
"By 2022, it should be over half of all households."
A local home automation project is found in the Mount Royal home of Ghassan Cordahi and his family. The home is equipped with many of the bells and whistles smart-home living can offer, from the self-defrosting driveway, to the remote-control shades throughout.
Upon entering the home, with is two storeys plus a finished basement, you can feel the warmth of the heated slate grey floors that run through the dining space that opens to a cozy seating area. Natural light pours in from generous windows, each custom fitted with shades that Cordahi is happy to demonstrate raising and lowering from a control screen on his Android phone.
"Everything is controllable from an app, be it on an iOS or Android," he says and goes on to demonstrate the remote control of a large dual sided gas fireplace, that heats the dining room, as well as a seating area on the other side.
The second seating area is decorated with a long sectional sofa and a large television on the opposite wall. The homeowner's daughter, Marguerite Cordahi, demonstrates the ease of using the home automation remote to control the television.
Hidden under counters and along the ceiling, RGBW LED lighting is used throughout the house and controlled by an app.
The tour continues to the basement, which houses the "piece de resistance": the fully automated, high-tech home theatre room, boasting a giant screen that stretches the length of the wall. Facing the screen is another long sectional couch that's big enough for the whole family (and some friends) to sink into on a cold winter evening to watch a movie or hockey game. The quality of the sound coming from behind the screen and surrounding walls might just be the next best thing to being there.

Where do we go from here?
Smart-home technology is here to stay and will only grow more common over time.
On a frigid - 15 C day in January, Winters shows off one of Homesync's biggest endeavours, YUL. It's an impressive two-tower condo and townhouse project in downtown Montreal. One tower is nearing completion and the other is underway. They will both have 38 floors, with 800 condo units all together, and 17 townhouses - all units offering integrated smart-home technology.
A model four-storey townhouse has a sleek layout of open-concept living, dining and cooking spaces dressed in muted earth tones with splashes of soft yellow. An abundance of natural light flows through a large ceiling-to-floor window and a door to a terrace. The window is custom fitted with automated shades that can be opened or closed at the tap of an icon, either on the control pad mounted on the wall or with an app on the homeowner's phone.
The other three floors in the townhouse, accessible by stairs or private elevator, comprise the bedrooms equipped with more smart lighting and shades.
But light and shades are just part of the picture.
"Pretty much the sky is the limit," Winters says. "Some people think about safety more, monitoring the home remotely, etc. And some people think of efficiency and time-saving."
He explains how an integrated smart home system can save the homeowner on energy costs with smart thermostats that can regulate the temperature depending of whether or not people are home. It can regulate lighting usage by being programmed to turn off or on as a room is occupied or unoccupied.
Guido Caso, Marketing and Sales VP at Brivia Group, the real estate development company behind YUL, agrees that the energy efficiency is a big selling point.
"Besides," he adds, "it's becoming more standard practice" in new housing developments.
Heating, cooling, lighting and window shades are all controlled via an Android phone app.
Baby Steps: Smart devices for every home
Maybe you're the type of person who doesn't want to go all in with a fully integrated smart home.
Maybe it's too much all at once or you live in a rental unit and don't have the option of installing such a system.
No worries. Here is a list of a few smart devices that can be easily used in any dwelling without an extensive installation procedure.
An Amazon Alexa device. (Elaine Thompson/Associated Press)
Echo Dot and Alexa Echo
Price range $70-$135. Courtesy of Amazon's intelligent personal assistant service Alexa, these little devices can do many things from playing music to giving you news or weather updates, ordering paper towels or telling you how to spell "antidisestablishmentarianism", if you are so inclined to ask it.
Google Home
Price range: $80-$180. Courtesy of the Google assistant, this device is growing in popularity and is cutting into the market share of Amazon's popular Echo Dot and Alexa Echo. It is designed to work with a wide variety of wifi- or Bluetooth-enabled smart devices for your home.

Insteon Smart Plug
Price range $60-$70. Allows you to control lamps and appliances with voice (using Alexa or Google Home) or smartphone or even programmed schedules.
Dome Home Security Siren and Chime
Price range $50-$60. Once connected to a compatible hub, this home-security feature triggers sirens to alert you to intruders on your property, or when a door is ajar or a window is open.
Nest Learning Thermostat
Price range $300-$325. It lights up when it sees you coming and shows you the time and temperature without you even having to ask. Also, it can learn your schedule and adjust temperature accordingly. Works with Alexa or Google Home for voice control or from an app on your phone. Easy install.
Wink Hub 2
Price range $130-$150. This allows your smart devices to communicate with each other. It uses the Wink app on your phone to control the locks on your door, monitor your home, schedule lights to turn on or off automatically. Also works with Alexa and Google Home.
Samsung Smart Things Hub
Price range $110-$120. Uses the SmartThings App, Amazon Alexa or Google Home to control smart devices in your home.
The Clapper
Price range $50.-$55. Yes, if this is more your speed, you can still get The Clapper sound-activated on/off switch, initially released in 1985. But now, it can be used alongside a second clapper to control multiple devices.
More help?
If you're interested in trying some of these or other smart devices for your home, but are still a bit intimidated, consider trying a service like HeroPin. Found at heropin.com( https://heropin.com/ ), it connects consumers to local technicians to assist when the technology gets a bit overwhelming.

Full text: It was scheduled to be a normal Canadian autumn: Cardigans, apple cider and baking. And then, summer returned with a vengeance. Millions of Canadians are now living under conditions that aren't just unseasonably hot; they're the hottest it's been all year. Below, scenes from a Canada at the mercy of the heat gods.
Even the capitals of hot countries are colder than Ottawa right now Ottawa likes to brag that it is the coldest national capital in the world, with the exception of Ulan Bator, Mongolia. But this week even diplomats from hot, snowless countries are surprised to find that their Ottawa embassies are hotter than anything back home. On Tuesday afternoon, Ottawa was at 31 C. Kingston, Jamaica, was at 29 C. Mexico City was at 23 C. Even Tehran, Iran, didn't crack anything higher than 28 C.
Toronto shattered a weather record from 1891 Six score and six years ago, a Toronto meteorologist gazed at his mercury thermometer and likely used a quill pen to record a Sept. 25 temperature of 31.1 degrees Celsius. Victoria was still Queen, John Abbott was prime minister and Yonge Street smelled strongly of horse pee. Only on Monday was that 1891 record broken, with a reading of 31.5 C.
This was supposed to be a "quintessential" fall Less than two weeks ago, a fall forecast by the Weather Network had no portent of the awesome heat wave to come. Predicting a "quintessentially Canadian fall" and "better-than-average leaf-viewing weather," the network said temperatures in both Quebec and Ontario would be "near normal."
It was too hot to run the Montreal Marathon Alarmed by the prospect of runners dropping dead from heat stroke, the full Montreal Marathon was cancelled on Sunday. Dedicated runners tried to get their marathon fix by signing up for a marathon in Rimouski, a city five hours to the northeast. Meanwhile, a half marathon and a 10K race in Montreal left nearly 900 requiring medical attention. Normally, only 500 end up at first aid tents, even when the full marathon is on.
It snowed in Alberta The vast majority of Canadians live in the ridiculously hot parts, but it's still business as usual in Western Canada. Edmonton logged its first autumn snowfall on Sept. 19 - a mere 10 days after the city's hottest day of the year. Heavy snowfall also hit Banff, only five days after Banff National Park had seen its summertime campfire bans rescinded.
It's still cold in the Arctic No matter how hot it gets in Canada, it's comforting to know that it's always cold somewhere. On Tuesday afternoon, the brave men and women stationed at CFS Alert were enduring temperatures of a respectable -20 C.

What If September Heat Waves Become New Climate Normal?

Full text: Many Montreal parents have been in a panic this week about the conditions in their children's classrooms as the city sweats through a week of sweltering temperatures.
Indeed the heat wave - highs hit 31 C Tuesday, but it felt more like 40 C with the humidex - is extraordinary for late September. We just shattered the record set in the late '60s. And severe heat warnings usually reserved for mid-July are in effect.
But the temperatures themselves aren't really that unusual for, say, late June.
So while there is much concern about whether our children will wilt at their desks a few weeks after going back to school, it's not actually that different from what they normally experience when school is about to let out. (Although not this year, as June was rainy, cool and damp, while July and August were only marginally better.)
Still, there has been tremendous hand-wringing about what precautions schools are taking to help kids beat the heat and keep them hydrated. And there is much consternation in some households about why most schools are not equipped with air conditioning. Some parents in Montreal, as elsewhere in Quebec and Ontario where it's sizzling, have been pulling their kids out of class or keeping them home because of the heat.
Of course, nobody wants their kids to melt or suffer heatstroke. But I don't ever recall this level of frenzy over the dangers of blazing hot classrooms in late springs past - or this level of sympathy for students who attend summer school, for that matter.
Reasonable precautions are certainly being taken: parents being asked to send extra drinks for their children; schools stocking up on bottled water; staff encouraging students to use water fountains to slake their thirst; fans being turned up full blast to circulate the stuffy air; and teachers taking their classes outside for lessons - in the shade, of course. Students are also being encouraged not to overexert themselves at recess and to take breathers during gym class or sports practice.
It can't be that easy for the teachers to handle the torrid temperatures, either. But principals, coaches, staff and after-school program supervisors seem to be doing their best to keep cool and carry on.
Maybe we're so used to dealing with the wind chill that a heat wave in September seems like uncharted territory. It takes a blizzard on the scale of the howler that whipped Montreal March 15 to result in school closures, so accustomed are we to dealing with ice and cold.
Most Montreal schools aren't equipped with air conditioning because we've never typically needed it. Classes usually let up about the time the scorching days of summer arrive. Schools in hot climates like Florida or California might be equipped with AC, but Montreal schools have only ever required heaters.
But if scorchers in September become the new norm under the shifting weather patterns we are experiencing because of climate change, new measures might be called for. If, say, we get to the point where it starts hitting 30 degrees in mid-May and lasting through June, then perhaps Montreal schools will eventually have to be outfitted with air conditioning. Many of our schools, particularly in the core, are old, crumbling and in need of repairs, anyway. We may need to start installing cooling systems as a matter of course when major renovations take place if we are going to make our schools bearable year round in the age of global warming.
The tricky part is that climate change is playing havoc with weather systems, causing more severe storms and making it more difficult to forecast accurately. It's a crapshoot. But if we do start to see summer weather shift more predictably to September, maybe the school calendar will have to be adjusted in turn so that we can take advantage of the most favourable holiday conditions.
Because, to me, the worst part is that our kids are baking in their classrooms when they could be outside swimming, playing and enjoying themselves. I sure wish I were on vacation now rather than back in August when the rain put a damper on many of my plans.
The good news is, the heat wave is supposed to break by Thursday, when temperatures should drop back to seasonal. So we'll just have to chill out for one more day. By Friday, I predict we'll all be getting out our sweaters when the sun goes down and lamenting the end of our belated summer. And by Thanksgiving, we may well be complaining about the arrival of cold and flu season. ahanes@postmedia.com

Full text: This Sunday's Montreal marathon has been cancelled by organizers because of the heat.
The forecast for the day calls for a high of 30 C, with a humidex factor of 39 C.
The Rock 'n'Roll Oasis Montreal marathon was to start at 8:30 a.m. from the Jacques Cartier Bridge.
On their website, organizers said that "in consultation with medical services officials and our city partners, event organizers have determined that the unseasonably warm weather conditions are not suitable to provide a safe race experience for the 42.2-km distance. The full marathon will therefore not take place."
The half-marathon or 21.1 km will go on, but will start at 7:30 a.m. instead of 8:30, and runners will have three hours to complete the event rather than the six originally planned.
The 10K event will begin as scheduled at 8:45 a.m.
Anyone who is registered for the marathon can choose to participate in the half-marathon, organizers said.
They can also defer their entry fee "to any open Rock 'n'Roll Marathon Series, including Montreal 2018, or receive a full refund."
Half-marathoners can opt to not race, and either defer their fee or receive a refund.
To help runners combat the heat, organizers say they will have cooling buses along the course, as well as iced towels and water and ice at the finish line.

Full text: Enjoy it while it lasts.
Montreal's summer is ending with a bang - the high temperature has surpassed 25 degrees Celsius every day over the past week, while nighttime lows have hovered around 15 C.
Those temperatures are about 10 C warmer than normal in September - and the warmer-thanusual weather is expected to last until the end of the month, Environment Canada says.
"Usually in September we will have three or four days of very warm temperatures and very sunny days, but this year it's over a prolonged period - that's what makes it more exceptional," meteorologist Amelie Bertrand told the Montreal Gazette Tuesday.
September has also been dry, with lower than normal rainfall so far, she added.
The last rain fell on Sept. 7. No new temperature records have been set in September, however. "Records in September would be 30 or 31 degrees during the day," she said.
The nice weather should stay beyond the official start of fall on Sept. 22, but expect a turn toward cooler, wetter weather in about 10 days. "We might get our first deep frost in southern Quebec starting in early October so we'll see a change in the pattern," Bertrand said.
"In October, temperatures should be slightly below the average and the same for November." Expect more precipitation, as well.
Montreal's summer began in June with weather that was cooler and wetter than normal, Bertrand said.
"It rebalanced in July and August when we had more normal temperatures and a little bit less rain," she said. "But Montreal did have not any significant heat waves. It was not a very hot and humid summer."
Since summer started June 21, the temperature did not surpass 30 C.

As Wave Of Asylum Seekers Swells, Quebec's Resources Wear Thin: Claims have tripled in recent weeks, spurred by fears of Trump's next immigration crackdown

Full text: The asylum seekers arrive about a dozen by the hour at the end of a quiet country road in upstate New York, hopping out of taxis, extended passenger vans and private vehicles.
They appear to range in age from seven months to 70 years, but they count more very young people than old.
Many drag along heavy suitcases and are well dressed - right down to some parkas and tuques in the 30-degree heat, anticipating a life ahead. Twenty-eight of the 57 people who arrive between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Thursday come from Burundi, Syria and the Palestinian territories and said they used the United States as a mere transit point to Canada. The other 29 are originally from Haiti and, in several cases, have been in the United States so long the younger ones speak only English with an American accent.
The migrants have diverse backgrounds but are united in one way: They have found their way from Boston, New York and Florida to this rural area on the Quebec border, fearing the latest or next immigration crackdown of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The number of asylum claims in Quebec tripled in recent weeks from an average of 50 a day to 150, according to the province's Immigration Minister Kathleen Weil. She said about 70 per cent of the recent arrivals are Haitian nationals.
The recent spike in claims has clogged short-term housing for new arrivals in Montreal, leading the province to open up to 600 beds in the Olympic Stadium, the cavernous, provincially owned, underutilized sports facility in the city's east end.
Some 6,500 people have sought asylum in Quebec in the first six months of the year, a nine-year high, but Ms. Weil noted the six-month trend is still well short of the record level in 2008, when a recession and shifting immigration rules in the United States pushed 12,000 people to seek refuge through the province's borders in the same time frame.
Ms. Weil asked the federal government to beef up processing to reduce pressure on local resources and to quickly allow migrants heading for other parts of Canada to move on.
Marc Miller, a Liberal MP in Montreal, said the government is sending additional resources to Quebec and will expedite settlement.
The federal opposition parties blasted the Liberal government for lack of preparedness. The Conservatives issued a statement saying the surge is an "unsustainable trend" that will add to a backlog in the overtaxed immigration and refugee system.
The NDP repeated a demand that the government suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States, which requires asylum seekers to make their claim in whichever of the two countries they first arrive in.
The agreement means refugee claimants are usually turned away at regular crossings, pushing many to hop the border instead.
The NDP also demanded better housing. "When people are warehoused in a stadium like that, it's not exactly a reflection of the Prime Minister's message that Canada welcomes you," NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan said.
In the winter, with the first wave of migrants seeking refuge in Canada since the inauguration of Mr. Trump, they arrived in a trickle. In Manitoba, they would trek across frozen fields, occasionally suffering frostbite, and they added up to 170 in a month at the peak. (The traffic in Manitoba has since dropped off to 60 cases a month.)
In Quebec, an average of about 560 have come in monthly since January. Many make a short hike across a ditch to Roxham Road on the Quebec side of the border, near Hemmingford, about 60 kilometres south of Montreal.
Initially, the small groups arrived sporadically to an informal checkpoint that usually consisted of one or two RCMP officers waiting in their vehicle. An observer could spend much of a day at the crossing and see only a handful of asylum seekers, or none at all.
Now, there's no missing them.
The first family on Thursday arrived shortly after 9 a.m. in a taxi minivan. A family of seven people of Haitian origin, the mother and father spoke French and Creole, while the younger of their five children spoke English.
"You've lost your language!" said an RCMP officer who greeted one of the teenagers.
In a hurry to get across the border, the adults in the family offered just a few details. They had been living in the New York area but saw no future in the United States.
"We were facing a lot of problems in the United States. You are well aware of what they are," said the father, who did not want to give his name.
The family made their way over the border along a small gravel path that has been built in recent months to prevent the ditch scramble that took place in the winter. Instead of sitting in their vehicles, the RCMP officers now have tents with tables, waiting areas and generators for electricity. Barricades have gone up to keep the public and media away.
A few hours after the first family crossed, Odelaire Baptiste, also of Haitian origin, arrived with his wife and young daughter. "It's just getting nasty in the United States," he said. "I want what's best for my family and there's nothing left for us there."
Some 58,000 families of Haitian origin have been living in the United States under a temporary special status granted by the Obama administration following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The order, similar to one put in place in Canada, was a humanitarian measure to prevent deportations even if Haitians had arrived in the United States without legal status.
Faced with a surge of thousands of Haitian migrants last summer, the Obama administration started a crackdown authorizing immigration officials to immediately deport undocumented new arrivals.
In May, Mr. Trump's administration announced the earthquake amnesty would end in January, 2018, when deportations would resume. (Canada's special exemption ended last year.)
Marjorie Villefranche, director of the Maison d'Haïti support centre in Montreal, said there appears to be a "wind of panic" sowed by the Trump administration's recent announcement. She said Creole social media has been very active with instructions for making the crossing.
"There's no end to the badmouthing of immigrants in the United States, it's become untenable," said Voltaire Timoche, a young man who had travelled from Boston with a dozen other Haitians. "I had to do something."
Amid the recent surge of Haitian arrivals, people from other countries continue to stream in along Roxham Road. A group of 13 Burundians from three families left a van and a small car nearly a kilometre from the border and walked with their luggage along pastures where horses grazed. While others were hesitant and shed a tear at the border, the Burundians dashed across with little hesitation before the RCMP officers were even ready to greet them.
Raed Alakhras, his wife and four very young children, hopped out of a taxi and put one of their smaller children in a stroller and strapped a baby carrier onto Mr. Alakhras's chest for the youngest.
The Syrian family travelled from Saudi Arabia to the United States last week, but their final destination was always Canada. Mr. Alakhras, an accountant, was working in Saudi Arabia on a contract that expired. He wasn't going to be allowed to stay and he was not going back to Syria, he said.
"Because of the war in Syria, we needed to escape. It was really tough. It was very tough. My contract was finished and we had to leave. This was the only way," he said.

Quebec strawberries not as sweet as usual; Rainy spring is to blame, but with heat and sun, taste could improve, growers say

Full text: Your strawberries are not as sweet as usual? Blame the rain.
Quebec strawberries - known for their sugary, even cotton-candy like sweetness - are missing their signature taste so far this season. Producers say the rainier-thannormal weather since the growing season began is to blame.
"They look good, but they're not as sweet as usual," said Charles Gingras, one of the owners of Chez Louis, a store at the Jean-Talon Market. "That's all the water (rainfall) that's doing that. It might get better because we're expecting some heat and sun. Strawberry season lasts until October, so it can change."
Gingras said the best strawberries so far this season come from Ile d'Orleans, an island just outside Quebec City.
"They also last longer; you can keep those strawberries for four or five days without a problem," he said. "The strawberries from around Montreal go soft in a couple of days, but it's almost always like that."
He said while some of the berries may not taste as good as usual, they are selling for a good price.
"If there is a shortage of production, the price could double or even triple in price," he said. "That's not the case right now."
On the other side of the market, Thomas Ramon, an employee of Ferme Rene Lussier, based in St-Damase, near St-Hyacinthe, said it's still possible to find excellenttasting strawberries, but you have to search. He recommends people taste the berries before buying them. The farm where Ramon works doesn't grow strawberries, but buys them from local producers at a centralized market of growers to resell in Jean-Talon Market.
"The strawberries are still sweet, but it depends where you get them from," Ramon said. "We usually get them from a farm in St-Nicolas, but this week, we chose strawberries from the Laval region (because they tasted better)."
Other crops have also been affected by the weather.
Daniel Brais, the owner of Ferme des Moissons, based in St-Urbain Premier, about 40 kilometres southwest of Montreal, said the cold weather has been giving him trouble, too.
"If we can have some nice heat waves, that will help a lot; we need some warm nights," Brais said. "Vegetables grow 24 hours per day, so if it gets cold at night, their growth will slow down quite a bit."
And too much rain can spread disease to crops, he added.
Among the crops that were most affected by the rain or cold weather were fresh herbs like basil, garlic, beets and beans, he said.
Patrice Juneau, a spokesperson for the Union des producteurs agricoles, which represents farmers across the province, said growers have not told him they're concerned about the weather so far this summer. He said grains and cereals were planted about three weeks later than usual because the fields were too wet, but it's possible to make up some of that delay by the end of the season.
"It's not an alarming situation," Juneau said. "We did see some delays with grains, like corn and soya, but a summer is long, so it's still too soon to say if we will have a good season or not."
Juneau said there has been a bit of a delay in getting strawberries to market, but production appears to be at its normal level for this time of the season.
Gingras said having a season delayed by a few weeks is not a big deal at this point, as long as the weather heats up for the rest of the summer. He said experienced growers are used to dealing with variations in weather.
"Last year was the total opposite," he said. "Summer came so early that everything came up very fast." jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist

Full text: As the early spring storm raged outside, the mayor of Toronto burst into the room where 90 community leaders and local government officials had convened.
The deluge had caused major flooding throughout the city. They needed a game plan.
You didn't miss the news - there was no recent flood. This was Resilientville Canada, a role-playing exercise hosted earlier this month at Toronto's Annex Centre for Social Innovation.
The "mayor of Toronto" was really a member of Faith & the Common Good, a community service non-profit. The organization has been hosting simulations all over Ontario, helping cities become more resilient to natural disasters.
Resilience is the ability to rebound from hardships and setbacks, often associated with workers, athletes or young children.
But resilience applies as much to cities as it does to individuals. Weather-related disasters have increased by 14 per cent globally over the past 20 years. Municipalities must be prepared to face and overcome threats like flooding, or the 2016 Alberta wildfires.
Four Canadian cities - Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver - have joined an innovative global project designed to strengthen the world's metropolises.
Launched by the Rockefeller Foundation, 100 Resilient Cities helps urban centres work with other governments and community groups and learn from cities around the world to identify potential threats and prepare for them. Participating cities receive funding to create a high-level chief resiliency officer role in their governments. They also have access to an estimated US$400 million in services - consulting, research, and engineering assistance - donated by companies around the world.
We spoke to officials in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal about the biggest threats they foresee. Toronto cites extreme weather, such as heat waves and ice storms. Vancouver leaders fret about rising sea levels, as well the ever-present fear of a major earthquake. Montreal is concerned with crumbling infrastructure.
In particular, Canada's biggest cities are thinking about how these challenges might affect their most vulnerable citizens.
Toronto, for example, is considering "cool rooms" for high rises without central air in low-income areas, preparing for heat waves. In Vancouver, residents in the vulnerable Downtown Eastside often can't afford Internet access. So the city is seeking alternate ways to share life-saving information off-line in those districts in the event of an emergency.
The 100 Resilient Cities initiative also encourages resiliency beyond prepping for disasters. For instance, how well a city addresses other non-emergency issues, like homelessness, impacts how well it can withstand - and recover from - sudden shocks.
Canadians can help make their communities resilient. Get together with your neighbours and make a community emergency plan. If you own a business, consider how you could help - for example, a restaurant might prepare meals for residents stranded in emergency shelters.
Strengthening communities against unexpected shocks benefits everyone.

Full text:   Montreal was a city on the verge of a nervous breakdown in the weeks before the 1976 Olympics.
The Olympic Stadium tower and retractable roof wouldn't go up for years, but it looked like competition facilities would be completed on time. The Games would go on. Excitement was building.
But so many things were going wrong.
At the vast east-end Olympic Park, chaos reigned. Construction workers were sabotaging the work site and working to rule, hoping to use their leverage to squeeze higher wages out of Quebec.
Fraud, collusion and corruption allegations were flying. There were growing calls for an investigation into enormous cost overruns.
Some Montrealers complained the city was an armed camp.
Soldiers patrolled airports, X-ray machines hummed in hotel lobbies, military helicopters buzzed overhead. Officials feared terrorists would target Montreal as they had the Munich Games four years earlier, when Palestinian terrorists murdered 11 members of Israel's team.
POLITICAL TURMOIL WAS RIFE
Pierre Trudeau, prime minister at the time, was threatening to bar Taiwan from the Games, angering the United States and other countries. Dozens of African, Arab and Caribbean countries were warning of a boycott if New Zealand were allowed to compete, pointing to its rugby team's tour of apartheid South Africa.
Locally, the tension was thick between Montreal and Quebec. Then-premier Robert Bourassa, in a panic over lagging preparations, had taken control of the Games from then-mayor Jean Drapeau, who would later be officially blamed for the Olympic financial disaster.
There was, of course, an English-French war raging. The issue: the language of the air. As the world was preparing to fly to Montreal, thousands of Canadian pilots and air traffic controllers walked offthe job over Ottawa's decision to allow the use of French between pilots and control towers in Quebec.
Labour strife was rampant.
Workers of various stripes - from hospital nurses to liquor store workers to Hydro-Quebec technicians to subway-car builders - paralyzed workplaces.
Did we mention the city was suffering through a heat wave? Starting today through Aug. 1, the Montreal Gazette will run a special series looking at the 1976 Olympics - the triumphs, the scandals, the personal stories.
As Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, deals with its own monumental problems in the buildup to the 2016 Summer Games, here's a look at the tense six weeks before the Olympic Cauldron was lit in Montreal.
JUNE 1 Work on the Velodrome is completed, two years behind schedule. It was originally slated to open for the world cycling championships in June 1974.
JUNE 2 Accused of slowdowns and sabotage, plumbers working at the Big O speak out. They describe frequent shortages of tools, equipment and construction materials; thefts of equipment by individuals, work gangs and companies; constantly changing engineering plans forcing workers to tear up completed work and redo it; surprise electrical blackouts that leave crews with nothing to do for hours or entire shifts. The situation had been even worse in 1975, according to the biography Drapeau, by Brian McKenna and Susan Purcell: "Workers were being asked to work seven 12-hour days. Some took to sleeping their entire shifts in shacks on the site, others played cards endlessly for high stakes.
A bootlegger sold booze and some workers were drunk most of the time. A lottery was established. Loan sharks set up shop. Marijuana and even heroine were available on the site. An investigation turned up a time-clock fraud, whereby workers paid certain time clerks to punch them in and out illegally, while they remained at home in bed, gambled or stayed in the tavern all day."
JUNE 3 Emergency safety precautions are put in place after the National Research Council declares the 7,000-seat Velodrome roof a potential fire hazard because its plastic materials burn twice as fast as wood when ignited. Twelve firefighters will be stationed at the Velodrome during competitions.
JUNE 4 The opposition Parti Quebecois demands a formal warning be issued to foreign visitors that they attend events at the Velodrome at "their risk and peril."
JUNE 6 An eastern extension of the metro's Green Line opens, adding nine stations over eight kilometres, including two stops - Viau and Pie-IX - that bookend the Olympic Park. But a strike by Bombardier workers has delayed the arrival of new subway cars. To deal with the expected crush of riders, cars are taken from the Orange Line.
JUNE 7 About 1.5 million Olympic tickets go on sale. Available at Eaton's downtown store, they must be purchased in person - no phone or mail orders - and can be charged to Eaton accounts or paid in cash.
JUNE 8 Canadian-born media baron Lord Thomson of Fleet says Quebec has botched the Games. "If we had done the job in Ontario, we would not have had all this graft and corruption," he tells a reporter. "Ontario would have done a better job." A month earlier, the Olympic Installations Board had accused plumbers and electricians of cutting wires, plugging pipes and staging slowdowns. It had obtained an injunction that ordered the mischief to stop, but more than 100 workers had been fired for defying the order. And the OIB now says some electricians never returned to a regular work pace. "If (electricians') work rhythm does not return to normal, we may not have as much electricity as we wanted," the OIB says.
JUNE 9 Ticket buyers are waiting up to 30 minutes at the Eaton's counter. "We sold about 20,000 to 25,000 tickets the first two days, and there were several hundred people lined up before store opening hours" on the second day, an Eaton's spokesperson says. With a provincial election in the offing and the PQ playing up Olympic mayhem, Bourassa had taken over the organizing of the Games. In a provincial government ad in the Gazette, Quebec portrays itself as a saviour and takes a jab at Montreal. "Yes, we're ready and fiercely proud of what we've done and of the Quebec workers on the world's biggest single project. Proud, too, that Quebec took up the challenge, saved the Games, and gave the whole world something to remember."
JUNE 11 The Quebec government says it isn't clear yet whether it will launch a public inquiry into the Olympic price tag, which has risen to more than $1 billion. In 1970, Drapeau said the Games would cost no more than $120 million. (In the end, Quebecers would finally pay offthe Olympics' $1.5-billion debt in 2006, 30 years after the Games.)
JUNE 13 Quebec officially hands over Olympic facilities to organizers. In a speech, Bourassa does not mention the role of Montreal - or Drapeau, who is at the ceremony but pointedly declines to speak. Bob Keaton, a councillor with the opposition Montreal Citizens' Movement, says Bourassa's Liberals are "just as much responsible for the incompetence, maladministration and exorbitant costs as the city administration." The premier tells reporters a legislature committee with full powers to summon witnesses will "get the whole truth about the cost of the Games."
JUNE 15 A Gazette editorial pooh-poohs Bourassa's legislature probe, saying it would be "dominated by the governing party of one of the levels involved in the investigation." Instead, what is needed is an independent inquiry, it says.
JUNE 16 With the Munich Olympic massacre still fresh in the world's memory, security is tight at Montreal airports. RCMP and Canadian Armed Forces personnel man command posts around-the clock. Soldiers are armed with semi-automatic rifles and 9-mm pistols. "All sorts of additional armaments are available to us, but I'm not prepared to say what they are," an official tells reporters. In the run-up to the Games, reports had surfaced about alleged "Arab terrorist" plots to target Montreal. In April 1975, the Gazette reported that terrorists had "penetrated the special security screen set up by the federal immigration department for the 1976 Olympics" and were in Canada. In the end, terrorism would not rear its head in Montreal.
JUNE 18 Some 80,000 health-care workers start walking offthe job, threatening to paralyze most Montreal hospitals. They want more money and changes to training and scheduling rules. Emergency rooms and occupancy rates are reduced to bare minimum. "It has become a crisis situation," a Montreal police spokesperson tells the Gazette.
JUNE 20 Pilots and traffic controllers start walking offthe job in a dispute that would last nine days, shutting down airlines and airports. Pilots say allowing French in flight communication makes flying dangerous. A post-Olympic economic slump is predicted, with few significant construction projects in sight. "The projected $1-billion deficit of the Games has thrown a monstrous monkey-wrench into both city and provincial finances," the Gazette reports. A $2.8-billion post-Olympic transport plan - metro extensions, and road, bridge and commuter-train improvements - has been shelved. Military choppers are flying over Montreal to familiarize military officers with the city. Motorcycle cops are zipping around to estimate driving times in case of an Olympic emergency.
JUNE 22 CF-5 fighter planes and military helicopters begin policing offlimits airspace over the Olympic sites. "We recognize there are many terrorist-guerrilla organizations active today and because of worldwide television and newspaper coverage, the Games would provide a perfect setting for their exposure," an official says. Drapeau suggests Quebec explore methods of "voluntary taxation" to finance Montreal's $200-million share of the Games deficit. He proposes an extension to the Olympic lottery and a new tax on tobacco.
JUNE 24 Striking nurses are urged to defy a court injunction ordering them back to work. American pilots are refusing to fly into Canada, saying tension over bilingual flight communications have made Canadian skies unsafe. Queen Elizabeth's itinerary is announced. She will arrive at St-Hubert airport July 16, and be met by Bourassa and Drapeau. The next day, before she opens the Games, she will visit Montreal city hall to sign the Golden Book and have lunch at an event hosted by Drapeau. She will attend competitions over several days before departing July 26.
JUNE 25 Some of the 1,000 official hostesses and guides are grumbling about training. Hostesses have been instructed to not chew gum, smoke, drink or get "personally involved" with the public while in uniform. "You wouldn't want to be known as 'les femmes faciles' - easy women - around the world," one hostess says her group was told. "They spend so much time telling us to take baths, keep our hair combed, brush our teeth, and wear deodorant, there is no time for us to find out what we are supposed to do," she says. She's concerned that when they start working, "we don't know how to direct the delegations to one of the stadiums."
JUNE 28 "Confusion reigned backstage at the dress rehearsal for the Olympic Games this weekend as organizers grappled with communication problems, ticket foul-ups, technical adjustments and security problems," the Gazette reports. About 49,000 tickets were sold for the 35,000 available seats. During a downpour, the Velodrome roof leaks. Some spectators at dress rehearsals gripe about outrageous food prices - 75-cent hotdogs, $1 beer, $2 boxed lunches.
JUNE 29 English-speaking pilots and traffic controllers call offtheir strike after Ottawa backs down. Angry francophone air traffic controllers call a 48-hour "unlimited, selective work-to-rule campaign." Quebec politicians suggest the racism and bigotry stirred up could lead Quebec to separate. (In 1979, French was finally allowed in the air, after a royal commission concluded bilingual control could be safely implemented.) Fraud and conspiracy charges are laid against developers of the Olympic Village. The OIB had seized control of the complex in April, citing escalating costs. The original estimate: $30 million. The new estimate: $90 million. Some English-speaking athletes complain about the Olympic Village. "Even though Village authorities have gone to great lengths to hire help for those who speak even obscure dialects, cafeteria staffrefused to or could not speak English during the weekend," the Gazette reports. Quebec says all commercial establishments, except grocery stores, can remain open beyond legal closing hours to accommodate an expected influx of hundreds of thousands of tourists.
JULY 1 The International Olympic Committee threatens to withdraw its sponsorship of the Montreal Games, saying Ottawa is overstepping its authority. The issue: Taiwan. Though Taiwan is self-ruled, the People's Republic of China considers the island part of its territory. Under pressure from China, Ottawa is threatening to ban Taiwan unless it stops referring to itself as the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name), using the flag of China, and playing the victory anthem of China. Taiwan won't back down. The IOC says only it can decide who can compete. "We are in a position, one step removed, from cancelling the Olympic Games," an IOC representative tells a reporter. "We would remove the name 'Olympic' from the Games and cancel all ceremonies and medal presentations. They would just become a Montreal sporting event." Canada's seven largest banks and a group of U.S. banking giants agree to a $700-million loan to cover a major portion of the Olympic debt.
JULY 2 Three thousand opening ceremony and 6,000 closing ceremony tickets are still available. Most are standing-room. Some Montrealers are renting their homes to out-oftowners attending the Games, for anywhere from $300 to $3,000 a week. Many are bypassing the official Olympic lodging bureau, created to inspect accommodations and set prices. Thirty families made homeless during the Games due to demolition or steep rent hikes have moved into temporary lodgings in a former school on Fullum St. An opposition MCM city councillor complains "the city can spend $1.5 billion for grandiose projects" but does "nothing for the real needs of the people."
JULY 5 Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, which was to treat any sick and injured Olympic athletes, can't meet its agreement due to a staffshortage caused by ongoing strikes by nurses and X-ray technicians. "We look mighty stupid, but we can't even serve our own population," a spokesperson says. The Montreal General Hospital steps in. Quebec liquor-store workers begin an unlimited strike, saying they'll shut stores at least until after the Games. About 10,000 Hydro-Quebec workers are holding rotating strikes. Hundreds of downtown business, restaurants and hotels are hit by electrical failures.
JULY 6 Ottawa orders that Taiwanese athletes, coaches and officials be barred from entering Canada while negotiations continue over their team's official designation. Furious that New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team is touring apartheid South Africa, African nations want the IOC to ban New Zealand from
the Games. The IOC refuses, saying it has no power over rugby because it is not an Olympic sport.
JULY 7 Roger Taillibert, the controversial French architect who designed the Velodrome, dismisses suggestions the facility is a fire hazard. He says in an emergency the building could be cleared in less than three minutes. Taillibert, who also designed the grandiose and grossly overbudget Olympic Stadium, notes the Velodrome is made largely of concrete - "the most beautiful modelling clay of this century" - which proved more resilient to fire than steel during the Second World War. Montreal is experiencing a heat wave, with highs hovering around 30 degrees Celsius. Equipped with 16 large air conditioners, the Olympic Village disco is proving popular with athletes. "The great thing about the place is nobody needs an interpreter - the music is loud, the psychedelic light patterns gyrate on white screens above the dance floor, making conversation tough," the Gazette reports.
JULY 9 Tanzania is the first country to withdraw over New Zealand's rugby tour of South Africa. Forty-seven African, Arab and Caribbean countries are threatening to join the boycott. (In the end, more than 30 countries would pull out of the Games.)
JULY 11 On the Taiwan issue, the IOC gives in to Canada and recommends barring Taiwan after the Taiwanese team refuses to compromise. Just arrived in Montreal, Taiwanese track and field athlete Chi Cheng, an Olympic medallist in 1968, is stunned. Choking back tears in her room at the Olympic Village, she says: "I'm hurt. Really hurt."
JULY 12 About 1,800 people, including then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, gather at a Westmount synagogue for a memorial service for 11 Israeli athletes slain by terrorists during the 1972 Munich Games. Widows and relatives of three of the murdered athletes are there. With Quebec liquor stores closed by a strike, Ottawa and Quebec relax rules so Olympic delegations can bring with them enough wine, beer and spirits to get them through the Games. French and Italian delegations have packed wine, while the Germans are arriving with their own beer.
JULY 13 A labour dispute is boiling over between Teleglobe Canada and 350 technicians who are threatening to pull the plug on overseas radio and TV coverage of the Games.
JULY 14 Behind the scenes, the IOC and the U.S. are still trying to find a Taiwan compromise. Gerald Ford, U.S. president at the time, has criticized Canada over the affair. Ronald Reagan, seeking the Republican nomination, is among those calling for the U.S. to withdraw from the Games. The U.S. says it is "very much a possibility" that its team will withdraw, perhaps persuading other countries to follow suit. (In the end, Taiwan packed up and went home rather than follow an IOC order to change its official designation to Taiwan. And the U.S. did not withdraw.) Hundreds of tourists are lining up at Eaton's to buy Olympic tickets. Car-rental agencies and stores that rent TVs report a booming business, but some hotels, restaurants and shopkeepers say they're still waiting for the expected boom. The 10-day liquor-board strike continues, but restaurants and bars can still buy liquor from liquor-board warehouses. A strike continues to cripple 37 Frenchlanguage hospitals.
JULY 15 A laser-ignited Olympic flame starts its journey to Montreal. In Greece, the flame is placed in a sensor activating an electronic signal that bounces offa satellite, then triggers a laser beam recreating the flame on Parliament Hill, where then-Prime Minister Trudeau receives the first torch. Twelve torch bearers will carry the flame to Montreal. Teleglobe technicians ratify a new contract, ending the threat to overseas radio and TV coverage. A group of 25 welfare recipients arrive at the main gate of the Olympic Village to collect the large quantities of food reportedly being thrown out by kitchen staff. The director of food services turns them away, denying good food was being dumped. The opposition MCM announces it will boycott Olympic events. It says the vast amount spent on the Olympics should have gone to pay for low-income housing, water purification, metro extensions and better facilities for children and the aged.
Gazette columnist Tim Burke captured Montrealers' mixed feelings in the hours before the July 17 opening ceremony: "For six rancorous years, this benighted undertaking has been staggering uphill on clay feet, obstructed by mishap and sabotage, undermined by corruption, incompetence and political strife and all but blown away by inflation," he wrote.
"Somehow, though, it's all coming offon schedule, and this afternoon when the Olympic Flame is borne into the stadium and the Queen proclaims the opening of the Games, let Montreal be transported into a two-week state of nirvana.
"Let's enjoy the Games to the hilt, because there's the strongest possibility that this will be Montreal's last hurrah. No matter how successful the Games may be, can we ever erase the terrible tab we owe the piper? Or the feeling that we've run out of excuses to give the world?" For better or worse, the Montreal Olympics were actually about to begin.

Full text:   Montreal is excluded from an open-fire ban that encompasses most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River as of 8 p.m. Friday. Other exceptions are Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. The ban, which was recommended by SOPFEU, an organization that helps protect against forest fires, also excludes Ile Jesus (Laval), Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks Laurent Lessard decided to ban fires because of the heat wave we have just entered. Environment Canada forecasts sunny skies in Montreal with temperatures ranging from 27 degrees Celsius to 31 C from Friday till Monday. Fire danger over forested areas of Quebec range from high to extreme. There are two active forest fires in Quebec right now: Abitibi-Temiscamingue, and 20 kilometres northeast of St-Jerome in the Laurentians. Since the season began, there have been 224 fires over 156 hectares.

Full text: A growing number of countries at the Paris climate talks are calling for an ambitious target of capping surface temperature rise to 1.5 C. Tu Thanh Ha reports on the effects different surface temperatures might have on the Earth and Affan Chowdhry outlines what it will take to mitigate the long-term effects of climate change?
Current emission-cut pledges established in the prelude to the Paris climate talks aim at limiting surface temperature warming to 2 degrees Celsius over the preindustrial era by the end of the 21st century. In the final leg of the Paris conference, a growing number of countries, including Canada, are calling for an even more ambitious target: capping temperature rise to 1.5 C.
But even capping warming at 1.5 degrees will not stop the environmental consequences of climate change. Here's a look at what effects different surface temperatures might have on the Earth and what it'll take to mitigate the long-term effects of climate change:
+1.5-degrees Celsius
Sea levels could rise to submerge land currently home to 27.4 million people in China, 3.6 million people in Bangladesh and 13.4 million people in Vietnam, according to projections by three scientists working for Climate Central, a non-profit organization that reports on climate science. In the United States, the homes of 7 million people would be under sea level. In Canada, 540,000 people would be affected.
Median local sea level could rise by 2.9 metres in the Vancouver area, above what is now the homes of 295,000 residents. In the Montreal area, the water level would go up by 2.7 metres, affecting 5,000 people.
The impact would be even worse in large Asian cities: the homes of 4.2 million people in Shanghai, 4.9 million in Hong Kong and 1.2 million people in Hanoi would be under water level.
Climate change is causing species in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere to move northward or higher in elevation. At 1.5 °C, most trees and herbs would be at moderate risk from falling behind the shifting climate zones, says Hans-Otto Portner, professor in Integrative Ecophysiology at the Alfred-Wegener Institute in Germany.
In the Middle East and North Africa, heat waves for two weeks to 80 days, according to the World Bank.
Between 6-15 per-cent increase in diarrheal disease in the Middle East and North Africa. Increase in the incidence of morbidity associated with food and water-borne diseases in Beirut of 16 to 28 per cent. In South America, 5 to 13 per-cent increase in relative risk of diarrheal diseases. In Mexico, 12 to 22 per-cent increase in dengue-fever incidence.
+2-degrees Celsius
Sea levels could rise to submerge land currently home to 64 million people in China, 12.5 million people in Bangladesh and 25.8 million people in Vietnam, according to projections by three scientists working for Climate Central. In the United States, the homes of 12 million people would be under sea level. In Canada, 737,000 people would be affected.
Median local sea level could rise by 4.7 metres in the Vancouver area, above what is now the homes of 340,000 residents. In the Montreal area, the water level would go up by 4.4 metres, affecting 10,000 people.
The homes of 11.5 million people in Shanghai, 6.8 million in Hong Kong and 3.5 million in Hanoi would be under water level.
Climate-change velocity would become too high for some species to move sufficiently fast and follow their preferred temperatures.
Crop production would be at high risk with some potential for adaptation, Prof. Portner told the UN climate-change conference in Lima, last December.
Heat waves in the Middle East and North Africa for three weeks to three months.
In Mexico, more than 30-per-cent increase in dengue-fever incidence in Mexico.
+4-degrees Celsius
Sea levels could rise to submerge land currently home to 144.7 million people in China, 48 million people in Bangladesh and 46.1 million people in Vietnam, according to projections by three scientists working for Climate Central. In the United States, the homes of 24.8 million people would be under sea level. In Canada, one million people would be affected.
Median local sea level could rise by 8.4 metres in the Vancouver area, above what is now the homes of 396,000 residents. In the Montreal area, the water level would go up by 7.4 metres, affecting 54,000 people.
The homes of 22.4 million people in Shanghai, 10 million in Hong Kong and 7.6 million in Hanoi would be under water level.
Climate-change velocity would be much too high for terrestrial and freshwater species to move and relocate.
Crop production would be at high risk. Biodiversity would be lost and the catch potential of fisheries would be highly reduced, Prof. Portner says.
Heat waves in the Middle East and North Africa for two months to 200 days.
Increase in the incidence of morbidity associated with food and water-borne diseases in Beirut of 35 to 42 per cent. In North Africa and the Middle East, 39 to 62 million more people exposed to risk of malaria. Howver, there will be a decreased malaria length of transmission season for tropical Latin America.
Mitigating the effects of climate change and meeting targets will require large and sustained cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a shift to renewable energy and trillions of dollars
Capping temperatures at 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of this century will be a massive global undertaking, according to experts. Even with current emission-cut pledges made by countries in the prelude to the Paris climate talks, the planet is on track to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius, according to the United Nations. Some scientists believe the figure is closer to 3.5 degrees.
Limiting a global rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius would mean dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a global shift away from fossil fuels, rapid development of renewable technologies and trillions of dollars of funding to help developing nations meet targets.
Curbing carbon emissions is key to lowering the Earth's surface temperature, but by how much will inevitably be determined by the level of emissions cuts. The worst-case scenario sees fossil fuel emissions continuing with no change; the best-case calls for a drastic and immediate drop.

Global emissions
Michiel Schaeffer, a physicist and climate scientist at the Berlin-based Climate Analytics policy institute, said to meet the 2-degree goal, global greenhouse-gas emissions would need to be cut to zero some time between 2080 and 2090.
In the 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario, that would need to happen earlier - some time between 2060 and 2080, explained Dr. Schaeffer.
By the middle of this century, countries would have to make significant progress in emissions cuts - between 40 and 70 per cent to reach 2 degrees and 70 to 95 per cent to reach 1.5 degrees, according to Dr. Schaeffer.
For Canada, hitting a target of 1.5 C will mean cutting emissions by a third over the next decade and achieving zero greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 30 to 35 years, according to Ian Bruce, director of science and policy at the David Suzuki Foundation.
On a global level, keeping the planet's temperature rise to less than 1.5 C by the end of this century would mean a massive weaning off coal and other fossil fuels that are putting heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
That will be a challenge in some rapidly developing countries such as India, the world's third largest emitter, which has plans to build more than 440 coal power plants over the next 15 years.
Dr. Schaeffer said that all existing plans to build coal plants around the world would have to be stopped - and other plants allowed to retire or converted to gas or cleaner energies when their lifespan of 50 years expires.
Renewable energy and carbon capture
Keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5 C by the end of this century will require a significant ramping up of renewable-energy technology, such as solar, wind and bioenergy technologies, as countries shift away from fossil fuels.
In Canada, achieving a zero-emissions economy will mean industry using renewable sources of energy and capturing carbon. It will also mean buildings and cars will need to become more efficient.
The David Suzuki Foundation is proposing a 100-per-cent renewable-energy goal by 2050. As an interim goal for 2030, it says Canada should consider the 50/50/50 plan, being considered by the State of California.
In that scenario, 50 per cent of a country's electricity would come from renewable sources, buildings would use 50 per cent less energy and the fuel used by cars and trucks would be cut 50 per cent.
Mr. Bruce, the foundation's director of science and policy, points to examples of progress in Canada such as the phasing out of coal from Ontario's electricity industry and British Columbia's carbon-tax plan.
"The real lesson there is that the federal government has a vital role and we can do so much more with a unified strategy on climate change," he added.
The focus right now is on the global electricity industry - the cheapest way to reduce emissions and curb global warming, explained Dr. Schaeffer.
Reducing emissions in the building and transportation sectors is much more expensive and harder to achieve - and those are the sectors countries will need to look at if they want to go from a 2 C goal to under 1.5 C, he said.
Adaptation fund
Ambitious global goals on capping temperatures would require developing countries to "leap frog" fossil fuels and it would mean developed economies providing financial assistance, explained Mr. Bruce of the David Suzuki Foundation. This would need to happen at a time when many of those developing nations are growing quickly and hoping to stay on that rapid economic growth path.
But most of these countries do not have the money or technological know-how to make a rapid transition to a clean-energy economy.
"For a 1.5° C or even 2° C degree pathway, there is consensus that the annual investments required in the energy sector alone [would] have to grow significantly up to about $1-trillion per year by 2020 and up to about $2-trillion per year by 2030/2035," stated a report called Fair Shares, endorsed by a global coalition of NGOs and civil-society groups. Most of these funds would be needed in developing countries.
Existing global climate -hange financing initiatives to help developing economies currently sits at about $15-billion, according to the report.

Full text:   For a northern city that has been around for nearly 375 years, there should be no surprises when it comes to Montreal's extreme weather patterns.
Winter temperatures range from nippy to risk-of-frostbite, and our far too brief summers go from bring-a-sweater-just-in-case to scorching hot.
With temperatures expected to spike at or above 30 C over the next few days, Environment Canada has issued a heat warning for the Montreal area. With the humidex factored in, it will feel like 40 C on Tuesday and Wednesday. The heat wave is expected to last until Thursday.
The temperature reached 30 C on Monday, well shy of the record for this day - a steamy 34 C in 1987.
HEALTH RISKS DURING HEAT WAVES
Some love the heat, but extreme temperatures can pose a health risk, especially to the most vulnerable members of society.
Those at greatest risk during a heat wave include seniors, infants and people with chronic illnesses such as breathing difficulties and heart conditions.
People who work outdoors should take more breaks and stay hydrated. Ditto for those who exercise/jog/cycle.
Environment Canada advises anyone spending a good deal of time outdoors should "drink plenty of liquids, especially water, before you feel thirsty to decrease your risk of dehydration. Thirst is not a good indicator of dehydration." And it bears repeating: Never leave seniors, children or pets unattended in a car.
Temperatures usually peak in late afternoon, noted Environment Canada meteorologist Rene Heroux.
"The heat builds up during the day. Around 4 p.m. is the warmest time, usually."
However, the red-hot temperatures won't keep the Montreal Alouettes from practising outdoors this week.
"We practise outdoors even when it's hot, humid," said Charles Rooke, a team spokesman.
"The saying in football is 'If we are going to play in it, might as well practise in it.'
"We go indoors for heavy rain or a thunderstorm."
HOW TO BEAT THE HEAT WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING
Riding out a heat wave without the comfort of air conditioning is a recipe for irritable days and sleepless nights.
But there a few things you can do to alleviate a sweaty meltdown.
Go to air-conditioned places such as shopping malls, public libraries or your local community centre.
A heat wave is also a good time to catch a movie at your local cinema, which are often as cold as ice boxes.
Afterward, catch a small bite at an air-conditioned restaurant. Most fast-food restos have AC.
If you are stuck inside a house or an apartment without AC, take a cool bath or shower. Or use a wet towel to cool off.
If you have young children, the old backyard sprinkler works wonders. But try to avoid the sun as much as possible.
HOW SOON WE FORGET TO REMEMBER THE WINTER OF 2015
Complaining about the stifling heat? Funny how that works.
A little more than six months a go Montrealers endured the coldest February ever recorded.
The city averaged a temperature of -15 C, eclipsing the 1979 record of -14.5 C. Brrr!
You might want to view the current heat wave with an eye on the Gregorian calendar: As of Tuesday, Christmas is only 128 days away.

Drink your veggies!
That's the latest word from Montreal's hippest bartenders. Cocktails have been getting crafty for a while, featuring local and seasonal ingredients. But this summer, Montreal bartenders are taking it one step further, incorporating garden-fresh vegetables like cucumbers and jalapeno peppers and such herbs as rosemary, thyme and basil into their highballs, old-fashioneds and spritzes. At 132 Bar Vintage on Fleury St. W., for example, they make cucumber water by juicing whole unpeeled cucumbers, then add it to a drink called The Mosquito. Jonathan Elbaz, the bar chef there, makes a mean margarita, too, fuelled by jalapeno-spiked simple syrup.
Downtown, at Balsam Inn Restaurant, the bar menu looks like the sequel to a seed catalogue: a half-dozen of the inventive cocktails for which the Metcalfe St. restaurant is known feature some form of garden green or herbal extract.
Next door, sister restaurant Dominion Square Tavern may have started Montrealers' love affair with herbal cocktails five years ago when it introduced the drink that has since become a perennial favourite: deep-green Basil Rye, which features rye whisky, lemon juice, simple syrup and fresh basil leaves shaken with ice.
Adding vegetables to cocktails isn't just an attention-seeking way to be different (even if a drink made with bok choy juice sure does draw attention to itself ). It's not about the nutritional content, either (though the vitamins and minerals can't hurt). Lea Wolosianski, the manager of the Balsam Inn, who created the cocktail menu, says that in the heat of summer, the most refreshing drinks are not-too-sweet herbal ones with a mildly bitter flavour profile.
"In summer, I'm looking for drinks that are really refreshing and thirst quenching. I want the sour from citrus juice and the mild bitterness of Aperol or dry vermouth," she said.
In her own cocktail adventures, Wolosianski says she's seeing a lot of rosemary, basil and thyme in addition to ubiquitous mint. Herbs are popping up more in ingredient lists not just on gin bottles, but also in vermouths and liqueurs. Bitter herbal liqueurs like Campari have long been popular as aperitifs and digestifs in Europe, but now there's a wave of interest in them among North American craft bartenders, too. One of Wolosianski's favourites these days is Farigoule, a sweet thyme liqueur made by Distilleries Provence. It is a traditional liqueur from the south of France that uses an infusion of thyme, sugarcane syrup and alcohol (plus a little sage, angelica and lemon verbena). Wolosianski says it arrives in SAQ stores only a few times a year, so she hoards it when she can and replaces it with her own homemade thyme-infused simple syrup when it runs out.
Another of her current favourites is Cynar, a dark-brown Italian bitter liqueur made from 13 herbs and plants, including artichoke (though that taste doesn't really come through, thankfully). It's great mixed with soda and served with fresh-squeezed lemon or orange juice.
Over at 132 Bar Vintage, Jean-Maxime Giguere says gin's herbal bouquet makes it extremely popular in summertime. He especially loves gins like Hendrick's and Tanqueray Old No. 10 because they are so aromatic. But he's also fond of two small-batch gins from Northern California: Uncle Val's Botanical Gin and St. George Botanivore Gin.
"Because it is herb-y itself, gin goes very well with fresh-pressed juices and herbs," Giguere says.
Here are a few veggie-centric cocktails. Get ready ahead of time by preparing the simple syrup: Simmer equal parts sugar and water for a minute or two, until the sugar dissolves. Cool and store in the fridge until ready to use.
THE MOSQUITO
This one, featuring cucumber water, is a summer hit at 132 Bar Vintage. Use a juicer to make the cucumber water or puree a couple of unpeeled cucumbers in a food processor, then pass the puree through a fine-mesh sieve. (You might need to add a little extra water with this method to reach the desired quantity.)
1 1/2 ounces tequila
1/2 ounce Chartreuse liqueur
1/2 ounce cucumber water (see note above)
1 ounce simple syrup
1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
3 fresh basil leaves (plus another for garnish)
Cucumber slice for garnish
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake all ingredients. Strain into a long Collins glass and garnish with a fresh basil leaf and a thin slice of cucumber.
Here are four cool, refreshing cocktails on the menu this summer at Balsam Inn:
LE VERJUS
This is not like any cocktail you've ever drunk before - a perfect balance between sweet and sour. It is based on verjus, the non-alcoholic juice pressed from unripened grapes, and it lends a gentle acidity to cocktails. (You'll find it at specialty grocers.)
The liqueur Farigoule is available at SAQ stores, but not always. If you can't find it, substitute homemade thyme liqueur. Try this recipe of Wolosianski's: In a medium saucepan, combine two parts sugar and one part water. Add a small bunch of fresh thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for four to five minutes. Let cool without removing thyme, then strain into a clean bottle and store in the refrigerator. The syrup will keep for several weeks.
1 1/2ounces verjus
3/4 ounce vodka
1/4 ounce Farigoule thyme liqueur (or thyme-infused simple syrup)
Thyme sprigs for garnish
In a shaker with ice, shake together verjus, vodka and Farigoule or thyme syrup. Pour into an old-fashioned glass and garnish with a fresh thyme sprig.
APEROL SPRITZ
This is a classic Italian aperitif.
The bitterness of the brightorange Aperol and the fizz of Prosecco make for a refreshing summer drink. Add a sprig of basil for aroma, if you'd like.
1 ounce Aperol
3 ounces Prosecco
2 ounces club soda
A slice of orange, for garnish.
Pour Aperol into a wine glass and add Prosecco. Top with club soda and garnish with orange slice.
CYNAR CUP
This is a beautiful, hardly sweetened amber cocktail made with the Italian bitter called Cynar. At Balsam Inn, they use Contratto red vermouth and Canadian Club 100 per cent rye.
1 ounce rye
3/4 ounce red vermouth
1/2 ounce Cynar liqueur
Club soda
Lemon zest, for garnish
In a shaker with ice, shake all ingredients and serve in a tall glass.
WHISKY SMASH
2 ounces bourbon
10 mint leaves
3 wedges lemon
1/2 to 3/4 ounce simple syrup
In a cocktail shaker, using a muddler or the end of a wooden spoon, muddle together all ingredients. Shake with ice, strain and serve over ice in a low old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the tender tips of a fresh sprig of mint.

Full text:   We interrupt this sweltering heat wave to bring you some news to help cool off.
In five months, you'll probably be complaining it's too cold when the Canadiens and Boston Bruins square offin the 2016 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass.
As Environment Canada was issuing a heat warning Wednesday for Montreal, with the combination of temperatures and humidity levels giving humidex values near 40, the NHL was holding a Winter Classic news conference just outside Boston, where the temperature was 31C.
"It's 90-plus degrees (Fahrenheit), we're in a football stadium, Patriots are reporting to camp today, the defending Super Bowl champions ... a little bit of news around the Patriots today," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said, referring to the "Deflategate" controversy surrounding Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. "And we're here to talk hockey. It doesn't get any better than that."
In hockey, it definitely doesn't get much better than Canadiens vs. Bruins.
The New Year's Day matchup will be the 730th regular-season meeting between the two Original Six teams and the 910th including playoffs.
The Canadiens have a 355-264-103-7 regular-season record against the Bruins and have won 25 of their 34 playoffseries. But New Year's Day will mark the first time the two teams meet outdoors.
The first meeting between the Canadiens and Bruins was on Dec. 8, 1924, at Boston Arena, which is now known as Matthews Arena and home to the Northeastern University Huskies. It's North America's oldest indoor hockey rink. In a sign of things to come, the Canadiens won that first game 4-3.
"When you think about sports franchises with traditions of excellence and success, the Boston Bruins, the Montreal Canadiens and the New England Patriots would have to rank at the top of any list," Bettman said.
"When you think about rivalries that perfectly summarize the excitement and passion of NHL hockey, the enduring legacy of the Bruins and Canadiens would merit lofty status as well."
Bettman added: "Through their combined 34 Stanley Cup and Super Bowl titles, the Patriots, the Bruins and the Canadiens all have been dominant in their respective sports."
Canadiens fans will proudly point out that the Habs have won 24 of those championships, compared with six for the Bruins and four for the Patriots.
Patriots owner Robert Kraft said during the news conference that it was "an honour to be in the same category as these two franchises" and was probably happy just to talk about something besides "Deflategate." Earlier in the day, Kraft issued a statement defending Brady and ripping the league after the QB's four-game suspension for his role in using under-inflated balls in last season's AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts was upheld by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.
Kraft talked about how it was the Habs-Bruins rivalry that first got him really interested in sports.
"It is one that first (stoked) my interest in sports, even though I'm dating myself in the early '50s, and really was a big part of turning me into a passionate sports fan in this region," he said. "I'll tell you that I remember as a young boy being under the covers in my bed late at night with my transistor radio under the pillows listening to the likes of Milt Schmidt and Sugar Jim Henry against Boom Boom Geoffrion and Rocket Richard. So for me, a little kid from Fuller St. in Brookline (Mass.) listening to those games and then having these two teams come here, it's a great thrill."
He added: "The power of this rivalry was also ingrained early on in other members of the Kraft family because I was thinking back to 1980 when Jonathan Kraft, on his 16th birthday, had only one wish: He wanted to see the Bruins play the Canadiens at the old Forum. We drove from our home up to Montreal and we bought two scalped tickets, and I'm a little embarrassed to say that I paid in 1980 over $100 for each of those tickets.
"While the Bruins lost that game unfortunately, 6-1, Jonathan and I have a great memory of Stan Jonathan's huge takedown in a fight against local boy Chris Nilan of the Canadiens in the third period of the game. And that always stuck with us."
Jonathan Kraft is now president of The Kraft Group - the holding company for the family's many business interests - and heir to the family throne.
The Winter Classic will put more money into the pockets of the elder Kraft, who has a net worth of more than US$4 billion, according to Forbes, as tickets to the hockey game in his stadium will cost a lot more than $100. The NHL revealed that information in an exclusive ticket pre-sale offer for Bruins, Canadiens and Patriots seasonticket holders that will be sent out "in the coming days." Forbes reported that the average price for tickets to last January's Winter Classic between the Chicago Blackhawks and Washington Capitals at Nationals Park was listed at US$508 on TiqIQ, with the cheapest seats going for $268.
The NHL is really milking these outdoor games and you have to wonder when the novelty will wear off. But for now it remains a case of supply and demand, with the 15 previous outdoor games - including seven Winter Classics on New Year's Day - attracting 853,228 fans, an average of 56,886. A crowd of about 70,000 is expected to watch the Habs play the Bruins, and there are two other outdoor games on the 2015-16 NHL schedule.
Canadiens fans will be happy to know that the visiting team has an 11-3-1 record in outdoor games, including 5-1-1 in the Winter Classic. And according to Accuweather.com, the average Jan. 1 in Boston has a low of -4 C and a high of 3 C. Feel a little cooler now? scowan@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/StuCowan1

Abstract: While Tanguay and others agree these ground-source heat pumps are the most efficient type of heat pump, Tanguay uses a mini-split heat pump: a system that draws heat from exterior air. A central heat pump system may cost $15,000 to install, Fauteux said, depending on the size of a house and the house's heat losses.

Full text:   In light of Montreal's sustained frigid weather, the question of how to heat homes most efficiently is a pertinent one these days. By far, the best known way to minimize heating needs is to maximize the quality of a home's envelope - including its insulation and windows. Heat pumps can also increase heating efficiency and lower an overall heating bill. They also cool homes in the summer.
Heat pumps absorb heat from one area and release it to another one.
In the winter, the systems extract heat from either the air surrounding a house, even in sub-zero temperatures, or from beneath the earth's surface, and then bring that heat into a home. Residential heat pumps are electricity powered, and require a backup heating system - which can include gas, oil or electrical systems.
Heat pump performance varies depending on the type, a system's design and installation, maintenance, as well as various aspects of the residence in question - most notably, the quality of the building envelope.
Denis Tanguay works in the field of geothermal energy, and is well-versed on the benefits of geothermal heating - that is, using heat pumps to pull heat from the ground.
While Tanguay and others agree these ground-source heat pumps are the most efficient type of heat pump, Tanguay uses a mini-split heat pump: a system that draws heat from exterior air.
In his 1910 house on the Plateau, Tanguay didn't want to install the ducting required for a geothermal system. He also didn't have room for the fridge-sized compressor ground-source heating requires.
In 2013, Tanguay had a Fujitsu mini-split heat pump installed. The compressor is about the size of a large suitcase, and is mounted on an exterior wall. A small hole was made in the wall, and piping about one-inch thick runs to two interior units - one is wall-mounted on the first floor of the open-concept home, and one is mounted upstairs.
The two units blow warm air, but Tanguay said, "It's not aggressive."
"It's smooth, so you feel the heat, and you don't feel any draft," he said.
Tanguay said he likes that the mini-split system is quiet, compact and does both heating and cooling.
It significantly reduces his use of electric baseboard heating, he said. To maintain his system, Tanguay cleans the back of the compressor in the fall with a garden hose, and cleans the plastic filters in his interior units once or twice a year. The mini-split is not efficient when it's very cold, as with other air-to-air heat pumps. Tanguay said his electric baseboards kick in when the temperature is -25C.
He noted his overall hydro costs have not changed since his system was installed, however, Tanguay also now has a cooling system in the summer, which he did not have prior to installation.
Including installation, a minisplit setup may cost about $8,000. "Just in the last five to seven years (mini-splits) were invented, and they're revolutionizing the housing market," said Andre Fauteux, editor of La Maison du 21e siecle, a magazine about ecological housing.
Meanwhile, central heat pumps, which are also air-to-air systems, have existed for decades. The central heat pump unit is about the size of a small dishwasher, and sits outside a home. Warm air travels from here through ducts, throughout the home. Efficiency in extreme temperatures have improved over time with this type of pump. "New inverter types have new electronics that have increased the efficiency of heat pumps below -10 and -15. They can (now) be efficient to -25," Fauteux said.
Below that point, the backup system - usually oil or gas - will kick in. Fauteux notes Montrealers who have dual-energy like this may want to also install a Montreal-invented tri-energy system, which can save them money. The 3-Flex system from ABC Hybrid Energy, he said, prevents oil or gas from kicking in too early, which means homeowners benefit more from off-peak electricity rates, and reduce their climate impact. A central heat pump system may cost $15,000 to install, Fauteux said, depending on the size of a house and the house's heat losses. If someone doesn't already have ducts throughout their home, installing a central heat pump will cost much more, he noted.
Homeowners usually see a 25-or 30-per-cent reduction in heating costs with a central heat pump system, Fauteux said, if it's properly installed and maintained. However, central heat pumps, he said, usually break down after 15 years.
Geothermal, or ground-source, heat pumps collect heat using water in subterranean pipes. That heat is transferred to either air or water that is piped into the home. Tanguay, who is president of the Canadian GeoExchange Coalition, said these systems reduce homeowners' energy bills by an average of 40-50 per cent.
For Marc Belanger, however, assessing the life cycle cost of any system should be more important than assessing year-to-year payback.
He's the director of geothermal systems for Master Group and, in 2012, had two geothermal heat pumps systems installed in his 2,500-square-foot home in Ile-Bizard. He expects his system to last 20 to 25 years, and the infrastructure in the earth will be there as long as the house is, he said.
Belanger's home was built to Quebec's Novoclimat standard, he said. "We made sure the building envelope was as efficient as possible," said Belanger, and so the energy demands are also as low as possible.
"Comfort is probably the No. 1 criteria," he said. After having vertical drilling done on his property, water now travels within closed loop piping down these narrow wells to collect the Earth's heat. Belanger's home has two separate heat pump systems: a water-towater system provides radiant floor heating in his basement and garage; and a water-to-air system that sends warm air through ducts to his basement, ground floor and upper floor. The home also has four thermostats, so areas not being used will not have energy demands.
For maintenance, Belanger has to change filters in his water-to-air unit. Each unit is in his mechanical room. And extreme temperatures do not impact his system's efficiency, he said.
Pricing for a geothermal system can be $20,000 to $35,000, including installation.
"It's really important to get your installation done by a professional who's certified, and get your installation certified also," said Fauteux, who noted there are a lot of problematic geothermal installations. "I recommend dealing with people who have been (installing geothermal) for 15 years or more."
Fauteux also recommended Quebec's Renoclimat (renoclimat. qc.ca) program for any homeowner looking at reducing energy needs. For $150, a specialist will do a thorough energy audit and recommend the best investments to reduce a homeowner's heating costs. If you apply what they recommend, Fauteux said, a second audit is free, and the fixes made will be subsidized.

Subban can't see why Kessel takes all the heat; Star defenceman knows a thing or two about being centre of media firestorm

Abstract: Some think he still has shelf life in the Queen City after having played 421 of his 643 NHL games with the Maple Leafs. At a sports management conference a couple of days after Kessel's Sabres meltdown, Burke asked: "Why should Phil Kessel have to talk to these (media) pukes every day?" Subban admits it's hard to have a full read on the dynamics of the relationship Kessel has with Toronto's media and many Maple Leafs fans.

Full text:   If Toronto Maple Leafs mercurial forward Phil Kessel has a fan club in Montreal, you could probably hold its meetings in a bus shelter.
But know this: the president of that club might be Canadiens defenceman P.K. Subban, who can't - from where he stands at a bit of a distance - understand how Kessel has become the lightning rod for all that is rotten with the Maple Leafs.
"I don't think it's deserved, some of the stuffthat they've gone through this year," Subban began generally of the Maple Leafs after the Canadiens' 2-1 shootout victory over Toronto on Saturday.
And then he turned his attention specifically to Kessel, whose jersey crest isn't so much an 11-or-more point maple leaf as it is a bulls-eye.
Kessel might or might not still be in Toronto after the March 2 NHL trade deadline.
Some think he still has shelf life in the Queen City after having played 421 of his 643 NHL games with the Maple Leafs.
Others, well, they have thoughtfully packed his bags for him and purchased his one-way ticket.
In Montreal, Subban scratches his head at the commotion, having more than a bit of first-hand experience at being in the centre of a storm.
"Phil's a guy who cares about his team, about hockey, about the Toronto Maple Leafs," said Subban, who had battled with Kessel throughout Saturday's game and even gave his opponent a pat on the back as both lay exhausted and tangled on the ice at the end of overtime.
"I know how much he cares about Toronto because in the summertime when we have dinner, we get into beaking matches about the team. I tell him Toronto is my city (it's Subban's hometown) and he's like: 'No, no, no, no, no!' "He's passionate about it. He's a great player, he's a world-class player, he's among the top guys in the league for goals for the past, I don't know, five, six, seven years?" (Kessel is a top-10 ranking NHL scorer the past three seasons, in fact, but a 30-or-moregoal marksman in four of his five full seasons in Toronto.)
"I know he's an elite player in this league. I thought he was working hard today," Subban said of Kessel.
"He worked his bag offto try to make the difference for their team. The last battle at the end of the game, I gave him a tap because he's been working hard. I think he should be appreciated for that."
Kessel has had his moments - hours, even - with the Toronto media and even a former coach.
In early January, ex-Leafs coach Ron Wilson charged in a TSN Radio interview that Kessel cannot be coached.
"You can't rely on Phil," Wilson said. "When he's not playing well, he's a hard guy to get on board and get on your side. He shows obvious signs of brilliance, but Phil's problem - it's pretty much the way he's been through his career - he's two weeks on and two weeks off.
"It's just the way it is. He comes and goes and he gets emotional. He lets that affect his game and his relationship with other players. That's what you have to coach."
Wilson's remarks promptly touched offa fiery confrontation between Kessel and Toronto Star columnist Dave Feschuk, who asked Kessel to comment on them.
Six or so weeks earlier, Kessel had been asked to explain why the sad-sack Leafs had just been blown out by the sadder-sack Buffalo Sabres and he snapped at his questioner: "Get away from me."
While the manure was raining down on him, Kessel had support from former Leafs GM Brian Burke.
At a sports management conference a couple of days after Kessel's Sabres meltdown, Burke asked: "Why should Phil Kessel have to talk to these (media) pukes every day?" Subban admits it's hard to have a full read on the dynamics of the relationship Kessel has with Toronto's media and many
Maple Leafs fans. But he suggests the embattled player is at least a little misunderstood.
"Phil is a personable guy if he knows you," Subban said. "If you put a microphone in his face and you're asking him stupid questions, he's not going to show that side of himself.
"But I've gotten to know him really well and I don't think he gets enough credit for showing his personality. He's an outgoing guy and he's really funny. I just don't get it. I don't get the rap that he gets for his personality and the type of guy that he is. He's a great guy."
Asked whether Kessel might be shy in the spotlight, Subban replied: "He's shy because of the stuffthat (the media are) asking him. If he feels that there's a motive behind the questions that you're asking him, he's not going to respond."
Having been in the white-hot spotlight of Montreal since he arrived for good during the 2010 playoffs, Subban can speak to the waves of media that wash up at a player's stall day after day.
"I think there's a sense of (media) class here, a sense of professionalism here," Subban said of his Montreal experience. "That's not to bad-mouth the Toronto media. I've never been a player there so I can't comment.
"But some of the things I've seen happen in Toronto I haven't seen happen here and I don't think they would ever happen here."

Full text: Bloc Qu?b?cois? election defeat had left political humorists largely without punchlines
? For Quebec comedy writers, the brouhaha in the NDP this week offered a clear indication that humour is finally on the comeback in Ottawa.
The province's comedy industry has a large number of stand-up artists, impressionists and writers who regularly tackle the lighter side of politics on radio, television and stage. But these humorists saw their world fall apart in the May 2 general election when the Bloc Qu?b?cois essentially disappeared from the federal arena and the Liberals were replaced by a cast of unknowns from the NDP as the Official Opposition in Ottawa.
Suddenly, favourite targets such as Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe left the scene, with no one jumping in to replace them in the public eye. The long-standing Conservative/Bloc/Liberal confrontations - a steady producer of comic fare in recent decades - were a thing of the past, replaced by a blank slate.
"In politics, jokes can grow stale very quickly. Suddenly, all our long-standing references disappeared," said Martin Petit, an acclaimed stand-up comic who tries to infuse a steady dose of politics into his routines.
Serge Chapleau at the Montreal daily La Presse, the province's top cartoonist, is also the brains behind a Sunday night show on Radio-Canada that features a full cast of computer-animated politicians and a fictional anchorman called G?rard D. Laflaque.
Mr. Chapleau said he is looking to add new characters, such as NDP House Leader Thomas Mulcair and interim Liberal Leader Bob Rae, to adapt to the new reality. He might dispatch newly retired politicians like Mr. Duceppe to what he has dubbed the "USS Entercrisis," a spaceship on which the likes of ex-prime minister Paul Martin and ex-Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau roam the universe looking for somewhere else to run for office.
Mr. Chapleau said it will take time for his viewers to adapt to today's reality and for the show to develop the comic traits of its new characters, such as anger-management issues beneath Mr. Mulcair's silky public persona.
The award-winning cartoonist said that until recently, most NDP jokes revolved around the fact that its Quebec caucus was populated by unknowns "asking for a recount, to make sure that they had really won."
With NDP Leader Jack Layton once again fighting cancer and therefore off-limits, the fall was expected to bring little new material for comics.
"In cartooning, we have to wait for something to happen. People have to start screwing up," Mr. Chapleau said.
Humorists said this week's revelations about interim NDP Leader Nycole Turmel's recent affiliation with the separatist Bloc and Qu?bec Solidaire, as well as her own federalist party, offered much-needed comic relief.
"The fact that Nycole Turmel seemed to have been collecting membership cards, that was pretty hilarious," said St?phane Laporte, a prolific writer involved in a variety of projects, including working with renowned impressionist Andr?-Philippe Gagnon.
In his Friday cartoon, Mr. Chapleau portrayed Ms. Turmel behind the podium of the Leader of the Official Opposition with, at the bottom, logos for the NDP, the Bloc Qu?b?cois, Qu?bec Solidaire, Costco, the Canadian Automobile Association and Air Miles.
"I also have my senior's card," the 68-year-old interim NDP Leader says in the cartoon.
Mr. Laporte, who writes a daily one-liner for the front page of La Presse, said he has had fun joking about the Bloc's demise, but added that he has confidence in the NDP's comic potential.
"This new partnership between the NDP and the people of Quebec, this new cohabitation, should provide material for a long time to come," he said.
Mr. Petit said it's still easier to joke about a tunnel collapse in Montreal than the "orange wave" that swept Quebec last spring. Still, he said, Quebeckers will eventually come up with a clear sense of what happened in the province in the last election, and humour will creep back into the world of federal politics.
"To do political humour, there needs to be a common understanding of events out there," Mr. Petit said.
The most popular radio show on the French-language equivalent of CBC Radio One, airing on Saturday mornings, is an hour-long series of skits and impressions called . Philippe Lagu?, the show's creator and host, said he is saddened by the loss of a character like Mr. Duceppe, but upbeat at the challenge.
"For new characters to come to life, others have to die," he said.
Mr. Lagu? said he started analyzing Ms. Turmel as soon as she was appointed as Mr. Layton's interim replacement, and that after this week's events, he can't wait for his season to start next month.
"We're looking at Ms. Turmel to see how we'll approach her. The trick now is to find a running gag," Mr. Lagu? said. "We're especially looking forward to when the House of Commons will come back [on Sept. 19]. It's going to be crunchy."
Political punchlines
Recent one liners from St?phane Laporte, published in a vignette on the front page of Montreal daily La Presse
"Who would have thought that one day, there would be more members of the New Kids on the Block than Bloc Qu?b?cois MPs?"
"What's the similarity between the heat wave and the orange wave? They both make Gilles sweat."
"Temporary leader of the Liberal Party - now that's a redundancy."
Standup comic Daniel Lemire at the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal
"The new NDP MPs really didn't expect to be elected. In fact, it's the first time that the winners of an election asked for a recount."

Full text: Cold front expected to hit sweltering Ontario, Quebec by Friday morning
Congratulations Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto: You've survived the first half of a nasty heat wave.
Those in the rest of the country? Be glad you dodged it altogether.
Southern Ontario, Eastern Ontario and the western part of Quebec will continue to endure temperatures as high as 35 degrees and a humidex of 43 this week as a slow-moving high-pressure ridge over the northeastern United States passes through, Environment Canada meteorologist Mark Seifert said.
The sweltering temperatures are expected to remain until Thursday night or early Friday, when a cold front will bring sweet relief in the form of showers, he said.
The heat wave is carrying air from the southern states, Mr. Seifert said, and will wash over the corridor from Windsor to Montreal, a strip of the country that's prone to such humidity.
An Environment Canada high heat and humidity alert issued for Montreal remained through Tuesday evening.
Toronto issued an extreme heat warning for the week and has seen an increase in 911 calls. Toronto's medical officer of health, David McKeown, said the hot weather is having a significant effect on vulnerable people, and asked the public and landlords to check on elderly or isolated tenants and neighbours.
The city is on track to endure the longest stretch of days with temperatures around 30 degrees since 2005, Mr. Seifert said. The heat and humidity might feel especially unbearable compared to last year's far more temperate summer - Toronto and Ottawa didn't have one day warmer than 30 degrees last July, he said.
Ottawa's busy ByWard Market was quieter Tuesday as people tried to avoid the 33-degree heat and humidex of 43.
Mark McConnell, a bartender at the Clock Tower Brew Pub, said business was uncharacteristically slow as the bar was forced to close doors and windows to keep the air conditioning in. He hoped traffic would pick up for the pub's wing night Tuesday.
"It's typical Canadian in Ontario - complain when it's hot, complain when it's cold," Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Seifert said the wave is already hitting New Brunswick, where the temperature was expected to reach 32 degrees on Wednesday.
While Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton and Vancouver are enjoying more normal temperatures this week, in the low-20s range, they shouldn't get too comfortable: Environment Canada forecasts a summer of hotter-than-normal temperatures all across the country.

Full text: Cold front expected to hit sweltering Ontario, Quebec by Friday morning
Congratulations Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto: You've survived the first half of a nasty heat wave.
Those in the rest of the country? Be glad you dodged it altogether.
Southern Ontario, Eastern Ontario and the western part of Quebec will continue to endure temperatures as high as 35 degrees and a humidex of 43 this week as a slow-moving high-pressure ridge over the northeastern United States passes through, Environment Canada meteorologist Mark Seifert said.
The sweltering temperatures are expected to remain until Thursday night or early Friday, when a cold front will bring sweet relief in the form of showers, he said.
The heat wave is carrying air from the southern states, Mr. Seifert said, and will wash over the corridor from Windsor to Montreal, a strip of the country that's prone to such humidity.
An Environment Canada high heat and humidity alert issued for Montreal remained through Tuesday evening.
Toronto issued an extreme heat warning for the week and has seen an increase in 911 calls. Toronto's medical officer of health, David McKeown, said the hot weather is having a significant effect on vulnerable people, and asked the public and landlords to check on elderly or isolated tenants and neighbours.
The city is on track to endure the longest stretch of days with temperatures around 30 degrees since 2005, Mr. Seifert said. The heat and humidity might feel especially unbearable compared to last year's far more temperate summer - Toronto and Ottawa didn't have one day warmer than 30 degrees last July, he said.
Ottawa's busy ByWard Market was quieter Tuesday as people tried to avoid the 33-degree heat and humidex of 43.
Mark McConnell, a bartender at the Clock Tower Brew Pub, said business was uncharacteristically slow as the bar was forced to close doors and windows to keep the air conditioning in. He hoped traffic would pick up for the pub's wing night Tuesday.
"It's typical Canadian in Ontario - complain when it's hot, complain when it's cold," Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Seifert said the wave is already hitting New Brunswick, where the temperature was expected to reach 32 degrees on Wednesday.
While Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton and Vancouver are enjoying more normal temperatures this week, in the low-20s range, they shouldn't get too comfortable: Environment Canada forecasts a summer of hotter-than-normal temperatures all across the country.

Full text: Teen loses consciousness climbing stairs to waterslide attraction at the Mont St. Sauveur Water Park north of Montreal
? A 14-year-old boy died on Monday after collapsing at a Quebec water park that was crowded with bathers trying to escape the torrid temperatures of a July heat wave.
The boy lost consciousness while climbing the stairs to a popular waterslide attraction at the Mont St. Sauveur Water Park north of Montreal, the second death of a youngster at the park in less than two weeks.
On June 23, a nine-year-old drowned in a wave pool at the Laurentians park while on a school outing.
Quebec provincial police say Monday's death, which occurred as 30C-plus temperatures and high humidity drove people to seek escape from the heat, appears to be linked to a heart condition. The boy, from a nearby town in the Laurentians, was at the park with a friend.
No criminal charges are being considered against the park's owners, said Sergeant Benoît Richard of the Sûreté du Québec. "Our hypothesis is that the death was due to natural causes," he said. "There was no foul play."
The boy was on the steps leading to the slide when he blacked out and fell, police say. Park staff and other customers administered first aid until paramedics arrived. The boy was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead.
Forecasts of a week-long heat wave and the start of summer holidays has water-safety authorities urging caution around water.
"From the moment you touch the water there's a risk, just like when you touch fire," said Raynald Hawkins, executive director for Quebec of the Lifesaving Society of Canada. He encouraged parents to ensure children have basic survival skills in the water, and to alert caregivers, such as schools or camps, if a child can't swim.
Still, Mr. Hawkins says that nearly all drownings in Quebec occur in unsupervised bodies of water such as lakes; the presence of lifeguards greatly increases safety. Of the 900 drownings in Quebec between 1998 and 2007, only nine were in public pools with lifeguards; one was in a water park, according to figures compiled by the lifesaving society.
On June 23, nine-year-old Jeremy Mulumba died on a field trip to mark the end of classes. The boy's father questioned whether there were adequate safety precautions for his son, who knew how to swim. The death is under investigation by a coroner.
A spokesman for the St. Sauveur water park, Christian Dufour, said the boy's death was the first since the park opened in 1986. He said Monday's death was unfortunate but the park regarded it as an accident. "We're upset by this," Mr. Dufour said. "But there was no link to any of the park's activities."

Record-setting temperatures are expected in Ontario on Monday, after a sweltering weekend caused the city of Toronto to issue an extreme-heat alert.
Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, extended an extreme-heat alert on Monday, warning city residents that the smog and humidity could be a health hazard for those with asthma or other respiratory ailments.
Environment Canada is forecasting a high of 35 degrees in the hottest regions, which extend from Windsor through Southwestern Ontario, all the way to Montreal.
Temperatures are expected to rise to a high of 32 degrees in Ottawa and 33 in Montreal.
Windsor and Toronto are expecting the highest temperatures at 35 degrees, challenging Toronto's 2002 record high of 34.4 degrees. Despite the extreme temperatures of the past few days, Toronto has had only four heat alerts this year. Last year there were a total of 14 heat alerts.
The Ontario Ministry of the Environment said smog levels are high because of hot and dirty air coming into the province from the United States, and pollutants from local industries and cars.
A spokeswoman from the Canadian Red Cross warned that it is not always evident that someone is suffering from the heat. People are advised to keep a close watch for symptoms such as dizziness, tiredness, headache and heat rash.
The Red Cross also advises to take the time to check on the elderly, children and those who have been ill, especially after a 97-year-old woman was found locked inside a black SUV in a Burlington mall parking lot for an hour on Saturday. The woman was treated for dehydration after passersby found her and called police. Temperatures soared above 30 degree outside, but the temperature was closer to 50 degrees inside the vehicle when she was found. She was locked in the SUV while her daughter and granddaughter went shopping.
Health officials are advising people to take the following measures in this hot weather:
1. Keep hydrated by drinking lots of water and natural juices
2. Avoid even moderate physical activity
3. Avoid going out in the sun. If you do, wear a hat
4. Stay in cool places with air conditioning, such as shopping malls or libraries
5. Take periodic baths or showers if no air conditioning is available

"Last summer was relentless," said Environment Canada's senior climatologist, David Phillips. "[Southern Ontario]had seven to eight days in a row without a break from the hot weather ... but this summer hasn't been so bad."
The heat wave is expected to end Monday night, with showers and thunderstorms developing about midnight.
"That little bit of rain will scrub the air clean, and we won't be weezing and gasping like we have been the last two days," Mr. Phillips said. "Everyone's going to be a lot more comfortable."
The Ontario Ministry of the Environment said smog levels are high because of hot and dirty air coming into the province from the United States, and pollutants from local industries and cars.
High pressure has created a "heat pump" that continues to draw moist and warm air from the southern U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.
"When that warm air is pumped this way, it becomes polluted as it travels over the Ohio Valley and into Southern Ontario," Mr. Phillips said. He said the high temperatures are not necessarily indicative of the effects of global warming.
"We can't see climate change simply by looking out the window," he said. "While it's no mystery that our weather seems to be warmer now, this is usually the warmest time of the year anyway. This is when everyone is complaining and the air conditioners are really humming. We can't look at one episode of weather and blame it on climate change. We have to look at trends over a long period of time."

The hot weather in Ontario didn't break any records Monday, with Toronto temperatures hovering around 34 degrees in the late afternoon, before cooling down for the evening.
Environment Canada had forecasted a high of 35 degrees in the hottest regions, which extend from Windsor through Southwestern Ontario, all the way to Montreal.
Cities across Southwestern Ontario and the eastern United States braced for the heat, after a sweltering weekend caused the city of Toronto to issue an extreme-heat alert.
Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, extended an extreme-heat alert on Monday, warning residents of the city that the smog and humidity could be a health hazard for those with asthma or other respiratory ailments.
Temperatures rose to a high of 33 degrees in Ottawa, and 32 degrees in Montreal. Toronto had the highest temperature at 34 degrees, just shy of the city's 2002 record high of 34.4 degrees.
Despite the extreme temperatures of the past few days, Toronto has had only four heat alerts this year. Last year there were a total of 14 heat alerts.

We have to look at trends over a long period of time."
South of the border, Americans are also roughing the heat with temperatures in the mid- to high-30s. The city of Philadelphia sent outreach workers to check on the homeless and elderly on Monday, and a "heatline" hot line was activated where nurses answered questions and gave advice about coping with the weather.
New York State issued an air quality health advisory because of ground-level ozone, a major component of smog that irritates the respiratory tract and eyes, and Illinois converted more than 130 office buildings into cooling centres, after a heat wave killed 700 people in Chicago in 1995.
A spokeswoman from the Canadian Red Cross warned that it is not always evident that someone is suffering from the heat. People are advised to keep a close watch for symptoms such as dizziness, tiredness, headache and heat rash.

Full text: Customers at Laird and Son, a Toronto-based air conditioning company, are no longer that concerned about the efficiency of the units they are buying.
Customers at Laird and Son, a Toronto-based air conditioning company, are no longer that concerned about the efficiency of the units they are buying.
"Instead, their first question is not about efficiency, it's, 'When can you do it?'" Frank Williams, a partner at Laird and Son, said Tuesday.
With record high temperatures in Southern Ontario, he said, the company's sales have doubled and he has been forced to increase his staff to accommodate the demand.
Normally, Laird and Son would install anywhere between 60 and 70 air-conditioning units in June. This year, that number has doubled, he said.
The heat wave is not isolated to Ontario. It has spread into Quebec and across the Maritime provinces, according to Environment Canada.
June, 2005, is about to become the hottest on record in Southern Ontario and Quebec, and July promises to be even warmer, according Dave Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.
"Toronto keeps clobbering records," Mr. Phillips said, adding that 14 days in the city have been equivalent to 35 degrees with the humiddex taken into account. The previous record was nine days in 1959.
"Last year, the whole year, we had 13 days (with a humidex above 35)," Mr. Phillips said.
But the temperature even without the humidex is blistering.
Both Montreal and Toronto have recorded records, with the monthly average in Toronto 4.3 degrees higher than normal and in Montreal 3.1 degrees warmer.
"By the time we close the book on June records, we'll probably have 14 days where the temperature has been above 30 C (in Toronto)," Mr. Phillips said. So far, Toronto has recorded 12 days above 30 C and Montreal has recorded nine.
"Last year people were complaining about 'Where is summer?' This year they're complaining about there is too much summer."
For then next 10 days, Environment Canada is calling for warmer-than-normal temperatures from Thunder Bay to Newfoundland
"We're calling for warmer than normal across Canada and, for the period July, August, September - apart from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick - we're saying its going to be warmer than normal," Mr. Phillips said.
The heat has created unprecedented electricity demands in Ontario.
Monday set a record, with Ontario's air-conditioners driving electricity demand to 26,157 megawatts per hour at the peak, said Terry Young, spokesman at the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO). Last June, demand peaked at 23,163 megawatts.
"It's all about air conditioning," Mr. Young said, adding that the generating capacity in Ontario is 25,500 megawatts. Anything above that requires the province to import more-expensive electricity from the United States.
By midday Tuesday, Ontario's electrical demand was once again poised to set records. IESO reported demand at 24,896 megawatts.
IESO is encouraging people to reduce their electricity use, primarily by curbing the use of air conditioners between peak hours - 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Otherwise, Hydro One may be forced to reduce demand by causing short blackouts in areas of high demand.
This is what happened in the Ottawa area on Monday, Hydro One spokesman Peter Gregg said, when the extreme heat and high-electrical demand forced the utility to shut off power in the area briefly.
The combination of heavy demand and intense heat caused what Mr. Gregg calls a "thermal constraint" on a transformer station south of Ottawa.
Essentially what happened was that, with temperatures peaking at more than 30 C, it became impossible for the high volume of electricity needed to pass through the station. Hydro One was forced to shut of the electricity in several areas for 15-minute intervals to decrease demand through the station.
Toronto coroner Jim Edwards said he is reviewing one heat-related death and is investigating what may be another.
People with respiratory problems are more vulnerable to heat-related illness, he said.
The city of Toronto declared its sixth heat alert of the year Tuesday. Such alerts are declared when there is an increased chance of weather-related death.
The alerts spur into action the Heat-Alert Response Team, which deals specifically with people who are suffering in the heat.
The team, made up of four paramedics who tour the city prepared to deal with life-threatening emergencies, visits homes and provide heat counselling.
Equipped with a hygrometer - an instrument the size of a large calculator that can measure both indoor temperature and humidity - paramedic Heather Cairns can advise patients which room in their house is the coolest.
About 50 per cent of the team's calls result in someone's being taken to the hospital, Ms. Cairns said.
Often people call for help late in the day when they are no longer able to deal with the heat. Ms. Cairns remembers tending to an apartment that was 30.3 inside, but felt like 41 with the humidex factored in, she said.
The disabled, elderly woman who lived there said she did not feel sick enough to go to the hospital but was eventually sent when she revealed she had trouble breathing and chest pains, Ms. Cairns said.
Education is key to managing safely in the heat, Ms. Cairns said.
Fans are important for cooling down, but they should be used only when a window is open. Without an outside air source, fans will have a convection effect, pushing low-lying cool air up, where it heats up.
"It's like a convection oven. ... It actually becomes hotter with the windows closed than if you weren't using a fan at all," she said.
During a heat alert, the Red Cross operates a heat information line from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. By dialling 416-480-2615, people can call in if they are concerned about their well-being or that of someone in the city. Where necessary, the Red Cross will then ask the medical team to make a courtesy call.
Southern Ontario has received only about one-third of its normal precipitation for May and June, Mr. Phillips said.
"There's no wonder there are watering bans, the ground is looking parched, gardeners are frustrated and the farmers are wishing for more precipitation. The berries aren't plump like you'd expect for this time of year."
And with no rain to cleanse the air, the smog days are set to increase, "the sun is just cooking those chemicals coming out of our tail pipes and our smoke stacks and so we're seeing a lot of bad air days."

Full text: MARGO PFEIFF escapes a Montreal heat wave by heading north -- way north, to Nunavut's Sirmilik National Park. Only a handful of visitors make it to this landscape of velvet tundra and streaming glaciers each year. Their reward? An Arctic wilderness all to themselves, not counting the snowy owls and Bowhead whales
? I could barely hear Donna Lester's voice from the depths of her hood where she was hiding from an icy wind that blasted big, wet snowflakes against her parka. She was pointing up at great overlapping V's of white snow geese circling against a charcoal sky, gathering numbers until finally, amid a chorus of syncopated honking, they soared away.
"We're heading north and they're heading south," Lester mumbled through frozen lips. "Do you think they're smarter than us?"
Good question. This was, after all, our summer vacation. Late August and even the birds were outta there.
The weather may sometimes be less than ideal 700 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, but where else can three people have a 22,000-square-kilometre national park all to themselves? The northern tip of Baffin Island is also one of the most dramatic landscapes on Earth. We camped in solitude overlooking three glaciers while a parade of icebergs sailed past on Eclipse Sound and a pair of snowy owls kept vigil on a nearby rock outcrop.
Sirmilik is one of Canada's newest national parks and the third biggest in the country. It comprises four parts: three sections on Baffin Island include the land and waters of Oliver Sound, Borden Peninsula and Baillarge Bay, a seabird colony. The fourth and biggest segment is the Bylot Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary, an 11,100-square-kilometre island half-covered with glaciers.
Unlike most federal reserves where the government pitches a conservation plan to the locals, it was the Inuit who asked Parks Canada in the late 1970s to protect Northern Baffin Island's Lancaster Sound, one of the richest wildlife areas in the Arctic with its abundance of seals, polar bears, caribou, narwhal, beluga and bowhead whales, as well as migratory birds. The Inuit had been watching petroleum exploration companies nosing around and feared a potential environmental nightmare coming down the pipeline in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Sirmilik was a long time coming as Inuit land claims first had to be settled. After the new territory of Nunavut was established in 1999, the park was set up in 2001. To reach Sirmilik it is a three-hour flight north from Ottawa or Montreal to Nunavut's capital of Iqaluit, and then another three hours north to Pond Inlet. No wonder the park sees fewer than 100 visitors a year.
For more than a decade of periodic visits to Pond Inlet, I had been gazing longingly at the dozen or so glaciers streaming off Bylot Island like icing off a cake, 25 ice-choked kilometres across Eclipse Sound.
I had visited "Pond," as the Inuit community of 1,250 is known, several times. In summer, I had kayaked between icebergs and up inlets along the coast. I had hiked through velvet tundra dotted with blueberries and the remnants of ancient Thule sod houses.
In early spring, I had visited when the sea ice first begins to shatter, opening up the rich waters beneath to winter-hungry wildlife from bears to birds that can be observed in a kind of Canadian-style safari at the edge of the ice floe. But I had never made it across to Bylot.
So, in the summer of 2004, when my Pond Inlet-based friend Dave Reid, an outfitter, suggested I join him for a week-long hiking trip to Bylot Island, I quickly packed my down parka, gloves and tuque, and happily headed north during a Montreal heat wave. Reid is the park's only licensed guide and at the last minute another keen hiker, Donna Lester, also from Montreal, joined us.
Pond Inlet is the jumping off point for Sirmilik. Sausaged into orange survival suits, we boarded Sheatie Tagak's boat. Bylot disappeared into an eerily dark fog bank halfway across Eclipse Sound, and when we burst free into sunshine again it was just in time to see a rainbow and the misty blow of a passing Bowhead whale.
I took it to be a good omen and said so as we stepped ashore, mostly because I had seen the look on Lester's face as she disembarked and stared down at dinner-plate sized bear prints in the sand all around us.
"Is that a big bear or a little bear?" she asked. It was her first trip to the Arctic.
Reid hesitated. "A wee one," he conceded in his broad, Glaswegian accent.
After unloading the week's supplies and setting up the tents, we both hung on our guide's every word as he explained and demonstrated how to operate flashlight-sized "bear-bangers" that fired off a loud "bang" that would hopefully dissuade any bears that might approach.
As back-up, Reid carried a pellet gun. Weapons, even for self-defence, are not allowed in Canadian national parks, although the Inuit are allowed to shoot wildlife in northern parks like Sirmilik as they are part of traditional hunting grounds.
The following morning, we set off along Bylot's shoreline. It's a rare treat to walk on a beach in the Arctic, and throughout the day we listened to the waves and followed wolf paw prints in the sand. We came across sandstone outcroppings that had been sculpted by the wind and rain into strange minaret-shaped hoodoos. When we hiked closer to examine Inuktitut syllabics graffiti someone had etched into the soft rock, we noticed the wolf had done the same.
By late afternoon we passed a small Inuit hunter's shack alongside the seaside toe of Sermilik Glacier, which gives the park its Inuktitut name meaning "place of glaciers." Climbing up a tundra ridge, we found a camp spot overlooking Sermilik and other glaciers up a long valley. As Reid cooked a chicken stir fry, we watched the last rays of a setting sun fire up a string of icebergs rafting along Eclipse Sound, a bracelet of brilliant rubies against a leaden sky. Seals popped up in the water, looked around and vanished with barely a ripple.
In the fading light, an agitated white spot in the distance stood out like snow on the reddish-brown tundra. By the shrieking of the snowy owl, we realized we must be near her nest and sure enough, magically camouflaged by their grey speckled coats, two juveniles were perched side by side on a rock barely 25 metres away, heads spinning nervously like swivels.
As an Arctic newcomer, Lester photographed every bright yellow Arctic poppy and set of shed caribou antler we came across. There was a bumper crop of lemmings that year and the small rodents scurried into burrows ahead of us. We watched a pair of sand hill cranes bugling and preening one another, and two white, chunky Arctic hares hopping up a grassy slope.
The hiking was not strenuous as we followed the stream up the valley. Tundra trekking is like walking across a landscape of feather pillows; soft on the boots, but tiring. River crossings were more of a challenge. Luckily water levels were low and we rarely got wet above our shins, but the glacial run-off turned our feet into useless blocks of ice within seconds.
Gradually, we settled into a relaxed rhythm. When Reid spoke, he increasingly slid into "Aye" and "Nay" and "Is that Choco-Max going begging?" Born in Scotland, he came to Canada in 1989 with the last intake of Hudson's Bay Company workers recruited from Scotland, as they had been for centuries, because the Scots had a reputation of surviving well in northern solitude.
"H.B.C.," Reid chuckled as he toasted bagels one morning on tent pegs suspended over the camp stove. "We used to say it stood for the Horny Boys' Club."
The summer of 2004 had been cool and wet, and in river valleys we hiked on ice that lingered from last winter. In places, "frost straws" had formed, hollow tubes of ice bunched together that tinkled and chimed as they shattered beneath our boots.
On our second-to-last afternoon, we watched Reid dance a jig on the high ridge ahead of us when he arrived at his favourite camp spot overlooking Stagnation Glacier. "Ah, it's good to be back," he said above the sound of a rushing waterfall. The late sun lit the snow-flecked hillside and we tucked into a feast of beef stroganoff.
The warm sunny days at the beginning of our trek had given way to clouds and bitter cold. To warm up each morning, we did yoga sun salutations against a backdrop of glaciers and waterfalls -- we'd try anything to get some sunshine. But when the Arctic sun did break through it did so coyly and briefly, showing off only tantalizing glimpses of the landscape; the glistening white arm of a glacier, a few soft mounds of tundra, the seductive curve of shoreline as we made our way back towards our base camp, snowy owls hop-scotching the ridges ahead to keep an eye on us.
Our final morning on the beach opposite Pond Inlet dawned bright and sunny. As we watched Sheatie's boat weaving through distant ice chunks toward us, we finally succumbed to a temptation we had been fighting all week -- we fired off our bear-bangers into the wide blue Arctic sky.
