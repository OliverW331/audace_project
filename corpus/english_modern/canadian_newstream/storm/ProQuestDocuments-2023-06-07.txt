Full text: Is the thrill gone for good between Montrealers and Mayor Valérie Plante?
Just like every other aspect of the pre-COVID-19 world, the hopes the energetic mayor once embodied seem long forgotten in this, the autumn of our discontent.
Instead, Plante's leadership evokes boarded-up storefronts, bitter battles over bike paths and forlorn-looking pedestrian corridors in a deserted downtown
Depicted as Wonder Woman by Montreal Gazette editorial cartoonist Aislin when she defeated incumbent mayor Denis Coderre three years ago on Nov. 5, 2017, Plante has taken a beating from the media in recent months.
She also faces dissent within her own ranks, according to a recent report that accuses Projet Montréal of muzzling party members.
And a recent poll indicates six out of 10 Montrealers say they will not vote for her in the next municipal election in November 2021. Nearly half of the 51 per cent of voters who supported her in 2017 would not do so again, the poll by Ad Hoc Research for Radio-Canada suggests.
Meanwhile, the city faces formidable challenges as the pandemic continues to devastate the economy. Two weeks ago, the Quebec government threw a $263-million lifeline to Montreal, which had projected a $129-million deficit this year.
Plante's pledge to get traffic flowing smoothly again by deploying a "mobility squad" on city streets and co-ordinating construction projects has failed to eliminate bottlenecks. She recently put one-third of the city's infrastructure projects on hold, saying "Montrealers need a break."
The signature promise of her 2017 election campaign - a Pink métro line crossing Montreal diagonally from Lachine to Montreal North - has not begun to materialize. Instead, Plante has suggested that an eventual east-west tramway from Lachine to downtown proposed by the Quebec government would be a partial replacement, even though critics note that unlike the Pink Line, its proposed route along Notre-Dame St. does not cross underserved areas of Montreal West and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.

Montreal mayor says getting death threats is not 'part of the job'
On the third anniversary of her election, Plante spoke by videoconference with the Montreal Gazette about the challenges ahead and the path to a second term. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Q: A poll last week said six out of 10 Montrealers say they're unlikely to vote for you in the next election. Why has your popularity plummeted when some other politicians appear to be holding their own during the COVID pandemic?
A: The municipal level is the grassroots level. Whatever is being done or not done, often people will blame it on the municipal government. It could be somebody's not happy because their garbage didn't get picked up or because of decisions that affect their day-to-day life.
To me, I feel like there was being the mayor before COVID and being the mayor since COVID. I find it quite remarkable how people's mood changes so fast. For example, during the first wave, when I decided to move forward with the homeless situation, and make masks mandatory, I felt like people were definitely behind me. But then there were one or two decisions I think were very polarizing.
Ever since I became mayor, my vision has always been the same. I'm not doing things that I've never talked about before. I've always talked about the same things: ecological transition, housing, transport and economic development.
Q: In the spring, you said that creating cycling and walking corridors on commercial streets would help downtown businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic. But many Montrealers say these measures only made things worse. A recent survey by the Downtown Business Development Corporation showed that car drivers spent twice as much as shoppers who used other means of transportation. It also showed two out of three downtown shoppers this summer came by car. On Notre-Dame St., restaurateurs forced the city to back down on traffic measures. How do you evaluate your measures now in the light of these negative reactions?
A: I don't know what people are talking about when they say, 'We come shopping with our cars, we don't come shopping with our bikes.' I understand that. I agree with what they're saying. But there's no new bike path downtown, so I don't understand where this is coming from.
What about her campaign promise of free transit for children and seniors, and fare reductions for people on low incomes? "The mandate is not over," Mayor Valérie Plante points out.
Q: You've faced a storm of negative media coverage in recent months. Commentator Richard Martineau said you should be kicked out, while La Presse accused you of living in a bubble. Guy A. Lepage said the St-Denis St. express bike lane was the worst idea of the year. Why do you think the media is piling on?
A: I think you should ask them. I'm not a different person than before. I am exactly the same mayor, although I've had to deal with COVID and that's pretty much where I'm putting all my time. It seems like all the frustration gets directed at me. I'm responsible for everything.
What I find disturbing is that a lot of people forget that I'm not doing (the bike path on St-Denis) because I hate cars. I don't wake up in the morning saying, 'I don't like cars.' I do it because of safety. Since 2014, 300 pedestrians or cyclists were hit and injured on St-Denis. There were nine people who died, including Mathilde Blais. It could have been me. I'm someone who takes my bike to work. It could have been me rolling under the wheels of a big truck. Every time somebody gets hit, I always get these messages, 'We gotta do something.' That's what we're doing. So I do not understand.
Q: There was a study by the Urban Development Institute that said downtown Montreal is in the intensive care ward. Three out of four people in Greater Montreal don't go downtown anymore. Ninety-two per cent of downtown workers want to keep working from home. The hotels are empty. A lot of people say it will never go back to what it was. What is your vision for the downtown of the future? What actions are you going to take to make sure that we somehow have a thriving downtown?
A: I think it's a bit early to know how downtown, not only in Montreal but also in other big cities, will change. Of course downtown cores will change. But I'm not ready to say that they will be completely different. Because, when I talk to big companies, like the Banque Nationale or the Caisse populaire, what they hear is that people are looking forward to coming back. Will it be 100 per cent? Maybe not. But people are not willing to stay like this for the rest of their lives.
We have an economic recovery plan that is ready. We wanted to present it earlier this month, but we're still in crisis mode. It's about having big investments, creating jobs, really working with all the actors to give some energy and financial support to the economy of Montreal.
Q: In the last election you promised that construction of the Pink Line would start by the end of your mandate. You also promised to accelerate the Blue Line extension. But it seems work will not start on the Pink Line by the next election. You also promised free transit for children under 12 and seniors, and fare reductions for people on low incomes. What will you do to fulfill these promises by next November?
A: I still have a year to go.???? For the Pink Line, the part which is from downtown to Lachine, is now in the PQI (Plan québécois des infrastructures) of the government of Quebec. It's not like it took 20 years, like the Blue Line. It took two years and a half. Now we have to do the second half. So I will continue and I'm very proud that the first part is there.
As far as the Blue Line goes, I feel like we're moving very well. I've offered my help to the government of Quebec to support better the work with the STM with the different promoters.
And for the fares, the mandate is not over.
Q: Another election promise was 12,000 new social and affordable housing units. You said that you've achieved three-quarters of that goal. But Montreal's auditor general, Michèle Galipeau, said that in fact, no units have been delivered yet under the Accès logis Montréal program. Could you explain where are these new housing units and are people actually going to be living in these 12,000 units by the next election??
A: Absolutely. We need to keep a few things in mind. The first point is that housing is quite complex. When we made the objective, we decided to base it on the average number of Accès logis units over 10 years. The thing we did not suspect is that in the last two years, the government of Quebec did not continue with that strategy. So we didn't get new money for Accès logis. So it's something we've been talking to them about and insisting that the needs are huge. So right now what I can say is that we have reached 76 per cent of our goals. Some of them are built, some of them are under construction, some of them have received their plans and specifications, and some of them are also in the waiting line. But overall we are in a good position.
Q: You're going to be tabling your budget in two weeks. The Quebec government has refused your request to allow the city to run a deficit. How are you going to balance the budget? while freezing taxes and helping businesses that are struggling to survive?
A: It was a big decision to freeze taxes, knowing that 70 per cent of our revenues come from property taxes, but we thought it was the right thing. We have made some cuts. We had a little bit of surplus that we are using. The government of Quebec gave us $263 million, which will help us to balance the budget. Finally, we cannot have a deficit but we can take out loans, so that is something we are exploring as well.

Down but not out: Artists find creative outlets during their forced break

Full text: What a long strange trip it's been for local artists over the past six months.
But artists are a resilient bunch. They're used to adversity.
Even prior to the pandemic, many of them saw their revenues drop big time as a result of the digital revolution. Maybe that's why folks in the entertainment milieu are cautiously optimistic even though the COVID-19 crisis has wreaked havoc with every aspect of the arts business.
Montreal singer-songwriter Jason Bajada remembers exactly where and when he was when he realized the world had changed. He'd been living in Los Angeles during the winter, wanting to spend more time in a city he loves, playing occasional gigs. He played a small club in Hollywood during the first week of March and everything seemed to be going fine for him.
The pandemic hit home March 14 at the Chateau Marmont, a legendary L.A. hotel known for its rock-star guests. He was there with fellow Montrealer Matt Holubowski, who'd just played a show in L.A.
"We were on the patio of Chateau Marmont having brunch on the 14th. It was a Saturday morning, and there was no one at the restaurant," said Bajada. "We were the only ones. That's when we thought: 'Oh this is pretty serious'."
Hearing the call for all Canadians to try to come home, Bajada and his girlfriend packed their car two days later and zipped across the continent as fast as they could, arriving back in their home town three and a half days later.
One immediate effect of the health crisis was to zap the incomes of musicians. Public gatherings were cancelled in most jurisdictions, including Quebec, and so all tours had to be nixed. This was particularly tough for musicians, given that concerts have become their main source of revenue now that record sales have virtually disappeared.
Bajada was lucky in the sense that he didn't have big touring plans for 2020 and was at work finishing a new album. Like many musicians, Bajada began posting songs on various social-media platforms. He misses concerts, both as a performer and a fan, but he's not sure they'll return in the same form as in the pre-COVID world.
"Just picture me at Osheaga, I think it was two or three years ago, I'm in the pit, like right up front, watching Wolf Parade perform, and it's super hot and I literally have sweaty bodies moshing against me and rubbing up against my arm," Bajada said. "I'm already someone who likes to preserve my perimeter. I can't imagine (in a post-COVID world) being at a concert squeezed up against a sweaty armpit."
The provincial government ordered the cancellation of major cultural and sporting events in the summer months, which shut down all festivals, like Osheaga, the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Just for Laughs. Some, like the jazz fest, presented smaller online-only versions. Most just decided to wait for summer 2021. Just For Laughs will hold a mini online event this fall.
Some promoters booked concerts at drive-in theatres The Royalmount Drive-In Event Theatre opened in late June with a mix of live music, comedy, movies and fundraising events. Quebecor also produced around 100 concerts at five drive-in locations across the province over the course of the summer.
The forced break led musicians to find other creative outlets. Montreal band Half Moon Run began making what they called Covideos, videos of their songs recorded with each of the four members in their respective homes. Their label Glassnote Records just released an album featuring 11 of these songs. The downside is they had to cancel a few of the biggest shows of their lives, notably a show in July on the main stage of the Festival d'été de Québec, on a bill with The National.
"It's upsetting for sure," said Half Moon Run multi-instrumentalist Dylan Phillips. "But as with anything, a crazy thing happens and it gives you an opportunity to learn from it. ... But it really made me miss live music. It made me think there must be so many people dying to get out to a show again, both on the musician and listener side. So I have to believe it's gotta come back. I'm sure we're going to have to do a lot of adapting. It's hard to imagine major festivals with over 80,000 people being able to function if the pandemic is still happening."
The consensus in the concert business seems to be that major shows will be back in the summer or fall of 2021, but no one really knows. The major concert promoters will survive, but many fear the big losers here may be the small clubs that can't book any shows at all due to social-distancing rules. Mauro Pezzente, co-owner of Casa del Popolo and La Sala Rossa, said in August that to follow those rules, Casa's concert capacity would be limited to just 12 people.
Nick Farkas, senior vice-president of concerts at Evenko, said it's been a roller-coaster ride the past six months. What Farkas sees is a gradual reopening. Evenko reopened its venue L'Étoile at the Dix30 in recent weeks and they are booking 250-capacity concerts in the 1,000-capacity venue in Brossard. The company had wanted to open a reduced-capacity site at Jean-Drapeau Park, where it holds festivals like Osheaga and ÎleSoniq, but that fell through. Evenko will survive the storm but he worries about small indie venues.
"I hope that the smaller clubs can make it through this because they're the lifeblood of what happens in the industry," Farkas said. "Support for the small venues is going to be key over the next six months because it's already been very difficult for them. The feeder system for everything we do starts in the small clubs."
Cinemas had a particularly difficult time. They had to close in March at the start of the pandemic and most reopened in Quebec in July but the biggest problem is that Hollywood stopped releasing films. The much-anticipated Tenet finally hit screens in Canada in late August. But there are still almost no blockbusters coming out. Disney released its live-action remake of Mulan on its streaming service Disney+ rather than in theatres.
Guzzo Cinemas president Vincent Guzzo said that when his cinemas reopened in July, the first people to come back were families with young kids, but he says the core demographic of 20-to-35-year-olds hasn't returned.
"Ultimately the biggest problem will always be content," Guzzo said. "We are a content-driven business. You've got the right movie, everybody is running to watch it. You've got the wrong movie, nobody's in the theatre, pandemic or no pandemic."
The pandemic also put a major damper on film and TV production in the province. Some production has resumed, but it's no easy task given social-distancing regulations, and many producers are simply postponing their shoots until 2021.

Full text: QUEBEC - It's pretty safe to say that Premier François Legault would rather not be managing the consequences of a virus which has killed 5,780 Quebecers and disrupted the entire province in its wake.
With the number of COVID-19 cases stubbornly refusing to drop, the economy and Montreal stuggling, a historic $14.9 billion provincial deficit and a health system still on high alert, Legault's government finds itself, mid-way through its four-year mandate, stuck in a perpetual state of crisis management.
In other words, this is not at all what the Coalition Avenir Québec signed up for when they won the election Oct. 1, 2018.
Worse. Unlike other catastrophes such as the 1998 ice storm, nobody really knows when this will end and life will return to normal.
Instead of confidently preparing the ground for the 2022 election, the daily routine for Legault and his cabinet - now six months into managing Quebec during a pandemic - has become navigating uncertainty at the same time as running a government.
One week it is announcing rules about masks. Another, a program to train 10,000 orderlies to work in the CHSLD network. Two weeks ago it was the creation of an alert system to indicate the severity of COVID-19 per region.
The list goes on and on with staff in various ministries working full out. The costs rise and so does the worry and pressure to make the right decisions in a volatile climate.
"We are at war with an invisible enemy and we have to review the priorities and the ways of doing things taking into consideration this reality," a top Legault aide said in a telephone interview when asked if the battle is taking its toll.
"There's not too much time for soul searching. You have to react. It comes with the job."
The aide summed up the government's priority list for the remaining two years before the election this way: limiting the damage of the pandemic and finding ways to relaunch the economy.
Somewhere amid the resurging pandemic, the CAQ hopes to proceed with its political and legislative agenda. Top of the list will be a "re-draft" of Bill 61, the legislation fast-tracking public infrastructure projects such as roads, hospitals and senior's residences.
The original bill, which is supposed to counteract the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, failed last June when the opposition blocked it.
The CAQ's environment minister, Benoit Charette, also plans to table his long-awaited "plan for a green economy," which was delayed by the pandemic.
The legislature resumes sitting Tuesday for the fall season.
"I'm optimistic that we'll be able to respect all our promises during the four-year mandate," Legault said at a news conference Friday when asked how disruptive recent events have been. "Of course the next weeks are a big challenge but we're a lot better prepared today than we were six months ago."
He repeated Quebec needs to get the number of new cases under control and that will require discipline.
"I don't think we'll come back to 800 or 1,000 cases a day but nobody can be sure of what's coming next," Legault said.
In the last few weeks, Legault - a man who admits he's not the most patient guy in the world - has expressed frustration with the minority of Quebecers who don't see COVID-19 as a threat or believe like some Americans that it is a conspiracy.
"There are some people who believe Elvis (Presley) is still alive and that the Earth is not round," Legault said in August when asked about anti-mask demonstrators.
He is also unhappy that some Quebecers are ignoring the rules and still holding house parties. To some extent, however, he knows his hands are tied.
"We can't put a police officer in every home in Quebec," Legault said in remarks to the CAQ caucus Friday.
There are rumours Legault will go a step further and make a fresh appeal for Quebecers to show solidarity in the form of a speech to Quebecers in the legislature or in a video.
Without actually putting any public blame on her shoulders, Premier François Legault transferred Danielle McCann out of the health portfolio in a June cabinet shuffle. In her place is Christian Dubé, the no-nonsense former president of the Treasury Board.
The province has entered what is actually a more complicated phase of the pandemic for the government - one where the flare ups are no longer mostly in public long-term care centres (CHSLDs) and no longer only concentrated in Montreal.
"We're not out of the woods yet," the aide said. "Nobody is declaring victory."
So what leads the government to say it is better prepared? Here are some key differences since last March.
A new health and social services minister: Without actually putting any public blame on her shoulders, Legault transferred Danielle McCann out of the health portfolio in a June cabinet shuffle. In her place is Christian Dubé, the no-nonsense former president of the Treasury Board.
Personal protective equipment (PPE): Legault has repeated many times that Quebec never ran short of masks, gloves and gowns in the first wave but has admitted there were distribution problems. Legault said he wanted to make Quebec more self-sufficient as well. In his action plan for a second wave, Dubé said Quebec will be signing agreements with Quebec suppliers of PPE to avoid being at the mercy of foreign companies. At a legislature committee in August, Dubé revealed Quebec now has in hand a 60-day supply of N-95 masks. Later, he said Quebec is aiming for a 6-month total supply.
CHSLD staffing: It was Quebec's weakest link in the first wave of the virus. The premier vowed to correct staffing problems in public long-term care residences. After pledging to hire 10,000 more orderlies and patient assistants, Quebec launched a paid fast-track training program which ran all summer. As a result, a total of 7,100 orderlies and patient attendants are being deployed in residences.
Testing has improved: The province's original target was to be able to conduct 14,000 tests a day but it rarely hit that number in the first wave. That started to change in May and June as systems improved and more people came forward. On Friday, Sept. 11, Quebec set a new record with 26,000 tests in one day. Wait times have also improved and are now down to between 24 and 72 hours.
Ironically, as is often the case for leaders in a crisis, Legault, still has widespread public support for his actions. A Léger poll conducted last week for Journal de Montréal and Journal de Québec pegged support for the CAQ at a massive 48 per cent.
The Liberals were second with 22 per cent support, the Parti Québécois with 17 per cent and Québec solidaire, 11 per cent.
Better still for Legault, his approval rating for his handling of the pandemic is 76 per cent.
"Because of the COVID-19 crisis, the Legault government had an unusually long post-electoral honeymoon," said Daniel Béland, director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.
A swift economic recovery would help the CAQ in the long run but a lasting health crisis - especially a new shutdown - could have the opposite effect, he added.
But after supporting the government in the early part of the pandemic, the three opposition parties plan to change channel during this session, with more questions about the CAQ's handling of events.
Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade, who has harshly criticized Legault for the pandemic, said two weeks ago she will be pressuring Legault because she does not believe Quebec is ready for a potential second wave.
On Monday, PQ leader Pascal Bérubé said he will be presenting a motion Tuesday in the legislature calling for a complete independent inquiry into the way the pandemic evolved, as Ontario is doing.
"When you are 23 per cent of the (Canadian) population and have 63 per cent of the deaths, that is noting to be proud of," Bérubé said at a news conference.

Can Montreal's food courts survive? Time Out Market is banking on it

Full text: Laurent Ruffier-Lanche had just ordered about 100 additional chairs and tables for his downtown food market when the pandemic hit.
"They're in storage now, as you can imagine," Ruffier-Lanche, who manages Time Out Market's Montreal location inside the Eaton Centre, said in an interview late last month while giving a Montreal Gazette reporter a tour of the premises. "One day we'll bring them out."
When that happens is anybody's guess. After almost three months of inactivity because of the coronavirus pandemic, Time Out's 40,000-square-foot space reopened for business July 8 - but at a vastly reduced clip. Instead of 16 food offerings, the space now counts six active concessionaires, as well as a cooking school, a retail space and three bars.
To get the space ready, Time Out invested in safety - adding signage, sanitation stations, Plexiglas shields at bars, counters and tables, as well as a contactless order system. All staffers wear personal protective equipment.
But will the measures Time Out and other downtown food courts have put in place be enough to ensure their long-term survival?
"We're lucky in a certain sense of having this huge space with high ceilings, and the ability to bring in fresh air regularly," Didier Souillat, Time Out Group's London-based chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview late last month. "It's easier to do social distancing with 40,000 square feet than it is with 2,000."
If early indications are anything to go by, business has a ways to go to bounce back. On a recent lunch hour, about two dozen customers were scattered across a space that can seat 390 people. When it opened in November, Time Out's original capacity of 550 often seemed insufficient to meet demand.
Laurent Ruffier-Lanche is the general manager of the Time Out Market at Montreal's Eaton Centre.
Time Out isn't the only company to have invested in a new food concept just before the pandemic hit.
In January, Place Ville Marie owner Ivanhoé Cambridge opened Le Cathcart, a 1,000-seat location that includes two cafés, three full-service restaurants and nine food kiosks - part of a $1-billion revamp of the venerable office complex. The opening followed that of Le Central, a 25-restaurant food court inside the Carré Saint-Laurent project at the corner of Ste-Catherine St. and St-Laurent Blvd.
Both spaces recently reopened with reduced seating - a reflection of the funk that has gripped downtown Montreal this summer.
No more than 5 per cent of the estimated 300,000 office tower workers are back working downtown, Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal chief executive officer Michel Leblanc said late last month. Some area restaurants that would normally serve 300 meals a day now have to get by with as few as eight meals, he said.
"You can't walk away from the fact that if people aren't commuting anymore, if people aren't traveling anymore, if people aren't going to the office anymore, it's not going to be good for business," Souillat said. "We're happy to be open, but we need tourists to come back and people to come back to the offices, basically."
Walmart Canada president Haio Barbeito predicted in a presentation hosted in July by the Retail Council of Canada it will take at least two years for food-service sales to recover. As teleworking gains in popularity, more people will embrace home cooking at the expense of eating out, he said.
"It will take a while" for things to improve, Souillat said. "That's why we are staggering our tenants back in, little by little. The pie is only so big. You can't divide it by 18. Right now every week is looking a bit better."
COVID-19 is making food-service businesses "take a long hard look at their concepts," Francine Rodier, a marketing strategy professor at Université du Québec à Montréal, said in a telephone interview. "When you depend on office-tower workers for business, you are going to suffer. You need to get creative."
Last week, Time Out began offering home delivery in a bid to revive sales by striking a deal with DoorDash.
"We never really wanted to have people with helmets and bags coming through our food halls," Souillat said. "It wasn't part of our business plan. We want people to come and enjoy the food, but we have to adapt. Our experience just shows that businesses have to react pretty fast."
The way Souillat tells it, Time Out has what it takes to ride out the COVID-19 storm until the spring.
"I'm pushing to make sure we limit damages till the end of this winter, and hoping - of course I'm being optimistic - that from April next year we get back in full swing," he said. "When the pie becomes a little bit bigger and tenants are ready to come back, we will welcome them back. We're here for a long time. We're here for at least 10 years."

Crisis puts Quebec's smaller literary presses in a tight bind

Full text: What's a book launch with no book launch?
Or with no books?
What's a book launch if everybody is focused on something completely different - like, say, COVID-19?
The pandemic brought cultural production to an almost complete standstill. Montreal's anglo publishers are hanging in as best they can.
"What it boils down to is that it's really, really hard to sell books, and to let people who would be interested in those books even know there's such a book," said Linda Leith, of Linda Leith Publishing
Among the challenges facing Quebec publishers: distributors, printers and bookstores were closed for varying lengths of time over the past three months (some bookstores still are); and events such as book launches and the all-important Blue Metropolis festival - which Leith founded in the late '90s - have been cancelled.
"On top of that, there's hardly anywhere you can get a book reviewed," Leith said. "So all in all, it's a tough slog right now."
Leith had four English books and one in French released this spring (all currently offered half-price on her website). All of them fell into a void.
Several events were planned for Quebec City journalist and author Raquel Fletcher's Who Belongs in Quebec? Identity Politics in a Changing Society, looking at the treatment of Muslims in the province. None of those took place, and sales have suffered as a result.
"It's really hard to replace the launch period," Leith said. "That's when it's exciting, a book is new and authors are happy to see it, show it to everybody, read from it and talk about it."
She has more titles lined up for fall and next spring, which are all up in the air alongside a glut of releases by other publishers. There's a real risk of fall books getting caught in a logjam as publishing houses try to push out releases before the end of the year, prompting the question of whether it might be better to put everything on hold indefinitely.
"We don't want to launch more books into limbo if we can wait a couple of months to find a better moment," Leith said.
"I must say, it's worrying from a financial point of view. Smaller literary presses like us are very vulnerable."
Part of the problem is the financial burden placed on publishers, who must pay printing costs themselves and are responsible for unsold books. Bookstores can return unsold items, and have been doing so since the onset of the pandemic.
Publisher Linda Leith has titles lined up for fall and next spring, but with recent releases falling into a void, publication dates are up in the air. "We don't want to launch more books into limbo if we can wait a couple of months to find a better moment."
"It's a huge financial loss for (publishers)," said Anna Leventhal, executive director of the Association of English-Language Publishers of Quebec, who sees more trouble on the horizon.
"Even (with) physical bookstores (reopening), there's going to be nowhere near the numbers of people shopping as before," she said. "And even if all the bookstores ... were packed full of people, things like readings, events and conferences - which garner important sales and visibility for authors - are not happening now, and that will continue to impact the industry down the line."
Leventhal is heartened by "the book love out there" from readers who continue to support the industry in whatever way they can. She also points to independent bookstores such as Drawn & Quarterly, in Mile End, which offers curbside pickup and has teamed up with a bicycle delivery service to get books to Montrealers promptly and at a reasonable cost.
"It's not that people don't care about books now," she said. "They care as much or more. It's just that the distribution chain has several links that were already rusty and now are broken."
Metonymy Press could be considered lucky, in that it had no releases scheduled for spring. But it has still seen important engagements for its authors cancelled, and is facing uncertainty regarding its busy list of releases for the fall and new year.
The publisher's mandate is to "reduce barriers ... for authors whose perspectives are underrepresented," in order to produce content relevant to "queer, feminist and social justice communities."
Author Kama La Mackerel had several events planned leading up to the release of their book of poetry Zom-Fam in the fall. An April performance at the MAI was cancelled, and an August tour of Canada, with stops in the U.S., is now in question.
"We had a Zoom meeting yesterday to try to brainstorm what our potential virtual book launch might look like," said Metonymy co-founder Ashley Fortier, who runs the company with high school friend Oliver Fugler.
Metonymy was hit by a record number of returns from bookstores in March, but has been encouraged by increased sales on its website, and being eligible for financial relief from the Canada Council for the Arts.
A poetry reading by La Mackerel, Powetik and Shanice Nicole planned at feminist book store L'Euguélionne was moved online, June 18, in an effort to maintain real-time connections with readers. Books, after all, are more than just words on a page.
"Audiences are a pivotal part of how to engage with a work, particularly with small-scale stuff produced by artists at the margins," Fortier said. "It's really important for those people not to be pushed aside during a crisis like this."
Simon Dardick has seen all kinds of ups and downs in the 47 years of Véhicule Press Based out of the Roy St. home he shares with life and business partner Nancy Marrelli, the company has weathered every storm. He hopes that resilience will carry it through this one.
"Our way of responding to the situation was to use social media a lot," Dardick said, "and to offer specially priced book bundles."
Packages such as Véhicule's Women Writers Bundle and National Poetry Month Bundle have helped prod people to buy a few books at a time, with discounts of up to 40 per cent.
"There's been an incredible uptick in direct sales, web sales," Dardick said. "It doesn't replace bookstore sales, but it's good for the morale. Our books are getting into the hands of readers, one way or another."
That said, it hasn't been easy. Apple S, Dimitri Nasrallah's translation of Éric Plamondon's novel inspired by Apple founder Steve Jobs and Silicon Valley, was scheduled to come out in early April but copies arrived only recently. Same goes for Rosalind M. Pepall's Talking to a Portrait: Tales of an Art Curator.
An event planned for earlier this week at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts around Pepall's book was cancelled, and may eventually take place online.
Véhicule has six titles due in the fall, including History Through Our Eyes, a collection of Montreal Gazette photographs from the past century, curated by Gazette editor-in-chief Lucinda Chodan and editorial page editor Edie Austin. Dardick hopes those books will get the attention they deserve.
"I have moments of depression," he said, "but basically we're trying to be optimistic. We're working with good writers and just feeling good about that, and saying to ourselves, 'We'll work things out down the road.' "

Full text: Quebec City entrepreneur Peter Simons, one of the province's best-known fashion retailers, is in no rush to reopen his chain of stores.
Though his company has annual sales of more than $500 million, the Simons CEO says he's chosen safety over profits as he gears up for the May 19 reopening of his nine Quebec stores, including the downtown Montreal location.
Simons shared his thoughts by telephone Wednesday with the Montreal Gazette on how the pandemic is affecting the 3,000-employee company and the retail industry as a whole. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
How have the last two months been for you?
It's been tough. We've had really long days, though I always try to take time to think of the good things that are happening at the company. It's a very stressful moment because the losses that come with closure have to be financed. At the same time, you're working to stabilize your business.
Entrepreneurs are used to looking into the future, but a crisis like this makes you focus on the next day, the next week - the things that are in front of you. It can just be to make sure that employee morale and mental health are solid, and that people are focused on the immediate challenges."
What was business like in mid-March when you shut your doors?
We were really excited. We had just gotten through the rail transportation shutdown, which disrupted our supply chain in January and February. It took enormous efforts to address that, and then we got hit with this. It was a little bit of a double whammy.
We were a couple of months away from putting into commission a new $200 million robotics distribution facility in Quebec City that represented the largest capital investment in our history. We had finished spending all the money in order to serve our stores and our e-commerce more efficiently. It was very bad timing for us. We're sitting on a dormant investment, so it's added an extra layer of challenge.
How has confinement impacted the online part of your business?
It was already an important part of the business. We've been investing massive amounts for the past 10 years. We run one of the top 10 fashion websites in the country, No. 2 in Quebec, with more than 60 million visitors annually, and we sell all over North America.
After the shutdown, we saw a major acceleration in online sales. That has helped enormously to weather the storm. It's been one of the positive pieces, but it hasn't been able to compensate completely for the store closures. It's brought oxygen to the company. Another bright spot is Fabrique 1840, our digital platform that supports Canadian artisans.
The downtown Simons location on Wednesday, on eerily quiet Ste-Catherine St. "It's too early to say" how the COVID crisis will affect malls, CEO Peter Simons says.
Is it fair to say consumers have woken up to the importance of buying locally?
We've seen this coming with our customers for a number of years. We started building Fabrique 1840 five years ago, and the trend has really taken shape during the crisis. There's been massive growth, a 10-fold increase. My dream is that Fabrique 1840 will become the destination for Canadian artisanal creativity. I would like to create wealth here in Canada, as opposed to me writing a cheque to some holding in Liechtenstein.
Customers are trying to support their local economy. There's an appreciation for quality and local retailers, and it's manifested itself in purchasing behaviour. Sometimes, the diamonds are in your own backyard.
This crisis will bring to bear a deep reflection about the companies that are there, creating jobs and contributing to the community. The customer is changing, and hopefully the politics and the legislation can change. There has to be political action in terms of accepting the impacts of the intangible economy, and passing legislation that makes it just.
There's obviously been a big move to e-commerce. Part of that will be sticky, meaning that people will adopt the new habit and keep it post-confinement. How much of it will stick? We're still reflecting on that. The change has been happening. This crisis has just accelerated it.
How will COVID-19 affect malls?
It's too early to say. Right now I'm just focusing on the experience of reopening, on taking care of our people and our clients when we reopen. We watch cash flow carefully. I work with some incredible people, some real warriors. People seem to be keen and excited to get back to work. I'll be out in the stores next week as some of the staff comes back for training and preparation. It's a big change, and I want to do it safely, the right way. We are going to start slowly. Better to walk and think than run and make mistakes.

'Not the best time' for minimum wage increase, business groups say

Full text: A minimum wage hike in the middle of a prolonged economic shutdown? Quebec business groups, predictably, aren't thrilled.
Labour minister Jean Boulet confirmed on Wednesday that the province's minimum hourly wage would climb by 60 cents( http://www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca/Pages/Article.aspx?aiguillage=ajd&idArticle=2804152285 ) to $13.10 starting May 1. More than 409,000 workers will benefit from the move, he said.
At 4.8 per cent, the increase represents more than double the rate of inflation in Quebec.
"The timing isn't great," François Vincent, Quebec vice-president at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview Wednesday. "A lot of small businesses don't even know if they'll survive. Many had trouble paying the rent in April, and now they're trying to see how they can pay it in May."
With Quebec having lost 264,000 jobs in March as the COVID-19 pandemic spread, "perhaps the government could have pushed this back by a few months," said Michel Leblanc, head of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. "Many smaller companies already have cash flow problems. Higher labour costs could make them reassess their plans to rehire when this is over."
Quebec first announced its intention to boost the minimum wage in December, when the provincial economy was still expanding and many companies were struggling to find enough workers to meet demand.
Four months later, the pandemic is in full flight and all non-essential businesses in Quebec are closed until at least May 4. As a result, companies are now focused on keeping costs down - and business groups say the government should at least help them offset the wage increase.
"The world has changed a lot since December," Norma Kozhaya, chief economist at the Conseil du Patronat du Québec, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview. "This minimum wage increase is an extra burden that no one needed, especially in sectors such as the restaurant business, where profit margins are slim at the best of times."

Only half of Quebec business owners surveyed by CFIB( https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/sites/default/files/2020-04/COVID-19-survey-results-April-15.pdf ) are confident their business will survive if current economic conditions last until the end of May. The group represents more than 110,000 small businesses across the country, including about 24,000 here.
Two-thirds of the Quebec businesses surveyed by CFIB say they've lost more than half of revenue because of the crisis, Vincent said. COVID-19 disruptions have cost Quebec businesses an average of 183,000$, CFIB data show.
Quebec unveiled plans on March 19 to commit at least $2.5 billion( https://theprovince.com/business/quebec-unlocks-2-5-billion-to-help-companies-weather-covid-19-storm/wcm/a9601eb8-e5ad-4faf-8ca0-16d5659d1576 ) to help companies overcome liquidity problems caused by the pandemic.
While praising Quebec for the help provided so far, organizations such as CFIB and the Conseil du Patronat are now asking for more - through measures such as a temporary suspension in provincial pension plan contributions or a reduction in municipal taxes.
CFIB is also urging Quebec to follow in the footsteps of Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia and give business owners an emergency subsidy of as much as $5,000 a month while COVID-19 closings last.
"The goal here is to preserve liquidity, to preserve jobs," Vincent said. "Once businesses go bankrupt, it will be too late."

Yet even as people gather with their families both physically and virtually for the holiday, the pandemic continues to cause pain and grief for many Canadians whose health and livelihoods have been devastated by the illness.
Ontario reported 401 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday as well as 21 deaths, bringing the national total to 23,719 confirmed and presumptive cases and 674 deaths. The federal government and other provinces were expected to release more numbers throughout the day.
In a message marking Easter, nearly one month after the country started locking down to slow the spread of COVID-19, Trudeau commemorated the personal sacrifice and compassion that many Canadians have exhibited during the pandemic.
"This year, as we celebrate differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Easter's themes of hope, understanding, and renewal are more relevant than ever," the prime minister said in a written statement.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.

Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

11:30 a.m. RCMP says it will enforce the Quarantine Act if people don't self-isolate
The RCMP announced new powers( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-to-highlight-interest-free-loans-to-help-small-business-weather-pandemic/wcm/87aef560-e5ec-48eb-96fd-6889908ecbfa/ ) aimed at enforcing the Quarantine Act, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted Friday that rules could be loosened this summer if Canadians act now to contain the spread of COVID-19.
The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's schedule is about to change as the federal government continues to avoid invoking the Emergencies Act.

Thursday, April 9 6 p.m. COVID-19 cases growing at Edmonton seniors facility
A COVID-19 outbreak has occurred at Shepherd's Care Kensington Village, a seniors care residence in Edmonton.
A growing number of COVID-19 cases have been identifiedat a group of Edmonton seniors care facilities( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-cases-growing-at-edmonton-seniors-facility/wcm/f57a613a-f2f1-4304-bf95-95e6a825c96e/ ) run by Shepherd's Care Foundation.
Eighteen cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed at Shepherd's Care Kensington Village campus, the foundation said Thursday, which includes multiple connected buildings offering differing levels of care to seniors. The outbreak has been traced to a visitor who had recently travelled outside the country, and a resident who recently moved to the facility who may have been exposed prior to their arrival.
"Shepherds Care Foundation's number one priority is the safety and care of our residents and staff. COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors and our population is at greatest risk as we have seniors and individuals that are older than 65 and immunocompromised," Shawn Terlson, president and CEO of the foundation, said Thursday.

4:30 p.m. 2020 Edmonton International Jazz Festival postponed until 2021
The 2020 TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival( https://www.edmontonjazz.com/ ), originally scheduled to take place from June 19-28, was postponed Thursday as a result of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic. The longtime festival and jazz fan favourite has been rescheduled for June 18-27, 2021.
"We have monitored the latest news and updates from provincial and federal authorities in hopes we would be able to come together for another TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival," festival artistic producer Kent Sangster said in a release. "We know this pandemic is a devastating blow to our music industry friends, family, and partners, but the health of everyone who attends and participates in our festival is a priority for us." 4 p.m. Cases rise to 1,451
Alberta recorded 28 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, bringing the total to 1,451. There were three more deaths recorded, bringing that total to 32.

3:45 p.m. Temporary expansion to Calgary hospital adds 100 spaces for patients
A temporary expansion to the Peter Lougheed Centre will provide 100 new spaces for patients in Calgary, the region hardest hit by COVID-19 in Alberta.
The 6,000 square foot structure is donated by Alberta-based Sprung Structures, and is worth $235,000, Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Thursday.
There have been 878 cases in Calgary, including 22 deaths. That accounts for 61 per cent of all cases in the province and 69 per cent of the deaths.
The structure will be located in the parking lot next to the Peter Lougheed Centre.
Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.
The announcement of the extra $937 million investment, which will create thousands of jobs, came hours after Statistics Canada reported Alberta lost 117,000 jobs in March, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent.
The funding will go towards paving roads, fixing bridges, filling potholes and repairing K-12 schools. HVAC upgrades will be installed in universities, and courthouses will get information technology upgrades.
1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.
"We're going to have to be creative on how we're going to be funding our programming this fall."

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

"I want to tell Quebecers we will make sure this residence, and all residences, are taking care of our seniors," Legault said before going a step further.

10:15 a.m. House of Commons convenes to pass wage subsidy
The Trudeau government has struck a deal with opposition parties( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/national/government-opposition-parties-strike-deal-to-pass-massive-wage-subsidy-bill/wcm/8496b484-78b9-4078-8913-bcea9956c564/ ) to swiftly approve today a massive $73-billion wage subsidy program aimed at helping businesses and workers survive the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

Singh says he is in negotiations with the Liberals and has received assurances from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that gaps in the program will be addressed.

The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

The 2020 TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival( https://www.edmontonjazz.com/ ), originally scheduled to take place from June 19-28, was postponed Thursday as a result of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic. The longtime festival and jazz fan favourite has been rescheduled for June 18-27, 2021.
"We have monitored the latest news and updates from provincial and federal authorities in hopes we would be able to come together for another TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival," festival artistic producer Kent Sangster said in a release. "We know this pandemic is a devastating blow to our music industry friends, family, and partners, but the health of everyone who attends and participates in our festival is a priority for us." 4 p.m. Cases rise to 1,451

Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.
The announcement of the extra $937 million investment, which will create thousands of jobs, came hours after Statistics Canada reported Alberta lost 117,000 jobs in March, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent.
The funding will go towards paving roads, fixing bridges, filling potholes and repairing K-12 schools. HVAC upgrades will be installed in universities, and courthouses will get information technology upgrades.
1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.

Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.
"I want to tell Quebecers we will make sure this residence, and all residences, are taking care of our seniors," Legault said before going a step further.

10:15 a.m. House of Commons convenes to pass wage subsidy
The Trudeau government has struck a deal with opposition parties( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/national/government-opposition-parties-strike-deal-to-pass-massive-wage-subsidy-bill/wcm/8496b484-78b9-4078-8913-bcea9956c564/ ) to swiftly approve today a massive $73-billion wage subsidy program aimed at helping businesses and workers survive the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

Singh says he has heard from many Canadians who do not qualify for the emergency benefit program, which opened to applicants this week, including people who are still earning a small income, students and those who were unemployed before the pandemic began.
Singh says he is in negotiations with the Liberals and has received assurances from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that gaps in the program will be addressed.

The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.

1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.
"We're going to have to be creative on how we're going to be funding our programming this fall."

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

8:20 a.m. WestJet plans to rehire 6,400 employees
Calgary-based WestJet says it will rehire almost 6,400 workers,( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) hours after rival Air Canada announced it would use the federal government's wage subsidy program to bring back employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19.
Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.
"I want to tell Quebecers we will make sure this residence, and all residences, are taking care of our seniors," Legault said before going a step further.

10:15 a.m. House of Commons convenes to pass wage subsidy
The Trudeau government has struck a deal with opposition parties( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/national/government-opposition-parties-strike-deal-to-pass-massive-wage-subsidy-bill/wcm/8496b484-78b9-4078-8913-bcea9956c564/ ) to swiftly approve today a massive $73-billion wage subsidy program aimed at helping businesses and workers survive the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

The RCMP announced new powers( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-to-highlight-interest-free-loans-to-help-small-business-weather-pandemic/wcm/87aef560-e5ec-48eb-96fd-6889908ecbfa/ ) aimed at enforcing the Quarantine Act, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted Friday that rules could be loosened this summer if Canadians act now to contain the spread of COVID-19.
The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

"Shepherds Care Foundation's number one priority is the safety and care of our residents and staff. COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors and our population is at greatest risk as we have seniors and individuals that are older than 65 and immunocompromised," Shawn Terlson, president and CEO of the foundation, said Thursday.

4:30 p.m. 2020 Edmonton International Jazz Festival postponed until 2021
The 2020 TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival( https://www.edmontonjazz.com/ ), originally scheduled to take place from June 19-28, was postponed Thursday as a result of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic. The longtime festival and jazz fan favourite has been rescheduled for June 18-27, 2021.
"We have monitored the latest news and updates from provincial and federal authorities in hopes we would be able to come together for another TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival," festival artistic producer Kent Sangster said in a release. "We know this pandemic is a devastating blow to our music industry friends, family, and partners, but the health of everyone who attends and participates in our festival is a priority for us." 4 p.m. Cases rise to 1,451

A temporary expansion to the Peter Lougheed Centre will provide 100 new spaces for patients in Calgary, the region hardest hit by COVID-19 in Alberta.

Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.
The announcement of the extra $937 million investment, which will create thousands of jobs, came hours after Statistics Canada reported Alberta lost 117,000 jobs in March, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent.
The funding will go towards paving roads, fixing bridges, filling potholes and repairing K-12 schools. HVAC upgrades will be installed in universities, and courthouses will get information technology upgrades.
1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.
"We're going to have to be creative on how we're going to be funding our programming this fall."

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

8:20 a.m. WestJet plans to rehire 6,400 employees
Calgary-based WestJet says it will rehire almost 6,400 workers,( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) hours after rival Air Canada announced it would use the federal government's wage subsidy program to bring back employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19.
Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.
"I want to tell Quebecers we will make sure this residence, and all residences, are taking care of our seniors," Legault said before going a step further.

10:15 a.m. House of Commons convenes to pass wage subsidy

Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors and our population is at greatest risk as we have seniors and individuals that are older than 65 and immunocompromised," Shawn Terlson, president and CEO of the foundation, said Thursday.

"We have monitored the latest news and updates from provincial and federal authorities in hopes we would be able to come together for another TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival," festival artistic producer Kent Sangster said in a release. "We know this pandemic is a devastating blow to our music industry friends, family, and partners, but the health of everyone who attends and participates in our festival is a priority for us." 4 p.m. Cases rise to 1,451
Alberta recorded 28 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, bringing the total to 1,451. There were three more deaths recorded, bringing that total to 32.
There have been 70,247 tests completed.
3:45 p.m. Temporary expansion to Calgary hospital adds 100 spaces for patients
A temporary expansion to the Peter Lougheed Centre will provide 100 new spaces for patients in Calgary, the region hardest hit by COVID-19 in Alberta.
The 6,000 square foot structure is donated by Alberta-based Sprung Structures, and is worth $235,000, Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Thursday.
There have been 878 cases in Calgary, including 22 deaths. That accounts for 61 per cent of all cases in the province and 69 per cent of the deaths.
The structure will be located in the parking lot next to the Peter Lougheed Centre.
Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.
The announcement of the extra $937 million investment, which will create thousands of jobs, came hours after Statistics Canada reported Alberta lost 117,000 jobs in March, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent.
The funding will go towards paving roads, fixing bridges, filling potholes and repairing K-12 schools. HVAC upgrades will be installed in universities, and courthouses will get information technology upgrades.
1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Quebec has 10,912 cases of COVID-19, an increase of 881 from yesterday, Premier François Legault said in his briefing this afternoon.
The total number of deaths is now 216, an increase of 41.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.
"We're going to have to be creative on how we're going to be funding our programming this fall."

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

8:20 a.m. WestJet plans to rehire 6,400 employees
Calgary-based WestJet says it will rehire almost 6,400 workers,( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) hours after rival Air Canada announced it would use the federal government's wage subsidy program to bring back employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19.
Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.
"I want to tell Quebecers we will make sure this residence, and all residences, are taking care of our seniors," Legault said before going a step further.

Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

The RCMP announced new powers( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-to-highlight-interest-free-loans-to-help-small-business-weather-pandemic/wcm/87aef560-e5ec-48eb-96fd-6889908ecbfa/ ) aimed at enforcing the Quarantine Act, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted Friday that rules could be loosened this summer if Canadians act now to contain the spread of COVID-19.
The police force says it has been asked to assist in enforcing the act in the midst of the pandemic. Officers could visit homes to ensure anyone entering Canada is self-isolating for 14 days, and police can now make arrests, rather than issue a court appearance notice or summons.
The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

9:15 a.m. Trudeau's schedule changes for Easter Weekend
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's schedule is about to change as the federal government continues to avoid invoking the Emergencies Act.
Trudeau will be at the House of Commons on Saturday as the government attempts to pass the wage subsidy bill.
The prime minister primarily has been working from home since March 12 when his wife tested positive for COVID-19. He says he will conduct his daily televised address to the country from parliament on Sunday.
Trudeau calls the wage subsidy bill the largest economic measures Canada has seen since the Second World War.

Thursday, April 9 6 p.m. COVID-19 cases growing at Edmonton seniors facility
A COVID-19 outbreak has occurred at Shepherd's Care Kensington Village, a seniors care residence in Edmonton.
A growing number of COVID-19 cases have been identifiedat a group of Edmonton seniors care facilities( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-cases-growing-at-edmonton-seniors-facility/wcm/f57a613a-f2f1-4304-bf95-95e6a825c96e/ ) run by Shepherd's Care Foundation.
Eighteen cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed at Shepherd's Care Kensington Village campus, the foundation said Thursday, which includes multiple connected buildings offering differing levels of care to seniors. The outbreak has been traced to a visitor who had recently travelled outside the country, and a resident who recently moved to the facility who may have been exposed prior to their arrival.
"Shepherds Care Foundation's number one priority is the safety and care of our residents and staff. COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors and our population is at greatest risk as we have seniors and individuals that are older than 65 and immunocompromised," Shawn Terlson, president and CEO of the foundation, said Thursday.

4:30 p.m. 2020 Edmonton International Jazz Festival postponed until 2021
The 2020 TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival( https://www.edmontonjazz.com/ ), originally scheduled to take place from June 19-28, was postponed Thursday as a result of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic. The longtime festival and jazz fan favourite has been rescheduled for June 18-27, 2021.
"We have monitored the latest news and updates from provincial and federal authorities in hopes we would be able to come together for another TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival," festival artistic producer Kent Sangster said in a release. "We know this pandemic is a devastating blow to our music industry friends, family, and partners, but the health of everyone who attends and participates in our festival is a priority for us." 4 p.m. Cases rise to 1,451
Alberta recorded 28 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, bringing the total to 1,451. There were three more deaths recorded, bringing that total to 32.

3:45 p.m. Temporary expansion to Calgary hospital adds 100 spaces for patients
A temporary expansion to the Peter Lougheed Centre will provide 100 new spaces for patients in Calgary, the region hardest hit by COVID-19 in Alberta.
The 6,000 square foot structure is donated by Alberta-based Sprung Structures, and is worth $235,000, Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro said Thursday.
There have been 878 cases in Calgary, including 22 deaths. That accounts for 61 per cent of all cases in the province and 69 per cent of the deaths.
The structure will be located in the parking lot next to the Peter Lougheed Centre.
Alberta announces nearly billion dollars in infrastructure spending as 117,000 jobs lost
The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.
The announcement of the extra $937 million investment, which will create thousands of jobs, came hours after Statistics Canada reported Alberta lost 117,000 jobs in March, bringing the unemployment rate to 8.7 per cent.
The funding will go towards paving roads, fixing bridges, filling potholes and repairing K-12 schools. HVAC upgrades will be installed in universities, and courthouses will get information technology upgrades.
1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

8:20 a.m. WestJet plans to rehire 6,400 employees
Calgary-based WestJet says it will rehire almost 6,400 workers,( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) hours after rival Air Canada announced it would use the federal government's wage subsidy program to bring back employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19.
Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

4 p.m. Alberta to acquire hundreds of more ventilators and ICU beds ahed of projected May peak
Alberta plans to more than double the number of available ventilators( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-jason-kenney-releases-modelling-that-projects-health-impacts-in-alberta ) by the end of the month, and increase ICU beds by more than 1,000 to deal with the projected COVID-19 peak in May.
In the official modelling released Wednesday, the province offers further details on how it will respond to the pandemic including acquiring resources beyond what the model suggests it will need and boosting training for staff.
According to the newly released details, 314 ventilators are currently dedicated to COVID-19 patients in the province. The government plans to bump that number up to 576 by April 22 and 761 by the end of the month.
Alberta Health Service expects to increase ICU capacity by an additional 1081 beds for COVID-19 patients by the end of April, if necessary.
Officials could convert operating, recovery, and treatment rooms to ICU beds.
AHS is working with two different scenarios. In the "probable" scenario Alberta is predicting as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections and between 400 and 3,100 deaths, with the peak of the cases arriving in mid-May.
In the less likely "elevated" model, the province expects to see infections peak at the beginning of May, with as many as 1 million infections, and between 500 and 6,600 deaths.

3:10 p.m. Edmonton zoo taking precautions with cats after New York tiger gets COVID-19
Masks are now a requirement when caring for cats at the Edmonton Valley Zoo( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-impacts-on-zoo ) after a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for COVID-19.
"We have arrangements in place to protect both people and cats," Alice Leung, a manager with the City of Edmonton's communications and engagement department, said in an email on Tuesday. "The Edmonton Valley Zoo animal care team has always used personal protective equipment (PPE) when interacting with all our cats (including training, shifting, and feeding). We have now added masks to PPE based on recommendations from veterinary advisors."
News broke Sunday that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the disease, after showing symptoms on March 27.
The four-year-old Malayan tiger, Nadia, as well as six other tigers and lions are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn't showing symptoms.
Nadia is doing well and is expected to recover.

3 p.m. Edmonton makes room for pedestrian
Two busy roadways in Edmonton's river valley will open to pedestrians and cyclists( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-city-making-more-room-for-pedestrians-eliminating-beg-buttons-at-56-intersections ) Thursday to allow them to meet COVID-19 physical distancing requirements.
The city will be also deactivating beg buttons at 56 intersections in the city's core so pedestrians don't have to press a frequently-touched button to cross the street.
One-way portions of Victoria Promenade and Saskatchewan Drive will be reallocated to those getting their daily dose of exercise, the city announced Wednesday after a push from councillors and several community groups to provide pedestrians with more space.

1:15 p.m. COVID-19 transforms Way of the Cross, Easter church service
Good Friday and Easter services are transforming in the wake of the COVID-19( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/people-are-hurting-covid-19-transforms-way-of-the-cross-easter-church-service/wcm/e793dd93-b190-4284-a9bc-410c8587b7e5/ ) pandemic.
Edmonton's Way of the Cross is set to run Friday for its 40th year but in a form not seen before due to the prohibition of mass gatherings of more that 15, said Jim Gurnett, a member of the event's organizing committee.
Instead, the committee has organized a 40-minute long video for the faithful to watch.
"It is impossible to do the walk," said Gurnett. "The people who would have been the presenters at the real walk on Friday, we took them at different times to the locations...or something similar. We just taped what their reflection would have been on Friday."
The event - where Edmonton crowds have grown to as many as 600 - is characterized by 14 'stations' depicting moments and places of importance during Jesus' last walk from condemnation to death.

1 p.m. All provincial parks in B.C. closed
B.C. Parks is closing all provincial parks ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-all-provincial-parks-in-b-c-closed-to-halt-spread-of-virus/wcm/277eeb2c-e6bb-483e-85cc-136420389933/ ) in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus after physical distancing measures in the wilderness have failed.
The temporary closure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.
In a statement Wednesday, B.C. Minister of Environment George Heyman said the action being taken is difficult but necessary.
"The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk," he said.
"I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors."

Police say a licence plate was written down and officers were able to find the four suspects.
One of them, an unnamed 20-year old from Taber, Alta., has been charged with mischief under $5,000.

Trudeau to work from home, but will attend cabinet
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he will continue to work at home but will begin leaving his residence to attend the occasional important meeting, including a cabinet session today.
Trudeau says he will take "all appropriate precautions" when he does so.
The prime minister has been working from home since his wife Sophie tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-March.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says party House leaders are negotiating when and how Parliament can return to debate legislation on wage subsidies to help workers.
Freeland says she is hopeful a meeting of the House of Commons can happen very soon

Ontario reported 550 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday, the biggest single-day increase so far, though figures also showed a return to an increasing testing backlog.
The new cases bring the total in the province to 5,276 cases - an increase of 11.6 per cent over Tuesday - including 174 deaths and 2,074 resolved.
The jump followed two days of a relatively lower number of new cases.

9:15 a.m. Trudeau promises 'relaxed' rules for wage subsidy
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal wage-subsidy program for employers hit by COVID-19 will have looser standards( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/canadian-press-newsalert-trudeau-promises-relaxed-standards-for-wage-subsidy/wcm/4b0228e1-98b0-461a-a282-65487efe6ef5 ) than previously announced.
Rather than having to show a 30-per-cent decline in revenues, he says they can show a 15-per-cent decline in March, and can compare their revenues to previous months rather than the previous year.
Charities can also choose whether to include revenues from governments in their calculations when they apply.

8 a.m. Air Canada to use federal wage subsidy to re-hire employees
Hours after Air Canada announced it will use the federal government's wage subsidy program( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) to re-hire employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19, Calgary-based WestJet said it has yet to determine whether it can do the same.
Montreal-based Air Canada - which has reduced its work force by 50 per cent, or 16,500 jobs, due to the pandemic's devastating impact on airline revenue - said Wednesday it has had discussions with federal officials that have allowed it to conclude the company is eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
In a news release, Air Canada said while the full details of the program are still outstanding, the airline has enough information to conclude that it is eligible and will therefore be adopting the program "for the benefit of its 36,000 Canadian-based employee work force."

6:30 a.m. CERB system gets stellar reviews

"Successfully applied for the #CERB at 6.01am ... Fully expected it to crash. It didn't. Easy as pie," tweeted one applicant at 7:26 a.m. who goes by the moniker Suburban Voyeur on Twitter.
"I clicked literally three boxes," she later added in response to numerous other applicants who appeared to have found it just as easy to apply for the special benefit program for those out of work because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Close to one million applications for the CERB - which offers people $2,000 a month for up to 16 weeks - were filed through the CRA-operated processing portal within 24 hours of the benefit becoming available, according to the federal government, perhaps the largest-ever number of unemployment claims filed in a single day to date.

1:30 p.m. Liberals, Conservatives spar over passage of COVID-19 aid legislation
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guide sisters, Paige, 12, and Jaide, 9, Bradley, can't go door-to-door anymore to sell cookies, so now they deliver them to peoples door and they put cash in the mailbox in Sherwood Park, April 8, 2020.
Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.
"We're going to have to be creative on how we're going to be funding our programming this fall."

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

8:20 a.m. WestJet plans to rehire 6,400 employees
Calgary-based WestJet says it will rehire almost 6,400 workers,( https://edmontonjournal.com/business/air-canada-to-use-federal-wage-subsidy-to-re-hire-employees-westjet-still-evaluating/wcm/d11ea665-bafe-4a3c-a2e5-c45b79d1d0ea/ ) hours after rival Air Canada announced it would use the federal government's wage subsidy program to bring back employees it has already laid off due to COVID-19.
Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.

4 p.m. Alberta to acquire hundreds of more ventilators and ICU beds ahed of projected May peak
Alberta plans to more than double the number of available ventilators( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-jason-kenney-releases-modelling-that-projects-health-impacts-in-alberta ) by the end of the month, and increase ICU beds by more than 1,000 to deal with the projected COVID-19 peak in May.
In the official modelling released Wednesday, the province offers further details on how it will respond to the pandemic including acquiring resources beyond what the model suggests it will need and boosting training for staff.
According to the newly released details, 314 ventilators are currently dedicated to COVID-19 patients in the province. The government plans to bump that number up to 576 by April 22 and 761 by the end of the month.
Alberta Health Service expects to increase ICU capacity by an additional 1081 beds for COVID-19 patients by the end of April, if necessary.
Officials could convert operating, recovery, and treatment rooms to ICU beds.
AHS is working with two different scenarios. In the "probable" scenario Alberta is predicting as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections and between 400 and 3,100 deaths, with the peak of the cases arriving in mid-May.
In the less likely "elevated" model, the province expects to see infections peak at the beginning of May, with as many as 1 million infections, and between 500 and 6,600 deaths.

Masks are now a requirement when caring for cats at the Edmonton Valley Zoo( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-19-impacts-on-zoo ) after a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for COVID-19.
"We have arrangements in place to protect both people and cats," Alice Leung, a manager with the City of Edmonton's communications and engagement department, said in an email on Tuesday. "The Edmonton Valley Zoo animal care team has always used personal protective equipment (PPE) when interacting with all our cats (including training, shifting, and feeding). We have now added masks to PPE based on recommendations from veterinary advisors."
News broke Sunday that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the disease, after showing symptoms on March 27.
The four-year-old Malayan tiger, Nadia, as well as six other tigers and lions are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn't showing symptoms.
Nadia is doing well and is expected to recover.

Edmonton's Way of the Cross is set to run Friday for its 40th year but in a form not seen before due to the prohibition of mass gatherings of more that 15, said Jim Gurnett, a member of the event's organizing committee.
Instead, the committee has organized a 40-minute long video for the faithful to watch.
"It is impossible to do the walk," said Gurnett. "The people who would have been the presenters at the real walk on Friday, we took them at different times to the locations...or something similar. We just taped what their reflection would have been on Friday."
The event - where Edmonton crowds have grown to as many as 600 - is characterized by 14 'stations' depicting moments and places of importance during Jesus' last walk from condemnation to death.

The temporary closure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.
In a statement Wednesday, B.C. Minister of Environment George Heyman said the action being taken is difficult but necessary.
"The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk," he said.
"I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors."

Rather than having to show a 30-per-cent decline in revenues, he says they can show a 15-per-cent decline in March, and can compare their revenues to previous months rather than the previous year.
Charities can also choose whether to include revenues from governments in their calculations when they apply.

8 a.m. Air Canada to use federal wage subsidy to re-hire employees

Montreal-based Air Canada - which has reduced its work force by 50 per cent, or 16,500 jobs, due to the pandemic's devastating impact on airline revenue - said Wednesday it has had discussions with federal officials that have allowed it to conclude the company is eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.
In a news release, Air Canada said while the full details of the program are still outstanding, the airline has enough information to conclude that it is eligible and will therefore be adopting the program "for the benefit of its 36,000 Canadian-based employee work force."

Tuesday, April 7 Properly dispose of your gloves, masks
More and more instances of medical waste being disposed in parking lots of essential service stores like this glove in an Edmonton grocery store parking lot on March 31, 2020.

Coronavirus: The psychology of hoarding during a pandemic

Full text: It's time to put down the coveted package of toilet paper, give the brain a break from doomsday social media posts and plunge into a new pastime. That's what mental health experts are suggesting as the Quebec-wide shutdown continues in the effort to stem the spread of COVID-19.
The phenomenon of hoarding - notably of toilet paper, hand sanitizer and food - is an obvious manifestation of an "epidemic" of stress and fear gripping the province and elsewhere, say experts who spoke with the Montreal Gazette this week.
However, they offered suggestions on how people - nascent hoarders and others - can manage the stress.
The experts' coping tools start with limiting time spent scanning social media for information on the pandemic and include practising positive and goal-oriented thinking. The experts even have suggestions on how to do the latter two.
But first, about that hoarding.
"There's a large part of what's going on that is also an epidemic of panic and anxiety about something other than the coronavirus, or about a threat that may or may not happen but has not happened yet," said Samuel Veissière, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at McGill University.
An evolutionary anthropologist, Veissière offered an explanation for hoarding that's rooted in the past: humans have long been obsessed with potential threats.
"We have these well-understood psychological vulnerabilities and cognitive biases for negative information," said Veissière, who is also co-director of the Culture, Mind and Brain program at McGill.
"We evolved in dangerous environments. Our minds are obsessed with anything that conveys information about potential threats. This is why the stuff that really goes viral online is always about outrage, about panic. And the 24-hour news cycle and the social media feeds don't help because people panic and they read a lot of misinformation."
Hoarding, Veissière said, stems from a need to regain a sense of control when faced with uncertainty, such as the invisible threat posed by a contagion.
"As a behavioural scientist, at first I was a little amused and now I'm more alarmed, of course," he said of news reports about store shelves being emptied of toilet paper and other goods.
"People need predictability in their lives," he added.
A shopper leaves a Montreal store with her limit of two packs of toilet paper on March 26, 2020 as stores place limits on some products because of hoarding due to the coronavirus pandemic.
"They need control. So they revert to things that they perceive to be vital to their basic survival. So food, but also face masks and toilet paper. This is almost like a magical ritual to prevent danger. People want to protect their body from infections and foreign agents. So they gravitate towards, from my perspective, really symbolic things."
The population is facing an "info-demic," Veissière said, his term for an epidemic of bad information.
People hear about an incident where a store has run out of something, so they think they also need it and start panicking, he said.
As well, a pandemic - more than a natural disaster - will tend to foster tribalism, Veissière said. Think of the stories that emerged during the 1998 ice storm about cooperation and collaboration among neighbours, and compare that to the reports of frenzied hoarding in response to COVID-19.
"A pandemic and the fear of infection from invisible agents ... recruits some dark psychological biases, the same ones that you would see with fear of witchcraft, xenophobia, fear of strangers," he said.
Robert-Paul Juster, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and addiction at the Université de Montréal, draws from fight-flight-freeze, the body's built-in response to threat or danger, to help explain what's happening now.
Juster, who also works with the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal, said the population seems to be in a "freeze" response.
"It's extremely stressful to be in a situation of restraint," he said. "That's what we're all dealing with right now as humans. We're restrained in our homes and that's increasing our stress."
Situations that are unpredictable, threaten our survival and in which we have no sense of control "are all going to make us react in a very distressed way, either with hostility, with anger (or) with protection," Juster said.
"And I think this hoarding behaviour is a real example of that. ... But the problem with that is there's an individuality element, where people are really just thinking about themselves."
In fact, Juster called the hoarding a combination of individuality and mass hysteria, the latter generated by people "constantly bombarding each other with news updates," he said. He has seen it in his own entourage.

That's where coping tools come in.
Juster suggests focusing on problem-solving and setting goals.
For example, he said he decided this week to check his emails only certain times of the day and to control his use of social media. Instead, he's focusing on hobbies.
Juster said he loves chess, so he's started reading books on chess. And because he can't go to the gym, he's planning to use his home rowing machine. He recently bought a new vacuum, so he's determined to make use of it.
"We try to sublimate our anxiety and our stress towards other objectives," Juster said. "Everybody can find personalized ways of doing it."
In terms of positive thinking, Juster said he's looking forward to the lessons that will be drawn from different countries' responses to the pandemic and how that will make the health-care system more resilient in the future.
Veissière also suggested focusing on positivity.
"My belief is that most people are cooperating and collaborating," he said. "Most people are waiting in line patiently and they're buying the number of items that they're told they're allowed to buy."
The media could encourage more cooperative behaviour, Veissière added, with stories about those who are not being selfish.
Limiting the passive consumption of negative information online is important, he said, adding that it's possible to do even as people who are isolated use social media to stay connected.
Think about loved ones and friends, Veissière said, and about the quality of interactions when we meet again.
"For many people, this is finally a time to pick up that novel that they didn't finish, or start playing piano again," he said, adding that some people seem to have taken up running during the pandemic.
"Or the sun is out, we're going to be able to start gardening soon. There are just so many things that we didn't have the time to do because we're so busy working all the time."

Full text: The Montreal Gazette is receiving a steady stream of questions from readers about COVID-19. We are doing our best to answer as many as we can. Here's a glimpse into our mailbox.
Q: IKEA in Montreal is still advising employees they are required to show up for work. Not only does this fly in the face of what authorities are advising people, this is bordering on contemptible as far as IKEA's management is concerned. What kind of "corporate citizenship" is this demonstrating?
My daughter works for IKEA. What are we supposed to do when the government is telling people not to congregate and to stay home, and yet employers like IKEA are bullying 23-year-olds into reporting to work even if they are not comfortable doing so?
A: IKEA temporarily closed all its Canadian stores on March 18. However as of Wednesday, the company was still selling its products on IKEA.ca, for either store pickup or home delivery. Delivery service is now only to the front door, as opposed to the room of your choice. Returns and exchanges are suspended for the time being.
In response to questions about its COVID-19 safety protocol and the company's decision to keep the above services going when Quebec has banned non-essential services, IKEA emailed the Gazette on Wednesday evening to say that as of the end of the day it was temporarily suspending its Click & Collect store pickup option nationwide.
The company also said it has incorporated "rigorous cleaning and sanitization in all units and new operating procedures which ensure social distancing principles are followed. These include a recommended distance of six feet between individuals at all times, increased physical space between workspaces ... and providing protective gear for personnel including latex gloves and separation screens."
Q: (Regarding Quebec's list of essential services,) they never talked about auto repairs. I would like to know if we have to close.
A: Gas stations and garages are on the list of essential services( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-quebecs-list-of-essential-services-that-can-remain-open/ ) announced this week by the Quebec government. On another transportation-related note, bicycle repair shops are not on the list of essential services. As spring begins, that leaves many Montrealers in the lurch for their annual tune-up, particularly when people are told that getting out of the house for a little exercise can do the body good.
Q: I am expecting a delivery on Friday of a dryer. That means two delivery guys inside my apartment for about 15 minutes. What are the recommendations on this? Also, if someone is just breathing normally through their nose, or talking, can droplets and virus still spread?
A: Coronavirus is spread most easily( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-room-doctor-answers-questions-about-covid-19/ ) through droplets projected when sneezing or coughing, or when one touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face. Social distancing guidelines should protect you from any droplets emitted through normal breathing or speech. The Quebec government recommends keeping a distance of two metres at all times, which means don't get too close to the delivery people.
Once they are gone, let the area air out, then wash/disinfect any area where they have been or that they have touched, including door handles, taps and the dryer. Quebec guidelines( https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/fichiers/2019/19-210-30FA.pdf ) say that coronavirus can remain on dry surfaces for three hours, and on humid surfaces for up to six days. For washing, soap and water works best. To disinfect, Quebec recommends commercial cleaning products or a solution of one part bleach and nine parts water.
Q: Does the new walk-in testing site at Place des Festivals( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-2000-screened-for-coronavirus-at-place-des-festivals-clinic/ ) test children, or only adults? I called the Montreal COVID-19 hotline this morning and they didn't know.
A: The CIUSS website says the test is available to all people (which one would assume includes children) having travelled outside of Canada, who returned after March 1; or who have exhibited symptoms for less than 14 days, or who have been in one of the public areas targeted by public health officials.
It also says the test is available to all people who have been in close contact with a traveller who has had symptoms including fever, chills, cough or difficulty breathing since returning to Canada in the last 14 days.
Q: I was wondering if there has been anything said by the Quebec government about support for those laid off during the pandemic? Help for small businesses? Etc.
A: People who are laid off can apply for employment insurance. The Quebec government has also announced a Temporary Aid for Workers Program( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-live-updates-public-health-department-heading-to-trudeau-airport/ ), for people who, because of COVID-19, "cannot earn all of their work income and are not eligible for another financial assistance program."
The amount granted to those eligible is $573 per week, for a period of 14 days of isolation. The coverage period can be extended due to health reasons for a period of up to 28 days.
Quebec also launched a $2.5 billion plan to help companies( https://montrealgazette.com/business/quebec-unlocks-2-5-billion-to-help-companies-weather-covid-19-storm/ ) affected by COVID-19, including low-interest loans and loan guarantees of at least $50,000.
On Wednesday, the Canadian government passed an emergency COVID-19 bill( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/government-wins-unanimous-consent-to-quickly-pass-legislation-for-covid-19-help/ ) that includes $2,000 per month in direct support through the Canada Revenue Agency to those who can't work because of COVID-19. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said benefits for workers would come as early as the first week of April.

A: IKEA temporarily closed all its Canadian stores as of Wednesday. However the company is still selling its products on IKEA.ca, for either store pickup or home delivery.
Customers picking up items are requested to respect two metres of social distancing, and no loading assistance is offered. Delivery service is now only to the front door, as opposed to the room of your choice. Returns and exchanges are suspended for the time being.
IKEA's website says it has updated its operating procedures "to ensure the health and safety of our customers, co-workers and contractors," without offering details of what this means for warehouse workers and store employees greeting customers who come to pick up items.
Questions about IKEA's safety protocol were emailed to the company on Wednesday, but no response was received in time for publication.
Q: (Regarding Quebec's list of essential services,) they never talked about auto repairs. I would like to know if we have to close.

'Just try to think: I'm very well in my bed, there is no virus around me'
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda and Health Minister Danielle McCann answered a key question at today's briefing: How do you get a good night's sleep during these stressful times?
Quebec's tally
Note that today's number includes confirmed and probable cases, while previous totals included only confirmed ones.
'Time for determination, solidarity, courage' - Legault
There are 628 COVID-19 cases in Quebec, Premier François Legault announced at his daily briefing.
The previous tally, released Sunday: 219 cases.
Note that today's number includes confirmed and probable cases, while previous totals included only confirmed ones.
As of today, the government says, it will combine confirmed/probable in its daily updates.
Forty-five people are hospitalized, with 20 of them in intensive care.
The death toll remains at four.
Legault also announced that Quebec is ordering all non-essential businesses to close until April 13.
That includes the construction industry and aluminum smelters. Until now, Legault had said these should keep humming to help the economy.
"Quebec will be on hold for three weeks," Legault said. "We are entering a new phase, a critical phase."
Legault said he is asking Quebecers "to stay at home, except to help the vulnerable or to provide essential services."
Grocery stores, pharmacies, the news media and restaurant take-out/delivery were mentioned as essential services. Legault said a list will be published soon.
Those who work from home can continue to do so, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said via Twitter( https://twitter.com/MinFitzgibbon/status/1242158328307953665 ).
The premier also announced a new restriction: people in seniors' residences can now only leave with supervision.
"It's a time to unite, more than ever," Legault said.
Asked if he envisages the Canadian military being deployed in Quebec if police become overloaded, Legault answered: "We're not at all there now."
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda said it's crucial that Quebecers stay at home and avoid getting together with others: "I am not trying to scare people but it's a question of life and death."

Middle-aged face 'very serious complications'
The elderly are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 but middle-aged Canadians also face "very serious complications" if they contract the disease, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said at a press conference today.
Significant complications affect about 15 per cent of middle-aged people with COVID-19, she said.
Two Montreal police officers infected
Two Montreal police officers have been infected with COVID-19, a police department spokesman has confirmed to the Montreal Gazette. Another 100 Montreal officers have been placed in quarantine.
The Montreal police department has more than 6,000 police officers and civilian employees.
20 deaths in Canada
At a press conference with federal ministers this morning, Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, this afternoon said there are now 1,474 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths.
Canada has tested 102,000 people. A growing number of the infected in Canada had not traveled, Tam said.
"Unrelenting" social distancing is required, she said.
To preserve Canada's food supply, the federal government is setting aside $5 billion to help farmers and agriculture companies get through the crisis, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said.
Asked about rumours of a shortage of meat inspectors, Bibeau confirms that there are problems. She said the government is working with provinces to make sure inspections take place. Retired food inspectors are also being contacted, she said.
'The pandemic is accelerating'
It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000, the World Health Organization said at a briefing this morning.
"More than 300,000 cases of #COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) have now been reported to WHO, from almost every country in the ??.
The pandemic is accelerating.
It took 67 days from the 1st reported case to reach the first 100K cases, 11 days for the second 100K & just 4 days for the third 100K"-@DrTedros( https://twitter.com/DrTedros?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/XoBkVnWtLH( https://t.co/XoBkVnWtLH )

'Enough is enough - go home and stay home'
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he's frustrated that many Canadians are ignoring social distancing recommendations are putting others at risk.
"Sadly, as we can see there are some people who feel invincible who continue to go out," Trudeau said at his morning briefing.
"Enough is enough - go home and stay home. This is what we all need to be doing and we're going to make sure it happens."
He said people still going out and gathering in groups are putting at risk elderly relatives, friends with pre-existing conditions, front-line health care workers and people who work in grocery stores.
All Canadians need to follow recommendations, he said.
He said governments will ensure this happens, either via education or "by enforcing the rules if that's needed. Nothing that could help is off the table."
He did not clarify what other measures could be taken but said the federal government has tools at its disposal, including those in the Emergencies Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-4.5/page-1.html ) and the Quarantine Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/q-1.1/index.html ).
No province has formally asked for the federal Emergencies Act to be invoked but the issue will be discussed at tonight's meeting with premiers, Trudeau said. Talks with provinces are necessary because under the Act, the federal government would take over some provincial powers.
Trudeau also said:
Canada will spend $192 million on developing and producing vaccines for the novel coronavirus.
He says being prepared to mass-produce a vaccine, no matter who creates it, will be essential for suppressing COVID-19 in Canada.
The Canadian Olympic Committee made the right call in announcing that Canada's athletes will not go to the Tokyo Olympics this year. He said it's difficult for athletes, coaches, staff and fans, but it was a prudent move.
He will speak to premiers tonight about the possibility of closing provincial boundaries.
The federal government will launch ads about the importance of social distancing.
78 new cases in Ontario
Ontario is reporting 78 new COVID-19 cases today, bringing the provincial total to 503, The Canadian Press is reporting. It's the largest increase in a day so far.
The total includes six deaths and eight cases that have fully resolved. At least six of the new cases are hospitalized.
Montreal police field 200 calls
Since the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings was issued Saturday, Montreal police have received about 200 calls from citizens reporting that some people are defying the decree, Commander André Durocher told the Montreal Gazette this morning.
"We are hoping that the fact the media is talking about it will get the message across (that people need to stay home,)" he said.
"We don't want to create (an atmosphere) where you are snitching on your neighbour because two people are walking. We are hoping people will show common sense. We want people to be civilized and not insult each other."

The city of Montreal says it's "modifying its parking regulations for all boroughs, to facilitate travel and ensure the safety of all."
Key points:
The date of entry into force of street-cleaning no-parking rules, originally scheduled for April 1, is postponed to May 1.
Expired resident-parking vignettes are considered valid until further notice.
Motorists still have to pay at parking meters according to posted schedules but city parking enforcing officers are focusing on "offenses that have the greatest impact on public safety."
What is essential travel?
Transat lays off 3,600 employees
With air travel grinding to a halt, Transat says it has temporarily laid off about 70 per cent of its workforce in Canada, about 3,600 people, including all flight crew personnel.
The company says the final Air Transat flight prior to the full suspension of its operations is scheduled for April 1.

Vancouver planning stiff fines
From The Canadian Press:
Anyone who ignores Vancouver's state of local emergency declaration could receive a ticket and stiff fine if city council approves a recommendation supporting enhanced powers to enforce it.
Council votes later today on the recommendation that would immediately impose fines of up to $50,000 on businesses violating the declaration.
If approved, bylaw officers would also have the power to hand out $1,000 tickets to anyone not honouring social distancing requirements to stay at least one metre apart.
Vancouver declared a state of local emergency last week and did not include violation penalties in anticipation of compliance.

Middle-aged face 'very serious complications'
The elderly are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 but middle-aged Canadians also face "very serious complications" if they contract the disease, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said at a press conference today.
Significant complications affect about 15 per cent of middle-aged people with COVID-19, she said.
Two Montreal police officers infected
Two Montreal police officers have been infected with COVID-19, a police department spokesman has confirmed to the Montreal Gazette. Another 100 Montreal officers have been placed in quarantine.
The Montreal police department has more than 6,000 police officers and civilian employees.
20 deaths in Canada
At a press conference with federal ministers this morning, Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, this afternoon said there are now 1,474 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths.
Canada has tested 102,000 people. A growing number of the infected in Canada had not traveled, Tam said.
"Unrelenting" social distancing is required, she said.
To preserve Canada's food supply, the federal government is setting aside $5 billion to help farmers and agriculture companies get through the crisis, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said.
Asked about rumours of a shortage of meat inspectors, Bibeau confirms that there are problems. She said the government is working with provinces to make sure inspections take place. Retired food inspectors are also being contacted, she said.
'The pandemic is accelerating'
It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000, the World Health Organization said at a briefing this morning.
"More than 300,000 cases of #COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) have now been reported to WHO, from almost every country in the ??.
The pandemic is accelerating.

'Enough is enough - go home and stay home'
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he's frustrated that many Canadians are ignoring social distancing recommendations are putting others at risk.
"Sadly, as we can see there are some people who feel invincible who continue to go out," Trudeau said at his morning briefing.
"Enough is enough - go home and stay home. This is what we all need to be doing and we're going to make sure it happens."
He said people still going out and gathering in groups are putting at risk elderly relatives, friends with pre-existing conditions, front-line health care workers and people who work in grocery stores.
All Canadians need to follow recommendations, he said.
He said governments will ensure this happens, either via education or "by enforcing the rules if that's needed. Nothing that could help is off the table."
He did not clarify what other measures could be taken but said the federal government has tools at its disposal, including those in the Emergencies Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-4.5/page-1.html ) and the Quarantine Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/q-1.1/index.html ).
No province has formally asked for the federal Emergencies Act to be invoked but the issue will be discussed at tonight's meeting with premiers, Trudeau said. Talks with provinces are necessary because under the Act, the federal government would take over some provincial powers.
Trudeau also said:
Canada will spend $192 million on developing and producing vaccines for the novel coronavirus.
He says being prepared to mass-produce a vaccine, no matter who creates it, will be essential for suppressing COVID-19 in Canada.
The Canadian Olympic Committee made the right call in announcing that Canada's athletes will not go to the Tokyo Olympics this year. He said it's difficult for athletes, coaches, staff and fans, but it was a prudent move.
He will speak to premiers tonight about the possibility of closing provincial boundaries.
The federal government will launch ads about the importance of social distancing.
78 new cases in Ontario
Ontario is reporting 78 new COVID-19 cases today, bringing the provincial total to 503, The Canadian Press is reporting. It's the largest increase in a day so far.
The total includes six deaths and eight cases that have fully resolved. At least six of the new cases are hospitalized.
Montreal police field 200 calls
Since the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings was issued Saturday, Montreal police have received about 200 calls from citizens reporting that some people are defying the decree, Commander André Durocher told the Montreal Gazette this morning.
"We are hoping that the fact the media is talking about it will get the message across (that people need to stay home,)" he said.
"We don't want to create (an atmosphere) where you are snitching on your neighbour because two people are walking. We are hoping people will show common sense. We want people to be civilized and not insult each other."

Middle-aged face 'very serious complications'
The elderly are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 but middle-aged Canadians also face "very serious complications" if they contract the disease, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said at a press conference today.
Significant complications affect about 15 per cent of middle-aged people with COVID-19, she said.
Two Montreal police officers infected
Two Montreal police officers have been infected with COVID-19, a police department spokesman has confirmed to the Montreal Gazette. Another 100 Montreal officers have been placed in quarantine.
The Montreal police department has more than 6,000 police officers and civilian employees.
20 deaths in Canada
At a press conference with federal ministers this morning, Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, this afternoon said there are now 1,474 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths.
Canada has tested 102,000 people. A growing number of the infected in Canada had not traveled, Tam said.
"Unrelenting" social distancing is required, she said.
To preserve Canada's food supply, the federal government is setting aside $5 billion to help farmers and agriculture companies get through the crisis, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said.
Asked about rumours of a shortage of meat inspectors, Bibeau confirms that there are problems. She said the government is working with provinces to make sure inspections take place. Retired food inspectors are also being contacted, she said.
'The pandemic is accelerating'
It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000, the World Health Organization said at a briefing this morning.
"More than 300,000 cases of #COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) have now been reported to WHO, from almost every country in the ??.
The pandemic is accelerating.
It took 67 days from the 1st reported case to reach the first 100K cases, 11 days for the second 100K & just 4 days for the third 100K"-@DrTedros( https://twitter.com/DrTedros?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/XoBkVnWtLH( https://t.co/XoBkVnWtLH )

'Enough is enough - go home and stay home'
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he's frustrated that many Canadians are ignoring social distancing recommendations are putting others at risk.
"Sadly, as we can see there are some people who feel invincible who continue to go out," Trudeau said at his morning briefing.
"Enough is enough - go home and stay home. This is what we all need to be doing and we're going to make sure it happens."
He said people still going out and gathering in groups are putting at risk elderly relatives, friends with pre-existing conditions, front-line health care workers and people who work in grocery stores.
All Canadians need to follow recommendations, he said.
He said governments will ensure this happens, either via education or "by enforcing the rules if that's needed. Nothing that could help is off the table."
He did not clarify what other measures could be taken but said the federal government has tools at its disposal, including those in the Emergencies Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-4.5/page-1.html ) and the Quarantine Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/q-1.1/index.html ).
No province has formally asked for the federal Emergencies Act to be invoked but the issue will be discussed at tonight's meeting with premiers, Trudeau said. Talks with provinces are necessary because under the Act, the federal government would take over some provincial powers.
Trudeau also said:
Canada will spend $192 million on developing and producing vaccines for the novel coronavirus.
He says being prepared to mass-produce a vaccine, no matter who creates it, will be essential for suppressing COVID-19 in Canada.
The Canadian Olympic Committee made the right call in announcing that Canada's athletes will not go to the Tokyo Olympics this year. He said it's difficult for athletes, coaches, staff and fans, but it was a prudent move.
He will speak to premiers tonight about the possibility of closing provincial boundaries.
The federal government will launch ads about the importance of social distancing.
78 new cases in Ontario
Ontario is reporting 78 new COVID-19 cases today, bringing the provincial total to 503, The Canadian Press is reporting. It's the largest increase in a day so far.
The total includes six deaths and eight cases that have fully resolved. At least six of the new cases are hospitalized.
Montreal police field 200 calls
Since the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings was issued Saturday, Montreal police have received about 200 calls from citizens reporting that some people are defying the decree, Commander André Durocher told the Montreal Gazette this morning.
"We are hoping that the fact the media is talking about it will get the message across (that people need to stay home,)" he said.
"We don't want to create (an atmosphere) where you are snitching on your neighbour because two people are walking. We are hoping people will show common sense. We want people to be civilized and not insult each other."

Montreal loosens parking rules
The city of Montreal says it's "modifying its parking regulations for all boroughs, to facilitate travel and ensure the safety of all."
Key points:
The date of entry into force of street-cleaning no-parking rules, originally scheduled for April 1, is postponed to May 1.
Expired resident-parking vignettes are considered valid until further notice.
Motorists still have to pay at parking meters according to posted schedules but city parking enforcing officers are focusing on "offenses that have the greatest impact on public safety."
What is essential travel?
Transat lays off 3,600 employees
With air travel grinding to a halt, Transat says it has temporarily laid off about 70 per cent of its workforce in Canada, about 3,600 people, including all flight crew personnel.
The company says the final Air Transat flight prior to the full suspension of its operations is scheduled for April 1.

Vancouver planning stiff fines
From The Canadian Press:
Anyone who ignores Vancouver's state of local emergency declaration could receive a ticket and stiff fine if city council approves a recommendation supporting enhanced powers to enforce it.
Council votes later today on the recommendation that would immediately impose fines of up to $50,000 on businesses violating the declaration.
If approved, bylaw officers would also have the power to hand out $1,000 tickets to anyone not honouring social distancing requirements to stay at least one metre apart.
Vancouver declared a state of local emergency last week and did not include violation penalties in anticipation of compliance.

Coronavirus: Little chance Quebec schools will open at end of March

Full text: QUEBEC - Even if the number of new confirmed COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-live-updates-new-possible-exposure-points-reported-in-montreal ) cases is growing at a slower rate than the day before, there is little chance Quebec schools will open by the end of March, Premier François Legault said Friday.
Moving to deal with a new threat on his flank - tongue wagging by panicky people - Legault took the time to deny wild rumours that as pockets of COVID-19 emerge in cities the government will use the extraordinary powers at its disposal to order a confinement.
"I don't want false rumours," Legault told reporters at his daily briefing on the evolution of the coronavirus. "Closing down the Eastern Townships is out of the question. Closing down Montreal is out of the question. These are all false rumours and it's important to say it."
Legault made the comments even as the mayor of Côte-St-Luc( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cavendish-mall-closed-as-cote-st-luc-grapples-with-coronavirus-exposure-points ), Mitchel Brownstein, asked Quebec for the authorization to quarantine his city in the wake of news that two points of exposure had been discovered.
Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, also tried to calm the waters, noting pockets of the virus in individual centres may make headlines but they were expected and do not necessarily represent a province-wide threat.
On Friday, it was announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quebec rose by 18 from the day before to 139. One person in Quebec has died and 10 are in hospital, including six in intensive care.
Results are pending for another 2,400 tests. More than 7,700 tests have been negative.
#COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) - Au Québec, en date du 20 mars 13h, la situation est la suivante:
139 cas confirmés
1 décès
1 personne guérie
2403 personnes sous investigation
7666 analyses négatives
Pour connaître le nombre de cas confirmés par régions : https://t.co/OaNGSH8BSO( https://t.co/OaNGSH8BSO ) #santéqc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/sant%C3%A9qc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
- Santé Québec (@sante_qc) March 20, 2020( https://twitter.com/sante_qc/status/1241048497836736515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Arruda noted that the 18-case increase is less than the 27 new cases announced Thursday.
"We're noticing the number is going up, but a little bit slower than it was going up even if we have increased the number of tests," Arruda said, adding he does not want to get overly optimistic. "The situation is under control."
Quebec, nevertheless, continues to prepare for the worst with Health Minister Danielle McCann announcing the province has freed up 4,000 hospital beds by delaying things like elective surgery. McCann has also been overwhelmed with applications from 17,000 retired health-care workers prepared to return to work if needed.
Legault said Quebec has enough medical equipment for the short term, but may call on industries to help produce things like masks. He wouldn't speculate when asked again what percentage of Quebec's population could end up infected.
"The lucky party for us is that we started acting (on the threat) sooner than others so that should allow us to have a flatter curve (in terms of cases)," Legault said. "But listen, you can talk to five different experts and get five different sets of numbers."
As for the re-opening of Quebec's schools, Legault said he is being realistic.
"I think students in the CEGEP and university system will be able to complete their school year this summer thanks to remote teaching methods," Legault said. "We are looking at different scenarios on schools, but it's unlikely that they will be back by the end of March. We are in the process of checking whether it will be possible by early May."
The original scenario was to re-open Quebec's elementary and high schools by March 30.
Despite calls by some in the construction industry to shut down sites because it is difficult to impose social distancing rules and hand washing, Legault said the sector is too essential to the economy( https://montrealgazette.com/business/quebec-unlocks-2-5-billion-to-help-companies-weather-covid-19-storm ) to allow that. Instead, Labour Minister Jean Boulet is working on plans to install wash stations on sites and larger trailers so the workers can respect social distancing on their breaks and lunch hours.
"It's important to protect our construction workers," Legault said. "We are going to need them. It is a critical part of the economy."
There will be work for them.
Legault said Quebec is now working on plans to move up spending on public infrastructure projects - from roads to schools - to replace lost jobs as the private sector puts building projects on hold. Quebec's construction sector employs 260,000 people.
For his daily thank you ritual at his news conference, Legault highlighted the important work the media( https://montrealgazette.com/ ) is doing during the crisis in getting essential information out to Quebecers.
"We need you to inform the population," Legault said while sitting in front of 10 reporters who have to respect the distancing rules even at the news conference. "It is essential work."
Legault also reached out specifically to the English-speaking community, adding a section in English to his opening remarks for the first time since the crisis started.
"I want to say a few words in English," Legault said. "The situation remains under control. Every action we take to limit physical contact will save lives. If you feel sick, stay home. We must continue our effort and we'll get through this together."
To get the message about staying home out better to people over 70, Legault announced entertainer Dominique "Dodo," Michel( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Michel ) and respected retired journalist Bernard Derome( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dTjqjKFogU ) have recorded telephone messages to be played to older Quebecers.
Afin de rassurer les personnes aînées & leur rappeler l'importance de respecter les consignes de santé publique, des appels automatisés, enregistrés par Bernard Derome & Dominique Michel, seront effectués à compter de 18 h.
Voici le message de "Dodo" : https://t.co/bMm4euPwT7( https://t.co/bMm4euPwT7 )

Legault's handling of the crisis is earning him praise on many fronts. On Wednesday, a new Léger poll( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/575143/le-quebec-uni-derriere-le-gouvernement ) conducted for Le Devoir revealed 85 per cent of the population, regardless of age or language, support his government's handling of the crisis.
Legault confirmed he and deputy premier Geneviève Guilbault are keeping their distance to ensure if Legault falls ill - as many politicians have - there is someone to replace him. The 62-year-old Legault has not taken a day off since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in Quebec and is working out of the provincial capital even though his home is in Outremont.
"I'm in good shape and I don't see any problems," Legault said answering a question from the Montreal Gazette on how he is holding up. "I think it's important to have a backup, but I feel well."
Legault added that rules limiting travel from one region to the next apply to him as well.
"I know that is the birthday of one of my boys Sunday," Legault said. "Unfortunately, I won't be able to see him. He's in Montreal, I'm in Quebec City, but that's life."
Legault's son, Victor, turns 26 this weekend.

Full text: The news sent Dennise Ann Del Mundo reeling: She had less than a week to gather her things, leave Concordia University's downtown dormitory and find a new place to live.
It isn't like Del Mundo could just move back in with her parents - they live 10,000 kilometres away in Qatar. So the marketing major scrambled and managed to find accommodations until she can move into a new apartment next month.
Concordia is closing its Grey Nuns residence Sunday in order to minimize students' risk of exposure to the coronavirus( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ). They announced the decision Wednesday afternoon and, according to Del Mundo, it sent a wave of panic through the dormitory, which houses 600 students, many of whom came to Montreal from overseas.
"I had already made arrangements to move out but some people aren't that lucky," said Del Mundo. "It's making a lot of us anxious."
With Montreal's rental vacancy rate below two per cent and most leases not expiring until June 30, this puts international students in a bind. Many come from places in Europe that have been hit hard by the pandemic and, given the risks travel poses, Del Mundo says they may be safer in Quebec.
There are 121 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Quebec and one coronavirus-related death( https://msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/maladies-infectieuses/coronavirus-2019-ncov/#situation-au-quebec ) since the pandemic began. Experts say that number will continue to spike before the effects of social distancing and quarantine are felt.
Dennise Ann Del Mundo outside Grey Nuns on Thursday. She's grateful that she at least has made plans. Fellow students are not so lucky.
Del Mundo says the dormitory has been emptying out since Concordia cancelled classes last Friday in response to government measures to contain the pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/coronavirus-quebec-closes-elementary-high-schools-cegeps-and-universities-for-two-weeks ). With students living, sleeping and eating in close quarters, she says the dorm can be something of a Petri dish at times.
"Even with your basic flu, you see a few people that have it one day and the next it triples," said Del Mundo.
In a statement sent to the Montreal Gazette, Concordia spokesperson Vannina Maestracci said( https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/offices/cco/covid-19/2020/03/18/students-in-resdidence-to-move-out-by-march-22.html ) the university will make exceptions for students in "exceptional circumstances." She called the decision to close Grey Nuns a "precautionary measure to reduce the spread and impact of the virus and to assist national and local efforts to flatten the curve."
The university said it will refund students the balance of their rent and meal plans.
After being contacted by students facing eviction, university president Graham said Thursday that not a single student will be left behind.
"Concordia will support any student who has nowhere to go to the best of our abilities by providing them with accommodation, meals and other services until conditions improve," Graham said.
There are about 100 students remaining at Grey Nuns, according to Del Mundo.
"It's an old, creepy building that used to be a convent so it feels a little bit haunted," she said.
As they await the Sunday deadlines, staff at Grey Nuns residence are dealing with and tightening quarantine measures. Cafeteria visits are staggered, students eat on paper plates using disposable utensils and sit alone at tables. A major common space in the complex has been shut down.
McGill University, for its part, has decided to keep its dormitories open but is "strongly encouraging" residents to return home, according to spokesperson Cynthia Lee. For those who remain, measures are in place to ensure they adhere to strict social distancing protocols.
Both Concordia and McGill won't require students to be physically on campus for the remainder of the winter 2020 term.
At Université du Québec à Montréal, administrators met Thursday to discuss how students can finish their term without being penalized by the pandemic( http://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2020/mesures-interimaires-encadrement-activites-academiques ). Deadlines for any papers, projects or theses due have been put on hold until at least Friday at UQAM.
The office of international students at Université de Montréal has been working with students since Tuesday on deciding - on a case-by-case basis - whether they should return home for the rest of the semester. Classes will resume online beginning Saturday.
The school has a web page (urgence.umontreal.ca) set up to exclusively deal with COVID-19 news.( https://urgence.umontreal.ca/ )

Full text: Emergency room overcrowding across Quebec has plunged as people stay home in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/covid-19-first-death-reported-in-quebec ) and as hospitals cancel non-essential appointments and reduce other clinical activities.
It's perhaps the only silver lining in a public health system that is struggling to prevent the spread of the rogue coronavirus and that is bracing for an influx of COVID-19 patients.
On Thursday morning, the Lakeshore General Hospital was reporting an ER occupancy rate of 65 per cent( https://www.indexsante.ca/urgences/ ), compared with rates routinely soaring above 200 per cent( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-are-urged-to-avoid-citys-ers ) in January. It was the same story at the Jewish General Hospital, which reported that it was filled to less than 50 per cent of its capacity.
"ERs like mine have very very low counts," a nurse at the Lakeshore in Pointe-Claire told the Montreal Gazette.
"The reason is simple: people are scared to go out, much less, to the ER."
However, the nurse - who agreed to comment on the ER stats on condition of anonymity - warned that this might very well turn out to be like the calm before the storm.
"Because primary care is so poor in this city, this will only go on for a little while longer. Then, whoever will no longer be able to put off the abdominal pain, cough, minor foot infection or whatever because he/she will be too sick, into the ER they will come, likely in droves.
"Combined with those patients will be all the people who were not tested for COVID-19 who should have been," the nurse added. "Many will be positive because the virus is (likely) spreading within the community."
The nurse expressed concern about the capacity of ERs to treat patients who might be suffering from the most severe complications of COVID-19.
"These patients will have pneumonia-like symptoms and some will be in respiratory distress. The combination of both sets of patients - those with ailments other than COVID-19 who are too scared to come in now and those sick with the virus - will put ERs into a terrible situation. Forced overtime will be instituted, many nurses will be sick with the virus and all the flaws in our already fragile health-care system will be exposed.
"I do hope I am wrong but I just cannot see this going any other way," the nurse concluded.
Hospitals like the Jewish General are preparing for a potential wave of COVID-19 patients by cutting back on some clinical activities. The Côte-des-Neiges( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jewish-general-hospital-braces-for-a-wave-of-covid-19-cases ) as one of four COVID-19 treatment centres in the province.
"Non-essential outpatient appointments at the JGH are being postponed," confirmed Glenn J. Nashen, a spokesperson for the centre-west health authority in charge of the Jewish General.
"Calls are being made by staff to advise those patients affected by these postponements. Patients needing ongoing care and those with emergencies are being seen."
Across Montreal, overall ER occupancy stood at 70 per cent early Thursday morning. In contrast, ER overcrowding surged in Montreal's two psychiatric hospitals, the Douglas and the Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal, which both reported rates of 150 per cent.

Coronavirus: seniors told to stay home, shun visitors

Full text: Nelly Bravo, 69 and her husband Pedro Donoso, 75, said as members of the age group most at risk to be severely affected by the new coronavirus, they were already limiting their time out of the house.
"But we have to eat too," said Bravo, who was walking on Grand Blvd. in Notre-dame-de-Grâce and clutching a white plastic shopping bag from nearby Marché Ahkavan supermarket. "We're not panicking, but we are staying safe."
The couple was reacting to news on Saturday that Quebec Premier François Legault recommended anyone 70 years or older to stay home in order to avoid being infected by the virus.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/covid-19-people-70-and-over-should-stay-home-visits-banned-to-hospitals-seniors-residences )
The recommendation came as the province also banned visits in hospitals, long-term care centres and seniors residences.

COVID-19: People 70 and over should stay home, visits banned to hospitals, seniors' residences( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/covid-19-people-70-and-over-should-stay-home-visits-banned-to-hospitals-seniors-residences )
COVID-19 live updates( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-live-updates-quebec-to-provide-coronavirus-update-at-1-p-m )
The latest in our coronavirus coverage( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus )
Bravo and Donoso thought Legault's order was a good idea, but they worry about seniors who rely on visitors to get what they need to survive in their homes.
"We have to organize for senior citizens to make sure they have what they need," Bravo said. "Our neighbour is 95 years old. Who will bring her food?"
Dorval resident Tanya Gitto echoed that concern.
"Is there any plan by the government or local municipalities to check on seniors who may be at home with no support? I remember during the great ice storm in Quebec, the local police in Dorval were going door to door of the homes of seniors to make sure they were okay and had support," she wrote in an email. "I am almost 74 but I have support system in place. I worry about seniors who are alone."
Maureen Sullivan and her husband, Bruce Prentice normally walk their dog, Millie, a few times a day. They are seen at their home in Montreal, on Saturday, March 14, 2020.
Bruce Prentice, another N.D.G. resident said he believes the new measures announced Saturday could be an "exaggeration."
"If you're in frail health, it's probably a very good idea," said Prentice, 83, holding a leash attached to a medium-sized golden-haired mixed breed named Millie. "I don't think I am, so here I am walking my dog."
Prentice said he believes all the measure taken so far seem sensible, and he hopes they will prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
"The load on the healthcare system could peak if we don't take precautions," he said, adding that he isn't concerned that he will contract the virus. "I volunteer (in the Palliative Care unit of St-Mary's hospital), so I'm used to washing my hands and I do it a lot. I try to keep my distance from illness, take my vitamins and try to get a good night's sleep. We try to do what we can to keep healthy and that includes walking the dog."
Also in the area, Anne Jasmin, 78, said she was relieved to hear that nursing homes were barring visitors, but said that means she won't be able to see her 85-year-old husband, who is being cared for at the Waldorf residence for senior citizens on Côte-St-Luc Rd.
"I can't go see my husband anymore, but I think it's a good thing that visitors are barred, because these people are fragile," she said. "I think the measures are good, but I'm healthy. I don't catch anything. There are lots of people who are 70 years old who are very active. It's not old anymore, they should have made it at 80 years old."
She said the government order could make a dent in her social life.
"I have a bridge club, and that's my only outing of the week, so I hope it's not cancelled," she added. "If it is, I'll deal with it.
"I have kids who tell me they're not going to come see me because they're afraid that they are carrying it," she said. "My grandchildren also aren't coming over. That's hard. But we speak on the phone."
Tina Mintz isn't a senior citizen, but the 59-year-old with diabetes falls into another category of people the government recommends stay home: those with compromised immune systems and chronic illnesses.
Mintz, who was walking home from the grocery store with her guide dog Keanna, said the coronavirus has made her worried.
"Because I know it could hit me much harder than a lot of other people," Mintz said. "The regular flu hospitalized me once, so I am concerned, absolutely."
She said she has been limiting her outings, but still goes to work, and takes the bus and métro several times a week to travel to courses that she teaches throughout the city. Mintz gives giving sensitivity training classes to people in the tourism industry for a company called Kéroul.( http://www.keroul.qc.ca/en/home.html ) She said she keeps hand sanitizer and uses it often when she takes transit.
"I go to work, but the rest of the time, I'm a home body, so I got all my medicine and groceries so that tomorrow I can stay put," Mintz said.

Full text: Why is this man always smiling?
He spends much of his days and nights often getting peppered by the press about slow snow removal and slippery streets and sidewalks sometimes perceived to be less pristine than bike paths. Not to mention criticism about rampant street construction, broken water pipes, mobility or lack thereof, recycling, composting and, natch, the ever-ongoing Mountain road imbroglio.
Such is the life of city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin. He is on the front line - some might even say the firing line - in seeking to explain city-hall decisions that some find confounding.
Sabourin awakes around 4:30 a.m. to see what's up or down in the city. He can often be heard on radio at 6 a.m. and then on the tube throughout the day. He can be counted on to send text messages to media up until late at night. In short, he's always available.
This is a job that could give most ulcers. Not Sabourin. He relishes it all. He's not just a glass-half-full fellow - his mug overflows. I suspect he may even whistle while he works.
"There's no stress here for me. I honestly love what I do, and so I remain positive all the time," says the ever-affable Sabourin, 47, who became the city's spokesperson three years ago.
"I'm confident because I feel I have the information to understand the situation and make citizens more aware of the challenges we face. And they are more willing to accept the situation, even if it's difficult. They understand there's no way we can get rid of two-metre-high snowbanks in just a few days."
The stats appear to support Sabourin's assertion. Despite frequent media outrage over these issues - I plead guilty here( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-montrealers-are-slip-slidin-away-on-icy-sidewalks ) - citizen complaints have dropped. Between Nov. 1 and Feb. 10, the city received 397 from the 19 boroughs. That's down considerably from last year's 707 complaints over the same period.
Sabourin is taking me and Montreal Gazette photographer Allen McInnis on a drive through the city to check out key operational posts on the snow-battle front.
Since Feb. 6, Montreal has received about 60 centimetres of snow and, as of Sunday, the cleanup was 95 per cent completed. Sabourin estimates the job will be finished by Monday - unless another storm strikes.
But even on a relatively calm day, Sabourin is having to deal with complaints from LaSalle residents about unplowed sidewalks and from irate city motorists who've been issued tickets on streets after they've been cleaned, but with the No Parking signs still erroneously in place.
In the first instance, the problem relates to massive amounts of snow removed from homes and driveways, thus requiring heavier artillery to clear sidewalks. And while sympathetic to the plight of wrongly ticketed motorists, Sabourin notes this is more a police issue.
Then there's the reality of some boroughs being faster than others in removal operations.
"It's like we're running a marathon here. It doesn't always matter who is fastest, but more that we all get to the finish line in good time. Often, we have to work on steeper hills first, as is the case in the Ville-Marie borough. In Île-Bizard, it's fast, because they don't have to transport the snow. They can blow it on the side. But in Côte-des-Neiges, they have to load the snow at night, because there's so much traffic during the day and they're so far away from the land dump sites.
"What has to be considered is the geographic situation of each borough in relation to the dump sites and the density of the population. Each borough has to figure out the best strategy."
Sabourin disputes a conspiracy theory about bike paths receiving priority treatment.
"The point is we use different tools and machinery for the streets, sidewalks and bike paths. They all start working around the same time but there's certainly no bike-path priority. We try to do sidewalks first to ensure pedestrian safety. We realize it's not perfect, but we are trying."
The city is a network of 10,000 kilometres, 6,000 of which are sidewalks and only 700 of which are bike paths.
"That's the equivalent of the distance between Montreal and James Bay," Sabourin says. "That's our challenge, and clearing it is like a military operation."
That would make executive committee member and Verdun mayor Jean-François Parenteau the general.
Over 3,000 workers are involved in this operation. The cost is equally enormous, about $1 million per every cleared centimetre of snowfall, according to Sabourin. While we've already received close to the seasonal average of 190 centimetres, only 120 centimetres has had to be cleared away. The rest has melted on its own.
The snow-removal budget this winter is about $180 million, but should we get blasted again, there's still plenty of capacity left to accommodate it at the city's 12 land and 16 sewer dump sites, which together can handle up to 18 million cubic metres of snow.
A contracted dump truck operator unloads into the sewer system at one of the approved sewer dumps in Montreal on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2020. The sewer dump is located under the Jacques Cartier Bridge and feeds in to one of the largest sewers in the city, which transports the melts snow to the water-filtration plant in east-end Montreal.
On the subject of sewer sites, we visit one under the Jacques-Cartier Bridge. During the height of snow-removal operations, 100 trucks an hour, 24/7, drop off their loads here.
Sabourin explains that the sewer sites save a lot of time, especially in the downtown area, where trucks don't have to haul snow at land sites farther away. He also is quick to point out that the dumped snow goes through a water treatment process before being moved into the St-Lawrence River.
"In the old days, the snow, which can contain salt and grease, went straight into the river, without regard to the environment," Sabourin says.
We also visit "command central," a small office in an Old Montreal highrise. Staff here monitors road conditions on 550 closed-circuit cameras throughout the city. Based on their surveillance, they are able to direct crews from affected boroughs to trouble spots. They also control traffic lights, in case of emergencies.
"The worst scenario is freezing rain and ice pellets, especially in hilly areas," Sabourin says.
Adds staffer Alain Dupuis: "We see everything that goes on in the city here, and some of it can be pretty crazy. But the key is not to panic."
That appears to be the prerequisite for a job here.
"I love the snow. It's like a winter wonderland for me here. That explains why I'm so positive," Sabourin says. "There's little more beautiful a sight than watching one of our machines at a land site blowing snow 140 feet in the air at sunrise."
Such a romantic. But surely there must be a downside to the job.
"What's Philippe doing between the tempests? Why, he's dealing with the potholes," Sabourin says with a sigh.

Full text: Here's what happened while the Habs lost - again( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-7dad ).
Montreal police are seeking possible victims of a man arrested for allegedly pressuring girls to send him explicit photos( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-seek-possible-victims-in-sexual-exploitation-case ). The SPVM's sexual exploitation unit arrested Marc-Antoine Corbeil, 23, on Jan. 22. Police believe Corbeil contacted girls and women on social media posing as a 14-year-old girl. He did not meet with any of his alleged victims. The suspect used the pseudonyms mégane.dupuis and megane.lalonde to contact his alleged victims and persuade them to send photos and videos. If they refused to send more, he would allegedly threaten to send the ones he already had to all their social media contacts. Police are asking anyone who may be a victim of this crime to call 911 or go to a local police station to make a report.
The association representing Quebec's English school boards is considering a legal challenge to Bill 40( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bill-40-english-school-boards-considering-a-legal-challenge ). Passed on Saturday, Bill 40 replaces school boards with service centres. The government is allowing some members of the English service centre boards to be elected in order to fulfill the requirement in the Canadian Constitution that minority official language communities retain control of their school systems. But the Quebec English School Boards Association isn't convinced the new law fulfils those constitutional requirements. "There are a number of articles in the bill that give the minister powers to change various elements in cabinet rather than through new legislation," QESBA vice-president Noel Burke told the Montreal Gazette. "In particular, who qualifies as a candidate and who qualifies as an elector is a critical issue for us with respect to Article 23 of the Constitution."
A foam spill wreaked bubbly, bubbly havoc at Manassas Regional Airport in Virginia. Officials said( https://www.facebook.com/cityofmanassas/posts/2713285095404718?__tn__=-R ) a malfunctioning fire suppression system had caused a hangar to fill with foam, which then spilled out onto an access road. It looked like the combination of a bubble bath and snow storm. Anyhow, the road had to be closed while all the foam was cleared.

City crews snowed under with surprise 15 cm dump; 'Our crews got caught in traffic just like everyone else,'city spokesperson says

Full text: Geneviève Polese has lived in Montreal her whole life, but every time there's a large snowfall she sees it through the eyes of a newcomer.
Polese is a project coordinator at Bienvenue à N.D.G., a welcome centre for new immigrants. The immigrants she works with always marvel at the snow the first time they experience a major storm, she said.
"The first thing is amazement that something is falling from the sky and it's just staying around," Polese said. "The second question is what to do with it. Where does it go? It's not rain, it's not mud. How do people function?" Veteran Montrealers were perhaps not as happy to see the extra surprise snow that greeted them Monday morning. About 15 centimetres fell in the early hours of the day, creating havoc on roads and sidewalks. The STM's bus network was significantly delayed and traffic chaos was in evidence on local roads and highways, making for a rougher-than-normal morning commute.
"It was a surprise for us," city spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said. "We were expecting five centimetres, but we got three times that amount."
He said the city's crews were hampered because some were already out loading snow from Friday's storm and others were on break after working their maximum of 70 hours, which didn't leave many to plow and salt roads and sidewalks.
"The other problem was that the most intense snow came during rush hour and, of course, our crews got caught in traffic just like everyone else," Sabourin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged that the unexpectedly heavy snowfall could slow snow-clearing operations.
"It was going very well," she said with a laugh. "Obviously, we will remove it."
Sabourin said the snow-clearing operation that was forecast to end Friday will now probably last until the beginning of next week, because crews have to return to the streets where snow was already removed. He urged Montrealers to be patient with city crews, to respect no-parking signs and not to park in such a way as to block emergency vehicles.
The city's snow-clearing website (montreal.ca/deneigement) lists areas where people can park for free overnight during a snow-clearing operation.
Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said the snowfall Monday morning defied predictions, as the system intensified quickly overnight. He said a weather warning was issued, but it came late because 15 centimetres is the minimum amount needed to trigger a warning.
Polese said immigrants are often surprised that people continue to go about their daily lives during snowstorms.
"We get a lot of calls from people saying, 'I'm not going to come in for the French class because it's snowing,'but we still function."
Walking around N.D.G., Tunisian immigrant Latifa Haouesh said she was impressed with how well the city continues to run after a major snowfall.
"Public transit continues, and schools are still running," said Haouesh, who moved to Montreal with her family about a year ago. "The city continues to run. It's very well organized."
Haouesh said she wasn't sure about winter when she moved last year, but now she takes it all in stride.
"When we came last year, we just caught the end of winter and it was very icy. It was terrible," she said. "When it's like this and there's no ice, it's perfect. It's amazing.
"This is, 'Wow!'This is impressive."
Legault said more snow is expected on Thursday, with up to 10 centimetres falling in the afternoon and overnight. The weekend is expected to be frigid, with a low of -20 C on Saturday morning.

Full text: Geneviève Polese has lived in Montreal her whole life, but every time there's a large snowfall she sees it through the eyes of a newcomer.
Polese is a project coordinator at Bienvenue à N.D.G., a welcome centre for new immigrants. The immigrants she works with always marvel at the snow the first time they experience a major storm, she said.
"The first thing is amazement that something is falling from the sky and it's just staying around," Polese said. "The second question is what to do with it. Where does it go? It's not rain, it's not mud. How do people function?"
Veteran Montrealers were perhaps not as happy to see the extra surprise snow that greeted them Monday morning. About 15 centimetres fell in the early hours of the day, creating havoc on roads and sidewalks. The STM's bus network was significantly delayed and traffic chaos was in evidence on local roads and highways, making for a rougher-than-normal morning commute( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-takes-all-with-another-snowfall-warning-during-mondays-rush-hour ).
"It was a surprise for us," city spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said. "We were expecting five centimetres, but we got three times that amount."
He said the city's crews were hampered because some were already out loading snow from Friday's storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/schools-out-plows-hit-the-roads-as-montreal-braces-for-50-cm-of-snow ) and others were on break after working their maximum of 70 hours, which didn't leave many to plow and salt roads and sidewalks.
"The other problem was that the most intense snow came during rush hour and, of course, our crews got caught in traffic just like everyone else," Sabourin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged that the unexpectedly heavy snowfall could slow snow-clearing operations.
"It was going very well," she said with a laugh. "Obviously, we will remove it."
Sabourin said the snow-clearing operation that was forecast to end Friday will now probably last until the beginning of next week, because crews have to return to the streets where snow was already removed. He urged Montrealers to be patient with city crews, to respect no-parking signs and not to park in such a way as to block emergency vehicles. The city's snow-clearing website (montreal.ca/deneigement( https://montreal.ca/deneigement )) lists areas where people can park for free overnight during a snow-clearing operation.
Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said the snowfall Monday morning defied predictions, as the system intensified quickly overnight. He said a weather warning was issued, but it came late because 15 centimetres is the minimum amount needed to trigger a warning.
Polese said immigrants are often surprised that people continue to go about their daily lives during snowstorms.
"We get a lot of calls from people saying, 'I'm not going to come in for the French class because it's snowing,' but we still function."
Walking around N.D.G., Tunisian immigrant Latifa Haouesh said she was impressed with how well the city continues to run after a major snowfall.
"Public transit continues, and schools are still running," said Haouesh, who moved to Montreal with her family about a year ago. "The city continues to run. It's very well organized."
Haouesh said she wasn't sure about winter when she moved last year, but now she takes it all in stride.
"When we came last year, we just caught the end of winter and it was very icy. It was terrible," she said. "When it's like this and there's no ice, it's perfect. It's amazing.
"This is, 'Wow!' This is impressive."
Legault said more snow is expected on Thursday, with up to 10 centimetres falling in the afternoon and overnight. The weekend is expected to be frigid, with a low of -20 C on Saturday morning.

City crews will be busy until Friday carting away snow

Full text: It wasn't a record snowfall, but the amount of snow that fell between Thursday and Friday was still a lot to handle.
Environment Canada reported between 35 and 45 centimetres of snow fell on the island of Montreal between Thursday and Friday, with close to 40 reported at Trudeau airport.
"It's not really a record, especially considering it didn't all fall on one day," Environment Canada meteorologist Julie Deshaies told the Montreal Gazette.
She said the snowstorm appeared to have hit all areas in the province along the St. Lawrence River nearly equally, with up to 50 centimetres recorded in the hardest-hit areas.
Another five to seven centimetres of snow are forecast by Monday night, Deshaies said.
The snowfall was a welcome treat for children braving the frigid temperatures to venture out to the numerous winter carnivals in the area, such as in King George Park in Westmount on Saturday, or Connaught Park in Town of Mount Royal on Sunday.
City crews began loading and carting away the snow on Saturday morning. Spokesperson Philippe Sabourin said the operation will probably last until at least Friday, given how much snow fell. He said it's fairly rare for the city to experience a snowfall as extreme as what fell this week.
"There were high winds, so there was a lot of snow that fell from the roofs that (will add) to the total amount that has to be taken away," Sabourin said. "We normally get a storm of this magnitude once every two years. Citizens will have to be patient. It represents a huge challenge."
Sabourin said the operation will cost the city about $40 million altogether, but residents can help it go more smoothly by minding no-parking signs, as each car parked illegally in a snow bank adds 10 minutes to the overall operation. Sabourin said the city towed away 45 cars per hour during its last operation, which was a decrease from 75 per hour during the first clearing operation.
He said the city's snow dump sites have plenty of capacity and should be able to handle the amount of snow that fell.
Sabourin added the city's emergency services are asking residents not to park their cars on an angle, because that could slow down police cars, ambulances and fire trucks on their way to help someone in distress.
The city's fire department is asking residents to be aware of their balconies and their emergency exit doors to ensure they are not blocked by snow. Dryer vents also have to be cleared to avoid a fire hazard, the department said.
The Régie du batiment du Québec said homeowners and building owners should pay attention to the amount of snow that has accumulated on their roofs, and shovel it out if necessary. The work should be done by professionals, the organization said.
While it will take some time until the roads are in good shape, Sabourin said citizens should expect their sidewalks to be cleared.
"They are all in a good state, but we could have missed a few spots. If citizens see any place where the sidewalks are not cleared properly, they can call us," Sabourin said.
He said citizens can call the city's hotline at 311, or take a picture and submit it to the city through its mobile application.

Full text: Good morning and welcome to the post-storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/schools-out-plows-hit-the-roads-as-montreal-braces-for-50-cm-of-snow ) Saturday edition of While You Were Sleeping. Habs play tonight at 7( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/leafs-at-canadiens-five-things-you-should-know ), snow removal is reportedly underway, construction-related road closures are at a minimum( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-7cFV ) and bad news for school board commissioners. Onward.
Bill 40 passes 60-35 despite fury over last-minute amendments, including one that will see commissions let go three weeks earlier than expected:( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bill-40-opposition-parties-fail-to-block-caqs-use-of-closure ) Playing hardball to the bitter end, an unyielding Education Minister Jean-François Roberge infuriated MNAs Friday when he announced the government intends to fire hundreds of school board commissioners three weeks sooner than originally announced. As the final legislature debate over Bill 40 abolishing Quebec's 60 francophone and nine anglophone school boards dragged late into the night under the cloud of closure, Roberge tabled a surprise last-minute amendment to the bill moving up the date commissioners will be extinct. Instead of the previously announced date of Feb. 29, Roberge's amendment means commissioners are out the door as soon as the bill gets royal sanction, sometime Saturday morning, hours after the 3:20 a.m. vote that approved the bill 60-35.
At least 10 killed, many hurt in Thailand mass shooting: An attacker using military-style weapons killed at least 10 people Saturday near a shopping center in Thailand, according to police.

* The virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people.
* There have been two deaths outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
* In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship for a fourth day after three people on board were found to be infected.
Hamilton police looking for two suspects after dog is wounded in shooting: Police in Hamilton say they are looking for two suspects after a dog was shot in the city's east end Friday night. They say it happened around 9 p.m. when a home owner in the area of Brampton Street and Dunn Avenue let his German Sheppard out the front door as two young men approached the residence. Investigators say one of the men pulled out a firearm and shot the dog, which was rushed to a veterinarian and is expected to survive. They say the shooter was also confronted by a female from the residence and pointed his gun at her before he and the other suspect fled on foot. Police say they believe it was a targeted shooting, and are asking anyone who witnessed it to contact them. They are also urging area residents to check their home security cameras for possible surveillance evidence.
Cats and its furry stars nominated for Razzie worst film awards: The widely panned movie musical Cats and four of its stars were nominated on Saturday for Razzie awards, an annual ritual that lampoons the worst of cinema. James Corden, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson and Francesca Hayward received Razzie acting nominations for their Cats roles, in which they were costumed in digitally created fur. Oscar winner Dench was singled out for "looking suspiciously similar to The Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz," organizers said in a statement announcing this year's nominees. This comes, as per tradition, on the same weekend as Sunday's Oscars (8 p.m. ET on ABC and CTV)( https://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/when-are-the-oscars-2020-start-time-and-date-for-92st-academy-awards ) and Saturday's Independent Spirit Awards (5 p.m. ET( https://www.filmindependent.org/spirit-awards/watch-the-show/ ) livestreamed in Canada at hollywoodsuite.ca( https://hollywoodsuite.ca/ )).

Full text: Montreal-area schools were shuttered and hundreds of plows took to the city's streets Friday as a winter storm warning issued by Environment Canada( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-7cb1 ) entered its second day, forecasting as much as 30 centimetres of snow would fall before the day was out.
As of 2:30 p.m. Friday, nearly 30 centimetres of snow had already fallen over the region since Thursday. Snow is expected to continue through the evening.
Schools across the island of Montreal were closed, as well as some CEGEPs.

Dozens of cancellations and delays were recorded for flights arriving and leaving Montreal-Trudeau airport. Travellers are urged to check their flight status before heading to the airport.
Aéroports de Montréal( https://www.admtl.com/fr/vols ) reported that as of 3:30 a.m. Friday about 60 flights bound for elsewhere in Canada and to the tropics had been cancelled, although several planes had been able to take off by 6 a.m. By noon, more than two dozen arrivals had been delayed or cancelled while more than 90 departures were similarly listed.
About a dozen flights were cancelled at Jean-Lesage airport in Quebec City and Macdonald-Cartier airport in Ottawa.

No major accidents were reported on Montreal area roads but Highway 40 was closed temporarily in both directions at Saint-Sulpice near Highway 343 after a multi-vehicle pile-up at about 11:20 a.m. Eastbound Highway 40 in Vaudreuil-Dorion was also shut down after a 53-foot tractor trailer went off the road at Exit 26 for Highway 342. And southbound Highway 13 was reduced to one lane at Samson Blvd. when a tractor trailer went off the road.
There was no immediate word on any injuries.
The incidents pressed home the message from Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec that motorists postpone non-essential travel or adapt their driving to road conditions that on Friday were a combination of slippery city streets and poor visibility caused by snow blown by gusts of up to 60 km/h.
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel took to social media to add his voice to those already counselling caution.
Mise à jour: Plus de 700 incidents nous ont été rapportés depuis ce matin. Dans les prochaines heures, la situation se dégradera encore. Les précipitations se poursuivront et le vent s'intensifiera dans plusieurs régions.
Je le répète, ÉVITEZ tous déplacements non essentiels.

"More than 700 incidents have been reported to us since this morning," the minister tweeted. "The situation will worsen over the next few hours. Precipitation and winds will intensify in many regions. I repeat - AVOID any non-essential travel."

Transport Quebec reported that all Montreal island highways were snow-covered, as were most of those in Laval and on the South Shore and was recommending motorists exercise caution if they were compelled to get behind the wheel. However the combination of weather-related cancellations and poor road conditions seemed to have convinced many drivers to stay home resulting in lighter than usual morning traffic conditions on all major thoroughfares.
Those who opted to use public transport were not spared the storm's inconvenience's however, with several routes having to be detoured around snow covered and icy sections of city streets - and hills.

While it remains to be seen just how much snow will accumulate in the city over the next 24 hours, the city of Montreal announced Friday it will begin snow removal operations "progressively" at 7 a.m. Saturday.
The storm system hovering over Montreal is also expected to produce heavy snowfalls in Charlevoix, Drummondville, Nicolet, Bécancour, the Mauricie region and the Eastern Townships.
VIA Rail service between Montreal and Toronto was completely stopped until further notice but the interruption had nothing to do with the weather. A notice on viarail.ca( https://www.viarail.ca/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr7PGj-m_5wIVysDACh07PAlaEAAYASAAEgL9ivD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds ) said the disruption was caused by an ongoing protest on the tracks Belleville, Ont., and service would not be resumed "until the issue is resolved."
Via Rail train routes were halted due not to the snow storm in Eastern Canada, but to a protest.
The protest is being staged in solidarity with protesters in British Columbia trying to block a pipeline project.
The snow is expected to end by Friday evening and the forecast for Saturday calls for a mix of sun and cloud in the morning followed by clearing skies in the afternoon with a high of minus 13 C.
This story will be updated.

And southbound Highway 13 was reduced to one lane at Samson Blvd. when a tractor trailer went off the road.
There was no immediate word on any injuries.
The incidents pressed home the message from Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec that motorists postpone non-essential travel or adapt their driving to road conditions that on Friday were a combination of slippery city streets and poor visibility caused by snow blown by gusts of up to 60 km/h.
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel took to social media to add his voice to those already counselling caution.
Mise à jour: Plus de 700 incidents nous ont été rapportés depuis ce matin. Dans les prochaines heures, la situation se dégradera encore. Les précipitations se poursuivront et le vent s'intensifiera dans plusieurs régions.
Je le répète, ÉVITEZ tous déplacements non essentiels.

"More than 700 incidents have been reported to us since this morning," the minister tweeted. "The situation will worsen over the next few hours. Precipitation and winds will intensify in many regions. I repeat - AVOID any non-essential travel."

Transport Quebec reported that all Montreal island highways were snow-covered, as were most of those in Laval and on the South Shore and was recommending motorists exercise caution if they were compelled to get behind the wheel. However the combination of weather-related cancellations and poor road conditions seemed to have convinced many drivers to stay home resulting in lighter than usual morning traffic conditions on all major thoroughfares.
Those who opted to use public transport were not spared the storm's inconvenience's however, with several routes having to be detoured around snow covered and icy sections of city streets - and hills.

While it remains to be seen just how much snow will accumulate in the city over the next 24 hours, the city of Montreal announced Friday it will begin snow removal operations "progressively" at 7 a.m. Saturday.
The storm system hovering over Montreal is also expected to produce heavy snowfalls in Charlevoix, Drummondville, Nicolet, Bécancour, the Mauricie region and the Eastern Townships.
VIA Rail service between Montreal and Toronto was completely stopped until further notice but the interruption had nothing to do with the weather. A notice on viarail.ca( https://www.viarail.ca/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr7PGj-m_5wIVysDACh07PAlaEAAYASAAEgL9ivD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds ) said the disruption was caused by an ongoing protest on the tracks Belleville, Ont., and service would not be resumed "until the issue is resolved."
Via Rail train routes were halted due not to the snow storm in Eastern Canada, but to a protest.
The protest is being staged in solidarity with protesters in British Columbia trying to block a pipeline project.
The snow is expected to end by Friday evening and the forecast for Saturday calls for a mix of sun and cloud in the morning followed by clearing skies in the afternoon with a high of -13 C.

EMSB renounces $250K in funding from Ottawa; School board plans to fight Bill 21 in the courts using its own funds

Full text: QUEBEC On the same day the Legault government openly mulled over ways to block the funding, the English Montreal School Board dropped the idea of using federal money to help pay for its challenge to Bill 21.
But the EMSB said it has not changed its plans to battle the bill in the courts using its own funds, despite the ire of the provincial government over the last few hours - which one minority community leader has qualified as intimidation to crush democratic dissent.
"The cases are very much alive," EMSB spokesman Mike Cohen said in an interview.
"Nothing changes. We had allocated budget long before we even considered applying for court challenges.
"People have to remember school boards have always had the option to litigate against a government. Now it will be provincial money only that will be used for this court battle."
Cohen was explaining the EMSB's sudden flip-flop on plans to make use of the federal Court Challenges Assistance Program (CCP) to pay legal fees in its case against Bill 21.
The Montreal Gazette confirmed Wednesday that the CCP had agreed to grant $250,000 in funding to the EMSB to help cover the legal costs of two court challenges it has filed against the Quebec government.
The CCP had specifically awarded the board $125,000 to fund its challenge of Bill 21, the state secularism law that bans teachers, judges and police officers, among others, from wearing religious symbols on the job.
But then a political storm erupted in Quebec City and Ottawa.
By midday Thursday, after Premier François Legault specifically accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of meddling in Quebec's affairs, the EMSB backtracked.
In a statement, the EMSB said while it had made an application for funding and it had been accepted, it had not received any funding money in its litigation against the Quebec government and now no longer wanted any.
"The EMSB has renounced any funding it could receive from the Court Challenges Program," the statement said.
"That said, the EMSB maintains that its power of management and control conferred on it by Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms covers the power to make agreements with third parties, including the government of Canada."
"Recent events do not affect the EMSB's resolve to see to an end to its important litigation attacking the constitutionality of Bill 21 and Section 477.1.1 of the Education Act."
Asked to elaborate, Cohen said given the "political climate," lawyers with the firm Power Law, hired by the board to stickhandle legal cases, recommended dropping the applications.
Despite speculation the EMSB - which is under government trusteeship over governance issues - caved into government pressure, Cohen said it had no direct contact with Quebec City. The government-appointed trustee, Marlene Jennings, played no role in the decision, he said.
In slapping trusteeship on the EMSB in November 2019, Education Minister Jean-François Roberge allowed the EMSB to continue to operate its various legal challenges, including the one against Bill 21.
What Quebec didn't see coming was the possibility the EMSB would seek federal funding from the CCP, which Quebec City sees as a branch of the federal government.
Officials at the CCP were not commenting on the incident Thursday, but the organization rapidly became a political football kicked between the two capitals.
"I think Justin Trudeau insults Quebecers in financing a challenge against this law banning religious symbols, which is supported by a majority of Quebecers," a furious Legault said arriving for question period at the legislature.
"I ask Justin Trudeau to ensure this financing is not given to challenge Bill 21. It's shocking. I think it's unacceptable to see the federal government financing the EMSB to go against the will of the majority of Quebecers."
Legault dismissed out of hand Trudeau's explanation Wednesday that the CCP is an independent agency that decides itself which cases it will finance.
"Listen, a government can put a framework around an institution," Legault said. "This is no small matter. We have an organization suing the government of Quebec for a bill adopted and supported by the majority of Quebecers. "Mr. Trudeau can't hide behind an independent program."
Legault went so far as to say he has asked Justice Minister Sonia LeBel to look into possible options including taking away the EMSB's right to access such funding.
"I will look at possible actions," LeBel said later. "I will reflect. If there are things we can do we will do them in due time, but I won't discuss them in public."
In fact, Dawson College professor and Parti Québécois leadership candidate Frédéric Bastien argued the EMSB is acting illegally in trying to obtain such funding. He said the Education Act says a board has to have the authorization of Quebec to enter into agreements with a federal organization such as the CCP.
The EMSB refutes that statement, saying the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms covers the power to make such agreements. The point became moot with the EMSB's decision to renounce the funding.
Later, Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette told reporters he thinks the board had made the right decision, but he was still irritated saying Ottawa should have withdrawn the money from the EMSB on its own.
Jolin-Barrette, however, recognized the EMSB is within its rights now to contest Bill 21 using its existing provincial funding.
But the incident has left a bad feeling with the leaders of the minority community who wondered if Quebec's heavy hand over the last few days is designed to intimidate and quash dissent.
"It's very improper for the ministry to implement policies and laws that compromise the community's constitutional rights and for them to impede the community in verifying whether those constitutional rights have in fact been compromised," Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network, said in an interview.
"It's possible we have a disagreement among good faith parties and that the courts have to decide, but in that case the courts really have to decide. For one of those parties to obstruct, impede or intimidate the other which has fewer resources is just not right."
He said such pressure doesn't necessarily have to be manifested in official letters, but can take the form of statements the premier makes in press conferences.
"Either way there is definitely intimidation going on," Chambers said. "They know there are constitutional problems with Bill 21 because they invoked the notwithstanding clause." pauthier@postmedia.com Twitter.com/philipauthier

Later, Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette told reporters he thinks the board had made the right decision, but he was still irritated saying Ottawa should have withdrawn the money from the EMSB on its own.
Jolin-Barrette, however, recognized the EMSB is within its rights now to contest Bill 21 using its existing provincial funding.
But the incident has left a bad feeling with the leaders of the minority community who wondered if Quebec's heavy hand over the last few days is designed to intimidate and quash dissent.
"It's very improper for the ministry to implement policies and laws that compromise the community's constitutional rights and for them to impede the community in verifying whether those constitutional rights have in fact been compromised," Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network, said in an interview.
"It's possible we have a disagreement among good faith parties and that the courts have to decide, but in that case the courts really have to decide. For one of those parties to obstruct, impede or intimidate the other which has fewer resources is just not right."
He said such pressure doesn't necessarily have to be manifested in official letters, but can take the form of statements the premier makes in press conferences.
"Either way there is definitely intimidation going on," Chambers said. "They know there are constitutional problems with Bill 21 because they invoked the notwithstanding clause."

Full text: QUEBEC - The English Montreal School Board has dropped the idea of using federal funding from the Court Challenges Program to fund its challenge to Bill 21.
In a statement issued Thursday, EMSB spokesperson Mike Cohen said while the EMSB had made an application for funding and it had been accepted, it has not received any funding and thus has not spent any money in its litigation against the Quebec government.
Now it no longer wants it.
"The EMSB has renounced any funding it could receive from the the Court Challenges Program," the statement said. "That said, the EMSB maintains that its power of management and control conferred on it by Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms covers the power to make agreements with third parties, including the government of Canada."
The statement adds: "Recent events do not affect the EMSB's resolve to see to an end to its important litigation attacking the constitutionality of Bill 21 and Section 477.1.1 of the Education Act."
The EMSB's change of view follows a storm of controversy over the funding issue.
On Thursday, Premier François Legault accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of insulting Quebecers in allowing federal funds to be used in a court challenge against Bill 21( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/bill-21 ), Quebec's state secularism law.
One day after the minister of immigration, Simon Jolin-Barrette, slammed Ottawa for allowing the English Montreal School Board to use money( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emsb-receiving-250000-from-ottawa-for-high-profile-court-challenges ) from the federal Court Challenges Program (CCP) to challenge Bill 21, Legault went a step farther, pointing the finger directly at Trudeau.
"I think Justin Trudeau insults Quebecers in financing a challenge against this law banning religious symbols, which is supported by a majority of Quebecers," Legault said arriving for question period at the legislature.
"I ask Justin Trudeau to ensure this financing is not given to challenge Bill 21.
"It's shocking. I think it's unacceptable to see the federal government financing the EMSB to go against the will of the majority of Quebecers. It's insulting from Mr. Trudeau."
The Montreal Gazette confirmed Wednesday that the English Montreal School Board( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/emsb ) has received $250,000 in federal government funding from the CPP to help cover the legal costs of two court challenges it has filed against the Quebec government.
The CCP has awarded the board $125,000 to fund its challenge of Bill 21,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/emsb-files-legal-challenge-against-bill-21 ) the state secularism law that bans teachers, judges and police officers, among others, from wearing religious symbols on the job.
The bill was adopted by the National Assembly in June 2019( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-passes-secularism-law-after-marathon-session ).
Legault dismissed out of hand Trudeau's explanation Wednesday that the Court Challenges Program is an independent agency that decides itself which cases it will finance.
"Listen, a government can put a framework around an institution," Legault said. "This is no small matter. We have an organization suing the government of Quebec for a bill adopted and supported by the majority of Quebecers.
"Mr. Trudeau can't hide behind an independent program."
He said his government and Justice Minister Sonia LeBel will look into possible options including taking away the EMSB's right to sue the government. The EMSB is currently under government trusteeship for governance issues but it retains the right to launch legal cases.
Legault did not elaborate.
"I will look at possible actions," LeBel said at a separate news conference earlier. "I will reflect. If there things we can do we will do them in due time but I won't discuss them in public."
But Legault is clearly irritated.
"This is no small matter," Legault said. "They are suing a national government, they are suing a government which adopted a law with the support of the Quebec nation. This is no small matter.
"It's not like other suits. I agree that we protect and financially help minority groups but I don't accept that the federal government finance a suit against a government."
The Parti Québécois also continued its attacks on the federal government.
The interim PQ leader, Pascal Bérubé, tried to table a motion in the legislature asking the National Assembly to condemn Ottawa's financing.
The CAQ government refused to grant consent to debate the motion so it died without being debated.

Schukov: Chasing a windmill

Full text: A news article by John Meagher, Pointe-Claire heritage society, city argue over windmill restoration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-heritage-society-city-argue-over-windmill-restoration ); Montreal Gazette; Nov. 20, 2019, inspires a few analogies:
For one, there is the notion of a Mexican stand-off where three gunslingers (The city, the "hysterical" society and the Catholic Church) are floating in the doldrums over who reattaches the municipally symbolic windmill's fallen wings( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claires-signature-windmill-badly-damaged-by-storm ). On a more spiritual stretch, I liken it to the son and father and Holy Ghost not coming to a lasting agreement.
On to a literary simile: As many literate people will note (so that excludes tedious trolls), the expression "chasing a windmill" refers to the book Don Quixote, where the main character - a daffy sort - attacks a windmill thinking it is a giant; it means chasing something that isn't there. Okay, I only used this example because it has a windmill in it, but the thing that isn't there is the solution to the problem (which I have.)
Back up (beep-beep-beep): I used to live in LaSalle, a long time ago, very close to the stone windmill that is also that town's logo. The windmill has always been in beautiful shape. LaSalle no doubt appreciates the importance of constantly maintaining its symbol (unlike the water tower( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/schukov-10-things-to-do-with-an-abandoned-water-tower ) in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue which stood rotting for too long, before finally being beautified.) Only difference between the two aforesaid wind-cranked logos is that Pointe-Claire doesn't own theirs. On the surface, one can sympathize with two of the participants in this surmountable technicality: Pointe-Claire and the associated heritage society. They both want it fixed but the actual owner is the slum landlord who won't repair the leaky faucet, much less quick to agree to do so. (Whatever happened to a bit of house pride?)
Yeah, yeah - the Pointe-Claire windmill is located on church-owned land, and the city is in talks with the diocese to make repairs (You wonder just how fast things get done in this regard dealing with a church overseer.) Understandably, heritage people are frustrated by the inaction to date. Although the windmill is on property of St-Joachim Parish, the La Pointe area on Pointe-Claire has heritage protection. So, the Pointe-Claire Heritage Preservation Society( https://patrimoinepointeclaire.org/ ) maintains the city is responsible for restoring the windmill irrespective of parish ownership (Blah blah blah.)
But there is an obvious solution: The church should donate the windmill to the city in good faith (Pardon the pun.) Which brings me to yet another simile: 'It's better to give than to receive' is from the Bible, Acts 20:35 (King James Version.) Again, why can't the church donate it to the city? God knows (pardon the pun) the church is not adverse to the concept of accepting donations and isn't it better to give than receive? Wow, this has such a jagged angle to it, it borders on hypocrisy. Personally, I think if the church cannot extend itself, Pointe-Claire should get another logo. Maybe we should telex the Pope.
Hockey analogy: Reminds me of CBC not wanting to spend extra money on their signature Hockey Night in Canada theme song( https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/tsn-has-no-plans-to-give-up-rights-to-theme-made-famous-by-hockey-night-in-canada ), so CTV/TSN bought it and CBC got a new tune. Problem solved.

Food hall monitor; How do the recently opened marketplaces stack up against one another?

Full text: In the last three months, three major food halls have opened in Montreal's downtown core, jumping on a bandwagon that has already taken the world by storm. Those who remember Place Ville Marie's Mövenpick know the phenomenon has existed before - even Marché Artisans, which opened a couple of years ago in Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth hotel, offers an array of counters and a luxury approach to lunch foods in a cafeteria context that approaches the concept.
The difference with these big new food halls (or food marketplaces or emporia or whatever you call them, so long as it isn't "food court") is that it isn't one outfit providing the food, it's a selection of Montreal chefs - the hotter and buzzier, the better. And unlike food courts, there are no multinational chains allowed.
As Montreal Gazette columnist Josh Freed recently wrote, the reasons we love food halls are many, from the convenience to the variety to the primo people-watching.
But how do these new spots differ from one another? The grandest: Le Cathcart Restaurants et Biergarten The latest addition to Montreal's food hall roster, Le Cathcart opened on the bottom floor of Place Ville Marie on Thursday, and it wins the prize for best esthetic. Designed by Sid Lee Architecture, it's airy, comfortable and luxurious, with lasting materials like brass, iron, marble, wood, black-and-white tiled flooring and well-stuffed peach, teal and aubergine leather seating. The atmosphere is eclectic and loft-like, thanks to a variety of zones, each with its own design vibe. And the pièce de résistance is the biergarten's fully glassed ceiling, which reveals the grandeur of the surrounding skyscrapers.
Filled with plants that reflect the greenery of the now-visible Mount Royal, Le Cathcart is an oasis among the area's food courts. And of course, the important part: the food! The dozen or so restaurants, counters and coffee shops serving the 1,000 (!) seated spots run the gamut, from wood-oven pizzas by Pizza del Fornaio to tall-stacked fried chicken burgers from Chikin to platefuls of fragrant Middle Eastern goodies from Omnivore (try their mixed salad plate and their Beirut kefta sandwich). There are also mouth-wateringly generous bento boxes from the Japanese cantina Akio, courtesy of the project's patron-chef Antonio Park.
The overall array is less haute than Time Out, less international than Central, and the prices seem to sit right in the middle. 1 Place Ville Marie; lecathcart.com The chicest: Time Out Market Ride up the Eaton Centre elevator to Time Out Market and you'll be struck by the moodiness of the dark-designed space, featuring a black industrial ceiling and grey and cement surfaces illuminated with dramatic spotlights that reflect on the golden wood tables.
The fanciness carries through to the food options, which include outposts by renowned Montreal restaurants ranging from burgers signed by Toqué! to Club Chasse et Pêche to Montréal Plaza. So far, the most beloved by my trusted foodie sources are Moleskine's pizzas, anything from Olive & Gourmando, the decadent baked goods of Hof Kelsten and the Haitian-influenced dishes by Agrikol chef Paul Toussaint. There are 16 "unique food concepts" (their words) to choose from in all.
A meal here feels like something of an event - $30 for a burger and a glass of wine has that effect on me - and that elevated experience is hard to come by in the constantly bustling, chain-restaurant-addled downtown. It's a real escape and would make for a great place to meet the gang after work, where everyone can choose their own dish but meet in the separate bar section to catch up before a show.
The wine selection is small, but very well curated - in fact, it's the judicious curating of everything, especially the choice of restaurants, that will keep me coming back for more. Eaton Centre, 705 Ste-Catherine St. W.; timeoutmarket.com/montreal The most fun: Le Central The prize for greatest expression of Montreal's unique vibe goes to Le Central, at Ste-Catherine St. and St-Laurent Blvd.
Fun radiates from this place, thanks to a design that's eclectic and personalized to each eatery, featuring a range of materials - from solid wood sharing tables to '50s-style red plastic chairs. The irregular distribution of the 25 food counters - or, in cases like Pintxo, full-on restaurant spaces - gives it the feel of a permanent food truck meet-up. (First Fridays all year round - my dream!) When I visited, kids filled the place, running and exploring all the options before returning to the enormous tables in the central space, making it clear it's a very family-friendly experience with a vibrant and festive atmosphere.
The options include Mignonette's alluring raw bar, Misoya's ramen, Portuguese chicken from Emilia, delicious dosa from Le Super Qualité, Thai-Laotian yums from Thip Thip and Chinese fried chicken from Ho Lee Chix. My meal from Bonita's Taco & Deli was an extremely affordable ray of sunshine on a grey winter's day: a vegan carnitas taco made from wonderfully meaty-textured enoki mushrooms and a beefy barbacoa taco, dry-spiced and so fragrant, topped with fresh onion and cilantro and served with a juicy orange wedge to squeeze over. For dessert, I highly recommend the chocolatey Blizzard from Trou de Beigne.
Bon appétit! 30 Ste-Catherine St. W.; lecentral.ca

C.D.N.-N.D.G. Mayor Sue Montgomery turfed from Projet Montréal caucus

Full text: Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Mayor Sue Montgomery has been expelled from her party, Projet Montréal announced Friday afternoon.
But the mayor of Montreal's largest borough is refusing to stand down without a fight.
The party of Mayor Valérie Plante said Montgomery was expelled because she refused to remove a member of her staff accused of psychological harassment.
The expulsion stems from an investigation by the city's comptroller general( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/report-finds-cdn-ndg-borough-employees-suffered-harrassment ) that found employees within Montgomery's borough administration had been harassed by a member of Montgomery's staff.
"Following the report of the investigation of the city's human rights division, that concluded that there were serious behaviours comparable to psychological harassment toward two employees of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the comptroller general of the city put in place immediate measures and submitted recommendations aimed at avoiding any types of psychological harassment," the mayor's office said in a statement.
Officials with Plante's office would not divulge the name of the accused, saying it was a human resources matter, but sources within the party confirmed the accusations were against Annalisa Harris, Montgomery's chief of staff, who was hired last June.
The recommendations to dismiss Harris were given to Montgomery, who "has the legal obligation to take the necessary measures in order to stop the behaviours and protect the employees concerned," the statement reads. The cabinet of Mayor Plante demanded that Montgomery follow the recommendations, but "Montgomery has chosen to contest the validity of the report and its conclusion, and has openly refused to apply the recommendations of the comptroller general. This led to her expulsion from caucus."
In a statement Friday, Montgomery said she was "very disappointed" the party had removed her.
"I was democratically elected and will continue to work hard to serve the people of CDN-NDG," she said. "I will stay as mayor. But they have kicked me out of the party."
Montgomery said neither she nor Plante has seen the comptroller general's report. She said she was being asked to fire someone without having seen the evidence.
"I would be the last person to condone harassment. I will also not condone lack of due process," Montgomery said. "We live in a democracy where people have a right to see evidence against them and to defend themselves. This has not happened and I cannot accept it. It would be irresponsible for me, or any employer, to fire someone without seeing evidence and giving that employee a chance to correct any unacceptable behaviour, if any existed."
Montgomery can stay on as mayor but would sit removed from her party in city council and will no longer take part in party sessions. Her departure leaves Projet Montréal with 35 seats on the 65-seat city council.
In a tweet, Montgomery countered the mayor's office's version of events, saying she was the one to call for an investigation "because it was brought to my attention there were morale problems among city employees."
I want to correct the record in PM's release. I was the one who initiated the investigation because it was brought to my attention there were morale problems among city employees. #truth( https://twitter.com/hashtag/truth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #justice( https://twitter.com/hashtag/justice?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #transparency( https://twitter.com/hashtag/transparency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
- suemontgomery (@MontgomerySue) January 24, 2020( https://twitter.com/MontgomerySue/status/1220841753248399362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
In the city statement, Plante said despite "numerous interventions from my cabinet and myself asking Ms. Montgomery to accept to apply the recommendation of the comptroller general, it must be recognized she is refusing to conform.
"I have a zero-tolerance policy in matters of harassment and that goes for elected officials, political staff and all the employees in our public service," she said. "In another era, politicians preferred to close their eyes or to hide under the carpet similar situations in order to avoid paying a political price. I do not share that way of doing politics. ... All reprehensible acts require an intervention, no matter the party or the post occupied by the person that committed it."
In its explanation of the investigation, the city says the comptroller general's office received information saying that the accused exhibited behaviours "comparable to psychological harassment" toward two employees at the borough. The employees did not themselves lodge a complaint. Investigators spoke with the accused and 11 other members of the borough office about the work environment and found "serious violations" and evidence of psychological harassment.
Sources within Projet Montréal said the work climate changed dramatically when Harris was hired as the new chief of staff, replacing Daniel Sanger, who had been moved to another position in the office. A few weeks later, Sanger, a former chief of staff to ex-Plateau-Mont-Royal mayor Luc Ferrandez and a longtime Projet Montréal strategist, was fired by Harris and given just minutes to leave with his belongings. Sources also noted that Montgomery and borough director Stéphane Plante had had confrontations.
The departure of Montgomery from Projet Montréal stands in stark contrast to election night of Nov. 5, 2017, when she and Plante were shown dancing together in jubilation over their success.
Montgomery, a former Montreal Gazette justice reporter, has a long and well-documented history of fighting against harassment and abuse.
In August, Montgomery won a long-standing battle against Robert Edgar, who had followed and confronted her for 20 years( https://montrealgazette.com/news/three-year-probation-period-for-man-irrationally-obsessed-with-borough-mayor-sue-montgomery ), when a judge barred him from being near her or communicating with her in any way, including at city council meetings.
As a victim of sexual abuse, she was the co-creator of the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported in 2014 that has been shared more than 10 million times.
On Thursday night, Montgomery posted a quote on Facebook intimating she saw the storm coming, but did not intend to bow quietly.
" 'The ultimate measure of a person is not where he or she stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he or she stands at times of challenge and controversy.' (slightly altered) Martin Luther King Jr.
"I stand for what is right."
Montgomery is not the first borough mayor to be kicked out of Projet Montréal in connection with harassment complaints. Villeray-St-Michel-Parc-Extension Mayor Giuliana Fumagalli was ordered to only have communications with the borough director( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/borough-mayor-kept-at-arms-length-from-staff-as-harassment-probe-ends ) after an investigation ordered by Plante by the comptroller general into accusations of harassment against her by her employees.

Full text: Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Mayor Sue Montgomery has been expelled from her party, Projet Montréal announced Friday afternoon.
But the mayor of Montreal's largest borough is refusing to stand down without a fight.
The party of Mayor Valérie Plante said Montgomery was expelled because she refused to remove a member of her staff accused of psychological harassment.
The expulsion stems from an investigation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/report-finds-cdn-ndg-borough-employees-suffered-harrassment ) by the city's comptroller-general that found employees within Montgomery's borough administration had been harassed by a member of Montgomery's staff.
"Following the report of the investigation of the city's human rights division, that concluded that there were serious behaviours comparable to psychological harassment toward two employees of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the comptroller-general of the city put in place immediate measures and submitted recommendations aimed at avoiding any types of psychological harassment," the mayor's office said in a statement.
Officials with Plante's office would not divulge the name of the accused, saying it was a human resources matter, but sources within the party confirmed the accusations were against Annalisa Harris, Montgomery's chief of staff, who was hired last June.
The recommendations to dismiss Harris were given to Montgomery, who "has the legal obligation to take the necessary measures in order to stop the behaviours and protect the employees concerned," the statement reads. The cabinet of Mayor Plante demanded that Montgomery follow the recommendations, but "Montgomery has chosen to contest the validity of the report and its conclusion, and has openly refused to apply the recommendations of the comptroller general. This led to her expulsion from caucus."
In a statement Friday, Montgomery said she was "very disappointed" the party had removed her.
"I was democratically elected and will continue to work hard to serve the people of CDN-NDG," she said. "I will stay as mayor. But they have kicked me out of the party."
Montgomery said neither she nor Plante has seen the the comptroller-general's report. She said she was being asked to fire someone without having seen the evidence.
"I would be the last person to condone harassment. I will also not condone lack of due process," Montgomery said. "We live in a democracy where people have a right to see evidence against them and to defend themselves. This has not happened and I cannot accept it. It would be irresponsible for me, or any employer, to fire someone without seeing evidence and giving that employee a chance to correct any unacceptable behaviour, if any existed."
Montgomery can stay on as mayor but would sit removed from her party in city council and will no longer take part in party sessions. Her departure leaves Projet Montréal with 35 seats on the 65-seat city council.
In a tweet, Montgomery countered the mayor's office's version of events, saying she was the one to call for an investigation "because it was brought to my attention there were morale problems among city employees."
I want to correct the record in PM's release. I was the one who initiated the investigation because it was brought to my attention there were morale problems among city employees. #truth( https://twitter.com/hashtag/truth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #justice( https://twitter.com/hashtag/justice?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #transparency( https://twitter.com/hashtag/transparency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
- suemontgomery (@MontgomerySue) January 24, 2020( https://twitter.com/MontgomerySue/status/1220841753248399362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
In the city statement, Plante said despite "numerous interventions from my cabinet and myself asking Ms. Montgomery to accept to apply the recommendation of the comptroller-general, it must be recognized she is refusing to conform.
"I have a zero-tolerance policy in matters of harassment and that goes for elected officials, political staff and all the employees in our public service," she said. "In another era, politicians preferred to close their eyes or to hide under the carpet similar situations in order to avoid paying a political price. I do not share that way of doing politics. ... All reprehensible acts require an intervention, no matter the party or the post occupied by the person that committed it."
In its explanation of the investigation, the city says the comptroller-general's office received information saying that the accused exhibited behaviours "comparable to psychological harassment" toward two employees at the borough. The employees did not themselves lodge a complaint. Investigators spoke with the accused and 11 other members of the borough office about the work environment and found "serious violations" and evidence of psychological harassment.
Sources within Projet Montréal said the work climate changed dramatically when Harris was hired as the new chief of staff, replacing Daniel Sanger, who had been moved to another position in the office. A few weeks later, Sanger, a former chief of staff to ex-Plateau-Mont-Royal mayor Luc Ferrandez and a longtime Projet Montréal strategist, was fired by Harris and given just minutes to leave with his belongings. Sources also noted that Montgomery and borough director Stéphane Plante had had confrontations.
The departure of Montgomery from Projet Montréal stands in stark contrast to election night of Nov. 5, 2017, when she and Plante were shown dancing together in jubilation over their success.
Montgomery, a former Montreal Gazette justice reporter, has a long and well-documented history of fighting against harassment and abuse.
In August, Montgomery wona long-standing battle against Robert Edgar, who had followed and confronted her for 20 years( https://montrealgazette.com/news/three-year-probation-period-for-man-irrationally-obsessed-with-borough-mayor-sue-montgomery ), when a judge barred him from being near her or communicating with her in any way, including at city council meetings.
As a victim of sexual abuse, she was the co-creator of the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported in 2014 that has been shared more than 10 million times.
On Thursday night, Montgomery posted a quote on Facebook intimating she saw the storm coming, but did not intend to bow quietly.
" 'The ultimate measure of a person is not where he or she stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he or she stands at times of challenge and controversy.' (slightly altered) Martin Luther King Jr.
"I stand for what is right."
Montgomery is not the first borough mayor to be kicked out of Projet Montréal in connection with harassment complaints. Villeray-St-Michel-Parc-Extension Mayor Giuliana Fumagalli was ordered to only have communications with the borough director( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/borough-mayor-kept-at-arms-length-from-staff-as-harassment-probe-ends ) after an investigation ordered by Plante by the comptroller-general into accusations of harassment against her by her employees.

Food hall monitor: How do Montreal's new marketplaces compare to one another?

Full text: In the last three months, three major food halls have opened in Montreal's downtown core, jumping on a bandwagon that has already taken the world by storm. Those who remember Place Ville Marie's Mövenpick know the phenomenon has existed before - even Marché Artisans, which opened a couple of years ago in Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth hotel, offers an array of counters and a luxury approach to lunch foods in a cafeteria context that approaches the concept.
The difference with these big new food halls (or food marketplaces or emporia or whatever you choose to call them, so long as it isn't "food court") is that it isn't one outfit providing the food, it's a selection of Montreal chefs - the hotter and buzzier, the better. And unlike traditional food courts, there are no multinational chains allowed.
As Montreal Gazette columnist Josh Freed recently wrote( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/josh-freed-five-reasons-these-new-fancy-food-halls-are-worth-checking-out ), the reasons we love food halls are many, from the convenience to the variety to the primo people-watching. But how do these new spots differ from one another? It's time for a little compare-and-contrast.

The grandest: Le Cathcart Restaurants et Biergarten( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-pvm-is-joining-the-battle-for-your-tummy )
The latest addition to Montreal's food hall roster, Le Cathcart opened on the bottom floor of Place Ville Marie on Thursday, and it wins the prize for best esthetic. Designed by Sid Lee Architecture, it's airy, comfortable and luxurious, with lasting materials like brass, iron, marble, wood, black-and-white tiled flooring and well-stuffed peach, teal and aubergine leather seating. The atmosphere is eclectic and loft-like, thanks to a variety of zones, each with its own design vibe. And the pièce de résistance is the biergarten's fully glassed ceiling, which reveals the grandeur of the surrounding skyscrapers.
Filled with plants that reflect the greenery of the now-visible Mount Royal, Le Cathcart is an oasis among the area's food courts. And of course, the important part: the food! The dozen or so restaurants, counters and coffee shops serving the 1,000 (!) seated spots run the gamut, from wood-oven pizzas by Pizza del Fornaio to tall-stacked fried chicken burgers from Chikin to platefuls of fragrant Middle Eastern goodies from Omnivore (try their mixed salad plate and their Beirut kefta sandwich). There are also mouth-wateringly generous bento boxes from the Japanese cantina Akio, courtesy of the project's patron-chef Antonio Park( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-with-antonio-park-multicultural-in-life-and-in-food ). The overall array is less haute than Time Out, less international than Central, and the prices seem to sit right in the middle.
1 Place Ville Marie; lecathcart.com( http://lecathcart.com/en/ )
Le Cathcart's luxurious dining areas win the prize for best esthetic out of the recent spate of food halls.
The chicest: Time Out Market( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-a-tasty-sneak-peek-at-the-time-out-market )
Ride up the Eaton Centre elevator to Time Out Market and you'll be struck by the moodiness of the dark-designed space, featuring a black industrial ceiling and grey and cement surfaces illuminated with dramatic spotlights that reflect on the golden wood tables. The fanciness carries through to the food options, which include outposts by renowned Montreal restaurants ranging from burgers signed by Toqué! to Club Chasse et Pêche to Montréal Plaza. So far, the most beloved by my trusted foodie sources are Moleskine's pizzas, anything from Olive & Gourmando( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/dyan-solomon-shares-salads-soups-stories-in-olive-gourmando-cookbook ), the decadent baked goods of Hof Kelsten( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-hof-kelstens-panettone-is-a-hit-for-the-holidays ) and the Haitian-influenced dishes by Agrikol chef Paul Toussaint( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/beyond-the-plate-paul-toussaint-brings-haitian-heart-to-agrikol ). There are 16 "unique food concepts" (their words) to choose from in all.
A meal here feels like something of an event - $30 for a burger and a glass of wine has that effect on me - and that elevated experience is hard to come by in the constantly bustling, chain-restaurant-addled downtown. It's a real escape and would make for a great place to meet the gang after work, where everyone can choose their own dish but meet in the separate bar section to catch up before a show. The wine selection is small, but very well curated - in fact, it's the judicious curating of everything, especially the choice of restaurants, that will keep me coming back for more.

With a fancy atmosphere and well-curated outposts of renowned restaurants, a meal at Time Out Market feels like something of an event.
The most fun: Le Central
The prize for greatest expression of Montreal's unique vibe goes to Le Central, at Ste-Catherine St. and St-Laurent Blvd. Fun radiates from this place, thanks to a design that's eclectic and personalized to each eatery, featuring a range of materials - from solid wood sharing tables to '50s-style red plastic chairs. The irregular distribution of the 25 food counters - or, in cases like Pintxo, full-on restaurant spaces - gives it the feel of a permanent food truck meet-up. (First Fridays( https://montrealgazette.com/news/open-wide-montreals-first-fridays-is-canadas-biggest-food-truck-event ) all year round - my dream!) When I visited, kids filled the place, running and exploring all the options before returning to the enormous tables in the central space, making it clear it's a very family-friendly experience with a vibrant and festive atmosphere.
The options include Mignonette's alluring raw bar, Misoya's ramen, Portuguese chicken from Emilia, delicious dosa from Le Super Qualité( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/local-food-reviews/restaurant-review-le-super-qualite-is-a-superstar-indian-snack-bar ), Thai-Laotian yums from Thip Thip and Chinese fried chicken from Ho Lee Chix. My meal from Bonita's Taco & Deli was an extremely affordable ray of sunshine on a grey winter's day: a vegan carnitas taco made from wonderfully meaty-textured enoki mushrooms and a beefy barbacoa taco, dry-spiced and so fragrant, topped with fresh onion and cilantro and served with a juicy orange wedge to squeeze over. For dessert, I highly recommend the chocolatey Blizzard from Trou de Beigne. Bon appétit!

Full text: Authorities say they are ready to respond to treacherous road conditions and widespread power outages as the weather is expected to turn ugly Saturday night into Sunday.
Rain is expected to change to freezing rain overnight Saturday, but in some areas outside of Montreal, there were already slippery conditions reported early Saturday. At least 10 cars slid off the road in the Quebec City region Saturday morning, but there were no serious injuries or damage, said Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau.

She warned people to stay home if they don't have to travel when the roads are slippery.
Environment and Climate Change Canada( https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html ) has forecast that rain will be changing to snow( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), accompanied by freezing rain Saturday night into Sunday. Accumulations in some spots could exceed 25 centimetres of snow, but only about five cms are forecast for the Montreal region. More snow is expected later in the week.
Transport Quebec teams were out Saturday, and the city of Montreal issued a statement saying it is prepared to act to keep the roads safe in the wake of the changing weather conditions, by salting and plowing.
Nos équipes surveillent l'évolution des conditions météo et sécurisent du mieux possible les 10 000 km de rues et de trottoirs.
Malgré les efforts déployés, les conditions météorologiques rendront les déplacements difficiles. La prudence est de mise.

On its website, Hydro-Québec( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) said it had 100 teams ready to intervene as strong winds could knock down hydro poles or cause tree branches to fall on wires. The utility said there could be many outages in the next few hours, with the regions most at risk being Montreal, the Laurentians, the Montérégie and Outaouais.

Coop la Maison Verte appeals to N.D.G. community to save store

Full text: Staff and supporters of the Coop la Maison Verte, an eco-friendly fixture for the past two decades on Sherbrooke St. W., are hoping N.D.G. community members will make a last-ditch effort to keep the store open.
Co-ordinator Sheena Swirlz told the Montreal Gazette the co-operative store is on the verge of closing unless members can come up with funding ideas, recruit some skilled directors for the board and even volunteer for certain chores. A special meeting will be held on Jan. 16 to explore options. In the meantime, hours have been reduced most days and the store will be closed on Mondays.
"Despite our best efforts, the past has created a situation where we are now almost out of resources to the point where we don't know if we can continue much longer," Swirlz said. "So we are hosting this special general assembly to ask the community for help."
The co-op has only three directors left on its nine-member board of directors, and Swirlz said the attrition is partly because "it is very stressful to try to figure out how to save the co-op."
Customer and new volunteer Valerie Fauteux gets the rundown on helping out at the store by co-ordinator Sheena Swirlz, left, in Montreal on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.
The co-operative was founded in 2000, two years after the ice storm. According to the co-op's website, that event highlighted how many people in the relatively wealthy community of N.D.G. were living in isolation. Founders wanted to create a community gathering space, a member-owned co-operative that would offer environmental products, services and ecological living advice to the community. A "solidarity co-operative," the coop is owned and controlled by its members. Members pay an annual fee for voting rights, and get a discount of five to 10 per cent on products.
The co-op thrived for several years, attracting more than 10,000 members at one point, its shelves teaming with ecologically-themed, locally produced goods, including artwork, clothing and food items. But Swirlz said debt began to mount in recent years, partly because of trouble with a contractor. A crowdfunding campaign( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-co-op-launches-crowdfunding-campaign-to-preserve-building ) launched in 2017 failed to raise enough money to turn the tide.
The co-op was forced to sell the building that houses it last spring because of its debt load, and has been staggering under stiff competition from a chain health-food store, the Branche d'Olivier, right across the street.
The primary goal of next week's meeting will be to find at least three more volunteer board members, Swirlz said.
"Unless we get more board members, we cannot continue to operate," she said.

Look for organic cotton or opt for used clothing to reduce ecological harm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/green-tip-of-the-day-buy-organic-cotton-or-used-clothing )
While the co-op hopes to attract volunteers to help run events, stock shelves and do media promotions, she stressed that volunteer labour is not a sustainable solution going forward.
"Some people are thinking we can reduce our paid staff by half and replace it by unpaid labour ... That's not a functional program."
If there is enthusiasm to try to keep the co-op alive, there may be a second meeting to brainstorm on funding ideas, but she called this the co-op's "one-last-shot kind of moment."
"We need to know if people feel it's at its organic end; if they look at the data and decide its time has come. Or if we have a really great turnout at this meeting and people bring their energy and their ideas and they are willing to offer time, then we can take one last look and see if there is a chance."
The special general assembly will be held on Thursday, Jan. 16 at 7:15 p.m. at the Coop la Maison Verte, 5785 Sherbrooke St. W.

Full text: Staff and supporters of the Coop la Maison Verte, an eco-friendly fixture for the past two decades on Sherbrooke St. W., are hoping N.D.G. community members will make a last-ditch effort to keep the store open.
Co-ordinator Sheena Swirlz told the Montreal Gazette the co-operative store is on the verge of closing unless members can come up with funding ideas, recruit some skilled directors for the board and even volunteer for certain chores. A special meeting will be held on Jan. 16 to explore options. In the meantime, hours have been reduced most days and the store will be closed on Mondays.
"Despite our best efforts, the past has created a situation where we are now almost out of resources to the point where we don't know if we can continue much longer," Swirlz said. "So we are hosting this special general assembly to ask the community for help."
The co-op has only three directors left on its nine-member board of directors, and Swirlz said the attrition is partly because "it is very stressful to try to figure out how to save the co-op."
The co-operative was founded in 2000, two years after the ice storm. According to the co-op's website, that event highlighted how many people in the relatively wealthy community of N.D.G. were living in isolation. Founders wanted to create a community gathering space, a member-owned co-operative that would offer environmental products, services and ecological living advice to the community. A "solidarity co-operative," the co-op is owned and controlled by its members. Members pay an annual fee for voting rights, and get a discount of five to 10 per cent on products.
The co-op thrived for several years, attracting more than 10,000 members at one point, its shelves teaming with ecologically-themed, locally produced goods, including artwork, clothing and food items. But Swirlz said debt began to mount in recent years, partly because of trouble with a contractor. A crowdfunding campaign launched in 2017 failed to raise enough money to turn the tide.
The co-op was forced to sell the building that houses it last spring because of its debt load, and has been staggering under stiff competition from a chain health-food store, the Branche d'Olivier, right across the street.
The primary goal of next week's meeting will be to find at least three more volunteer board members, Swirlz said.
"Unless we get more board members, we cannot continue to operate," she said.
While the co-op hopes to attract volunteers to help run events, stock shelves and do media promotions, she stressed that volunteer labour is not a sustainable solution going forward.
"Some people are thinking we can reduce our paid staff by half and replace it by unpaid labour ... That's not a functional program."
If there is enthusiasm to try to keep the co-op alive, there may be a second meeting to brainstorm on funding ideas, but she called this the co-op's "one-last-shot kind of moment."
"We need to know if people feel it's at its organic end; if they look at the data and decide its time has come. Or if we have a really great turnout at this meeting and people bring their energy and their ideas and they are willing to offer time, then we can take one last look and see if there is a chance."
The special general assembly will be held on Thursday, Jan. 16 at 7:15 p.m. at the Coop la Maison Verte, 5785 Sherbrooke St. W. mlalonde@postmedia.com

Full text: This story was originally published in the Montreal Gazette on Saturday, June 23, 2001.
Sunny Florida was anything but yesterday as thunderstorms lit up the sky and rains pounded the sands of this seaside resort.
It also rained on André Savard's latest attempt to wrest the No. 1 over-all pick in today's National Hockey League entry draft (noon, Sportsnet) from the Atlanta Thrashers.
The Canadiens' general manager refused to confirm he had sweetened his offer for the top pick, but The Gazette has learned that Atlanta GM Don Waddell turned down a package that included young goaltender Mathieu Garon, defenceman Andrei Markov and the seventh over-all pick in today's draft.
"The ball's in their court," Savard said. "It's their pick and they can do what they want with it. We've made what we feel is a good offer, and we're willing to talk until it's their turn and they use the pick."
While Savard said he was actively pursuing the No. 1 over-all pick, he expressed no interest in the second over-all pick that belongs to the New York Islanders.
"It's either No. 1 or No. 7," Savard said.
Russia's Ilya Kovalchuk (left) and Jason Spezza of the Windsor Spitfires are considered the top two prospects heading into the 2001 NHL entry draft.
That's the latest indication that the one can't-miss prospect in this draft is Russian left-winger Ilya Kovalchuk. For most of the past season, there has been a debate over who will be No. 1 - Kovalchuk or centre Jason Spezza of the Windsor Spitfires. But Spezza's star seems to have slipped a notch or two, and Kovalchuk has emerged as the star attraction. There has even been speculation that Kovalchuk will lead a Russian sweep of the top three selections in the draft.
Waddell is so impressed with Kovalcuk that he indicated this week he was 75-per-cent sure he would keep the pick, after saying earlier that he hoped to trade the pick for a young goaltender.
Kovalchuk has been described as self-centred, but he is an imposing figure at 6-foot-2 and 207 pounds, and has impressed scouts with his physical play. He impressed scouts at the world under-18 championship in April, when he had 11 goals and four assists in six games. His scoring feats are enhanced by the fact he led his team in penalty minutes.
"I'd rather have a skilled player who wants the puck and go through guys than a skilled guy who is passive," Waddell said. "In the long run, we feel he's a coachable and strong player."
At a media luncheon to introduce the top prospects, Kovalchuk stood out because he was the one player who seemed certain he would be playing in the NHL next season.
Spezza continued to be the media star, handling interviews with aplomb, but he cautioned that being drafted is only the first step on the road to the NHL.
"I've been working hard six days a week and doing the things I have to do to make it," he said. "But after I'm drafted, I still have to sign a contract and make the team."
Speaking through an interpreter, Kovalchuk said he was looking forward to playing in the NHL and wasn't bothered by the prospect of playing for a losing team.
"In a way, it will be an advantage because I'll have a better chance of playing," said Kovalchuk, whose father played professional basketball in St. Petersburg and now runs a sports school. Kovalchuk grew up idolizing Valeri Kharlamov, a Russian star in the 1972 Summit Series against Canada, and wears his No. 17.
While he expressed a desire to play wherever he's drafted, Kovalchuk indicated he might not be comfortable in Philadelphia. When he asked if he was aware of the slash with which Flyers GM Bobby Clarke broke Kharlamov's ankle in the 1972 Canada-Soviet series, Kovalchuk replied: "Yes, I don't think it was very nice."
While Savard will continue to pursue the No. 1 pick, it appears likely the Canadiens will be content with the seventh, 25th and 37th over-all picks. That means there will be little hope of immediate help.
There has been increasing speculation that the Canadiens are high on Saku Koivu's brother, Mikko.
When asked whether he would like to play with his older brother, Mikko said: "It would be nice. I don't know whether I would be ready before three years, and who knows if he'd still be with the Canadiens then."
When asked if the Canadiens could afford to wait three years for a draft pick to pan out, Savard said Koivu's comments were a reflection of his maturity, and added that most of the players in the draft were two or three years away from the NHL.
"The difference is that a player like Koivu is realistic and knows the work he has to do," Savard said.
While Kovalchuk is the undisputed No. 1, there is growing interest in two other Russians, Stanislav Chistov and Alexander Svitov.
Chistov is only 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds, but his skills are considered to be at an NHL level. When Kovalchuk was asked if Chistov could make it in the NHL, he said: "It's not a question of if he makes it, but when. What he draws (on the ice) cannot be erased."
Meanwhile, the Canadiens announced yesterday they will not offer new contracts to defencemen Josh DeWolf and Barry Richter and forwards Matt Higgins and Mike McBain.
Higgins was their first-round draft pick in 1996.
Savard also said that forward Johan Witehall would play next season in Switzerland.
Help on way for Habs
This story was originally published in the Montreal Gazette on Monday, June 25, 2001.
The Canadiens came away from this year's NHL entry draft with some immediate help for their anemic offence.
And a move designed to strengthen the defence has provided them with the means to deal for some help.
While the Canadiens selected eight players in the annual entry draft, the most significant moves for next season were the acquisition of right winger Andreas Dackell from Ottawa for an eighth-round draft choice and the return of defenceman Stephane Quintal after two years of exile in New York and Chicago. The Canadiens gave the Blackhawks a fourth-round pick for Quintal's rights and signed the veteran to a three-year, $5.1- million U.S. deal.
Dackell represents an immediate upgrade at forward. He has averaged 13 goals a season over the past five years and is a solid two-way performer. He's a bargain with a club option for $1 million next season.
"He's a versatile player who works hard and he fits in well with Joe Juneau," said general manager Andre Savard, who knows both players from their days with the Senators.
While Savard said Quintal's return gives the Canadiens a physical presence they've been missing on the blu e line, it also gives the Habs depth on defence.
There's a saying in hockey that you can never have too many defencemen, but the Canadiens find themselves in that position. The addition of Quintal gives the Canadiens 10 NHL defencemen and they have two prospects on the way up in Ron Hainsey, the club's first-round draft choice last June, and Mike Komisarek, their first pick here Saturday.
"We didn't acquire Quintal to be in a position where we would be able to trade some defencemen, but if someone wants to talk, we have the cards," Savard said. "Our main concern was to get tougher and we've done that with the addition of Stephane. We'll also have Craig Rivet and Sheldon Souray coming back healthy and that will give us a good mix of defencemen who can play the physical game and guys who can help us out on offence and the power play."
One prime candidate for a trade is Patrice Brisebois, who signed a one-year, $2.5-million deal for next season. He is eligible to become a free agent next July.
While Savard said he was happy to have Komisarek, the bruising defenceman from the University of Michigan wasn't his first choice. In fact, he wasn't even the team's second choice.
Savard's first choice was Russian Ilya Kovalchuk, but he was thwarted in his attempt to wrest the No. 1 over-all draft choice from the Atlanta Flames. However, Savard deserves credit for trying.
Atlanta GM Don Waddell said the Canadiens were the most persistent of the 11 or 12 teams that made a pitch for the top pick. The Canadiens' last offer, an hour before the draft, included goaltender Mathieu Garon, defenceman Andrei Markov and both of the Canadiens' first-round picks - No. 7 and No. 25. Savard was willing to sweeten the deal more, but finally got the message that Waddell wanted Kovalchuk as much he did.
Savard also had his eyes on Saku Koivu's younger brother, Mikko, but Minnesota took him one pick before the Canadiens tabbed Komisarek.
None of the players drafted by the Canadiens will provide any immediate help, but Komisarek is the closest. He plans to return to Michigan in the fall for his sophomore year, but Savard is hoping that he will follow the same path of Hainsey, who abandoned the University of Massachusetts at Lowell in April and signed a three-year deal with the Canadiens.
"We'll keep close tabs on him and, if he continues to develop the way we expect him to, we'll see if we can bring him to camp," Savard said.
Komisarek is an imposing 6-foot-4, 225-pounder who grew up in New York. He's a late bloomer who didn't start playing hockey until he was 11.
"I played soccer and baseball, but I liked hockey right away because of the contact," Komisarek said. "I like hitting people."
The Canadiens' other first-round pick (25th over-all) is Alexander Perezhogin, a 5-foot-11, 185-pounder from Avangard Omsk in the Russian second division. Perezhogin was overshadowed by Omsk teammates Alexander Svitov (third pick over-all) by Tampa Bay and Stanislav Chistov (fifth over-all by Anaheim), both of whom played for Omsk's first-division team. But the Canadiens were impressed by his speed and scoring ability - 48 goals in 32 games.
Perezhogin will return to Omsk next season with the Canadiens' blessing. He has been promised a place on the first-division team and will work on his English, which is already better than Markov's.
The most confident selection was Duncan Milroy, a 6-foot, 180-pound right winger from Swift Current in the Western Hockey League. He was selected in the second round (37th over-all) and said he was coming to camp next September "to make the team. I'm not going there with the idea of going back to junior."
While the Canadiens appreciate that kind of confidence, Savard noted that Milroy's skating has to catch up to a good pair of hands, and he's a few years away from the NHL.
The other Montreal picks were:
- Tomas Plekanec: an 18-year-old, 5-foot-10, 189-pound forward from Kladno in the Czech League (third round, (71st over-all).
- Martti Jarventie: a 25-year-old, 5-foot-11, 185-pound defenceman from TPS Turku in the Finnish League (fourth round, 109th over-all).
- Eric Himelfarb: an 18-year-old, 5-foot-9, 160-pound forward from the OHL's Sarnia Sting (sixth round, 171st over-all).
- Andrew Archer: an 18-year-old, 6-foot-4, 195-pound defenceman from the OHL's Guelph Storm (seventh round, 203rd over-all).
- Viktor Ujcik: a 29-year-old, 5-foot-10, 180-pound forward from Slavia Praha of the Czech League (ninth round, 266th over-all).

Full text: The last decade was tumultuous in Quebec politics and there wasn't even a referendum.
The period was bookmarked by divisive debates over religious symbols. The political landscape was upturned as two historic parties crumbled and two upstarts rose. The first female premier was elected. And activist youth shook the province - twice.
Here's a portrait of an eventful decade in Quebec political history.
Dark clouds for Liberals, PQ
Early in the decade, a Liberal - Jean Charest - was premier and the Parti Québécois was the official opposition under Pauline Marois. But in 2010, storm clouds were gathering for the two parties, which had alternated in power in Quebec for more than four decades. Liberal support was collapsing. Media were swirling with stories about corruption in government contracts and criminal control of the province's construction industry. And voters were telling pollsters they didn't think Charest would do anything about it. Over at the PQ, Marois's leadership was under scrutiny. Polls showed francophone voters would happily abandon the party René Lévesque founded for one that didn't even exist yet. They were intrigued by news that behind the scenes, former PQ minister and businessman François Legault was building a new right-of-centre party that would shelve sovereignty.
Corruption clamour
For two years, just about everybody in Quebec was calling for an inquiry into corruption in Quebec. The key holdout: Charest. He finally relented in October 2011, launching a public inquiry to investigate 1) collusion and corruption in public construction contracts, 2) whether such crimes were linked to political party fundraising, and 3) the role organized crime played in the construction industry. With Justice France Charbonneau at the helm, its hearings were broadcast live and Quebecers were riveted to 261 days of public testimony. Civil servants were being paid off. Above-board contractors were being harassed. Construction and engineering firms were rigging bids. In some cases, the Mafia controlled which companies won contracts, how much they would charge, and got a percentage of the take. The machinations were producing substandard infrastructure and costing taxpayers untold millions. It took four years for the $45-million Charbonneau Commission( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/charbonneau ) to publish its final report( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/charbonneau-commission-report-short-on-blame ), a period during which Quebec twice changed government, first turfing Charest in favour of Marois and then replacing Marois with Liberal Philippe Couillard. In its final report in 2015, the Charbonneau commission said corruption and collusion was "widespread and deeply rooted; it made 60 recommendations. A year later( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/charbonneau-commission-report-one-year-later-has-anything-changed-in-quebec ), most recommendations had not been implemented, an anticorruption monitoring group said at the time. And three-quarters of Quebecers surveyed said corruption under Couillard was as significant or more significant than under previous premiers.
Youth in the streets, take 1
Quebec youth took to the streets en masse in 2012, demanding a university tuition freeze. They were up in arms against a Liberal government plan to hike tuition fees, among the lowest in Canada, by 75 per cent via annual $325 increases over five years. With small red squares of fabric safety-pinned to their clothes, tens of thousands of protesting CEGEP and university students boycotted classes, regularly paralyzing Montreal streets. Some demos turned violent, making international headlines. Dubbed the Maple Spring, the movement fizzled out in the summer. An election was in the offing and the protesters had an ally in Marois; the PQ leader had worn a red square in the National Assembly for months and at one point clanged pot lids together as she joined a demo. After she won power in September 2012, Marois cancelled the Liberal tuition hike. But she also slashed university funding by $124 million and later hiked tuition by three per cent, or about $70. That hike led to more demos in the spring of 2013, with some now calling for the abolition of tuition fee. Today, Quebec's tuition is the second lowest in Canada, after Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2019-20, fees jumped by 3.7 per cent, almost twice the rate of inflation.

Historic election
Quebec made history in 2012, electing its first female premier. But Marois's election night celebration at PQ headquarters was marred by a burst of political violence, a rarity in Canada. The new PQ premier was whisked off the stage as she gave her victory speech. Richard Henry Bain had opened fire outside, killing stage technician Denis Blanchette. Bain later wrote to his psychiatrist that his plan was to kill "as many separatists as possible" and that he would have killed more people had his gun not jammed. Marois's ascension to power came as another woman was soaring: Françoise David of the left-wing sovereignist Québec solidaire, one of Quebec's most popular politicians at the time. David's impressive performance in the leaders' election debate helped her party siphon votes away from the PQ, depriving Marois of a majority. Marois's reign was short-lived. After just 19 months, she was defeated by Couillard.
Religious symbols, take 1
Quebecers had spent part of the previous decade arguing over "reasonable accommodations" - the relaxing of rules in favour of people threatened with discrimination. In 2013, Marois tried to exploit resentment among some Quebecers by proposing a Charter of Quebec Values under which public workers - including teachers, professors, civil servants and doctors - would be prohibited from wearing "overt and conspicuous" religious symbols such as burkas, hijabs, kippahs, turbans and "large" crosses at work. The proposal, complete with diagrams to show what could and could not be worn, was highly controversial, with some institutions saying they would defy the law. But the PQ's charter failed to become law after Marois called an election and was defeated by Couillard. Some attribute her 2014 loss in part to the backlash over her proposed charter.
Rise and fall of PKP
Pierre Karl Péladeau, head of the Quebecor business empire launched by his father, entered politics with a bang in 2014. Standing next to Marois, who had recruited him as a star PQ candidate, Péladeau passionately pumped his fist in the air, saying his main goal was to make Quebec a country. The candidacy of the rich, powerful businessman sent shock waves through Canada; one national magazine ran a photo of a determined-looking Péladeau on its cover, asking: "Is this the man who will break up Canada?" It didn't work out that way. The fist pump became an enduring image of the ensuing election campaign. That put sovereignty on the forefront, to Marois's detriment, as many Quebecers were not keen on another referendum. After Marois's government fell, Péladeau took over as party leader in May 2015. But his tenure was short: he quit just under a year later as leader and MNA( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pierre-karl-peladeau-steps-down-as-pq-leader ). In the midst of a difficult divorce from TV personality Julie Snyder, he cited family reasons. But Péladeau remains a key figure in politics. Quebecor is a print, broadcasting and online juggernaut that is dominated by nationalist voices. And Péladeau is still personally present: he stole the show at a Bloc Québécois rally in August, and he's not afraid to publicly castigate the Legault government.
The CAQ era begins
Beginning in 1976, two parties dominated Quebec politics, but over the course of the last three elections the Liberals and PQ saw their fortunes sink as Quebecers increasingly looked for fresh ideas. Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec, a centre-right, nationalist party that brought together federalists and sovereignists, won a decisive majority in 2018( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-legault-rides-caqs-wave-couillard-in-reflection ). More than a year later, the honeymoon continues. The CAQ easily won a byelection in December and Legault is the most popular premier in Canada. Another relatively new party is also on the upswing. In the 2018 election, Québec solidaire attracted left-wing sovereignists and environmentally-conscious voters away from the PQ. Québec solidaire, born in 2006, has 10 seats in the National Assembly, one more than the fourth-place PQ. The Liberals, for their part, came second in 2018, but that result belies its dire situation. Polls show francophones, who make up the majority in the vast majority of Quebec ridings, want nothing to do with the Liberals. Today, the party, which traces its roots back to 1867, has no MNAs east of its Montreal bastion. Rudderless, the PQ and the Liberals both end the decade desperately looking for a leader who can breathe new life into them.
Religious symbols, take 2
When it comes to religious symbols, the CAQ succeeded where the PQ failed. Buoyed by a rise in nationalism, one of Legault's first acts as premier was to introduce Bill 21( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/bill-21 ), a law that prohibits government workers deemed to be in positions of authority - including teachers, police, judges - from wearing symbols such as the hijab and the kippah at work. Opposed by many among religious and linguistic minorities, the law, which came into force in June, is popular among the majority, largely Catholic population. The government invoked the notwithstanding clause, which prevents citizens from challenging a law for violating parts of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, lawsuits contending the bill is discriminatory were launched. In December, Quebec's Court of Appeal rejected a motion( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-court-of-appeal-rejects-request-to-suspend-bill-21 ) to suspend the law while the Superior Court examines whether the law itself is unconstitutional. That court is expected to start hearing the case in the fall of 2020.
Students in the streets, take 2
Seven years after the red-square protests, a new youth movement arose in the dying days of the decade. Inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, Quebec young people again took massively to the streets in 2019, this time to demand action on climate change. They held weekly Friday rallies, often skipping school, culminating in what was described as the biggest rally in Quebec history. Led by Thunberg herself, an estimated crowd of 500,000 dominated by young people took over Montreal streets in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-coverage-greta-thunberg-leads-climate-march-in-montreal ). The youth-led demand for action helped make the environment a major issue in the federal election, held three weeks after the rally. And after largely ignoring climate change during its rise to power, Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government also took notice. Criticized for sitting out this year's United Nations climate summit, Legault now says he'll be there next year.
Where were they then?
A decade ago, some of today's political leaders were not on the front lines.
Legault quit politics in 2009, lamenting that "Quebec is going into a quiet decline." He launched the CAQ two years later.
Interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand, a former broadcasting executive recently arrived in politics, was Quebec's environment minister in 2010.
Manon Massé, co-spokesperson for Québec solidaire, worked for the Centre des Femmes de Laval, while her co-spokesperson, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, was a prominent student activist.
Pascal Berube, now the PQ's interim leader, was an obscure opposition critic focusing on tourism, wildlife and fisheries.

It would have been interesting hear the conversation between Bart Yabsley and Don Cherry before the Sportsnet president decided to fire the star of Hockey Night in Canada's Coach's Corner on Monday.
I don't think Cherry believed he would be fired after his "you people" rant Saturday night, accusing immigrants of not buying poppies. Cherry had crossed the line many times before - insulting francophones, First Nations people, European hockey players, and ranting that female reporters don't belong in NHL locker rooms. Cherry has always refused to apologize for anything he says, standing behind his 85-year-old beliefs and refusing to evolve.

Plante promises to do better after city's first snowfall; Mayor faces criticism for not responding quickly enough to winter's early arrival

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante insists she's a fan of winter.
"Am I allowed to like winter? It's beautiful," Plante told reporters Monday afternoon.
Plante could be excused for hating the cold season after two challenging winters marked by early snowfall, ice storms and flash freeze episodes, and now one of the earliest snowfalls in city history forecast for Monday into Tuesday.
However, hours before the snowfall was set to begin, the Plante administration was already apologizing for a slower than normal response to a dusting of snow and ice that left roads and sidewalks slippery in many spots on Monday morning.
Verdun Mayor Jean-François Parenteau, the city executive member in charge of snow removal, said slippery sidewalks and roads on Monday morning were caused by the fact that snow and ice wasn't removed as quickly as normal since most snow removal contracts only begin on Friday.
Parenteau said because of that, fewer people than usual were out plowing and spreading salt.
"We work with smaller teams until then, and it's the first time we have had conditions like that so early in November," Parenteau said.
However, he said the city called its contractors early Monday and asked them to start the season earlier, so they will be ready for the storm. Montreal is expecting more than 15 centimetres of snow between Monday and Tuesday. Plante said it's the earliest major snowfall in 36 years.
"But we will be ready," Plante told reporters.
This year, the city is giving boroughs more liberty to handle snow clearing by allowing them to declare two removal operations independently of city-wide directives.
The city has purchased 33 new salt spreaders for sidewalks, and will deploy its mobility squad when weather conditions make roads difficult to manoeuvre.
City hall opposition leader Lionel Perez blasted Plante's record on snow clearing, saying she offers only excuses for poor service.
And he said without a significant increase in the snow-clearing budget for this winter, he's expecting more of the same.
Perez said the roughly $3-million increase in this year's budget covers only inflation. He'd like to see the city up its snow-removal budget by at least $20 million.
"It's just a snowflake in the bucket," Perez said about the budgetary increase. "We are going to make sure the city lives up to the expectation of what Montrealers deserve when it comes to snow removal.
"They pay enough taxes; they're entitled to good basic services, and we haven't seen that in the last two years."
Earlier Monday, Jonathan Trudeau, president of the Association des entrepreneurs de déneigement du Québec, told the Montreal Gazette contractors are bitter already because the city arbitrarily changed the way it measures the amount of snow being removed.
He said the change has not been approved by his association and represents thousands in lost revenue for his members.
As well, Trudeau said he's concerned about the effect of the province's labour shortage on snow removal services. It could become difficult to hire and retain employees in the middle of the winter when they are needed, he said.
Plante said she shares Trudeau's concern.
"People don't want to work nights and weekends, and sometimes it becomes (challenging to recruit people)," Plante said.
Parenteau added that various work sites in the city, like the Turcot Interchange project, are luring away experienced truck drivers that would otherwise work for the city to remove snow. Postmedia News

Full text: Five days after violent winds ravaged its distribution network( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ) in southern and central Quebec less than 5,000 Hydro-Québec customers were reported on Wednesday to be without electricity.
As of 7:30 a.m. the utility reported that 5,208 customers were dealing with power outages, most of them in the Eastern Townships and central Quebec.
Hydro-Québec had given itself the objective of fully restoring power throughout the province by Tuesday evening, but that plan was delayed because repair crews had to deal with numerous outages affecting smaller numbers of clients.
A total of 1,500 persons were assigned to repair crews deployed to deal with the damage from last Friday's storm, including reinforcements( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/hydro-quebec-getting-more-out-of-province-help-to-assist-with-reconnections/wcm/95dcd43f-38af-45b1-b0d1-6a3111915428 ) from New Brunswick Ottawa, Detroit and Connecticut.
At the height of the crisis, a total of 990,000 homes and businesses were without power in Quebec.

Full text: In 2019, isn't it time for underground hydro cables? When close to one million Hydro-Québec customers are in the dark again - the biggest service interruption since the 1998 Ice Storm - how can the utility and provincial government continue to refuse to build underground cabling in high-density population areas? The costs associated with restoring power - including loss of revenue, importing linesmen, vegetation maintenance, overtime wages, heavy equipment fleet, employee training, equipment replacement - are significant.
While there is an initial capital outlay in burying cables, it is time to think about longterm planning to ensure the reliability of the power grid.
Hydro-Québec generates billions in revenue from domestic and exported power. Some of these revenues must be invested in underground cabling to ensure Quebecers can continue to have reliable power.
All new and proposed hydro installations in urban areas should be built underground. For years, the Build it Underground DDO team has been seeking a commitment from to the previous government. Now is the time for the Coalition Avenir Québec to accept some short-term pain for long-term gain.

Full text: Only during the 1998 Ice Storm did more people lose power across the province than people did during the wind storms that blew through the region last Friday.
On Monday, Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) CEO Éric Martel said power has been restored to 94 per cent of the utility's clientele. Some pockets in rural parts of the province remained off the grid, particularly in the Eastern Townships, Lanaudière and Trois-Rivières areas. A total of 1,400 workers were out repairing the parts of the network that were still damaged.
"Everybody is working around the clock to get people back up," Martel said. "We're now dealing with outages that just affect a few people. We're getting to areas that are hard to access, and each time we reconnect, only four or five customers are affected."
As of 7 a.m. Monday, 56,781 customers remained in the dark, and Martel promised nearly all would be reconnected by Tuesday.
The regions that remained without power Monday were those where high winds caused extensive damage to trees, which in turn fell on power lines. Repair crews in those areas prioritized the parts of the grid serving hospitals or water-treatment plants. About 50 schools remained closed on Monday because of the outages.

All of Hydro-Québec's repair crews were deployed during the weekend and were reinforced by colleagues from the city of Detroit in Michigan, Ottawa and New Brunswick.
At the height of the blackouts, a total of 990,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, leading Quebec Premier François Legault to compare the crisis to the 1998 Ice Storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning ) when 1.5 million households went without power, some for several weeks.
In 1998, the transmission network collapsed, with steel pylons crumbling under the weight of ice. In Friday's storm, most of the outages were caused by wires on smaller wooden poles near homes. Winds sent broken branches into the network at 2,500 sites, causing the massive blackouts.
Speaking to reporters Monday morning, Martel said the utility knew about the threat from high winds well in advance and had deployed teams in strategic locations to be ready for the outages.
Martel said the utility is still learning the lessons from the Ice Storm and beefing up its transmission lines. However, while the Ice Storm was a unique occurrence, extreme weather is becoming more common because of climate change, Martel said.
"The weather has been different, and we've observed that in the last two years," Martel said. "In the last four years, we have been doing a lot of work in our research centres. We're also testing how we cut trees, how we put new (covering) on our cables. We're thinking of redesigning the posts also. So we're in a testing mode."
Martel added that while some have suggested burying electrical cables to make them more resilient to weather extremes, that's a prohibitively expensive proposal and would not be the best way to make the network more resilient.
"It sounds like an easy solution, but it would cost $100 billion to bury all the cables," he said. "There are also a lot of other downsides when you bury cables; you would still have outages, and it would be harder to find the outages. The cables would also degrade much quicker if they are underground. We would not get our value for that money."

Significant progress was made over the weekend in restoring power to the 990,000 Quebecers who lost it as a result of Friday's severe wind storm, with service returned to 93 per cent of affected Hydro-Québec customers by late Sunday.
Utility president and chief executive officer Éric Martel told reporters Sunday afternoon "there could be exceptional cases," but 99.9 per cent of customers would have power restored by Tuesday night.
"We are doing all we can," he said.
As of 11 p.m. Sunday, 66,851 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
Workers remove a large tree limb that fell on a car on Madison Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019.
Among them were Derek Burcombe and his fiancée, Sharron Perry, who lost power early Friday in the Eastern Townships community of Knowlton. By Sunday night, the temperature in their house was 10 degrees Celsius.
Being without power is "a total inconvenience," said Burcombe, who was unable to take a morning shower, prepare his morning tea or make dinner.
But on another level, "you realize how spoiled we are," he said Sunday night at the Knowlton Pub, where he and Perry had stopped in for a drink with friends after having dinner in nearby Foster.
"It's just the power that went out. We are all still alive, although we are all getting grumpy."
On Saturday, Premier François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
But to 44-year-old Burcombe, the ice storm of January, 1998 "was a whole different thing." For one, he was not worried on the weekend about his pipes freezing. Whereas temperatures during the ice storm were "devastatingly cold," Friday was 16 degrees Celsius.
"You have to look at it as a bit of an adventure," he said. Without the distractions of television or smartphones, he and Perry spent a couple of nights cuddled under the covers, lots of candles on the night tables, playing Trivial Pursuit.
As of 11 p.m. Sunday, the area with the greatest number of blackouts remained central Quebec, south of the St. Lawrence River: 12,201 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. In Montreal, only 230 of 1,051,496 customers were without power.
Power had been restored by 4 p.m. Sunday to all but six of 50 priority cases, which include hospitals, social service centres, water- filtration plants and seniors' residences - and would be back in the rest before midnight, Martel said. Of the 100 schools affected, all but 11 would have power restored before midnight, he said.
He thanked affected customers for their patience and their resilience, and thanked employees, who have been working flat out since Friday. About 1,400 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, New Brunswick and Michigan, were on the ground on Sunday. More workers from outside Quebec were expected for Monday, including 50 from Connecticut.
Martel said the 1998 ice storm, which affected 1.4 million Quebecers, damaged transmission systems, which in some cases took weeks to repair. Friday's storm, on the other hand, affected mainly the distribution system - poles and wires - and repair is more rapid, he said.
If progress appeared slower than at the start of the outages that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), it's because the areas in which Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre explained.
In the case of 70 per cent of the remaining outages, the repairs involve no more than 20 clients at a time, Martel said Sunday, and are often in locations that are inaccessible to trucks and require such specialized equipment as aerial buckets.
The storm damage was most significant in heavily treed regions, Huard-Lefebvre said. Entire sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others. It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole. "We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
Martel noted it's not clear that installing wires underground, which costs four to 10 times what above-ground installations do, is necessarily better. Underground wires have their own attendant problems and do not necessarily mean fewer power failures, he said.

Full text: Three days after devastating wind storms battered much of the province's power grid network and left nearly one million customers without electricity, Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) reported on Monday that power has been restored to 94 per cent of its clientele.
"And 1,400 workers are on the ground to reconnect those 56,000 clients still without service," the utility announced on its Twitter account. "Our teams will continue to work until all Quebecers are reconnected."
As of 7 a.m. Monday, 56,781 customers remained in the dark, most of them in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie and Chaudière-Appalaches regions and the Laurentians.
On Sunday, Hydro-Québec president Eric Martel warned that some areas would not be back on the grid before Tuesday or even Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ).
Martel said 70 per cent of the outages that had yet to be repaired affected no more than 20 clients each. He said power would be cut to some customers to allow repair crews to safely carry out their tasks.
The regions that remained without power Monday were those where high winds caused extensive damage to trees, which in turn fell on power lines. Repair crews in those areas prioritized the parts of the grid serving hospitals or water treatment plants.
About 50 schools remained closed on Monday because of the outages.

All of Hydro-Québec's repair crews were deployed during weekend, and were reinforced by colleagues from the city of Detroit in Michigan, Ottawa and New Brunswick.
At the height of the blackouts, a total of 990,000 homes and businesses were hit with power outages, leading Quebec Premier François Legault to compare the crisis to the ice storm of 1998( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning ) that paralyzed the province for weeks.
Hydro-Québec spokesperson Cendrix Bouchard acknowledged that if judged only by the number of people affected - 1.5 million clients were without power in 1998 - the two events might seem similar.
"But there the comparison ends because in 1998, it was our transport and transmission network that collapsed, with steel pylons giving way under the weight of the ice.
"This time it was our distribution system, based on wooden poles near residences, that was affected."
Bouchard said winds on Friday sent broken branches colliding into the network at 2,500 sites, causing the massive blackouts.
Quebec Energy Minister Jonatan Julien reminded citizens to avoid fallen power lines and not try to do any repairs on their own.
This story will be updated.

Nearly 90% of clients who lost power now back on the grid: Hydro-Québec

Full text: Significant progress was made over the weekend in restoring power to the 990,000 Quebecers who lost it as a result of Friday's wind storm, with service returned to nearly 90 per cent of Hydro-Québec customers.
Utility president and chief executive officer Éric Martel told reporters Sunday afternoon "there could be exceptional cases," but 99.9 per cent of customers would have power restored by Tuesday night.
"We are doing all we can," he said.
As of 9 p.m. Sunday, 93,529 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
Workers remove a large tree limb that fell on a car on Madison Ave. in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019.
Among them were Derek Burcombe and his fiancée, Sharron Perry, who lost power early Friday in their Knowlton house. By Sunday night, the temperature in the house was 10 degrees Celsius.
Being without power is "a total inconvenience," said Burcombe, 44 - unable to take a morning shower, prepare his morning tea or make dinner.
But on another level, "you realize how spoiled we are," he said Sunday night at the Knowlton Pub, where he and Perry had stopped in for a drink with friends after having dinner in nearby Foster.
"It's just the power that went out. We are all still alive, although we are all getting grumpy."
On Saturday, Premier François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
But to Burcombe, the ice storm of January of 1998 "was a whole different thing." For one, he was not worried on the weekend about his pipes freezing. Whereas temperatures during the ice storm were "devastatingly cold," Friday was 16 degrees Celsius.
"You have to look at it as a bit of an adventure," he said. Without the distractions of television or smartphones, he and Perry spent the past couple of nights cuddled under the covers, lots of candles on the night tables, playing Trivial Pursuit.
As of 9 p.m. Sunday, the area with the greatest number of blackouts was central Quebec, south of the St. Lawrence River, where 19,160 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. In Montreal, only 455 of 1,051,496 customers were without power.
Power had been restored by 4 p.m. Sunday to all but six of 50 priority cases, which include hospitals, social service centres, water- filtration plants and seniors' residences - and would be restored in the rest before midnight, Martel said. Of the 100 schools affected, power would be restored before midnight to all but 11, he said.
He thanked affected customers for their patience and their resilience, and thanked employees, who have been working flat out since Friday. About 1,400 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, New Brunswick and Michigan, were on the ground on Sunday. More workers from outside Quebec were expected for Monday, including 50 more from Connecticut.
Martel said the 1998 ice storm, which affected 1.4 million Quebecers, damaged transmission systems, which in some cases took weeks to repair. Friday's storm, on the other hand, affected mainly the distribution system - poles and wires - and repair is more rapid, he said.
If progress appeared slower than at the start of the outages that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), it's because the areas in which Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre explained.
In the case of 70 per cent of the remaining outages, the repairs affect no more than 20 clients at a time, Martel said Sunday, and are often in locations inaccessible to trucks and requiring specialized equipment like aerial buckets.
The storm damage was most significant in heavily treed regions, Huard-Lefebvre said. Entire sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others. It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole. "We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
Martel noted it's not clear that installing wires underground, which costs four to 10 times what having them above ground does, is necessarily better. Underground wires have their own attendant problems and would not necessarily mean there would be fewer power failures, he said.

Full text: The power outages situation has greatly improved in Quebec, with service returned to more than 85 per cent of Hydro-Québec customers who lost power as a result of Friday's storm, but 118,917 Hydro-Québec clients still had no power as of 3 p.m. Sunday, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
The great majority of households should be reconnected by Sunday night, but outages in some areas are expected to continue for some time. In an update early Sunday afternoon in Quebec City, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien said that the repairs were beginning to affect fewer customers at a time.
"It's not any less work, but the results are less compelling in terms of repairs for the customers," he said.
More than 1,200 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, New Brunswick and Michigan, are hard at work to restore service, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre.
Progress might appear to be slower than at the start of the outages that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), when 990,000 homes and businesses were without power, but that's because the areas where Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, he explained.
"Now we're working on outages that affect a smaller number of customers," Huard-Lefebvre said.
As of 3 p.m., the area with the greatest number of outages was central Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, where 21,640 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. Not far behind was Chaudière-Appalaches (Beauce), where 19,855 customers of 242,633 had no power. In the Eastern Townships, 17,245 customers of 90,560 were without power. In the Laurentians, 3,015 customers of 346,575 had no power. The number of Montreal customers without power was 1,081 of 1,051,496.
Hydro-Québec spokesperson Cendrix Bouchard could not say Sunday morning when power would be restored across the province.
"If people have the possibility to stay with family or to continue to remain out of the house, it's a good idea to do so," he said, as temperatures across the province dropped.
"However, it's important to realize that we are continuing to work toward restoring power to everyone as quickly as possible. The great majority of customers will have electricity restored by the end of the day, but we are not in a position to say whether we will be capable of repairing all the power outages by the end of the day," Bouchard said.
"The storm caused more significant damage in certain regions, like the Montérégie, Centre-du-Québec and Chaudière-Appalaches," said Huard-Lefebvre, noting that complete sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others.
It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole, he said.
"We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
On Saturday, Premier François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
Legault acknowledged that power failures could last longer in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie region, the Beauce, central Quebec, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.

Full text: The situation for power outages has greatly improved over the last few hours in Quebec, but 156,165 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power as of 10 a.m. Sunday, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
The vast majority of households should be reconnected by Sunday night, but outages in some areas are expected to continue for some time. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien will give an update Sunday afternoon in Quebec City.
More than 1,200 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, Nova Scotia and Detroit, are hard at work to restore service, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre.
Progress might appear to be slower than at the start of the blackout that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), when 990,000 homes and businesses were without power, but that's because the areas where Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, he explained.
"Now we're working on outages that affect a smaller number of customers," Huard-Lefebvre said.
As of 10 a.m., the area with the greatest number of blackouts was the Montérégie region south of Montreal, where 25,480 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. The next-worst was central Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, where 24,341 customers out of 242,633 had no power.
"The storm caused more significant damage in certain regions, like the Montérégie, Centre-du-Québec and Chaudière-Appalaches (Beauce)," said Huard-Lefebvre, noting that complete sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others.
It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole, he said.
"We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
On Saturday, Prime Minister François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
Legault acknowledged that power failures could last longer in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie region, the Beauce, central Quebec, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.

Full text: Almost all of the homes and businesses that lost power as a result ofFriday's windstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ) will have electricity restored by Sunday evening, Quebec Premier François Legault( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/francois-legault ) said late Saturday morning.
"We are in a situation that is the worst since the infamous 1998 ice storm. But things are improving much faster than they did in 1998," Legault said during a press conference held with Hydro-Québec president Éric Martel. "Between now and Sunday evening the majority of Quebecers should have electricity."
Legault thanked the Hydro work crews who restored power over the course of roughly 24 hours to more than half of those who experienced black-outs when the windstorm hit early Friday morning. But he noted there are remain "problematic regions" where some public may find themselves without power beyond Sunday. The regions affected are the Eastern Townships, Beauce, Montérégie and Richelieu.
The premier noted areas surrounding the cities of Granby, Sherbrooke and Drummondville were among the hardest hit by the storms because a lot of utility poles were knocked down by the storm.
Quebec Premier François Legault, left, and Hydro-Québec president and CEO Eric Martel attend a briefing in Montreal on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019, where they updated news media on the continuing power outages in the province.
He asked people to be prudent and to throw out any food that requires refrigeration if they have been without power for more than 24 hours. He also invited people to use shelters that have been set up by the government in the worst hit regions if they have no other options available.
"At Hydro-Québec we have been in an emergency situation since early (Friday) morning. We have people who have been working 24 out of 24 hours and we will keep going until every client's power is restored," Martel said, adding more than 1,000 people were working on the problem. Forty teams of utility workers are expected to arrive from Detroit on Sunday morning and contractors from New Brunswick were lending a hand on Saturday.
Arborists work to remove a large tree limb that fell on a car on Madison St. in Notre-Dame-de-Grace on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019.
Martel noted the improved weather witnessed across most of the province on Saturday was making things much easier for work crews.
"Just to give you an idea of the scale involved, we have about 250 (utility poles) to replace. To replace a pole takes between five and seven hours," Martel said, while adding at least 2,500 trees fell on power lines across the province.
Martel was unable to estimate the cost of repairing the damage caused by the storm.
As of 10 p.m. Saturday, Hydro-Québec reported more than 217,000 clients were without power in the province, down from a peak of nearly 1 million on Friday. A little more than 6,000 clients in Montreal remained without electricity late Saturday afternoon. Montérégie (35,520), the Laurentians (27,492) and Chaudière-Appalaches (34,333) remained the hardest-hit regions.
Speaking from Quebec City earlier Saturday morning, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said: "The worst is behind us a little everywhere (across the province).
"Things are improving slowly."
Urgence Québec has set up a shelter at 987 du Conseil St. in Sherbrooke. They have also set up several locations across Quebec where people can get services, including the Centre aquatique in Blainville (to take showers) and 349 chemin Val-des-Lacs in Val-des-Lacs, a town in the Laurentians.
Urgence Québec also reports there are six centres open in Laval during the day and recommends communicating with the municipality for details. More info on available services can be found at https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/Tempete_automnale/Pages/offrir-aide.aspx( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/Tempete_automnale/Pages/offrir-aide.aspx )
Hydro-Québec says it has more than 1,000 employees, including 800 linemen, working to restore the power. However, some clients in hard-hit areas will not have electricity until early next week.
Nos équipes sont toujours sur le terrain pour rétablir le service. Au plus fort de l'événement, plus de 950 000 clients étaient en #panne( https://twitter.com/hashtag/panne?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Il en reste environ 665 000. Le travail se poursuivra jour et nuit et pourrait prendre plusieurs jours avant le rétablissement complet. pic.twitter.com/DeybjStFc7( https://t.co/DeybjStFc7 )

The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
More than 34,000 Hydro-Québec clients in the Eastern Townships still had no power as of late Saturday afternoon. Guilbault noted the situation in the Townships was more challenging. The Sherbrooke area was flooded after the St-François River spilled over on Friday after a heavy rainfall. About 30 roadways were flooded after 100 mm of rain fell in and around Sherbrooke. More than 250 homes also had to be evacuated. The minister also reported about 60 homes were flooded in Cowansville.
"It is difficult to get precise figures on the number of homes flooded and evacuations because they are based on the information transferred by the municipalities. Not all municipalities communicate the information to us because take charge of the situation themselves without necessarily asking for (the provincial government's) help," Guilbault said.

Full text: The situation for power outages has greatly improved over the last few hours in Quebec, but more than 168,000 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power as of 8 a.m. Sunday morning, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
The vast majority of households should be reconnected by Sunday night, but outages in areas where damage was greater are expected to continue for some time. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien will give an update Sunday afternoon in Quebec City.
At the height of the blackout resulting from Friday's storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), 990,000 homes and businesses were without power. On Saturday, Prime Minister François Legault called it "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
Legault acknowledged that power failures could last longer in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie region, the Beauce, central Quebec, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.

Full text: Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left more than 800,000 clients in the dark Friday.
Wind gusts snapped many branches and trees, which in turn severed power lines. Many wood electrical poles were also damaged.
The hardest hit areas: the Montérégie, Montreal and the Laurentians.
The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
With blackouts set to last days, some local governments set up warming centres. Quebec City welcomed residents on Friday evening, while in Montreal, the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough said four buildings would be open on Saturday for those still without power.
It's the biggest service interruption since the January 1998 Ice Storm, when up to 1.4 million customers were without power in the dead of winter and it took weeks to reestablish electricity to all.
At the height of Friday's storm, close to 1 million customers were affected by outages.
Hydro said it had more than 1,000 employees on the ground and was also hiring private companies and asking neighbouring jurisdictions for help.
But the damage was so widespread it will take time to deal with the downed power lines that have caused 2,000 power failures across the province, Éric Filion, president of Hydro's distribution division, told a hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon.
"That's more than 2,000 places that our teams have to visit to make repairs," he said. "We have a lot of work to do."

Winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour swept through many parts of Quebec on Friday, a day after heavy rains drenched much of the province.
Filion did not yet know which areas of Quebec would get their power back first, in part because the storm was expected to continue in some parts of the province until Saturday. The storm was moving east and more customers were expected to go dark, Filion said.
Hydro-Québec dismissed comparisons to the 1998 Ice Storm.
"The big difference is that in 1998, the transmission lines collapsed and they had to rebuild the network, the grid," Filion said.
"The good news (in the latest storm) is that our steel transmission towers were not affected... This time, we're now talking about wood poles behind houses and although (many were damaged), the speed of repairing those is much quicker."
In advance of the heavy rain forecast for Thursday, Halloween, some municipalities, including Montreal, had urged parents to take their kids trick or treating a day later.
But in many parts of the province, Friday was worse because of gusty winds, colder temperatures and power failures; Hydro urged parents to exercise caution when taking children out, as streets in many neighbourhoods were pitch black. In some parts of Montreal, children in costumes did, indeed, go out on Nov. 1 to collect candy.
As of 8 p.m., 781,029 customers were without power across Quebec, including 170,658 in the Montérégie, 99,889 Laurentians and 57,423 in Montreal. Hydro was unable to say how many of those affected were residential customers.

The heavy rain led to flooding in some parts of Quebec on Friday.
In the Eastern Townships, homes were evacuated in Sherbrooke and Cowansville. In the Beauce, many roads were closed because of water overflow from adjacent rivers, and some evacuations were ordered because of flooding and a landslide.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault reassured Quebecers all steps were being taken to deal with the storm and its after-effects.
She indicated the government expects the intensity of the wind to drop overnight and flooding to start receding in most regions of Quebec, except the Eastern Townships.
"This is a big meteorological event hitting Quebec full-bore," Guilbault said. "I ask people to be extremely prudent. If you can stay home, avoid leaving your home, avoid going on the roads. Let this storm pass. By tomorrow, everything should be stabilized in most regions in Quebec. Avoid unnecessary risks.
"I want to reassure everyone things are under control. All our public security and civil security teams are deployed and in contact with municipalities affected."

In a tweet, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa is ready to provide any support or help Quebec may need.
Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the wind storms - please listen to your local officials and stay safe. We're monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide any support or help the provinces may need.

Earlier in the day, the strong winds flipped over trucks, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways. A fallen tree caused delays on the Deux-Montagnes commuter train line.
Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights.
They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents to call insurance companies, not 911, to report wind damage to their homes. And motorists were reminded when traffic lights are out, they must come to a complete stop before proceeding.
City crews had to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. Some West Island motorists and residents posted videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Urgences-santé received 122 calls between 11 a.m. and noon, a period when it normally only gets half that number.
The high winds resulted in some unusual calls, said Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoît Garneau, including extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been blown out of his second-floor work area.
The storm and power failures had an effect on the political agenda. Guilbault announced the Coalition Avenir Québec general council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Quebec City has been cancelled so delegates can avoid travel and MNAs can stay in their ridings to help citizens.

Full text: Just under 500,000 Hydro-Québec clients were still without power Saturday morning after a violent windstorm hit the province on Friday.
"The worst is behind us a little everywhere (across the province)," Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said during a press conference in Quebec City Saturday morning. "Things are improving slowly."
As of 10:30 a.m., the utility was reporting that 478,000 customers were without power, down from a peak of nearly 1,000,000 on Friday. Montérégie (86,023), the Laurentians (68,069) and Chaudière-Appalaches (67,391) are the hardest-hit regions. 14,879 of Hydro-Québec customers in Montreal were without electricity at that time.
Hydro-Québec says it has more than 1,000 employees, including 800 linemen, working to restore the power. However, some clients in hard-hit areas will not have electricity until early next week.
Nos équipes sont toujours sur le terrain pour rétablir le service. Au plus fort de l'événement, plus de 950 000 clients étaient en #panne( https://twitter.com/hashtag/panne?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Il en reste environ 665 000. Le travail se poursuivra jour et nuit et pourrait prendre plusieurs jours avant le rétablissement complet. pic.twitter.com/DeybjStFc7( https://t.co/DeybjStFc7 )
- Hydro-Québec (@hydroquebec) November 2, 2019( https://twitter.com/hydroquebec/status/1190468834249117697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
More than 40,000 Hyrdo-Québec clients in the Eastern Townships sill had no power as of late Saturday morning. Guilbault noted that the situation in the Townships was more challenging. The Sherbrooke area was flooded after the St-François River spilled over on Friday after a heavy rainfall. About 30 roadways were flooded after 100 mm of rain fell in and around Sherbrooke. More than 250 homes also had to be evacuated. The minister also reported that about 60 homes were flooded in Cowansville.
"It is difficult to get precise figures on the number of homes flooded and evacuations because they are based on the information transferred by the municipalities. Not all municipalities communicate the information to us because take charge of the situation themselves without necessarily asking for (the provincial government's) help," Guilbault said.

Full text: More than 500,000 Hydro-Québec clients were still without power Saturday morning after a violent windstorm hit the province on Friday.
As of 8:00 a.m., the utility was reporting that 511,156 customers were without power, down from a peak of nearly 1,000,000 on Friday. Montérégie (95,767), the Laurentians (71,914) and Chaudière-Appalaches (68,731) are the hardest-hit regions. 16,137 of Hydro-Québec customers in Montreal were without electricity at that time.
Hydro-Québec says it has more than 1,000 employees, including 800 linemen, working to restore the power. However, some clients in hard-hit areas will not have electricity until early next week.
Nos équipes sont toujours sur le terrain pour rétablir le service. Au plus fort de l'événement, plus de 950 000 clients étaient en #panne( https://twitter.com/hashtag/panne?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Il en reste environ 665 000. Le travail se poursuivra jour et nuit et pourrait prendre plusieurs jours avant le rétablissement complet. pic.twitter.com/DeybjStFc7( https://t.co/DeybjStFc7 )

The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Energy Minister Jonatan Julien are scheduled to provide an update on the situation Saturday morning in Quebec City.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
'I felt like a damn fool': He fell prey to the paving scammers with Irish accents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/irish-accented-driveway-pavers-scam-elderly-west-island-couple )
Theodore can't believe he fell for it. The 90-year-old Pierrefonds resident was the victim of a driveway paving scheme that roped in many West Islanders last month. His trusting nature cost him $3,500. For weeks, he didn't even want to talk about it, until his daughter convinced him his story could help others avoid the same ruse. Last Thursday, Montreal police issued photos of six men, age 25 to 45, who went around the West Island last month wearing orange vests and suckering residents with a scam( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/police-seek-irish-accented-paving-scammers-working-in-the-west-island ) that sounded all too familiar to Theodore. What's more, he recognized at least two of the suspects, and the fact that the police said they had Irish accents.
Cannabis: CAQ government raises consumption age to 21 in Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/as-of-jan-1-2020-quebecers-will-need-to-be-21-to-consume-cannabis )
The legal age to consume cannabis in Quebec will go from 18 to 21 as of Jan. 1. A year after the government tabled Bill 2 tightening the already strict cannabis consumption rules adopted by the previous Liberal government, the National Assembly Tuesday held a final vote on the legislation. The score was 64 for and 43 against with MNAs in the three opposition parties - Liberal, Québec solidaire and Parti Québécois - all voting against. Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs, including Premier François Legault, voted in favour. The section of the law setting the legal age comes into effect in 60 days (Jan. 1, 2020) because the government wants to give consumers and state-run cannabis stores( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-cannabis-stores-report-1-4-million-in-net-income-during-second-quarter ) time to adjust to the new system, junior health minister Lionel Carmant told reporters after adoption.
Study points to 'problematic' lack of English in Quebec health care( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/study-points-to-problematic-lack-of-english-in-quebec-health-care )
A new provincial government study has found a significant number of English-speaking Quebecers across the province "face language barriers in their daily lives" when it comes to accessing health care - a finding that appears to be at odds with the current position of the CAQ government. In January, Premier François Legault said he would not reverse a decision to remove English from longstanding signs at a hospital in Lachute despite concerns raised by nine mayors in the lower Laurentians( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-wont-protect-bilingual-signs-in-lachute-hospital-legault ). Legault said he was standing by a decision from the Office québécois de la langue française ordering the signs to be taken down in a region where English is the first language for about 15 per cent of the population. The study( https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/2585_portrait_communautes_linguistiques_reseaux_territoriaux_services.pdf ) by the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) notes obtaining health services is "problematic" for nearly 6 per cent of the population of Quebec - 454,000 people - who still cannot speak French.
Geoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network.
#Halloweengate: Quebec's delay being met with mockery online( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-halloween-delay-being-met-with-mockery-online )
Talk about your shared Quebec values. Less than 24 hours after the mayor of the Ste-Julie on the South Shore announced that her town would be "postponing" Halloween from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1 because of a poor-weather forecast( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) and even as nearly two dozen other municipalities( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/who-is-delaying-and-who-is-going-ahead-with-halloween-today ) - including Montreal - followed suit, online mockery and debate of the decision has been fast and furious. Many of the comments on the Montreal Gazette Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/montrealgazette/ ) page focused on whether municipalities had any business deciding when Halloween would be celebrated no matter what the weather: "Why are they, "municipalities," focusing on moving a holiday - as a parent you decide what is best for your child (find it unsafe - stay home and do something special for you kids - maybe buy candy, dress up for dinner, Halloween movie - use your imagination)."
Three cars were damaged by s fallen tree on Lorne St. in the McGill Ghetto on Friday, Nov. 1, 2019.
Some power outages from violent storm will last into next week, Hydro-Québec says( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark )
Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left more than 800,000 clients in the dark Friday. Wind gusts snapped many branches and trees, which in turn severed power lines. Many wood electrical poles were also damaged. The hardest hit areas: the Montérégie, Montreal and the Laurentians. The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree. With blackouts set to last days, some local governments set up warming centres. Quebec City welcomed residents on Friday evening, while in Montreal, the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough said four buildings would be open on Saturday for those still without power.

Update: Wind warning lifted; nearly one million Hydro-Québec clients without power

Full text: Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until early next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left about 900,000 clients in the dark Friday.
The utility has more than 1,000 employees on the ground and is also hiring private companies and asking neighbouring jurisdictions for help.
But the damage is so widespread that it will take time to deal with downed power lines that have caused 2,000 power failures across the province, Éric Filion, president of Hydro's distribution division, told a press conference late Friday afternoon.
Starting late Thursday night, powerful winds snapped many trees, which in turn toppled power lines, Filion said. Many wooden electrical poles were also damaged.
He said Hydro doesn't know yet which areas of Quebec will get their power back first, in part because the storm continues in some parts of the province. The storm is moving east and more customers are expected to lose their power in the coming hours, he said.
Filion dismissed comparisons to the 1998 Ice Storm, when up to 1.4 million were without power at one point, with some not getting it back for weeks.
He said the main difference between that storm and the one that hit Montreal this week is that Hydro's steel transmission towers were not affected by the latest windstorm. That will make it easier to restore power, he said.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault held a news conference to reassure Quebecers that all steps are being taken to deal with the storm and power outages.
She confirmed one death: a man in Bromont, who was hit by a tree. "I want to offer my sympathy to the family of this man," Guilbault told reporters.
She indicated the government expects the intensity of the wind to drop overnight and flooding to start receding in most regions of Quebec, except the Eastern Townships.
"This is a big meteorological event hitting Quebec full bore," Guilbault said. "I ask people to be extremely prudent. If you can stay home, avoid leaving your home, avoid going on the roads. Let this storm pass. By tomorrow, everything should be stabilized in most regions in Quebec. Avoid unnecessary risks.
"I want to reassure everyone things are under control. All our public security and civil security teams are deployed and in contact with municipalities affected."
Earlier in the day, as Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million - a number that could represent as many as three million users.
Hydro-Québec says some Quebecers won't get their power back until early next week. 1,000 Hydro workers working on it but the damage is so widespread that it will take time to deal with all the broken equipmen, utility says. @mtlgazette( https://twitter.com/mtlgazette?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

As of 5 p.m., 897,595 customers were without power across Quebec.
Storm damage is affecting the commute for many Montrealers.
Many traffic lights are out and the Deux-Montagnes train service was down for part of the day. The Exo agency that runs the service said it brought in diesel trains to replace electric ones but was also dealing with debris on the line, delaying some departures.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro earlier in the day tried to manage customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 km/h that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene, we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."

The numbers backed up Hydro's claim( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ).
As of 3 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 280 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 115,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Québec reported that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island, west-end and central Montreal as wind-blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
There are more than 2,000 power failures across the province and workers have to visit each site, Hydro-Québec says. Many trees have cut many power lines and many hydro poles were toppled. But main transmission towers intact. @mtlgazette( https://twitter.com/mtlgazette?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Urgences-santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls, when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.
Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoit Garneau said the high winds had resulted in some unusual calls being answered.
Garneau said those calls included extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been literally blown out of his second-floor work area.
Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so, or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents not to use 911 to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. However, some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours was evident on streets and highways, and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Heavy rain warnings remained in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations were being carried out because of concerns the St. François River would flood), Rimouski, St-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.
The storm and power failures have had an impact on the political agenda: Guilbault announced the Coalition Avenir Québec general council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Quebec City has been cancelled so delegates can avoid travel and MNAs can stay in their ridings to help citizens.
"We want our MNAs to be in the field with citizens, given the situation," Guilbault said.

Full text: As Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear Friday that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million, a number that could represent as many as two to three million users.
As of 1:30 p.m. a total of 960,845 customers were without power across Quebec.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro-Québec managed customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 kms./hr. that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."
The numbers backed up Hydro's claim.
As of 2 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 272 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 122,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
In Laval, more than 24,000 customers were without power.
Hydro-Quebec reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island , west-end and central Montreal as wind blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
Urgences Santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.

However some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Meanwhile, nearly 234,000 Hydro customers in the Montérégie region, which includes Montreal's South Shore, were in the dark as scores of isolated outages were reported from St-Lambert to Lac Mégantic.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours were evident on local streets and highways and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Commuters who left their cars at home also had to face an interruption of service on the Deux-Montagnes line, as a power failure brought trains to a halt. Service was not expected to be restored before 3 p.m. at the earliest.
The wind warning issued for the Montreal area remained in effect Friday morning.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )
As of 2 p.m.Hydro-Québec reported more than 55,000 customers in the Eastern Townships, 67,000 in the Chaudière-Appalaches region and more than 122,000 in the Laurentians were without power.
Heavy rain warnings remain in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations are being carried out because of concerns the Saint François river will flood), Rimouski, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 mms. of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15-25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. However they were obliged to take to social media by mid morning Friday to urge residents not to use the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight also allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau and Hochelaga Sts. However some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Meanwhile, nearly 234,000 Hydro customers in the Montérégie region, which includes Montreal's South Shore, were in the dark as scores of isolated outages were reported from St-Lambert to Lac Mégantic.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours were evident on local streets and highways and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Commuters who left their cars at home also had to face an interruption of service on the Deux-Montagnes line, as a power failure brought trains to a halt. Service was not expected to be restored before 3 p.m. at the earliest.
The wind warning issued for the Montreal area remained in effect Friday morning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), with Environment Canada predicting that "southwesterly winds will reach up to 100 kilometres per hour beginning this morning."
Those gusts have the potential to damage buildings and turn loose objects into projectiles.
As of 2 p.m.Hydro-Québec reported more than 55,000 customers in the Eastern Townships, 67,000 in the Chaudière-Appalaches region and more than 122,000 in the Laurentians were without power.
Heavy rain warnings remain in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations are being carried out because of concerns the Saint François river will flood), Rimouski, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 mms. of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15-25 cms. of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.

Full text: As Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear Friday that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in one million, a number that could represent as many as two to three million users.
As of 1:30 p.m. a total of 907,845 customers were without power across Quebec.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro-Québec managed customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 kms./hr. that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."
The numbers backed up Hydro's claim.
As of 1:30 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 254 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 146,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Quebec reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island , west-end and central Montreal as wind blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.

Full text: Re: "Halloween storm plays tricks on kids who want treats" (Montreal Gazette, Oct. 31) What's next - change Christmas Day if there is a snowstorm? I had two children who never missed a Halloween outing unless they were bedridden. Not going out on Halloween night just because of poor weather is ridiculous.
It's a safety issue because of slippery walkways and driveways? Be more careful and dress accordingly, just Iike we did back in the day as we endured rain and sometimes snow.
Changing the date only softens up our ghoulies for the realities of life. It also creates a confusing precedent about what day will be mandated Halloween in any given year.

Full text: It's a bitterly cold rain, and more than 35,000 Montreal homes and businesses were without power Thursday afternoon as a fall storm tried to shake a few more leaves from the trees.
Power outages were reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#map ) in western and central Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and in Côte-St-Luc, Verdun, Hampstead, Montreal West, Pointe-aux-Trembles, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Pierrefonds, Dorval, Candiac and Brossard. Close to 2,000 were blacked out in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Beaconsfield. There were outages in Laval as well.
As of 2 p.m. more than 106,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without electricity across the province. Hydro said nearly 200 teams had been dispatched to trouble spots. While most people should have their power back by the end of the day, Hydro said that customers in more remote areas or where there was more damage may only get their electricity back on Friday.
Much of southern Quebec remained under a rainfall warning issued by Environment Canada. It has increased its forecast rainfall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/an-intense-rainstorm-is-brewing-over-montreal-environment-canada-warns ) to between 50 to 80 millimetres by Thursday evening. The rain Thursday morning was being propelled by high wind gusts that snapped branches off trees and in some cases sent debris from home fronts out into the street.

Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec were reporting no accidents or damage reports in connection with the rainfall.
Heavy downpours can cause pooling on roads and hydroplaning - take it slow out there, and if you're driving, leave lots of room between you and the car ahead of you.
The rain will continue till early Friday morning, according to Environment Canada, and Friday should be cloudy with a high around 8 degrees Celsius. The weekend is expected to be sunny with temperatures ranging around 10 to 12 C.
Elsewhere in Quebec, the low pressure system plowing through the province is being monitored as a possible risk for storm surges and coastal erosion on Thursday, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada.
The areas at risk have been identified as Rimouski, Mont-Joli, Matane, Gaspé, Percé, New-Carlisle and Chandler.
In Quebec City, a wind warning has been issued with gusts expected to reach 90 km./hr.

Publisher led Gazette to victory in newspaper war; Publication saved from bankruptcy - and thrived - under veteran newsman

Full text: He was one of this newspaper's youngest and most influential publishers.
Robert McConnell, who pulled the Montreal Gazette from the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, died on Sept. 12 surrounded by family in Victoria, where he lived. He was 76.
"The Montreal Gazette simply wouldn't exist today without him," said longtime friend and former Gazette reporter Henry Aubin.
Born in 1942, McConnell grew up in the Vancouver area, where he got his first job as a reporter for the Vancouver Province and quickly rose through the ranks to become editor.
Former Gazette reporter and columnist John Kalbfleisch grew up in the same neighbourhood and knew him as a teenager, as both were presidents of the student councils at rival high schools.
"My earliest memory of him involves - appropriately enough - a newspaper," Kalbfleisch recalled. "Students at his school had been involved in a beach party that had gotten out of hand, and a local paper interviewed him to ask why the good people of the city should have to endure being offended by 'orgies'like this taking place. The beach party had been anything but an orgy, but in any event Bob replied, 'Orgy? What orgy? The sand was too wet for that.'The forces of outrage were neatly defeated by laughter."
A clipping of that newspaper article - which had McConnell's photo and appeared on the front page of the Vancouver Sun on May 19, 1960 - was displayed at McConnell's funeral in Mayne Island, B.C. on Tuesday.
Kalbfleisch and McConnell became close friends when they both attended the University of British Columbia. Kalbfleisch moved to Montreal to work at The Gazette, and McConnell arrived in the late 1970s, hired to be the paper's general manager and heir apparent to then-publisher Ross Munro.
It wasn't a happy time when Mc-Connell arrived, as The Gazette was losing $2 million a year and was facing declining advertising revenue. On the other side of the spectrum, the rival Montreal Star was seeing record profits of $5.7 million and was expected to weather a storm when its press workers went on strike in 1978. However, much of that paper's survival depended on the Montreal Gazette remaining as the second-tier paper that it was.
McConnell respected an agreement between both papers not to take advantage of a labour conflict, but when it became clear the strike would drag on, and his newspaper's survival was threatened, he acted. He first ensured delivery to existing readers was working well before expanding readership and advertising, growing the newspaper by hundreds of pages in a matter of weeks.
The result was that when The Star returned to publication in February 1979, readers and advertisers had already switched to The Gazette. The Star folded in September of that year, and the expanded Gazette, with McConnell as publisher, purchased its assets and moved into its headquarters at 250 St-Antoine St. W.
"He declared a fearless, all-out campaign to demonstrate that we were the paper that Montrealers who wanted to stay here wanted to read," said former senator Joan Fraser, who worked as the head of the newspaper's editorial board under McConnell. "It would have been easy for Bob to do what The Gazette had done during an earlier strike at the Star - declare a sort of no-poaching standstill - but he had the guts and the vision to do otherwise."
"It was a tremendous coup by McConnell," Aubin agreed. "He played to win. I once asked him his motivations for doing what he did and he told me, 'I did it for the employees, I didn't want to see them out of work.'And I believe him."
Aside from saving the newspaper, Fraser, Aubin and Kalbfleisch all agreed McConnell's sharp wit and respectful tone distinguished him, as he seemed to know all the names of his employees from the editors to the junior reporters and was friendly with all of them.
McConnell moved to Toronto in the 1980s and worked at other jobs at the head office of Southam Inc. - the Gazette's parent company at the time. He also worked as a consultant for the government of British Columbia.
In retirement, McConnell spent many of his days fishing for salmon or searching for wild mushrooms in the woods of Vancouver Island. Kalbfleisch, who remained close with McConnell, said nothing gave him more joy than finding food and cooking a meal for family and friends.
"He was very sociable in that way, and boy, sitting down at the table with him was always a wonderful experience. Not only was the food delicious, but the conversation was (fascinating)," Kalbfleisch said.
McConnell is survived by his wife, Isa Milman, his children, Megan Edge, Morgan McConnell, Anna, Daniel and Malachy Phelan and his grandchildren, Emily and Charlotte Harrison-Edge and Fintan Phelan. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jasonmagder Facebook.com/jasonmagderjournalist

The Outer limits of the Clown Universe

Full text: No hiding in the storm drain for these clowns, as the Montreal Clown Festival breaks out the balloons for its fourth year at Mainline Theatre (from Wednesday to Sept. 22).
It all starts with artistic directors Vanessa Rigaux and Kendall Savage valiantly proffering their own mugs as targets for pie throwers at an opening event (pies available by donation). After that, it's cabarets, a talent competition, roundtable discussions and workshops all the way, plus, of course, a veritable clown car of acts careening across five days of mayhem.
If you're already groaning at the prospect of a coulrophobic's fever dream of party clowns and burger-chain mascots swarming toward you, think again. This is a festival that looks to the outer limits of the clown universe.
Take, for instance, the Mainebased Amanda Huotari, whose bouffon show, Pretty Face: An American Dream (Friday and Sept. 22), takes a savage swipe at current U.S. politics - though, you might think the unending buffoonery coming out of the White House makes for impossible-to-beat competition.
"You cannot be more absurd than the most absurd man on the planet," Huotari agrees during a telephone chat with the Montreal Gazette. "Although the show circles around him, like a sharpie around Alabama on a map, I never actually say his name, which is a conscious choice. Because, my goodness, the man says it enough and we don't need to hear it any more. So the show's really looking to turn the spotlight off of him and turn it back on us."
For those who have never experienced the grotesque and dangerous thrills of a bouffon act, Huotari gives us an idea of what to expect, or rather what to unexpect.
"The (traditional) red-nose clown goes onstage anticipating that the audience will laugh at the clown," she says. "The bouffon goes on stage to laugh at the audience. But it's also essential that the bouffon doesn't alienate them and continues to hold their love, like the jester who's mocking the king with their life at stake. I love that together we are going to find the edge of our comfort zone. There's an atmosphere that anything can happen."
Huotari's bouffon persona is just one example of the wild diversity of the festival, which this year features everything from a hospital clown to a zany flamenco dancer to an Indigenous clown troupe of eco-warriors, and ranges from absolute beginners to Cirque du Soleil veterans.
"What we're trying to do with this festival is mix all these genres," says Savage, who founded the festival with Rigaux. "I've been made more aware over the last four years of what clowning can be, all the different clowns that are out there."
Says Rigaux: "A lot of our audience are themselves practising clowns. You can learn as much from watching as from performing. You shouldn't be deterred from seeing beginners'shows because that's the brilliance of clowns, that they can constantly surprise you."
Rigaux and Savage are talking to the Montreal Gazette in the Old Port's Tommy Café, which also happens to be the venue where the pair first hatched the idea for the festival more than five years ago. It's an origins story that itself has more than a touch of clownishness about it.
"We had a great first meeting and got along fabulously," Rigaux says. "It was only at the end of the meeting when Kendall said, 'So, I have a confession to make, I thought I'd actually texted the other Vanessa clown, Vanessa Kneale of Les Bunheads.'We thought, OK, well, we'll roll with that accident."
Though they haven't yet performed in the festival, both Kendall and Rigaux are trained clowns. Rigaux was taught by the legendary French teacher Philippe Gaulier, whose past students include Sacha Baron Cohen and Emma Thompson. Savage is currently making waves on the Toronto improv scene.
At one point, Rigaux jokingly apologizes for "clownsplaining," which sounds like the most appealingly kooky way of getting your information. In fact, let's end with nuggets of clown wisdom.
Savage: "A clown has a very small brain but a very big heart. Even when Charlie Chaplin is in a snowstorm and eating that shoe, he's going to make the best of it. It's going to be the best shoe he's ever eaten."
Rigaux: "At different points of history we need different things, and I think the clowns can alleviate a little bit of the pain. We're at a time in history again when we're like, oh, the world's going to end. So the question is: who's going to get the last laugh?" WHAT TO SEE This year, for the first time, the festival is aiming a show specifically at kids with Just Enough, an adaptation of a Yiddish folk tale from Lost & Found Puppet Company. It happens on Sept. 21 at 2 p.m.
Iman Lizarazu's one-woman show Basquette Quese (Thursday and Sept. 21) is about an insomniac clown doing everything she can to fall asleep. It features routines that defy the laws of gravity, which is ironic, given Lizarazu started out as an astrophysicist.
One-time Cirque du Soleil clown Jesse Buck also makes play out of bedtime with Bubkus (the Yiddish word for "nothing"), in which he creates an epic fairy tale with just a pillow, blanket and toothbrush. It plays on Thursday and Sept. 21.
On Friday and Sept. 22, there's a triple bill featuring Alicia Payne's A Parody; Jo Jo Rideout Under Construction; and a duo called Bad Clown and Shirley acting out a certain famous banquet scene in Macbeth BBQ: Une tragédie clownesque vegétarienne.
And there's another triple bill on those same days with Toronto's Hercinia Arts Collective sending up synchronized swimming in Money Fish; Roccio Vadillo combining clowning and flamenco in Vous Étes Ici; and Étienne Bordeleau causing chaos in a waiting room with L'attente.
A double bill on Sept. 21 and 22 sees Indigenous clowns Debajehmujig ("storytellers" in the Cree and Ojibway language) performing the eco-parable The Quest; and hospital doctor Philippe Thibaudeau trying to find a quiet corner in a cacophonous world in Bruit.
The Montreal Clown Festival is at Mainline Theatre, 3997 St-Laurent Blvd., from Wednesday to Sept. 22. Tickets for each show are $17; $12 for those 12 and under. Call 514-849-3378 or visit mainlinetheatre.ca Also happening this week is the Canadian première of Spun, Rabiah Hussain's acclaimed drama about two young British-Pakistani girls whose friendship is tested because of their different reactions to the 7/7 bombings in London. It's being put on by local Muslim company Silk Road Institute, and plays from Thursday to Sept. 28 as a guest production at Centaur Theatre, 453 St-François-Xavier.

Full text: No hiding in the storm drain for these clowns, as the Montreal Clown Festival breaks out the balloons for its fourth year at Mainline Theatre (from Sept. 18 to 22).
It all starts on Thursday with artistic directors Vanessa Rigaux and Kendall Savage valiantly proffering their own mugs as targets for pie throwers at an opening event (pies available by donation). After that, it's cabarets, a talent competition, roundtable discussions and workshops all the way, plus, of course, a veritable clown car of acts careening across five days of mayhem.
If you're already groaning at the prospect of a coulrophobic's fever dream of party clowns and burger-chain mascots swarming toward you, think again. This is a festival that looks to the outer limits of the clown universe.
Bouffon clown Amanda Huotari takes on U.S. politics in Pretty Face: An American Dream at the Montreal Clown Festival.
Take, for instance, the Maine-based Amanda Huotari, whose bouffon show, Pretty Face: An American Dream( http://www.mtlclownfest.com/pretty-face.html ) (Sept. 20 and 22), takes a savage swipe at current U.S. politics - though, you might think the unending buffoonery coming out of the White House makes for impossible-to-beat competition.
"You cannot be more absurd than the most absurd man on the planet," agrees Huotari during a telephone chat with the Montreal Gazette. "Although the show circles around him, like a sharpie around Alabama on a map, I never actually say his name, which is a conscious choice. Because, my goodness, the man says it enough and we don't need to hear it anymore. So the show's really looking to turn the spotlight off of him and turn it back on us."
For those who have never experienced the grotesque and dangerous thrills of a bouffon act, Huotari gives us an idea of what to expect, or rather what to unexpect.
"The (traditional) red-nose clown goes onstage anticipating that the audience will laugh at the clown," she says. "The bouffon goes on stage to laugh at the audience. But it's also essential that the bouffon doesn't alienate them and continues to hold their love, like the jester who's mocking the king with their life at stake. I love that together we are going to find the edge of our comfort zone. There's an atmosphere that anything can happen."
Huotari's bouffon persona is just one example of the wild diversity of the festival, which this year features everything from a hospital clown to a zany flamenco dancer to an Indigenous clown troupe of eco-warriors, and ranges from absolute beginners to Cirque du Soleil veterans.
"What we're trying to do with this festival is mix all these genres," says Savage, who founded the festival with Rigaux. "I've been made more aware over the last four years of what clowning can be, all the different clowns that are out there."
Says Rigaux: "A lot of our audience are themselves practising clowns. You can learn as much from watching as from performing. You shouldn't be deterred from seeing beginners' shows because that's the brilliance of clowns, that they can constantly surprise you."
Rigaux and Savage are talking to the Montreal Gazette in the Old Port's Tommy Café, which also happens to be the venue where the pair first hatched the idea for the festival more than five years ago. It's an origins story that itself has more than a touch of clownishness about it.
"We had a great first meeting and got along fabulously," Rigaux says. "It was only at the end of the meeting when Kendall said, 'So, I have a confession to make, I thought I'd actually texted the other Vanessa clown, Vanessa Kneale of Les Bunheads.' We thought, OK, well, we'll roll with that accident."
Though they haven't yet performed in the festival, both Kendall and Rigaux are trained clowns. Rigaux was taught by the legendary French teacher Philippe Gaulier, whose past students include Sacha Baron Cohen and Emma Thompson. Savage is currently making waves on the Toronto improv scene.
At one point, Rigaux jokingly apologizes for "clownsplaining," which sounds like the most appealingly kooky way of getting your information. In fact, let's end with these nuggets of clown wisdom.

Full text: It was a small note on the society pages of the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 13, 1952: "Dr. and Mrs. Max Stern returned this week in the Empress of Canada from a three months trip to England, France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy."
But as this photograph, taken before their departure, makes clear, it was no ordinary trip. Stern, a pioneering Montreal gallery owner, was on a mission to find paintings stolen from his family's gallery in Dusseldorf, Germany, by the Nazis.
In the uncredited photo, Stern and his wife, Iris, are looking at reproductions of some of the missing paintings. During the trip, they located one work: Judgment Day by 15th-century master Hieronymus Bosch. "Another - St. Anthony - by an unknown 15th-century painter, is being contested by Hamburg law courts," the caption said.
Stern died in 1987. But restitution efforts continue for art looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis. Only last year, two more paintings were returned to the heirs of Max and Iris Stern.
In November 2018, Storm at Sea by Dutch painter Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek was presented by a Dusseldorf auction house to the Stern heirs and three universities who are beneficiaries of the Stern legacy: Concordia and McGill in Montreal and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
Another Dutch painting, Women of Weinsberg, was returned in May 2018.

Stu Cowan: Nick Suzuki hopes for chance to spark Canadiens' power play

Full text: Canadiens fans, along with head coach Claude Julien and GM Marc Bergevin, might still be having nightmares about watching the team's power play last season.
The Canadiens' power play was often like a two-minute horror flick - minus the Chucky doll since Alex Galchenyuk was in Arizona - as the club ranked 30th in the NHL with a 13.2 per cent success rate. Only the Nashville Predators (12.9 per cent) were worse.
Bergevin hasn't made any moves during the summer to improve the power play, but one player who might be able to help is Nick Suzuki.
Nick Suzuki during the Montreal Canadiens rookie camp at the Bell Sports Complexe in Brossard on Friday September 6, 2019. Dave Sidaway / Montreal Gazette ORG XMIT: 63086
Suzuki posted 34-60-94 totals in 59 regular-season games last season in the OHL with 11 of his goals and 18 assists coming on the power play. He added three more power-play goals and 10 assists while posting 16-26-42 totals in 24 playoff games with Guelph to earn the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as MVP and help the Storm win the league championship.
Suzuki will definitely be on the Canadiens' power play at this weekend's rookie tournament in Belleville, Ont., and if he gets a chance there during training camp and the NHL exhibition season it will provide his best shot at making the team.
"I know they were, I think, 30th," Suzuki said on Day 1 of the Canadiens' rookie camp Thursday when asked about the team's power play. "I think I've always been good on the power play. I think I'm a threat (to shoot) and (to) pass at the same time. I think every team I've been on we've always had a good power play, so if I get the opportunity to be on the power play with a lot of the NHL players hopefully we can mesh well."
The Canadiens acquired Suzuki in the Max Pacioretty trade last summer after the Vegas Golden Knights selected the 5-foot-11, 201-pound forward in the first round (13th overall) at the 2017 NHL Draft. Bergevin said Suzuki was the key player in the deal that also brought Tomas Tatar to Montreal.
The general thinking is that Suzuki, 20, needs to improve his speed and physicality before he's ready for the NHL and he will probably start this season with the AHL's Laval Rocket. But the Canadiens also desperately need help on the power play and it's definitely worth giving Suzuki a look.
"He's got a good feel, he's got a good dazzle about him," Rocket head coach Joël Bouchard, who is handling the Canadiens' rookie camp, said Friday when asked about Suzuki on the power play. "He's comfortable. I think one of the things, too, is guys have to be comfortable in some situations.
"He has a good flair, he's got good poise," Bouchard added. "He manages stress very well in situations. Power play, it's like a little bit of baseball. A good power play is 28, 29 per cent. You're failing a lot, but then you're still capable of having those moments where you strike, and he seems to be a guy that can strike on the power play."
Another thing Suzuki has going for him is the fact he can play centre or wing. Bouchard plans to play Suzuki on the wing with Ryan Poehling at centre during this weekend's rookie tournament in which the Canadiens will play the Ottawa Senators on Saturday and the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday, with both games starting at 7 p.m.
Suzuki has worked this summer with renowned skating coach Barb Underhill, who won the world championship in pairs figure skating with partner Paul Martini in 1984, represented Canada at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics and is a consultant with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Underhill's husband, Rick Gaetz, is governor of the OHL's Storm, which is how Suzuki hooked up with her.
"She's great," Suzuki said. "She skates like nothing I've ever seen before. I got to see her figure-skating highlights and she still skates like that. She's been teaching me a new technique that she's been trying to teach all the Leafs. It's just kind of slowing down before you can accelerate. It's blade technique and always being on one foot rather than two."
Underhill also noticed Suzuki needed to improve his ankle flexion and he's been working on that.
"I think that's really helped a lot," he said. "She's pretty mythical."
Suzuki's name will always be linked with Pacioretty following last summer's trade and the former Canadiens captain scored 22 goals in 66 games last season with the Golden Knights, including four on the power play. When Pacioretty scored a career-high 39 goals with the Canadiens in 2013-14, 10 came on the power play.
"It's nice knowing that the team really wants you when they trade for you," Suzuki said. "For them to be trading Pacioretty, a (30-goal) scorer a few times, it's a really big piece for them and for them to really want you in the trade coming back really made me feel good. I just want to prove them right for wanting to trade for me and hopefully have a great career like Pacioretty did."

Full text: With his googly eyes, soft fur the colour of Flamin' Hot Cheetos and unmistakable paunch, Youppi! doesn't come across as a bad boy.
Many fans of the Montreal Expos remember the mascot's goofy antics and hugs. Innocent stuff. His place in baseball history, however, has everything to do with a confrontation that took place 30 years ago today.
On Aug. 23, 1989, Youppi! became the first - and, to date, only - Major League Baseball mascot to be thrown out of a game by an umpire.
The Expos were hosting the Los Angeles Dodgers in what proved to be a chippy, low-scoring game.
In the top of the seventh inning, with the game scoreless and the teams arguing about a disputed call, Youppi! clambered atop the visiting team's dugout.
The clomp-clomp of his footsteps on the dugout's metal roof was picked up on the TV broadcast of the game. So was Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda's reaction.
"Get the f-k off my dugout," he could be heard shouting at Youppi!, before instructing some unseen person: "I don't want him jumping on my dugout."
Youppi! dismounted and protested his innocence by tracing the shape of a halo over his head using one of his large, orange fingers.
Four scoreless innings later, with the game dragging on, Youppi! changed into his pyjamas and appeared to take a nap on the Dodgers' dugout.
What happened next is the subject of some dispute.
Lasorda left his dugout and yelled in Youppi!'s direction. The third-base umpire then motioned for the mascot to leave the game.
The most common understanding of the incident is represented in the title of a 2017 Major League Baseball video( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmzeK6oAtkk ): "Lasorda gets Youppi! tossed from the game."
But Claude Hubert, who was playing the part of Youppi! that night, tells a different version of the story.
"The fans were making lots of noise on the dugout," he explained to Télé-Québec's Guylaine Tremblay( http://bancpublic.telequebec.tv/emissions/emission-42/31772/claude-hubert-animateur-de-mascottes ) in a 2017 interview.
"Dodgers coach Tommy Lasorda came out and the first thing he saw was me. I explained that it wasn't me, it was the fans," Hubert continued. "He understood, but the third-base umpire thought he was yelling at me, so he said 'Youppi!, get out of the game.' "
What's a mascot to do in such a situation?
He picked up his pillow, shook his head in indignation and trudged away as the crowd chanted his name.
At the time, the orange rapscallion's ejection was not a major story. It barely featured in coverage of the game, which the Dodgers won 1-0 in 22 innings.
The next day, in a column about poor attendance at Expos games, Montreal Gazette columnist Jack Todd wrote "Youppi! is a fuzzy orange critter who belongs at La Ronde, not at a ballpark."
Youppi! may not frequent the ballpark anymore, but his ejection is now that night's legacy. In the intervening decades, his exploits have been popularized online. The ejection is now the subject of videos, listicles, Reddit discussions, memes and articles such as this one.
Baseball games - and even teams - can come and go, but mascot drama is forever.

Full text: Re: "Calm turns to storm for fiery Kyrgios" (Montreal Gazette, Aug. 16) This is concerning the incident during the second round of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati in which Nick Kyrgios was fined US$113,000 for his extremely poor conduct, which included apparently spitting in the direction of the chair umpire.
In my tennis club, such an individual would have his membership privileges revoked - period. Perhaps it's time that the ATP bans Kyrgios from competing at least until he satisfactorily completes some sort of anger management training.

Full text: Re: "Alouettes will only go as far as a healthy Adams takes them" (Montreal Gazette, Aug. 12) A happy Friday-evening crowd at Molson Stadium was deflated when a storm delay morphed into the cancellation of the CFL game.
Electrical storms are serious matters, but the long delay suddenly became a cancellation, leaving the visiting Saskatchewan squad with an incomplete 17-10 win. The Alouettes had been competitive and, with almost 18 minutes remaining, anything could have happened.
The rules did not allow for it, but even if the stadium had been largely empty, the remainder of the game should have been played.
If the Alouettes miss the playoffs by one point, this call will be infamous.

Full text: 4:21 p.m. - King Princess, River Stage
Mikaela Straus cut a cool figure on the River Stage. Better known by the moniker King Princess, the openly queer, tomboyish Brooklyn native strutted the stage sporting a Raptors jersey. A protégée of former Amy Winehouse collaborator Mark Ronson, she has a sinuous pop sound infused with groove and soul, and racy, heartfelt lyrics that had seemingly everyone within earshot singing along, as they did on swaying torch song 1950. The singalong got louder on the anthemic Talia, as she sang about being wasted after four drinks and how "I can taste your lipstick / I can wake up next to you / But it's all in my head." Katy Perry, eat your heart out.
5:48 p.m. - Schoolboy Q, River Stage
It was a hip-hop love-in as Compton rapper Schoolboy Q held court in a late-afternoon set. No gimmicks or tricks, just rugged, rousing rap songs that sound huge when spewed by an intensely focused MC and echoed by an on-board crowd that knows every line. Dope Dealer became a galvanizing chant, in which even the white boys couldn't help rhyme along to the line, "I'm a dope dealer n-a," to somewhat disconcerting effect. He's got beats and flows galore, which changed up with every track. Hell Of a Night lit up the crowd with its rapid-fire chorus, turning the pit into one big party.

6:22 p.m. - Janelle Monáe, Mountain Stage
If there was any doubt as to whether Janelle Monáe could and should have headlined one of Osheaga's three nights, it was dispelled less than 30 seconds into her commanding, utterly dazzling set on the Mountain Stage.
She opened with Crazy Life, clad in a futuristic, red and black toy soldier outfit. Singing and rapping with authority, she commanded the stage while dancers bounded around her. Screwed was a mischievous mix of sex and politics that managed to be at once sexy and righteous. She changed outfits and sat on an elevated throne, centre stage, for Django Jane. Rhyming up a storm, she paused with her hand on her crotch after the line "Let the vagina have a monologue," before punctuating the tour-de-force with a sharp salute.
On song after song, Monáe delivered the kind of authoritatively mesmerizing performance of an artist in complete control. Beyoncé, Janet Jackson, Public Enemy, Prince and heck, even James Brown came to mind as she sang and danced up a storm - let's not forget a cheers-eliciting flash of a moonwalk - exuding joy at every turn.
Electric Lady was a funk-soul shakedown. Pink found her shimmying in the anatomically evocative pants seen in the song's eye-popping video.
She issued a rousing call for the rights of women, minorities, people with disabilities and immigrants, decried corruption and called for the impeachment of Donald "Thrump," before dipping into her early career smash hit Tightrope. From start to finish, it was a wildly fun, flawless performance that blew everything else seen so far this weekend out of the water.

8:07 p.m. - Rüfüs du Sol, Green Stage
Sunset was the perfect time to catch Rüfüs du Sol. The Australian dance music act combines shimmering synths, bleeding-heart vocals and pop-tinged melodies into a gently soaring, feel-good combo on the Green Stage, where a few thousand fans were on hand to take it all in.
9:05 p.m. - Logic, Mountain Stage
It seemed like an odd choice, for the pre-headlining slot. Logic is an agitated, increasingly popular American rapper who relies on lyrical dexterity and heavy word flow to prove his mettle, a bit like a little-known MC named Eminem (one of the guests on Logic's new album Confessions Of a Dangerous Mind, alongside Gucci Mane and Will Smith). Now Slim Shady isn't everyone's cup of tea, and neither is Maryland native Logic, born Sir Robert Robert Bryson Hall II. He earned his keep, Saturday, prowling around the Mountain Stage and spitting rhymes backed only by his DJ. But behind the impressive flurries of syllables and ample amounts bluster, there wasn't much to really engage with. It's as if while trying so hard to impress, Logic forgets to connect.
9:20 p.m. - The Chemical Brothers, River Stage
And then it was time for some block rockin' beats. Choosing The Chemical Brothers as an Osheaga headliner could have gone either way. The British big beat pioneers are not exactly on the tip of the tongue of your average Osheaga fan - 70% of whom are between the ages of 18 and 34, meaning many attendees weren't even born when the electro giants took clubland by storm in the mid-'90s. To wit: the duo is not headlining any other major North American festival this summer.
So there was every reason to fear that this would be a case of an Osheaga headlining set fizzling due to the generational divide. (See Elvis Costello and the Imposters, who had young fans heading for the exits in 2011.( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/osheaga-2011-elvis-costello-and-the-imposters )) But Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons' mythic reputation has apparently carried on through the past two decades. A lengthy absence never hurts - the bros had not been to Montreal since 2003.
There was a palpable sense of anticipation in the minutes before they took the River Stage. People staked out their turf, the crowd swelled. And then came those beats - big, pumping. And lights, blinding lights. And projections - state of the art, artful. Like their own generational peers Daft Punk, The Chemical Brothers understand that they're not much to look at; so they hovered over their machinery in obscurity while unleashing a torrent of sensorial bombardment, pummelling Osheaga into submission while creating the desired effect of epic electronic grandeur.
And these guys know how to build a set. Almost an hour in, they dropped their 1999 hit Hey Boy Hey Girl, and the crowd went wild. As they segued seamlessly into their recent single Eve Of Destruction, the link was made: past, present, future, big beats, happy feet. By the time they brought out a pair of giant robots with lasers shooting out of their eyes, for Dig Your Own Hole, off - you guessed it - 1997's Block Rockin' Beats, Osheaga's bold wager was won.

Full text: 4:21 p.m. - King Princess, River Stage
Mikaela Straus cut a cool figure on the River Stage. Better known by the moniker King Princess, the openly queer, tomboyish Brooklyn native strutted the stage sporting a Raptors jersey. A protégée of former Amy Winehouse collaborator Mark Ronson, she has a sinuous pop sound infused with groove and soul, and racy, heartfelt lyrics that had seemingly everyone within earshot singing along, as they did on swaying torch song 1950. The singalong got louder on the anthemic Talia, as she sang about being wasted after four drinks and how "I can taste your lipstick / I can wake up next to you / But it's all in my head." Katy Perry, eat your heart out.
5:48 p.m. - Schoolboy Q, River Stage
It was a hip-hop love-in as Compton rapper Schoolboy Q held court in a late-afternoon set. No gimmicks or tricks, just rugged, rousing rap songs that sound huge when spewed by an intensely focused MC and echoed by an on-board crowd that knows every line. Dope Dealer became a galvanizing chant, in which even the white boys couldn't help rhyme along to the line, "I'm a dope dealer n-a," to somewhat disconcerting effect. He's got beats and flows galore, which changed up with every track. Hell Of a Night lit up the crowd with its rapid-fire chorus, turning the pit into one big party.

6:22 p.m. - Janelle Monáe, Mountain Stage
If there was any doubt as to whether Janelle Monáe could and should have headlined one of Osheaga's three nights, it was dispelled less than 30 seconds into her commanding, utterly dazzling set on the Mountain Stage.
She opened with Crazy Life, clad in a futuristic, red and black toy soldier outfit. Singing and rapping with authority, she commanded the stage while dancers bounded around her. Screwed was a mischievous mix of sex and politics that managed to be at once sexy and righteous. She changed outfits and sat on an elevated throne, centre stage, for Django Jane. Rhyming up a storm, she paused with her hand on her crotch after the line "Let the vagina have a monologue," before punctuating the tour-de-force with a sharp salute.
On song after song, Monáe delivered the kind of authoritatively mesmerizing performance of an artist in complete control. Beyoncé, Janet Jackson, Public Enemy, Prince and heck, even James Brown came to mind as she sang and danced up a storm - let's not forget a cheers-eliciting flash of a moonwalk - exuding joy at every turn.
Electric Lady was a funk-soul shakedown. Pink found her shimmying in the anatomically evocative pants seen in the song's eye-popping video.
She issued a rousing call for the rights of women, minorities, people with disabilities and immigrants, decried corruption and called for the impeachment of Donald "Thrump," before dipping into her early career smash hit Tightrope. From start to finish, it was a wildly fun, flawless performance that blew everything else seen so far this weekend out of the water.
8:07 p.m. - Rüfüs du Sol, Green Stage
Sunset was the perfect time to catch Rüfüs du Sol. The Australian dance music act combines shimmering synths, bleeding-heart vocals and pop-tinged melodies into a gently soaring, feel-good combo on the Green Stage, where a few thousand fans were on hand to take it all in.
9:05 p.m. - Logic, Mountain Stage
It seemed like an odd choice, for the pre-headlining slot. Logic is an agitated, increasingly popular American rapper who relies on lyrical dexterity and heavy word flow to prove his mettle, a bit like a little-known MC named Eminem (one of the guests on Logic's new album Confessions Of a Dangerous Mind, alongside Gucci Mane and Will Smith). Now Slim Shady isn't everyone's cup of tea, and neither is Maryland native Logic, born Sir Robert Robert Bryson Hall II. He earned his keep, Saturday, prowling around the Mountain Stage and spitting rhymes backed only by his DJ. But behind the impressive flurries of syllables and ample amounts bluster, there wasn't much to really engage with. It's as if while trying so hard to impress, Logic forgets to connect.
9:20 p.m. - The Chemical Brothers, River Stage
And then it was time for some block rockin' beats. Choosing The Chemical Brothers as an Osheaga headliner could have gone either way. The British big beat pioneers are not exactly on the tip of the tongue of your average Osheaga fan - 70% of whom are between the ages of 18 and 34, meaning many attendees weren't even born when the electro giants took clubland by storm in the mid-'90s. To wit: the duo is not headlining any other major North American festival this summer.
So there was every reason to fear that this would be a case of an Osheaga headlining set fizzling due to the generational divide. (See Elvis Costello and the Imposters, who had young fans heading for the exits in 2011.( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/osheaga-2011-elvis-costello-and-the-imposters )) But Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons' mythic reputation has apparently carried on through the past two decades. A lengthy absence never hurts - the bros had not been to Montreal since 2003.
There was a palpable sense of anticipation in the minutes before they took the River Stage. People staked out their turf, the crowd swelled. And then came those beats - big, pumping. And lights, blinding lights. And projections - state of the art, artful. Like their own generational peers Daft Punk, The Chemical Brothers understand that they're not much to look at; so they hovered over their machinery in obscurity while unleashing a torrent of sensorial bombardment, pummelling Osheaga into submission while creating the desired effect of epic electronic grandeur.
And these guys know how to build a set. Almost an hour in, they dropped their 1999 hit Hey Boy Hey Girl, and the crowd went wild. As they segued seamlessly into their recent single Eve Of Destruction, the link was made: past, present, future, big beats, happy feet. By the time they brought out a pair of giant robots with lasers shooting out of their eyes, for Dig Your Own Hole, off - you guessed it - 1997's Block Rockin' Beats, Osheaga's bold wager was won.

'Vague bleue'is more like a loud trickle

Full text: "We have so many enemies in Quebec," Diane Blain lamented the other day, just after telling a small crowd that patriots must sometimes take up arms for the cause.
"The federal government, federalist journalists, the Muslims, the Jews, the English, the Sikhs who turn our flag backwards."
Blain said as much out in the open on a recent sunny day in Trois-Rivières, an otherwise lovely town better known as the birthplace of Jean Béliveau. Her words were greeted with cheers from a gaggle of people, part of la "vague bleue" (blue wave), a fleur-de-lis-filled march through Quebec's fifth-largest city. In practice, this meant a sunburned crowd wandering Trois-Rivières, with many carrying signs demanding a secular state.
Secularism is a fig leaf that in Trois-Rivières was ripped away to reveal the loud and hateful few like Blain. And she certainly wasn't the only one dishing out demonstrably racist pensées. "I'm white, I'm proud of my heritage and I like walking around and feeling like I'm at home. This isn't Montreal here. This is why we need to keep our image as a city of whites," a certain Stéphane Gagné told La Nouvelliste.
Diane Blain isn't representative of your average Quebecer.
Not even close. A septuagenarian member of the far-right group Storm Alliance, Blain is one of the blinkered few who evidently sees the enemy in every non-white face and non-French tongue. A video of her two-minute diatribe, since removed from YouTube for violating the site's hate speech policy, garnered scorn from scores of people, including well-known nationalists.
It spurred a larger concurrent counter-protest. And for all its hateful noise, the vague bleue was more of a trickle of about 125 people, according to Radio-Canada.
Yet make no mistake: the vague bleue march was just a cruder and more extreme manifestation of Premier François Legault's own brand of nationalism, one that both reflects and reinforces a broader sense of insecurity. Legault is an astute politician in large part because, as a successful businessman before, he knows exactly what does and doesn't sell. What sells in Quebec? Insecurity. Specifically, Quebecers'own abiding and understandable beliefs about the vulnerability of their own culture and language. What doesn't sell, at least not anymore? The cause of Quebec separation. The two were once sold as a package by the Parti Québécois. Legault's genius was separating the two, discarding the separatism bit, then selling Quebecers a readymade boogeyman fashioned from those very insecurities, one that is willing to foist the alleged loss of identity onto the backs of immigrants and non-francophones.
Since Legault's election, the net result of this sale has meant a demonstrably unfair bill banning religious garb from the bodies of certain government workers.
Dressed up in the genteel garment of "laicity," it was debated then shoehorned into law, with a corresponding uptick in the number of attacks against Muslims in Quebec. It has meant Legault himself travels at home and abroad with mouthful of dog whistles. He's reduced the number of immigrants to Quebec in the name of protecting the province's culture - despite a greying population and a corresponding labour shortage. Speaking of which, he has also pined for "more European" immigration.
Not all of these immigrants would be from France, or francophone, but at least these immigrants would be - what? Less religious? More white? For his part, Legault himself failed to denounce the march or the many words emanating from it. Instead, on the very day of the vague bleue march, he was on Twitter, singing the praises of Mathieu Bock-Côté's newest book, in which the columnist and noted ultra-nationalist decries political correctness. "Thankfully, in Quebec, nationalism has returned to its rightful place," the premier wrote. Indeed.

Seaweed and its surprising subplots

Full text: A story is told about a Japanese emperor and his party who sometime in the 17th century were lost in the mountains during a snow storm and found a small inn where they were ceremoniously treated by the innkeeper who offered them a jelly dish made with seaweed. Seaweed is a type of algae, defined as aquatic organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis.
It seems the dish wasn't exactly to the emperor's liking and ended up being discarded. The night was cold and in the morning the innkeeper noted that the seaweed concoction had frozen. When he passed by later, it had thawed and separated into a liquid and a solid layer. Draining the liquid left a crumbly solid that to the innkeeper's amazement could be used to reconstitute a gel by boiling in water and then cooling. This gelling agent came to be known as "agar-agar," or just "agar," from the Malay term for the red algae from which it is derived. Agar is widely used in Asian cuisine for jellied desserts and can also be found as a thickener in soups, jams and ice cream. It is essentially a vegetable analogue of gelatin, and is acceptable in vegan cuisine.
After the introduction of the germ theory of disease by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century, researchers began to take great interest in culturing bacteria in the lab. In 1882, German microbiologist Walther Hesse introduced agar as a medium for growing bacteria while working as an assistant in the lab of Robert Koch who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for identifying the causative agents for tuberculosis, cholera and anthrax.
Supposedly Hesse got the idea after he had noted his wife's use of agar to thicken a soup that retained its consistency even after extensive boiling, which was not the case with gelatin-based thickeners. Gelatin had been previously used as a growth medium for bacterial cultures but it had a tendency to liquify as the temperature increased. In an agar medium, however, microbes could be cultured at higher temperatures, making it easier to determine which bacteria were susceptible to heat and which were not. Agar's application in microbiology, and its introduction to the U.S. as a food-gelling agent increased demand for the substance. Since it was mostly supplied by Japan, when the Second World War broke out, western countries had to look to their native seaweeds for extracting agar. These mostly turned out to be unsatisfactory but they did yield other useful gelling agents such as the alginates, carrageenan and furcelleran.
Today, commercial agar, composed mainly of a polysaccharide called agarose, is produced by a technique similar to the one that led to its original discovery, namely boiling then freezing seaweed. A number of novel uses include as an impression material in dentistry, modelling clay for children, fertilizer in organic farming and as a diet aid. The latter is based on agar's ability to absorb water and leave the dieter with a feeling of fullness.
While agar is obtained from a specific species of red seaweed, other types of "macroalgae'also have commercial importance. A different red seaweed is being explored as an additive in cattle feed with a view toward reducing methane emissions. When cows digest their food, they belch large amounts of methane, a gas that makes up about five per cent of total greenhouse gases. Bromoform, a naturally occurring component of some seaweeds, can reduce emission by interfering with the function of enzymes in the cow's rumen that lead to the production of methane.
What about seaweed as a food for humans? There are some 10,000 species of seaweed with a diversity of flavour and nutritional properties. Although sometimes called a "superfood" by marketers, the vitamins and minerals found in seaweed are readily available from other plant products. The dried sheets of nori, used to make sushi, weigh so little that they are inconsequential in terms of nutrition. Some people enjoy snacking on seaweed wafers which are actually low in calories and sodium, making them preferable to chips or crackers. The taste of seaweed is largely due to naturally occurring glutamate, the same substance that people are concerned about when it is used as an additive (monosodium glutamate) in foods. Indeed, MSG was first isolated from seaweed in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda.
While there appear to be no reports of adverse reaction to glutamate in seaweed, there is some concern about its iodine content. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone formation, but too much can cause the same symptoms as deficiency, including goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid gland. Most people have no problem applying "moderation" to seaweed consumption.
Finally, powdered agar dissolved in hot water can be poured into a mold to form a thin layer of a solution that is then frozen, thawed and air dried. The result is a film that is being explored as a possible biodegradable substitute for plastic packaging. You can even eat it. joe.schwarcz@mcgill.ca Joe Schwarcz is director of McGill University's Office for Science & Society (mcgill.ca/oss).

Full text: Re: "Legault presents an electric vision of a greener future for Quebec" (Montreal Gazette, May 27) Banning all fossil-fuel heating by converting entirely to electric now seems the favourite way for Quebec politicians to make a statement for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Considering the unreliable nature of Hydro-Québec's wooden-pole overhead power-distribution network, a loss of electricity is only a wind or ice storm away, leaving countless homes without vital heat for undetermined periods of time.
Let's hope common sense prevails by at least exempting the popular electric-fossil fuel hybrids, such as Dualand now Tri-Energy systems in which the oil/gas heat only kicks in below -12 C, reducing total emissions up to 90 per cent compared to a single-source fuel heating system.
And while not ideal, it leaves the option to install a small standby generator to power the fuel furnace and other domestic essentials during an outage.

Full text: In case you missed any, here are some of today's top stories on the Montreal Gazette website.
Plateau Mont-Royal borough mayor Luc Ferrandez announces he's leaving politics
In a major blow to Mayor Valérie Plante, Plateau Mont-Royal borough mayor Luc Ferrandez is quitting politics, saying he has failed to convince the mayor of the "gravity of the situation" and the need for stronger measures to combat climate change. A key player in Plante's Projet Montréal, Ferrandez said he submitted his resignation Tuesday afternoon and it will become official when it's delivered to city council at its June meeting. Full story here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plateau-mont-royal-borough-mayor-luc-ferrandez-resigns ).
Allison Hanes: Montreal in for a reality check on diversity
Mayor Valérie Plante is right about one thing: Montreal wouldn't be the vibrant city it is today if not for its diverse inhabitants. Plante went to the National Assembly to testify Tuesday on Bill 21, the Quebec government's secularism bill. Full column here( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-montreal-in-for-a-reality-check-on-diversity ).
Stu Cowan: Habs prospect Nick Suzuki does it all on way to OHL crown
Canadiens fans have been keeping a close eye on prospect Nick Suzuki's progress this season, but nobody has watched him closer than Guelph Storm head coach George Burnett. Burnett, who is also GM of the Storm, acquired Suzuki from the Owen Sound Attack on Jan. 9. Suzuki was one of six players Burnett acquired in deals before the OHL trade deadline, while dealing away three players and 19 draft picks in a push to win the league championship. It worked.

Cost of métro's Blue Line extension rises to $4.5 billion: reports
The extension of the métro's Blue Line will cost $600 million more than expected because of errors in the budgeting process, according to media reports. The previous $3.9-billion price tag did not include taxes that must be paid and underestimated the cost of expropriations, La Presse and Radio-Canada reported on Tuesday. The new cost is $4.5 billion. Full story here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cost-of-metros-blue-line-extension-rises-to-4-5-billion-reports ).
English school system says constitution shields it from Bill 21
Representatives of Quebec's English school system says Bill 21 does not apply to them because they have the exclusive authority under the constitution to make decisions on recruitment and hiring. At a news conference shortly before presenting a brief to the committee studying the bill, the coalition including the Quebec English School Boards Association (QESBA) plus associations representing teachers, parents and administrators trotted out a new argument it will use to fight the bill. Full story here( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/without-bill-21-religion-could-return-to-schools-sociologist-says ).
Here's how Montreal will spend its $213-million surplus
Thanks to a $213-million surplus, the city of Montreal is paying off debt and setting aside extra cash for snow clearing. On Tuesday, Benoit Dorais, executive committee member responsible for finances, outlined how the city will spend the surplus. Full story here.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heres-how-montreal-will-spend-its-213-million-surplus )
CAQ government's surplus as large as $5.5 billion, Quebec think tank says
The Coalition Avenir Québec government has underestimated its budgetary surplus for 2018-2019 by as much as $3 billion, a Quebec think tank contends. In a document obtained by Presse Canadienne, the Institut du Québec argues that the government's estimate of a $2.5-billion surplus is well below the amount calculated by its own budget simulator, which places the surplus between $2.9 billion and $5.5 billion.

Anglo rocker from Pointe-Claire enters La Voix final four; Contestant in popular music competition equal to challenge of singing in French

Author: Kelly, Brendan

Full text: Colin Moore arrives late for our meeting this week in Griffintown, blaming his tardiness on the traffic on the 20. He just took the bus into town from his apartment overlooking Lac St-Louis in southern Pointe-Claire. As he later quipped: "I always travel by BMW - bus, métro and walking."
He was happy to be meeting a Montreal Gazette journalist.
"Finally, I get to do an interview with an English paper," he said, as he sat down.
It's a classic Quebec thing, what we used to call "two solitudes" back in the day, but with a funny 21st-century twist. This anglophone from Pointe-Claire has been doing loads of media interviews with the franco press because they - and the rest of francophone Quebec - are extremely interested in La Voix and Moore is one of the four finalists on the incredibly popular music-contest TV show, the Québécois adaptation of The Voice that runs every Sunday night on TVA. He's already a major vedette in French Quebec. English people, however, have barely heard of him. The show attracts just under two million viewers every week and has a 50-per-cent market share.
The grand finale of La Voix is this Sunday and the final four vying for top honours for this year's crown are Moore, Rafaëlle Roy, Vincent Chouinard, and Geneviève Jodoin. There is a star-studded lineup of guests for the finale episode, including Michael Bolton, popular Quebec hip-hop star Loud, Corey Hart and his wife, Julie Masse, and Robert Charlebois.
Moore, a genial 40-year-old rocker who pays the bills by doing construction and renovation work, is happy to do his little bit to bring the two cultures together.
"I think there's more (English) people than ever before watching it because I'm on there," said Moore. "Hopefully I've brought a little bit of the English fan base to the show. A lot of my friends are watching it and they say, 'I would've never watched this show before, but I'm watching it 'cause you're on it.'And they're actually enjoying it. So it's good."
Moore grew up in the Valois neighbourhood of Pointe-Claire and then at 18, he moved into the city, spending the following years living in N.D.G., the Plateau and Westmount. He moved back to Pointe-Claire two years ago mainly because his girlfriend, a teacher, works in Beaconsfield.
"I had my share of French girlfriends, that's how I learned to speak French so well," said Moore.
Moore has been making music for over 20 years. He started out in punk bands and then at 25, after losing his voice from a little too much punk-rock screaming, he moved into folk-rock.
"I lost my voice for about six months," said Moore.
He signed with the local indie label Indica Records in 2009 and released two albums with the company, Leaving Home and Heart of the Storm. He was let go by Indica after the two albums and since then he's continued to tour the province, playing regularly. He wants to put out a third album and when an old pal from Indica suggested he audition for La Voix last fall, he figured the TV show might be a good way to spark interest in a new album.
He went to the audition right after a day of work renovating a house in St-Henri.
"I was covered in paint, I had plaster all over my pants and I was in my work boots," said Moore. "And they still called me back. I was so surprised."
Moore clearly isn't your usual music-contest candidate. He's much more of a rocker than someone who is likely to belt out a Katy Perry tune and he admits he had some hesitation about signing up for La Voix.
"I had lots of hesitation because I'm an old-school kind of guy," said Moore. "I'm a punk-rocker kind of guy and I know some of my old punk-rock friends are going to yell 'sell-out'right away. But I'm 40 now. If I was 20, I might agree with them. Now I feel if I want to keep singing, I have to keep it going. What better way to launch my career in Quebec than doing La Voix and showing the people that I can actually sing."
He didn't go in with huge expectations and so is pleasantly surprised to find himself in the final four. He has a classic raspy rock'n'roll voice and so it made sense that it was fellow raspy rockeur Éric Lapointe who picked him for his team in La Voix. He blew Lapointe away right at the start with his rendition of With a Little Help from my Friends (inspired by the Joe Cocker take, not the Ringo Starr-sung Beatles original). He also wowed the audience with his interpretation of Elton John's Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.
But the real challenge has been singing the French-language songs, something Moore hasn't done a lot of in his career prior to La Voix.
"It's been different," said Moore.
"I find that my voice changes a bit. I change my tone of voice because I am trying to pronounce the words. I kind of go operatic. It's not the same as English music. You have to be precise with your wording and your pronunciation. So I have learned a lot from that. But I had fun doing it." bkelly@postmedia.com Twitter.com/brendanshowbiz

West Island comes together to prevent another flood disaster

Full text: Wearing a security vest and clutching a megaphone, Johanne Hudon-Armstrong directs the steady stream of trucks arriving at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
"Barwick St. is an emergency," she barks as volunteers pile sand bags onto a trailer pulled by an SUV. And off it drives to bring protection and encouragement to West Island residents whose homes could be threatened by the rising waters of the Rivière des Prairies.
Shovelling sand into sacks or directing traffic in the hot sun is not everyone's idea of how to spend the Easter-Passover long weekend.
But the fear of a possible repeat of the catastrophic floods of 2017 has galvanized an outpouring of support among West Island residents.
From donating drinks and food to knocking on doors to make sure elderly and vulnerable residents have flood protections in place, hundreds of volunteers are pitching in to help their neighbours.
"I'm a project manager by nature, so I took over," said Hudon-Armstrong, who showed up to help with her daughter.
"It's really heart-warming to see everybody turning out to lend their support to people who need it," said Rachel Shizgal, 50, of Dollard des Ormeaux as she dug her shovel into a mountain of sand.
The floods of two years ago remain seared into residents' memories, she said.
"Everyone has stories. Everyone was affected in some way. If it's not them, it's a friend. If it's not the grocer or the dentist, it's somebody else you know," Shizgal said.
"We're dry. Others aren't," said Pierrefonds resident Dolores Carroll, 56, to explain why she and five other family members were volunteering their time.
Her son Eric Paquette, 24, said he had no problems spending the long weekend shovelling sand.
"It's nice and sunny," he said.

Blocks away, homeowner Ginette Roy, 69, gazed worriedly at the water surrounding the mature trees at the end of her waterfront property on Rive-Boisée Rd.
The 2017 floods, which caused $100,000 in damage to her house, "started just the way it is now," she said.
As she looked out, volunteer Lesley Steeves arrived at the house, pushing a wheelbarrow piled high with sand bags.
"Although our house isn't affected, many of my neighbours are," said Steeves, 46, whose husband, parents and sister were also giving their time.
Seeing so many people show up to help "is a reminder that there's some good out there," she said.
Roy, who has owned her home since 1979, said the property had never been flooded until two years ago.
"It was paradise," she said.
"The water never, never came up onto the property."
Walking around the side of the house, she showed where the flood had caused deep cracks in the foundation, which has since been repaired.
Vicky Belisle, 72, a 48-year neighbourhood resident, was also on hand to check in on Roy and other neighbours on the street.
Two years ago, bags for filling with sand were in short supply, she recalled.
"We have a lot of bags this time," Belisle said.
"You can't fault them this time," she said of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough.
"Last time, it was crazy. People were fighting over bags. People were using pillow cases (as sand bags)," she said.
René Leblanc, who lives on nearby des Maçons St., said he was "cautiously optimistic" of not seeing a repeat of what happened in 2017.
The floods caused extensive damage to homes on des Maçons even though the street is several hundred metres from the river, said Leblanc, a retiree and former city councillor.
"Six feet of water poured in within four minutes," he said.
"We weren't ready two years ago. This year, things are very different," he said.
Leblanc was forced to move out of his house for 88 days and spent $115,000 to repair the damage from the flood.
This time around, "our borough has done a brilliant job," he said.
Each households has received two pallets of sandbags and measures have been taken to prevent storm sewers from backing up as they did in 2017, he noted.
Jean Robert Télémaque, 62, a 19-year resident of des Maçons St., spent three days working from early morning to 10 p.m. piling rows of sandbags in front of his house and building a plywood barrier in front of the garage door.
In 2017, the surging flood blew in the garage door, filling the basement with six feet of water in minutes, he said.
"It's definitely stressful," he said.

Before and after
For Tim Coochey, 60, a 27-year resident of des Maçons St., the difference between the 2017 floods and this year is "night and day."
"Just look at the street," said Coochey, surveying the wall of sandbags residents have erected to prevent the damage that occurred two years ago, when several feet of water surged into basements.
"The difference between 2017 and now is that in 2017, they got caught with their britches down," said Coochey, known for the elaborate Halloween decorations he puts up each year, to the delight of neighbourhood children.
When the Rivière des Prairies overflowed its banks two years ago, rising waters caused storm sewers to back up, flooding a wide area, he noted.
"We had three four-foot storm sewers wide open. That was probably pushing two Olympic swimming pools worth of water a second," he said.
"For us, the flood initially started courtesy of the storm sewers," said Coochey, who spent $50,000 on materials to rebuild his basement, ruined by the flood.
Until 2017, the property had never flooded, he said.
This time, Coochey and other residents are leaving nothing to chance.
Not only has he built defences around his own home: he also spent the weekend picking up and delivering sand bags to other neighbourhood homes, making 48 trips from the command centre at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
The 2017 floods are what build the sense of community on display this year, he said.
"We all ganged up together and helped each other," he said.
"Your kids grew up here, that's your house, that's your everything. That's the nest egg for your family," Coochey said.
Given the measures taken to protect homes, it would take a dramatic rise in the river to cause similar damage this year, he said.
"That river's got to come up another 36 inches before she'll breach that dyke over here," he said.
"If Mother Nature gives us three more feet in the river height, we've got problems. If she doesn't, let's get a beer, Coochey said.

Full text: What a difference a few dozen kilometres can make.
While many Montrealers in the city centre were basking in the warm glow of the first true spring weekend of the year, others residing on the edges of bodies of water in Pierrefonds, Île-Bizard, Laval and Rigaud were fighting to save their homes and their way of life from flooding.
It was truly magical downtown for those who had endured nearly six hellish winter months of frigid climes, incessant snow and icy sidewalks. Trees were beginning to bud. Flowers were starting to bloom. Families took to parks for picnicking. And bar/resto terrasses were filled with patrons soaking up the first rites of spring.
Yet it was anything but a blissful long weekend for those who spent it in hip waders trying to barricade their homes from fast-rising waters.
It seems so surreal and downright cruel, especially on a holiday weekend when many families would normally be stuffing their faces around the dinner table, not stuffing sandbags.
The horrendous floods that wreaked havoc on homes in 2017 in these areas were thought to be a once-in-100-years occurrence. Right. Two times in three years should suggest that we are all in it up to our eyeballs - and then some. Can you say climate change? And yet there are those - like the orange-haired denier in the White House - who still believe it's all some liberal hoax. (Maybe if the Potomac River overflows he'll have a change of heart.)
Trump is far from the only unbelieving government leader. But even the believers aren't doing nearly enough.
It's with a certain degree of irony that some of this weather madness took place Monday, on Earth Day( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-flooding-rainfall-is-behind-us-but-thaw-will-be-fed-by-melting-ice ) - when too many locals couldn't see much earth beneath them.
The harsh reality is that there are those who may have to leave their homes for good, because this continual flooding is clearly no coincidence.
François Legault said on Sunday that it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ), to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes. This may have seemed somewhat rash and insensitive, but many felt he had a point. After all, there are some who have yet to complete repairs from the 2017 flooding and now must prepare for a second wave.
Legault tried to offer some solace by suggesting the government could purchase homes in flood zones, to avoid having to pony up over and over again to repair damage caused by repeated floods.
A for-sale sign at the home of René Rousseau is submerged in Rivière des Prairies on Île-Bigras, in the Laval area, on Sunday, April 21, 2019. Premier François Legault's suggestion that Quebecers in flood zones may have to move is just "a Band-Aid solution," a Pierrefonds resident tells Bill Brownstein.
Pierrefonds resident Itsik Romano knows all too well about the agony of flooding. His house on des Maçons St. was heavily damaged by the overflowing waters of Rivière des Prairies in 2017. He recently completed renovations to the tune of $140,000, of which $60,000 came from the government and the rest from loans and a second mortgage.
Romano didn't have flood insurance in 2017. Now he does.
"When I bought my home in 2007, no one told me anything about being in a flood zone," says Romano, a digital media designer and father of five. "No one knew then. Surveys in the area were done in the 1950s. So even though we are half a kilometre away from the river, we were flooded on our street."
It could have been worse. His next-door neighbour's home was so ravaged that it had to be demolished.
This time, Romano is prepared for the worst. And so is the borough, he feels.
"The city actually started getting ready a year ago, and that's been the difference so far," says Romano, who credits Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis for stepping up. "Communication has been amazing. They've been leaving sandbags at our doors. They've been sending volunteers. And, perhaps most importantly, they've been dealing with infrastructure issues to avoid the river from flowing into our street like the last time."
So far, so good. Romano's street and others in the area are dry. Two years ago, he had no sandbags; now his house is barricaded by them.
"We're not out of danger yet, but we're making sure that all our neighbours are protected this time."
In fact, Romano and his kids spent much of the holiday weekend filling up sandbags for others in their community.
Romano takes issue with Legault's comments about possibly moving residents from flood zones.
"Moving thousands of people around is just a Band-Aid solution which won't solve the problem," he says. "It would be a lot more effective and much cheaper to reinvest in the infrastructure. It has worked in countries like the Netherlands, and is working so far for us.
"We're not moving, either. We love this community. Over the last two years, we've been brought together and are now one big family."

Full text: Quebecers woke up Monday morning to a second week of spring flooding, with the worst of the damage in the Beauce region. The premier of Quebec had mused whether the time had come for some riverfront homeowners to consider moving elsewhere( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ).
As of 8:30 a.m. Monday, Urgence Québec reported that 2,389 homes across the province had been flooded, while 717 households had been cut off from their communities by floodwaters and 1,509 residents evacuated from their homes. Major flooding was recorded at five sites along Lac St. Pierre, the Chaudière River and Lac des Deux-Montagnes.
During a tour of flooded areas in Laval on Sunday, Premier Francois Legault wondered whether the time had come for those who find themselves repeatedly flooded during the spring thaw to relocate to higher ground. "If we have to oblige people to move, we will do so," he said, adding that "we have to be lucid" and understand that Quebec taxpayers should not have to pay for flood damage every other year. (Do you agree with the premier? Take our poll at the bottom of the story on what, if anything, the government should do about properties that are regularly flooded.)
That stark choice was particularly personal for Anna Lin and Eddy Girard, who spent Sunday watching the waters rise at the edge of their property on Île Bigras in Laval.
Since the floods of 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-victims-living-in-bureaucratic-limbo ), the two say they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate their home against flooding. They have lifted the structure by three feet and installed a waterproof foundation. Yet they worry it won't be enough.

"It's discouraging," said Girard. "It's tough to keep your morale up and it's tough for the family because there are always arguments. Do we rebuild? Do we leave? It's a big decision to make."
During his tour of Laval, Legault was informed that the water levels were expected to continue to rise until Wednesday at least.
Meanwhile, the most critical flooding thus far was in the Beauce region. A total of 200 people had to leave the town of Scott, an operation made more dramatic by the fact a fire broke out in a local machine shop, only to be extinguished in part by the flooding.
Water levels were also rising in the Outaouais area and in Rigaud, a town that was hard hit by 2017's floods( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/watch-st-lazare-resident-captures-birds-eye-view-of-rigaud-flooding ), although weather forecasts suggest that this year's damage may not be as severe.
"The weather is on our side," said Quebec civil protection spokesperson Éric Houde. "There are other rain systems on the way, but the water that's flowing now won't be back."
Environment Canada predicts the spring thaw will be fed by melting ice rather than rain.
"The heavy rainfalls are behind us," said meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère. "Now we're looking at runoff over the next few days, but no rain for Monday or Tuesday."
Called in as reinforcements for local civil protection staff, a total of 600 Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed throughout Quebec, about 30 of whom will be deployed Monday in Île-Bizard-Sainte-Geneviève. The soldiers have been assigned to shore up sandbagging and dike reinforcement in areas at risk.
Urgences Québec is urging citizens who have to leave their homes because of the flooding to inform their municipality and to leave a note in their mailbox stating the time of their departure and their destination.
The extent of flooding and the status of water levels in various regions can be consulted at the Quebec public security website.( https://geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/ )

Premier François Legault said Sunday it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move away to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes.
Visiting Île-Bigras, the largest of the Laval Islands in the Rivière des Prairies, Legault stopped to chat with homeowner René Rousseau, part of whose house is under water for the second time in three years.
"You have to ask yourself the question, do we think that this will keep happening regularly, because if so, it's not the same decision," he said to Rousseau, who had asked Legault how the government would help him out.
"We'll see what we can do that would be reasonable," Legault told him.
Later, Legault told reporters given the increasing frequency of floods because of climate change, the government would purchase homes in flood zones to avoid having to be on the hook to repair damage caused by repeated floods.
Premier François Legault (left) shakes tours the Île-Bigras area of Laval with Laval Mayor Marc Demers on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
"Now it's twice in three years. So for sure there must be the impact of climate change and we have to adjust our programs," he said.
We have to adjust our programs to rapidly compensate people who have damage and need to do renovations. But at the same time, we have to be lucid, and if it's necessary to force people to move, we will have to do it," he said.
A "For Sale" sign on Rousseau's property peeked up through the water.
Rousseau, who has owned the house for 30 years, said he has dropped his price from $900,000 to just under $700,000, but eventually the house might end up being demolished. "The reason is simple: it's in a flood zone," he said.
Earlier, Laval police chief Pierre Brochet said the city has delivered two pallets of filled sandbags to all of the 950 homes at risk of being flooded. While there was less rain than expected over the weekend, Sunday's bright sun and warm temperatures could melt frozen ground and cause waters to continue to rise, he said.
Brochet said the indications suggest the water might not rise quite as high as in 2017 in Laval and predicted the worst would be past by Wednesday.
Later, Legault visited Île-Bizard with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.
In the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, mayor Jim Beis appealed on Facebook for volunteers, trucks, trailers and empty bags to fill sand.
"It's not because it's sunny or clear that we're out of trouble here," he said in a video from the grounds of Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School at Anselme Lavigne Ave. and Rene Emard St. In Pierrefonds.
"We have 48 hours or so that we're really in a critical zone, so we're hoping that everybody comes out," Beis said.
In Rigaud, where 24 homes and 146 people in the flood zone near the Ottawa River were evacuated Thursday and 50 homes were isolated by flooding, residents watched nervously, fearing a repeat of 2017, when record flooding forced thousands from their homes.
William Bradley, whose house in Rigaud sits on a street that hugs the river, said Saturday he filled several hundred city-supplied sandbags this week. He's stacked them four high around doors and windows, wrapping the makeshift barriers in polyethylene.
William Bradley wades through floodwaters on a street next to his home on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"It's still coming up, coming up," said Bradley, 72.
He said flooding two years ago caused about $100,000 in damage to the ceramics equipment he stores at home for his small business.
As of Sunday morning( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/CruePrintaniere/Pages/Bilan-provincial-des-cons%C3%A9quences.aspx ), rising river levels had resulted in 980 flooded residences (up from 903 Saturday), 377 isolated residences (up from 251) and 1,264 evacuees across the province (up from 317), according to Urgence Québec.
Eight major floods were identified by Urgence Québec on Saturday evening, threatening thousands of Quebecers: the Chaudière River at St-Georges, St-Joseph, Scott and Vallée-Jonction, all in the Beauce region; Lake of Two Mountains at Rigaud and Quesnel Bay; and the Beaurivage River in Lévis in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

Premier François Legault will visit flooded areas in Île-Bigras south of Laval on Sunday afternoon.
About 200 soldiers started filling sandbags and carrying out evacuations in Quebec's Outaouais and Mauricie regions Saturday night, with an additional 400 troops standing ready to deploy there and in Laval on Sunday, said Brig.-Gen. Jennie Carignan.
A Jeep makes its way along a flooded road in the town of Rigaud on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
The soldiers are "extremely well-trained and prepared" for the flood fight, Carignan said. "They are used to doing it."
Quebec's public safety minister urged residents to stay safe and co-operate with authorities.
"Be careful, be vigilant ... please," Geneviève Guilbault said alongside Carignan at Canadian Forces Base Longue-Pointe in Montreal on Saturday evening.
A vehicle is seen in a gaping hole in the road in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa on Saturday.
Guilbault also offered her condolences to the family of Louise Seguin Lortie, who died early Saturday morning after driving her car into a massive sinkhole caused by flooding in the Outaouais region, according to police.
The accident left the 72-year-old's sedan upside down in a swollen stream after rising river levels swept away part of the road overnight, police said.
Sgt. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines police said a pair of witnesses parked near the washout tried unsuccessfully to warn the driver as she approached.
"That lady, who was driving by herself on that road, fell into a sinkhole basically because of the flooding. There was a culvert that was not there anymore, so the road was cut in half and she was not able to brake and avoid the accident," Fournel told The Canadian Press.
The woman was taken to hospital, but died shortly after, he said.
The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.
Pontiac, which sits along the Ottawa River, is one of at least four municipalities in the Outaouais region to declare states of emergency, along with Gatineau, St-André-Avellin and Val-des-Monts. Trois-Rivières is also under a state of emergency.
"We'll stay as long as we have gas for the generator. We've got a boat - my daughter bought a boat and a motor for us in 2017," he said. "By the way, never buy a boat during a flood season. It gets pricey."
In Deux Montagnes, where flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2017, city workers scrambled to put the finishing touches on a series of dikes Saturday night. The fruit of their labour is an impressive feat of engineering: a 10-foot cinderblock wall that stretches hundreds of meters along the shoreline.
They've been working at it since Tuesday and will continue reinforcing the structure into Sunday morning.

"We feel ready this year," said Éric Bélisle, who lives on 12th Ave. "In 2017, we lost a lot of houses on this street. There was six feet of water in my basement because the flooding backed up the city's sewers."
In Laval as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
More than 45 millimetres of rain fell on the Montreal area between Thursday and Saturday, according to Environment Canada. Rainfall warnings have been lifted, but water levels were already high and are expected to rise sharply over the weekend with warm temperatures and snowmelt runoff.
The city of Laval, just north of Montreal, said in a statement it had distributed sandbags to 900 homes and knocked on 550 doors to make sure people were safe as more than 1,500 homes and business remained under flood watch.
Quebec City and the Gaspé Peninsula can expect up to 30 millimetres of rainfall this weekend, said Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.
People are pulled in a small boat along a residential street in Rigaud on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"That will help the snow to melt again, and we do not expect the river will be able to go down for at least 48 hours," he said Saturday.
Guilbault has said the province will allow stores - usually closed on Easter Sunday - to remain open this weekend so residents can stock up on supplies.
Some of the worst flooding Saturday appeared to surge through the Beauce region south of Quebec City, where 868 homes were flooded and 94 people evacuated as of 3 p.m., according to an Urgence Québec bulletin.
In Montreal as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
In Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City, officials have asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance with evacuations ordered by the municipality.
Earlier this week, the Chaudière River burst its banks and flooded a large part of downtown. Officials called it the worst flooding since 1971, with 230 homes and businesses flooded.
In St-Raymond, about 60 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, 24 seniors in three residences have been moved to higher ground as the Ste-Anne River continues to rise.

A local dam gave way Saturday, said Mayor Daniel Dion, prompting concerns about flooding. "The problem today is that there is a lot of ice. If they clog our channels, the water will have no space to circulate and that's where it overflows," he said.
In the Mauricie region, Canadian Armed Forces are focusing on Trois-Rivières as well as the municipalities of Becancour, Louiseville, Maskinonge and Yamachiche.
Floodwater from the St. John River carries ice and debris onto the green and pathways in downtown Fredericton, N.B., on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
Meanwhile, about 120 Canadian soldiers are being deployed across western New Brunswick to help residents threatened by rising floodwaters.
Fifteen communities in that province have been warned to remain on high alert.

Full text: Many Quebecers were spending their Sunday filling sandbags as they kept an anxious watch on rising floodwaters across the province and in neighbouring New Brunswick.
In the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, mayor Jim Beis appealed on Facebook for volunteers, trucks, trailers and empty bags to fill sand.
"It's not because it's sunny or clear that we're out of trouble here," he said in a video from the grounds of Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School at Anselme Lavigne Ave. and Rene Emard St. In Pierrefonds.
"We have 48 hours or so that we're really in a critical zone, so we're hoping that everybody comes out," Beis said.
In Rigaud, where 24 homes and 146 people in the flood zone near the Ottawa River were evacuated Thursday and 50 homes were isolated by flooding, residents watched nervously, fearing a repeat of 2017, when record flooding forced thousands from their homes.
William Bradley, whose house in Rigaud sits on a street that hugs the river, said Saturday that he filled several hundred city-supplied sandbags this week. He's stacked them four high around doors and windows, wrapping the makeshift barriers in polyethylene.
William Bradley wades through floodwaters on a residential street next to his home Saturday.
"It's still coming up, coming up," said Bradley, 72.
He said flooding two years ago caused about $100,000 in damage to the ceramics equipment he stores at home for his small business.
As of Sunday morning( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/CruePrintaniere/Pages/Bilan-provincial-des-cons%C3%A9quences.aspx ), rising river levels had resulted in 980 flooded residences (up from 903 Saturday), 377 isolated residences (up from 251) and 1,264 evacuees across the province (up from 317), according to Urgence Québec.
Eight major floods were identified by Urgence Québec on Saturday evening, threatening thousands of Quebecers: the Chaudière River at Saint-Georges, Saint-Joseph, Scott and Vallée-Jonction, all in the Beauce region; Lake of Two Mountains at Rigaud and Quesnel Bay; and the Beaurivage River in Lévis in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

Premier François Legault will visit flooded areas in Île-Bigras south of Laval Sunday afternoon.
About 200 soldiers started filling sandbags and carrying out evacuations in Quebec's Outaouais and Mauricie regions Saturday night, with an additional 400 troops standing ready to deploy there and in Laval on Sunday, said Brig.-Gen. Jennie Carignan.

The soldiers are "extremely well-trained and prepared" for the flood fight, Carignan said. "They are used to doing it."
Quebec's public safety minister urged residents to stay safe and co-operate with authorities.
"Be careful, be vigilant ... please," Geneviève Guilbault said alongside Carignan at Canadian Forces Base Longue-Pointe in Montreal Saturday evening.
A vehicle is seen in a gaping hole in the road in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 km northwest of Ottawa on Saturday.
Guilbault also offered her condolences to the family of Louise Seguin Lortie, who died early Saturday morning after driving her car into a massive sinkhole caused by flooding in the Outaouais region, according to police.
The accident left the 72-year-old's sedan upside down in a swollen stream after rising river levels swept away part of the road overnight, police said.
Sgt. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines police said a pair of witnesses parked near the washout tried unsuccessfully to warn the driver as she approached.
"That lady, who was driving by herself on that road, fell into a sinkhole basically because of the flooding. There was a culvert that was not there anymore, so the road was cut in half and she was not able to brake and avoid the accident," Fournel told The Canadian Press.
The woman was taken to hospital but died shortly after, he said.
The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.
Pontiac, which sits along the Ottawa River, is one of at least four municipalities in the Outaouais region to declare states of emergency, along with Gatineau, Saint-André-Avellin and Val-des-Monts. Trois-Rivières is also under a state of emergency.
"We'll stay as long as we have gas for the generator. We've got a boat - my daughter bought a boat and a motor for us in 2017," he said. "By the way, never buy a boat during a flood season. It gets pricey."
In Deux Montagnes, where flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2017, city workers scrambled to put the finishing touches on a series of dikes Saturday night. The fruit of their labour is an impressive feat of engineering: a 10-foot cinderblock wall that stretches hundreds of meters along the shoreline.
They've been working at it since Tuesday and will continue reinforcing the structure into Sunday morning.

"We feel ready this year," said Éric Bélisle, who lives on 12th Ave. "In 2017, we lost a lot of houses on this street. There was six feet of water in my basement because the flooding backed up the city's sewers."
In Laval as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
More than 45 millimetres of rain fell on the Montreal area between Thursday and Saturday, according to Environment Canada. Rainfall warnings have been lifted, but water levels were already high and are expected to rise sharply over the weekend with warm temperatures and snowmelt runoff.
The city of Laval, just north of Montreal, said in a statement it had distributed sandbags to 900 homes and knocked on 550 doors to make sure people were safe as more than 1,500 homes and business remained under flood watch.
Quebec City and the Gaspé Peninsula can expect up to 30 millimetres of rainfall this weekend, said Environment Canada meteorologist Andre Cantin.
People are pulled in a small boat along a residential street in Rigaud on Saturday, April 20, 2019.
"That will help the snow to melt again, and we do not expect the river will be able to go down for at least 48 hours," he said Saturday.
Guilbault has said the province will allow stores - usually closed on Easter Sunday - to remain open this weekend so residents can stock up on supplies.
Some of the worst flooding Saturday appeared to surge through the Beauce region south of Quebec City, where 868 homes were flooded and 94 people evacuated as of 3 p.m., according to an Urgence Québec bulletin.
In Montreal as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
In Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City, officials have asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance with evacuations ordered by the municipality.
Earlier this week, the Chaudière River burst its banks and flooded a large part of downtown. Officials called it the worst flooding since 1971, with 230 homes and businesses flooded.
In Saint-Raymond, about 60 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, 24 seniors in three residences have been moved to higher ground as the Ste-Anne River continues to rise.

A local dam gave way Saturday, said Mayor Daniel Dion, prompting concerns about flooding. "The problem today is that there is a lot of ice. If they clog our channels, the water will have no space to circulate and that's where it overflows," he said.
In the Mauricie region, Canadian Armed Forces are focusing on Trois-Rivières as well as the municipalities of Becancour, Louiseville, Maskinonge and Yamachiche.

Full text: About 400 people cheered and waved placards Sunday as politicians, community leaders and educators denounced Bill 21 at a rally in Côte St-Luc.
The secularism bill would "create two classes of citizens" and "legislate discrimination," charged Lionel Perez, leader of Montreal's municipal opposition and one of 16 speakers who took the podium.
"I say no. We say no," he said to spirited applause.
Bill 21 would prohibit authority figures like teachers, police officers, prison guards, prosecutors and judges from wearing religious symbols like the Muslim hijab, Jewish kippah or Sikh turban at work.
Tolerance and the ability of people from different origins and faiths to live together peacefully are built into Quebecers' DNA, Perez said in a passionate denunciation.
"Religious and ethnic diversity built Montreal and built Quebec," he said.
Edmond Emad holds a sign at a Rally For Religious Freedom and against the CAQ government's Bill 21 in Côte-St-Luc on Sunday, April 14, 2019.
Perez, who wears a kippah, said he was born and raised in Montreal by immigrant parents who chose Quebec "for the promise of a better future, because they wanted to live in a safe and open society and because of the French language."
"My kippah is my deep faith," he said. "But it does not affect my ability to serve the needs of my constituents" or to contribute to Quebec society.
"My kippah is not an affront to a secular state. It's proof that Quebec is open to the world," he added.

Carolyn Gehr, a teacher at the English Montreal School Board, said she wears a head scarf because of her Jewish faith. The religious symbol has never interfered with her ability to do her job and asking her to remove it "would be asking me to change the way I practise my religion," she said.
Robert Leckey, dean of law at McGill University, noted, "there's much to say about Bill 21 in legal terms."
"It is unprecedented to amend the Quebec charter in order to reduce the protection of rights," he said.
The bill would be impossible to apply, Leckey charged.
"It does not define religious symbols. It sets no standard clear enough to be the means for excluding people from employment or from denying clear advancement to current employees," he said.
He added that it's wrong to invoke collective rights to justify curbing individual rights, since freedom of conscience and religion do not pose a threat to Quebecers' collective rights.
Imam Salam El-Menyawi quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous line that no "democracy can long survive which does not accept as fundamental to its very existence the recognition of the rights of its minorities."
"There are many leaders who tried to engineer society. They failed," El-Menyawi said, recalling the divisive debate over the proposed Charter of Quebec Values in 2013.
"Six years later, we are trying the same issues, expecting different results," he said.
Armand Richard and Susan Gaskell and their son, Zachary Richard, waved homemade placards as they listed to the speeches.
"We're here because we don't think that its right what the government is doing," Armand said.
Zachary, 13, a student at Heritage Regional High School in St-Hubert, said the issue has personal resonance for him.
"I have a teacher myself who wears a kippah and a technician at school who wears the hijab," he said.
Zachary said it does no harm for a teacher to wears a religious symbol.
"Unless people are in the religion, I don't think it influences people that much what they wear," he said.
Hampstead Mayor William Steinberg, who raised a storm of controversy April 5 by comparing Bill 21 with ethnic cleansing, did not attend, to avoid being a distraction.
In a statement Thursday, he said he understood his words were "painful to some and it was not my intention to upset anyone, only to have people see the effects of an odious bill."
"Sometimes strong words are necessary to open people's eyes," he added.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, Premier François Legault and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are among politicians who roundly condemned Steinberg's comments last week.
Mount-Royal MP Anthony Housefather, D'Arcy-McGee MNA David Birnbaum, Côte-St-Luc Mayor Mitchell Brownstein, Montreal councillor Marvin Rotrand and EMSB chair Angela Mancini also addressed the rally.
Later, the Canadian Muslim Alliance also held a demonstration against the bill at Place Émilie-Gamelin( https://montrealgazette.com/news/demonstration-today-to-protest-bill-21-at-place-emilie-gamelin ).
On Monday, Plante and Perez will hold a press conference on a bipartisan declaration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/religious-symbols-montreal-to-rebuff-bill-21-in-bipartisan-declaration ) opposing Bill 21 at city hall. However, Plante has said unlike such suburbs as Côte-St-Luc, Hampstead and Montreal West, she would not defy the law if passed.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bill-21 )

Another demonstration, Grand rassemblement tous unis pour un Québec inclusif, organized by the Canadian Muslim Alliance( https://www.facebook.com/events/1788271464606537/ ), was planned for 2-4 p.m. at Place Émilie-Gamelin, where a protest was held the Sunday before( https://montrealgazette.com/news/demonstration-today-to-protest-bill-21-at-place-emilie-gamelin ).
The bill before the Quebec National Assembly would prohibit authority figures like teachers, police officers, prison guards, prosecutors and judges from wearing religious symbols like the Muslim hijab, Jewish kippah or Sikh turban at work.
At its monthly meeting, which starts Monday, Montreal city council will vote on a bipartisan declaration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/religious-symbols-montreal-to-rebuff-bill-21-in-bipartisan-declaration ) opposing Bill 21. "No one should live in fear or uncertainty about their job or place in Montreal society because they choose to practice their religion," it says.
While Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante says she would not defy the law if passed( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bill-21 ), suburbs like Côte-St-Luc, Hampstead and Montreal West have vowed not to enforce Bill 21's restrictions.
On Thursday, Plante joined a chorus condemning remarks by Hampstead Mayor William Steinberg, who compared Bill 21 with ethnic cleansing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/citing-media-storm-hampstead-cancels-special-meeting-on-bill-21 ).

Politicians from Premier François Legault to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have roundly condemned Steinberg's comments, made April 5 at a press conference to announce Sunday's rally in Côte-St-Luc.
Plante demanded that Steinberg apologize( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/apologize-withdraw-from-secularism-debate-plante-tells-hampstead-mayor ). She has also called on him to scrap his decision to convene a special meeting of the Hampstead council Monday to adopt a resolution saying the town will not apply the legislation.
In a statement Thursday, Steinberg said he understood his words were "painful to some and it was not my intention to upset anyone, only to have people see the effects of an odious bill."
"Sometimes strong words are necessary to open people's eyes," he added.
Steinberg has said( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/apologize-withdraw-from-secularism-debate-plante-tells-hampstead-mayor ) he would not participate in Sunday's rally because he does not want to be a distraction.
The protest is set for 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. in front 5801 Cavendish Blvd. It is one of a number( https://montrealgazette.com/news/demonstration-today-to-protest-bill-21-at-place-emilie-gamelin ) that have been held in reaction( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/we-wont-be-silent-in-fight-against-bill-21-westmount-high-teachers-say ) to Quebec's Bill 21.

Plante slams Steinberg's remarks; Urges Hampstead mayor to apologize and withdraw from secularism debate

Full text: Hampstead Mayor William Steinberg's statements comparing Bill 21 with ethnic cleansing are "completely unacceptable," and he should apologize and withdraw from the debate on secularism, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Thursday.
But Steinberg was not budging despite the turmoil, issuing a statement on his Facebook page and on Hampstead's municipal page explaining his remarks again but not apologizing.
Breaking her silence in the wake of the controversy, Plante issued a statement in which she denounced Steinberg's remarks in the strongest possible terms. She is to meet the media Friday to elaborate further.
"Last Friday, Mayor Steinberg made absolutely unacceptable comments," Plante said in her statement. "These comments have sparked outrage throughout Quebec, with good reason."
"Mayor Steinberg's comments have no place in this public debate. Mayor Steinberg's words and his refusal to apologize have diverted the debate from the proposed law on secularism to become the subject of the debate himself.
"This attitude is irresponsible and must be denounced."
Plante has also urged Steinberg, if he is unwilling to apologize, to scrap his decision to convene a special meeting of the Hampstead council Monday to adopt a resolution saying the town will not apply the legislation.
Plante repeated that since the start of the debate she has emphasized the need to maintain a "healthy debate," but she says Steinberg is not part of it and should stand down.
"I have also reiterated the importance for elected officials to stay above the fray," Plante said.
It was Plante's first comments on the controversy. She issued the statement on a return from a trade mission in South America and after being criticized for not having said a word about one of Montreal island's mayors.
The storm has been raging since a news conference last Friday called to announce a protest against Bill 21 Sunday in Côte-St-Luc.
That was where Steinberg made comments about "ethnic cleansing - not with a gun, but with a law, comments which have been roundly criticized by all of Quebec's politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier François Legault.
Despite all the pressure, Steinberg has refused to apologize.
The Steinberg incident also dominated question period and the chatter in the halls of power of the National Assembly, where all party leaders insisted repeatedly that Steinberg backtrack.
Instead, Steinberg added to the storm when he tried to specify he was in no way condoning violence or such genocides as those which took place in Rwanda or Serbia.
"Since the phrase was ethnic cleansing not with a gun but with a law, a more accurate short description is peaceful ethnic cleansing," he said Tuesday, only making the situation worse in the eyes of other politicians.
In his message posted Thursday, Steinberg said he understands his words were tough for some to digest, but that is as close as he gets to saying sorry.
"I understand that these words are painful to some and it was not my intention to upset anyone, only to have people see the effects of an odious bill," he wrote.
"Sometimes strong words are necessary to open people's eyes."
But his image in the French media has not been aided by his inability to speak French. He has explained it is due to a lifelong hearing handicap. He now has two implants that allow him to hear English, but French is impossible.
In his statement, Steinberg returns to his criticism of the media noting some preferred inflammatory headlines instead of telling the full story. He notes only the Montreal Gazette, National Post and La Presse had "full and fair coverage."
He said he has repeatedly said he does not consider Quebecers racist, but Bill 21 is racist, something Quebecers will realize and reject the law.
But there has been ample speculation that Steinberg's presence and the resulting polarization of the debate over the bill is drowning the moderates on both sides of the issue. Some Coalition Avenir Québec government aides privately have been saying Steinberg is a godsend for Bill 21.
Steinberg has thus become a political football. On Thursday, during the last question period of the week, Legault made sure the story stayed alive another day by launching a blistering attack against interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand.
He accused Arcand of condoning Steinberg's remarks because Arcand said a day earlier that it is the CAQ's own divisive policies that are sparking such excesses as Steinberg's.
"I will not tolerate that Mr.
Arcand and the Liberal Party condone these remarks (by Steinberg), which suggest Quebecers are racist," Legault said.
A day earlier, Arcand said: "What the CAQ does in general is inciting this kind of excess."
Arcand has condemned Steinberg's remarks and called for an apology.
Meanwhile, Steinberg confirmed he will not participate in Sunday's religious freedoms protest (which is taking place outside Côte-St-Luc city hall at 11:30) because he does not want to be a distraction. pauthier@postmedia.com Twitter.com/philipauthier

"Since the phrase was ethnic cleansing not with a gun but with a law, a more accurate short description is peaceful ethnic cleansing," he said Tuesday, only making the situation worse in the eyes of other politicians.
In his message posted Thursday, Steinberg said he understand his words were tough for some to digest, but that is as close as he gets to saying sorry.
"I understand that these words are painful to some and it was not my intention to upset anyone, only to have people see the effects of an odious bill," he wrote.
"Sometimes strong words are necessary to open people's eyes."
But his image in the French media has not been aided by his inability to speak French. He has explained it is due to a lifelong hearing handicap. He now has two implants that allow him to hear English, but French is impossible.
In his statement, Steinberg returns to his criticism of the media noting some preferred inflammatory headlines instead of telling the full story. He notes only the Montreal Gazette, National Post and La Presse had "full and fair coverage."
He said he has repeatedly said he does not consider Quebecers racist, but Bill 21 is racist, something Quebecers will realize and reject the law.
But there has been ample speculation that Steinberg's presence and the resulting polarization of the debate over the bill is drowning the moderates on both sides of the issue. Some Coalition Avenir Québec government aides privately have been saying Steinberg is a godsend for Bill 21.
Steinberg has thus become a political football. On Thursday, during the last question period of the week, Legault made sure the story stayed alive another day by launching a blistering attack against interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand.
He accused Arcand of condoning Steinberg's remarks because Arcand said a day earlier that it is the CAQ's own divisive policies that are sparking such excesses as Steinberg's.
"I will not tolerate that Mr. Arcand and the Liberal Party condone these remarks (by Steinberg), which suggest Quebecers are racist," Legault said.
A day earlier, Arcand said: "What the CAQ does in general is inciting this kind of excess."
Arcand has condemned Steinberg's remarks and called for an apology.
Meanwhile, Steinberg confirmed he will not participate in Sunday's religious freedoms protest (which is taking place outside Côte-St-Luc city hall at 11:30) because he does not want to be a distraction.

Full text: If you're only interested in the ( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) - a date on the calendar that is not all that different than the one preceding it - tomorrow will be a good day.
This year's vernal equinox, which marks the beginning of spring, is due to take place at 5:58 p.m. on Wednesday( https://www.weather.gov/dvn/Climate_Astronomical_Seasons ).
At this point, you may be wondering how the vernal equinox materially affects your life. The short answer is ... not much, at least for now.
It's basically the point at which the Earth's northern hemisphere starts tilting toward the sun, leading to gradually sunnier days.
In a couple of months, when the days feel longer and you're not freezing your face off( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ), remember to think kind thoughts about the vernal equinox.
But for now, it's nominally spring in Montreal and more cold and snow is still to come.

After a warm midweek, Environment Canada says Montreal will get more snow( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/snow ) on Friday and Saturday.
The Weather Network is warning( https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/quebec/montreal?wx_auto_reload= ) that the accumulation could reach 15 centimetres over that period.
Oh, and for good measure, Environment Canada is forecasting that the nighttime low on Friday will be minus-10 degrees Celsius.
For good measure, all the climatic variation( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/why-early-spring-is-pothole-season ) has resulted in even more potholes( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/watchwords-the-strange-history-of-pothole ) on Montreal roads( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) than usual.

Full text: If you're only interested in the ( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) - a date on the calendar that is not all that different than the one preceding it - tomorrow will be a good day.
This year's vernal equinox, which marks the beginning of spring, is due to take place at 5:58 p.m. on Wednesday( https://www.weather.gov/dvn/Climate_Astronomical_Seasons ).
At this point, you may be wondering how the vernal equinox materially affects your life. The short answer is ... not much, at least for now.
It's basically the point at which the Earth's northern hemisphere starts tilting toward the sun, leading to gradually sunnier days.
In a couple of months, when the days feel longer and you're not freezing your face off( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ), remember to think kind thoughts about the vernal equinox.
But for now, it's nominally spring in Montreal and more cold and snow is still to come.

Full text: Montreal Gazette journalist Aaron Derfel has been nominated for a National Newspaper Award for exposing violence against workers at the Montreal General Hospital.
Called Hospital (In)security( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-anatomy-of-a-nurse-attack-at-montreal-general ), the four-part series published starting in January 2018 chronicled a 2017 incident in which a nurse in the psychiatric emergency room was violently attacked and almost killed by a patient at 3:35 a.m., and a security guard was not present because the hospital had determined that one was not necessary. The investigation showed the hospital had more incidents but less security than comparable institutions( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-new-safety-concerns-arise-at-montreal-general ), scaled back proposed training to deal with such incidents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-montreal-general-scales-back-code-white-training-plan ), and that such acts of violence were far from rare( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-when-a-nurse-is-attacked-others-suffer-too ).
"It is quite an honour to receive this recognition," Derfel said. "I'd like to thank my sources in the health network who showed great courage in speaking out about such an important matter of public interest."
Derfel's nomination in the investigations category( http://nna-ccj.ca/finalists-announced-for-the-70th-national-newspaper-awards/ ) is among 14 for Postmedia's journalists for the awards recognizing excellence in daily newspaper work in Canada.
Zane Schwartz was nominated in the prestigious Project of the Year category for Follow The Money( https://special.nationalpost.com/follow-the-money/feature ), an 18-month-long investigative project he worked on as the recipient of Postmedia's 2017 Michelle Lang Fellowship in Journalism. Schwartz gathered 5 million records from governments across the country to create the first searchable database of federal, provincial and territorial political donations.
The Saskatoon StarPhoenix received three nominations, with Kevin Mitchell recognized for his coverage of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash and its aftermath and Kayle Neis nominated in the news photo category for a photo of a Broncos memorial. StarPhoenix editor-in-chief Heather Persson was also nominated for editorial writing.
Postmedia journalists in Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton, Vancouver and London also received nominations.
"This year's nominations reflect the excellent work that is being done in our newsrooms across the country," said Lucinda Chodan, vice-president editorial for Postmedia. "The categories we are nominated in - from editorial writing and photography to investigative and explanatory work - are a testament to the breadth and strength of the journalism we practise."
The Globe and Mail secured the most nominations with 20, followed by the Toronto Star and Montreal's La Presse, each nominated six times.
The National Newspaper Awards, celebrating their 70th year, will be handed out at a ceremony in Toronto on May 3. The awards are given to daily newspapers, news agencies and online news sites that the NNA board of governors approve for entry.

When does spring start?

Full text: Is it spring yet? How about now?
Those hoping for a March melt were unpleasantly surprised as colder temperatures descended on Quebec over the past two days. Wednesday's high in Montreal was a nippy -9 C, with a low of -18 C (feels like -25) expected overnight, begging the question: Will it ever get warm around here?
"Right now it's colder," explained Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist for Environment Canada. "This week, the average high should be 0. We're around -8 or -9 for today and (Thursday). By Friday it should be closer to 0.
There's no immediate respite - or at least no impending heat wave - but patience will be rewarded if we can just hang on a little longer, according to Parent.
"Next week will at least be near normal, most of the week," he said.
But with 10-15 centimetres of snow expected for Sunday, combined with a risk of freezing rain, he is careful to point out that "winter is not over."
And while Shakespeare would warn us to "Beware the Ides of March," Parent is encouraging people to hold on until mid-month.
"A lot of models are forecasting a system bringing warm air and some rain for southern Quebec, late into next week and next weekend," he said.
In other words, there may be sunshine for St. Patrick's Day. Ah, the luck of the Irish!
If that still seems like a long way away, it's understandable. While this winter's average temperature is only one degree below normal, it has been unrelenting.
"It's been long," Parent noted. "It started Nov. 16 when we got around 10 centimetres of snow, which has stayed on the ground the entire winter."

The hardest thing to endure this winter may have been the accumulation. There were no records broken, but we are above average in terms of precipitation.
"In terms of snowfall, we have had 195 cm so far in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ); the average is 160 cm," Parent said. "And since December, we have had 149 mm of rain, while the average is 87 mm. So more precipitation, more weather systems and no breaks this winter."
As anyone who has tried to venture outside their front door over the past couple months knows, it has been an icy one( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/weather-nightmare-continues-schools-closed-treacherous-roads-amid-downpour ). And it's not your imagination: We have had an unusual amount of ice storms.
"If you look at December, January and February, on average in Montreal there are five days with temperatures above 0 and with 5 mm of rain or more," Parent said. "We had 11 of those days, and all of them were followed by cold temperatures, below 0.
"So it has been a busy winter in terms of weather systems, and there has been higher snowfall, rainfall and more of these rain and then freezing events."
Environment Canada issued twice as many weather warnings for January and February, a result of the shifting weather systems.
All of which leads us to the big question: When will it end? That is to say, will spring be spring-like, or will it be a drawn-out, slightly milder version of winter?
"This is always difficult," Parent said. "The forecast for the next three months for southern Quebec is for it to be above average in terms of temperature. That's what we're seeing for the next few weeks, and for April and May as well."
Hallelujah!
"But we always have to be careful," he warned. "These forecasts are better than (random guesses), but it's always a challenge. Sometimes it doesn't tell us what the season is going to be like."
The big question is, with all this accumulated snow, how fast is it going to melt? (Hint: faster isn't always better.)
"In terms of possible flooding, the snow mass on the ground is only one ingredient," Parent said. "After that, for flooding you need high temperatures, but you also need rainfall.
"The snow on the ground is higher than normal in Mauricie, Beauce and Quebec City. We have had winters with a lot of snow on the ground in March, but if spring is gradual and there's not too much rain, we could see a quiet season in terms of flooding( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ).
"I don't want to sound alarmist, but because of the snow levels we're following things pretty closely."
In summary: hope is on the horizon, but don't let your guard down.

A pirate's heart in the public eye; Quebec singer Béatrice Martin, who performs as Coeur de pirate, has attracted a lot of unwanted attention

A slow and steady approach has served Béatrice Martin's career well.
The Quebec singer who performs as Coeur de pirate - translated as "Her Pirate Heart" - began her career 15 years ago, dabbling in a variety of genres before settling in as one of the foremost practitioners of French pop.
Martin has reached the level of only a few of her Canadian contemporaries - Feist, to name one - with album sales over the onemillion mark, one million followers on Facebook and an immense profile overseas. She arrived there by taking a measured, carefully considered approach to her craft.
"You evolve and you want people to follow along," Martin, who studied at the Conservatoire de Musique du Québec as a child, told Cosmopolitan in an interview.
"But whenever you release something, you think: 'Are people actually going to like this?'I just want to have a project that means something to people. If I couldn't reach out to anyone, I wouldn't be doing this."
In 2008 - when Martin was just 21 - her self-titled debut hit No. 2 on the sales charts in France, propelled to the top spot by the single Ensemble. The four records that followed, including her most recent effort, En cas de tempête, ce jardin sera fermé, all cracked the top five in Canada, while achieving similar heights in France and Belgium.
Her music has been embraced by a wide swath of the music-buying populace, to be sure. But with that rise in popularity has come a degree of unwanted attention. The subject of tabloid talk in France, she has struggled to maintain her composure in the public eye, given that her every move is headline news in Quebec and abroad.
Martin, who sings primarily in French, comes across as cosmopolitan, but she's actually much more reserved, which has caused her to retreat slightly from the media in recent years. "It's important to disconnect from problematic media and recharge your batteries," she said in a post on her Instagram page.
Her reputation for giving inspiring concerts keeps Martin booked on the road for long stretches when there's a new record to promote. Her tour to support the 2015 album Roses included 150 sold-out concerts in more than 10 countries, including North America, Spain, Italy, England, France and Germany.
Martin has said that she turned to alcohol to ease the pressure, before eventually giving it up.
"Everything came rushing back," Martin told the Canadian Press. "All the emotions that I had repressed, all the experiences, everything. I was just like, wow, a lot of stuff went down and I didn't talk about it."
Martin came out as "pansexual" in 2016 - following a divorce from her husband of four years, Alex Peyrat, she entered into a relationship with transgender singer Laura Jane Grace from the punk band Against Me! Grace and Martin are no longer a couple, but the fallout from the public relationship left a mark on Martin.
The six-time Juno Award nominee spoke of her struggles in a post on her Instagram page, revealing that she suffers from body dysmorphic disorder - an obsessive focus on perceived defects in personal appearance - and encouraged others with similar mental-health issues to get help.
"We've talked a lot about mental health these days and I know I'm not alone," she wrote.
Her new effort (which translates as "In case of a storm, this garden will be closed") carries a heavy emotional weight. Rape is discussed from a first-person perspective on the song Je veux rentrer, with Martin singing: "The warmth of our violence, this intense pain that keeps hurting/And I keep our secret that's eating my soul away, that's feeding my vices."
While the songs on the album are in French, the emotional impact translates easily to Anglophone listeners. "I think it's important to move on from traumatic experiences if you can to re-appropriate the events that happened to you, which is what I'm doing with this album," Martin said in an interview with the Montreal Gazette. "I have been through trauma and things that are not cool, but they don't own me. So the way the music is so upbeat is my way of saying 'f- you'to whatever happened to me." mdevlin@timescolonist.com

Full text: With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.

The weather statement from Environment Canada said the "core of precipitation" expected Wednesday night through Thursday morning is snow. However, Montreal and regions close to the border could see some freezing rain mixed in.
The high for Wednesday is expected to be minus-5 degrees Celsius, while the high for Thursday could be 5 C. Friday and Saturday should see-saw over the freezing mark, under sunny skies.

Full text: Every Montrealer and their uncle felt the wrath of this week's snowmageddon one way or another, whether it was shovelling their way out of their home, trudging right up the middle of streets because sidewalks were impassable, or driving along the pothole-riddled, snowbank-lined roads.
I'll leave the bickering over the quality of snow removal to our city officials, except to note that anyone who lives in the West Island and drives downtown for work can see and feel the difference between the city of Montreal and the suburban municipalities.
As a parent and Montrealer, I have never been more preoccupied with weather alerts than I have been this year. Yes, some have been false alarms, but best to err on the side of caution.
This week's alert was the real thing, and by Tuesday, it seemed everyone was bracing for the onslaught.
My kids were jumping up and down when they heard the news that they were going to have a snow day Wednesday. I let out a sigh of relief because as crazy as it can get to have a hyper teen and pre-teen home while you're trying to work, there is nothing quite like knowing your kids are home safe while Mother Nature does her thing.
Not everybody is so fortunate as to be able to take time off from work if there is a weather advisory in effect, nor can every job be done from home, but when we hear about a major storm system moving in, with freezing rain warning or whiteout conditions, it's best to stay home if at all possible. There is no point arguing with someone who does not have a choice in the matter, but those who do have the opportunity but opt not to heed the warnings are merely being foolish.
A few weeks back, as I was leaving downtown late one evening after work, a dear friend messaged me and suggested I stay downtown and not risk driving back to the West Island because the weather was going to be particularly dangerous. I brushed aside the suggestion, and told her I appreciated her concern. After white-knuckling the steering wheel for the 90 minutes it took me to get home, I will think twice about doing that again. Later that evening, I noticed that several off-island Facebook groups were discussing whether to drive home, and a bunch of people were staying near the airport so as to cut short their commute.
Deciding whether to head out can be a life and death matter. I was saddened at the news that a dear family friend and longtime reader of the Montreal Gazette died last week in a multi-car pileup caused by poor weather conditions. She was returning home from the funeral of a relative in Ontario. We were devastated, and as news of her passing spread, the Montreal Pakistani/Indian community grieved the loss of this intelligent, eloquent woman who had given so much to those she loved.
I am amazed by the number of times I'll hear other parents driving across town to take their child to a sporting event during a storm or blizzard. Sports clubs need to cancel practices or games if there is a weather warning in effect. I've heard some say it's because they don't want to lose their deposit for the facility rental. We need to be more cautious when it comes to the safety and well-being of our children.
While we cannot control Mother Nature, we can control how much attention we pay to weather warnings. While we're blessed to have some of the best snow removal in the world (all jokes aside), we all need to do our parts to ensure the safety of ourselves and our families.

After the storm, city begins cleanup; Montreal hit with 40 cm of snow between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons

Full text: Montreal is getting back to normal after a major snowstorm closed schools, clogged roads and sidewalks and convinced many workers to take a snow day.
The cleanup is underway. Forty centimetres of snow fell between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère said. During an average snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal. So far this season, with more than two months to go, the tally is 180 centimetres, according to Environment Canada statistics.
The intense storm led all public schools on Montreal Island to cancel classes Wednesday. CE-GEPs and universities followed suit. They are all expected to reopen today. Canada Post cancelled mail delivery across Quebec due to severe weather.
Snow crews plowing roads and sidewalks were helped by the lack of students on the road and the fact that many workers heeded officials'calls to stay home or use public transit.
But Société de transport de Montréal buses were slowed by the sheer amount of snow on Montreal roads, leaving some commuters facing long delays. And many who opted for Exo commuter trains were thwarted by delays and mechanical breakdowns. Only one of Exo's six lines, Mont-St-Hilaire, was problem-free Wednesday.
The city of Montreal said workers spreading abrasives and plowing snow prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries.
Starting Wednesday evening, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles were to begin hauling away snow, an operation expected to take about a week.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration has been criticized for how it has handled snow and ice removal during a winter marked by wild temperature fluctuations and a wide variety of precipitation, from rain to freezing drizzle to freezing rain to snow.
Ensemble Montréal, the opposition party at city hall, says Montreal's poor planning is to blame for thick layers of ice found on some streets and sidewalks.
On Wednesday, Plante said it will cost between $25 million and $35 million to remove the latest snowfall.
The original plan had been to start the snow-removal operation on Thursday morning.
"We're going to start taking away all the snow (Wednesday night) because we didn't want to wait till (Thursday) morning," Plante said.
"We know a lot of people will be working tomorrow morning so if we can do as much as we can overnight, tonight, it's great. But of course it will take some time."
She said people should take the métro if possible, noting Wednesday's ride was smooth, likely because many children and their parents stayed home. Thursday's commute would undoubtedly be much busier, she said.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Wednesday morning that the province was coping with the storm and there were no deaths or major incidents.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads," Guilbault said.
Montreal's weather roller-coaster ride may continue in the coming days. Environment Canada says more snow may fall Thursday, possibly followed by rain on Friday as the temperature shoots up above zero. The forecast for Saturday: sunny with a high of -3 C.

Full text: OTTAWA - In the ongoing debate over the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and what kind of "pressure" was put on ex-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to prevent it, the pundit classes of Quebec and the rest of Canada are singing different songs.
Since the Globe and Mail published a report last week alleging the Prime Minister's Office pushed Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid prosecution, a chorus of voices in Quebec has sought to defend the Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin, its importance to the provincial and national economy and the appropriateness of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's desire to save some 8,600 Canadian jobs.
The opinion pages and panels of talking heads in English-Canadian media have largely focused on the question of whether a refusal to bow to undue "pressure" from Trudeau's office led to Wilson-Raybould's demotion to the veterans affairs file last month and ultimately her resignation on Tuesday.
In Quebec, par contre, the commentariat is more critical of Wilson-Raybould. They are more concerned about why the then-justice minister wouldn't push the Director of Public Prosecutions to allow SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement - a way for the firm to make amends for corruption charges incurred doing business in Libya without risking a long-term freeze on its ability to take public contracts. Liberals had inserted provisions for that kind of arrangement in the 2018 federal budget. Why then wouldn't the provision be used, Quebec columnists wonder?
Here's some of what they've been telling their readers and listeners.
The PMO may have done the right thing, Yves Boisvert argued in La Presse( https://www.lapresse.ca/debats/chroniques/yves-boisvert/201902/07/01-5213983-comment-punir-les-entreprises-criminelles-.php ) in the wake of the Globe's report last week, saying a deferred prosecution agreement makes sense in this case. The same day came a take from L'actualité's Alec Castonguay that it's possible Wilson-Raybould wasn't a "heroine standing up to power," and that Trudeau seemed to be advocating for something sensible( https://lactualite.com/politique/2019/02/08/et-si-justin-trudeau-avait-raison-pour-snc-lavalin/ ).
Gérald Fillion argued in a Monday analysis for Radio-Canada (CBC's French-language counterpart) that SNC-Lavalin is under siege( https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1152379/avenir-snc-lavalin-danger-accord-reparation-gouvernement-federal?depuisRecherche=true ), and in danger. The real question, he wrote, is why the government, why Wilson-Raybould, wouldn't use the tools Liberals had just put into place. Likewise Le Devoir's Denis Saint-Martin said the absence of "pressure" by the PMO would've been more surprising( https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/idees/547543/snc-lavalin-et-la-justice-en-matiere-de-corruption ) than this so-called scandal, given SNC-Lavalin's economic heft.
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould speaks with the media following caucus on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Tuesday June 6, 2017.
The next day, on Radio-Canada's news program Le télé journal, an expert on public and private governance, Michel Nadeau, defended the prime minister. "He told Quebecers, 'Look, with SNC-Lavalin, I did what I had to do,'" Nadeau said in French, paraphrasing Trudeau. "'And those who had something to say about it could have raised their hands, or come to me. But Wilson-Raybould didn't present herself.'" The real mystery, he said, was why bureaucrats would obstruct an agreement for SNC-Lavalin when the same is done for multinational companies across the world, and in light of the company's role in "building modern Quebec."
On Tuesday Michel Girard, for the Journal de Montreal, added his voice to the mix to declare "mortal consequences( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1is4yEDAXPU8mxAYoSxeHgmIDGcPd5TzgHeC--Q2S19k/edit )" if SNC-Lavalin is prosecuted and convicted. Opposition leaders, he wrote, should be asked why they won't support SNC-Lavalin like Quebec Premier François Legault does - a pertinent question for Quebecers in a federal election year.
On his TVA Nouvelles program Monday, television personality and former provincial party leader Mario Dumont said no one is denying the company engaged in corruption. But he offered an explanation of the issue that outlined how SNC-Lavalin, under a deferred prosecution agreement, would still have to pay significant fines, and how similar agreements have been used in other countries including the United Kingdom and United States. In a column for the Journal Wednesday, he further argued that Trudeau's actions to help secure such a thing were "serious and responsible,"( https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2019/02/13/agir-courageusement-en-cachette ) what one would expect of a head of government. The only error, he said, was that Trudeau had done all this in secret.
Woes pile up for SNC-Lavalin, the company at the centre of a political storm( https://nationalpost.com/commodities/mining/snc-lavalins-debt-rating-cut-by-sp-after-profit-warning/wcm/9df8b85e-f0c0-46b3-a6f2-7f65e9b3ffa9 )
Liberal MPs on justice committee under spotlight as opposition demands probe of SNC-Lavalin affair( https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/liberal-mps-on-justice-committee-under-spotlight-as-opposition-demands-probe-of-snc-lavalin-affair?video_autoplay=true )
SNC-Lavalin could face criminal charges over Montreal bridge contract, court documents reveal( https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/snc-lavalin-faces-criminal-probe-over-montreal-bridge-contract-documents-reveal )
Franco-Quebec coverage of the situation hasn't been without its skeptics. For La Presse, François Cardinal wondered Wednesday why so many commentators had made their beds on the issue( https://www.lapresse.ca/debats/editoriaux/201902/12/01-5214517-demission-wilson-raybould-doit-parler.php ) before having all the facts, and urged that Wilson-Raybould should be allowed to say her piece. Another La Presse columnist, Patrick Lagacé, noted that SNC-Lavalin created this mess( https://www.lapresse.ca/debats/chroniques/patrick-lagace/201902/12/01-5214520-les-dechets-de-snc-lavalin.php ) in the first place by engaging in corrupt activities. "I must have slumbered in a deep hibernation to have missed the moment when we collectively decided that corruption and collusion on a grand scale isn't so bad," Jonathan Trudeau wrote for the Journal( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1is4yEDAXPU8mxAYoSxeHgmIDGcPd5TzgHeC--Q2S19k/edit ) Wednesday.
But underlying many of the arguments is a fundamental sense that English Canada is biased against Quebec and its companies. Why punish thousands of workers( https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/editoriaux/547653/snc-lavalin-assez-d-hypocrisie ) when those who engaged in corruption are now outside of the company, Jean-Robert Sansfaçon asked in Le Devoir Tuesday? Why not allow for a solution that will prevent the dismantlement of such an important Quebec entity?
"I can't help but wonder whether English Canada's punditocracy would be as indignant if the prime minister's office had seemingly been trying to save a Toronto- or Calgary-based multinational corporation instead of a Quebec one," wrote Lise Ravary, in English, for the Montreal Gazette on Tuesday. "SNC-Lavalin is Canada's largest engineering firm. Not just Quebec's."

After the storm, Montreal commences cleanup

Full text: Montreal is getting back to normal after a major snowstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ) closed schools, clogged roads and sidewalks and convinced many workers to take a snow day.
The clean-up is underway.
Forty centimetres of snow fell between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, Environment Canada meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère said.
During an average snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal. So far this season, with more than two months to go, the tally is 180 cm, according to Environment Canada statistics.
The intense storm led all public schools on Montreal Island to cancel classes Wednesday. CEGEPs and universities followed suit. They are all expected to reopen Thursday. Canada Post canceled mail delivery across Quebec due to severe weather.
Snow crews plowing roads and sidewalks were helped by the lack of students on the road and the fact that many workers heeded officials' calls to stay home or use public transit.
Danny Lee shovels the sidewalk outside his business on Metcalfe St. on Wednesday.
But Société de transport de Montréal buses were slowed by the sheer amount of snow on Montreal roads, leaving some commuters facing long delays. And many who opted for Exo commuter trains were thwarted by delays and mechanical breakdowns. Only one of Exo's six lines - Mont-St-Hilaire - was problem-free Wednesday.
The city of Montreal said workers spreading abrasives and plowing snow prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries.
Starting Wednesday evening, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles were to begin hauling away snow, an operation expected to take about a week.
Mayor Valérie Plante's administration has been criticized for how it has handled snow and ice removal during a winter marked by wild temperature fluctuations and a wide variety of precipitation, from rain to freezing drizzle to freezing rain to snow.
Ensemble Montréal, the opposition party at city hall, says Montreal's poor planning is to blame for thick layers of ice found on some streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ).
On Wednesday, Plante said it will cost between $25 million and $35 million to remove the latest snowfall.
Eloi Morin takes a jump as he slides down the hill at Lafontaine Park on Wednesday.
The original plan had been to start the snow-removal operation on Thursday morning.
"We're going to start taking away all the snow (Wednesday night) because we didn't want to wait till (Thursday) morning," Plante said.
"We know a lot of people will be working tomorrow morning so if we can do as much as we can overnight, tonight, it's great. But of course it will take some time."
She said people should take the métro if possible, noting Wednesday's ride was smooth, likely because many children and their parents stayed home. Thursday's commute would undoubtedly be much busier, she said.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Wednesday morning that the province was coping with the storm and there were no deaths or major incidents.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads," Guilbault said.
Montreal's weather rollercoaster ride may continue in the coming days.
Environment Canada says more snow may fall Thursday, possibly followed by rain on Friday as the temperature shoots up above zero. The forecast for Saturday: sunny with a high of -3 C.

Full text: This was a live blog about the major snowstorm that hit Montreal on Feb. 12 and13.
3 p.m.: Thanks for following
That's it for today's live blog. Check in with montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) regularly for updates on the storm and its aftermath.
2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.
1:35 p.m.: Digging out
L'agente Chèvrefils se prépare à aller sur la route. Le déneigement des autopatrouilles fait aussi partie des tâches de nos policiers.#SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Ow3oCp0WFh( https://t.co/Ow3oCp0WFh )
- Police Montréal (@SPVM) February 13, 2019( https://twitter.com/SPVM/status/1095736053351309312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

Montrealers know snow. But some of us can use a refresher course in winter.
We have posted some handy and timely shovelling and driving tips( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-survival-guide ).

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

9:30 a.m.: No major incidents
Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo. Be careful.#RoadSafety( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadSafety?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #SPVM( https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPVM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Bkg2h4kvlU( https://t.co/Bkg2h4kvlU )

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.

Exo, which runs commuter trains in the Montreal region, says you should be careful on train platforms.

Full text: After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself ready for the major snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds were also expected.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision. All announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible. Snow-loading operations were expected to begin Thursday morning.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snow storm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels have been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems tonight and tomorrow is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home just do that. And we encourage every job giver to be flexible tomorrow and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible of course.
"The easiest thing to do is to stay home; the safest test thing to do is to stay home."
She said the government itself will show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has leaned its lessons from past storms including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 in when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"The government has learned lessons from the past and with a big storm in the works I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, risk zero doesn't exist but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency coordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec has called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working tonight for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road tonight. So as my colleague said we hope people will stay home or adopt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.

Full text: After facing criticism for the way it has handled removing snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm that is expected to blow into the city Tuesday afternoon.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, said Tuesday.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration with previous snow-clearing operations this winter.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are covered with thick layers of ice that will make snow clearing more difficult.
He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel wrote on his Twitter account that: "I am following the evolution of the storm that will move into Quebec over the next few hours. If possible, delay any travel and thank you for doing so. If not, adapt your driving (to road conditions)."
That message was echoed by the Sûreté du Québec, the provincial force responsible for patrolling Quebec highways. In a statement posted soon after Bonnardel's tweet, the SQ urged motorists to "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
Meanwhile, Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm.
Bonnardel's warning, made at a little before 11 a.m., came as a winter storm warning for the Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#191837342337813415201902110504ww1070cwul ) entered its seventh hour. And even though the first lashes of snow weren't expected to be felt until 6 p.m., the effects of its passage east from Ontario were already being felt locally.
At Trudeau airport, several flights to Toronto and the U.S. Midwest were listed as delayed or cancelled, as were most of Tuesday morning's incoming flights from Toronto.
City of Montreal officials were expected to meet the press Tuesday morning to detail their plan to handle the expected pummelling from the storm system, which is expected to arrive in time for supper on Tuesday and dwell over the area until Wednesday evening, dropping about a centimetre of snow every hour during its stay. The storm will also include high winds that will blow whatever snow does accumulate into potential white-outs on the highways, adding to the urgency of Bonnardel's advice.

Amid controversy, Premier Legault admits Islamophobia exists in Quebec

Full text: Premier François Legault has backed away from his remarks on Islamophobia( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-francois-legault-rules-out-anti-islamophobia-day-in-quebec ), after sparking a controversy by saying it does not exist in Quebec.
In a statement issued by his office Friday in the wake of the storm of angry responses sparked by his remarks Thursday, Legault clarified, saying it exists( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments ) but is not commonplace.
"Mr. Legault wanted to say there is no current of Islamophobia in Quebec," the statement said. "Islamophobia exists in Quebec, xenophobia, racism and hatred but not a current of Islamophobia. Quebec is not Islamophobic or racist."
Reached later, Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Legault, further clarified.
"Unfortunately, there are still too many racist acts that occur in our society and we have to do all that is possible to denounce and fight hatred and intolerance," Sauves said.
"However, there is no trend or culture of Islamophobia in Quebec. Quebecers are open and tolerant and they shall continue to exhibit these qualities.
Legault's clarification follows a chorus of complaints from all quarters.
On Friday morning, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) called on Legault to retract the comment, which he made after a caucus meeting of Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs in Gatineau.
He had been explaining why he felt there was no reason to designate Jan. 29 - the date six Muslim men were murdered( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-mosque-shooting ) in a mass shooting in Quebec City in 2017 - as anti-Islamophobia Day in Quebec.
NCCM executive director Ihsaan Gardee said in a statement that the comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.
National Council of Canadian Muslims executive director Ihsaan Gardee said that Premier François Legault's comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.
He was blasted by other politicians, too.
In a tweet posted on the same day as the Liberals entered the second day of a pre-session caucus, interim leader Pierre Arcand said Islamophobia exists in Quebec as it does elsewhere and Legault should reverse his statement.
L'islamophobie existe au Québec comme ailleurs. @francoislegault( https://twitter.com/francoislegault?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) a été catégorique en affirmant que ce phénomène n'existait pas. Je l'invite à se rétracter.#PolQc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolQc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #PLQ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLQ?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Later, at a news conference, Arcand said he accepted Legault's clarification.
"I think he recognized that he made a mistake and corrected it," Arcand said. "I asked him to apologize and that's pretty much what he did. I am satisfied."
Québec solidaire co-spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois also pounced, urging Legault to have a look at comments posted on his public Facebook page after he made the remarks.
François Legault semble douter que l'islamophobie soit un problème réel. Il devrait peut-être aller lire le genre de commentaires laissés sur sa propre page Facebook suite à sa présence à la commémoration des victimes de l'attentat de la mosquée de Qc...#polqc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polqc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/yGVrngsUw7( https://t.co/yGVrngsUw7 )

Boufeldja Benabdallah, president of the Quebec City mosque, released a letter he sent to Legault in which he expressed his disappointment.
"I felt a heavy blow and on top to that I felt betrayed since what you said (in Gatineau) was the exact opposite of what you said at Université Laval (during the recent memorial)," Benabdallah says in the letter he released to the media.
Benabdallah said he accepts that the government does not want to have an annual anti-Islamophobia day, but added:
"With all due respect to you, premier, you did not measure the gravity of this sentence that came barely 48 hours after the commemoration of the shooting at the Grand Mosque. I fear your sentence gives credence to the active fringe of society that is feeding Islamophobia."
Friday night, Legault took to Twitter to say he called Benabdallah and assured him that the CAQ government would fight racism, hatred and intolerance.
Je me suis entretenu avec M. Boufeldja BenabdAllah, président du Centre culturel islamique de Québec. Je l'ai assuré que mon gouvernement combattra le racisme, la haine et l'intolérance.
- François Legault (@francoislegault) February 1, 2019( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/1091479269040156674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Friday there are Islamophobic acts in Quebec.
"We can't deny this. We can't forget that two years ago, some men were killed in cold blood when they were praying in a mosque. This is the reality," she said. "Is this what defines the Quebec people? No, but there are Islamophobic acts, and we have to be able to call it out, and act, and to raise awareness. This is for sure."
Plante said she recognizes that for some people, creating a day against Islamophobia is the way to tackle the problem. She said she is looking at other possible actions.
"Raising awareness is very important," she said. "How can we make sure that in the public discourse, we don't allow Islamophobic words and actions? To me, that's the first thing that needs to be done. It's not acceptable to say things specifically that are Islamophobic."
NCCM's Gardee wrote that, in his opinion, Legault is clearly disconnected from the reality of Islamophobia on the ground in Quebec. The NCCM said Legault's original statement pandered to populist and reactionary sentiment to the detriment of Muslims.
Statistics Canada reported in November that the number of hate motivated crimes reported to police increased sharply in Canada in 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/hate-crimes-targeting-blacks-jews-muslims-on-rise-statcan-says/wcm/9ccbab60-a97a-4e85-aa2c-6c33793f239b ), with incidents targeting black people, Jews and Muslims accounting for most of the events.
Toronto Mayor John Tory, meanwhile, has designated Jan. 29 as a day of action against Islamophobia in his city.

Full text: Premier François Legault has backed away from his remarks on Islamophobia( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-francois-legault-rules-out-anti-islamophobia-day-in-quebec ), after sparking a controversy by saying it does not exist in Quebec.
In a statement issued by his office Friday in the wake of the storm of controversy sparked by his remarks Thursday, Legault clarified saying it exists,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments ) but is not commonplace.
"Mr. Legault wanted to say there is no current of Islamophobia in Quebec," the statement said. "Islamophobia exists in Quebec, xenophobia, racism and hatred but not a current of Islamophobia. Quebec is not Islamophobic or racist."
Reached later, Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Legault, further clarified.
"Unfortunately, there are still too many racist acts that occur in our society and we have to do all that is possible to denounce and fight hatred and intolerance," Sauves said.
"However, there is no trend or culture of Islamophobia in Quebec. Quebecers are open and tolerant and they shall continue to exhibit these qualities.
Legault's clarification follows a chorus of complaints from all quarters.
On Friday morning, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) called on Legault to retract the comment, which he made after a caucus meeting of Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs in Gatineau.
He had been explaining why he felt there was no reason to designate Jan. 29 - the date six Muslim men were murdered( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-mosque-shooting ) in a mass shooting in Quebec City in 2017 - as anti-Islamophobia Day in Quebec.
NCCM executive director Ihsaan Gardee said in a statement that the comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.
National Council of Canadian Muslims executive director Ihsaan Gardee said that Premier François Legault's comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.
He was blasted by other politicians, too.
In a tweet posted on the same day as the Liberals entered the second day of a pre-session caucus, interim leader Pierre Arcand said Islamophobia exists in Quebec as it does elsewhere and Legault should reverse his statement.
L'islamophobie existe au Québec comme ailleurs. @francoislegault( https://twitter.com/francoislegault?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) a été catégorique en affirmant que ce phénomène n'existait pas. Je l'invite à se rétracter.#PolQc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolQc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #PLQ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLQ?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Later, at a news conference, Arcand said he accepted Legault's clarification.
"I think he recognized that he made a mistake and corrected it," Arcand said. "I asked him to apologize and that's pretty much what he did. I am satisfied."
Québec solidaire co-spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois also pounced, urging Legault to have a look at comments posted on his public Facebook page after he made the remarks.
François Legault semble douter que l'islamophobie soit un problème réel. Il devrait peut-être aller lire le genre de commentaires laissés sur sa propre page Facebook suite à sa présence à la commémoration des victimes de l'attentat de la mosquée de Qc...#polqc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polqc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/yGVrngsUw7( https://t.co/yGVrngsUw7 )

Boufeldja Benabdallah, president of the Quebec City mosque, released a letter he sent to Legault in which he expressed his disappointment.
"I felt a heavy blow and on top to that I felt betrayed since what you said (in Gatineau) was the exact opposite of what you said at Université Laval (during the recent memorial)," Benabdallah says in the letter he released to the media.
Benabdallah said he accepts the fact the government does not want to have an annual anti-Islamophobia day, but he added:
"With all due respect to you premier, you did not measure the gravity of this sentence that came barely 48 hours after the commemoration of the shooting at the Grand Mosque. I fear your sentence gives credence to the active fringe of society that is feeding Islamophobia."
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Friday that there are Islamophobic acts in Quebec.
"We can't deny this. We can't forget that two years ago, some men were killed in cold blood when they were praying in a mosque. This is the reality," she said. "Is this what defines the Quebec people? No, but there are Islamophobic acts, and we have to be able to call it out, and act, and to raise awareness. This is for sure."
Plante said she recognizes that for some people, creating a day against Islamophobia is the way to tackle the problem. She said she is looking at other possible actions.
"Raising awareness is very important," she said. "How can we make sure that in the public discourse, we don't allow Islamophobic words and actions? To me, that's the first thing that needs to be done. It's not acceptable to say things specifically that are Islamophobic."
NCCM's Gardee wrote that, in his opinion, Legault is clearly disconnected from the reality of Islamophobia on the ground in Quebec. The NCCM said Legault's original statement pandered to populist and reactionary sentiment to the detriment of Muslims.
Statistics Canada reported in November that the number of hate motivated crimes reported to police increased sharply in Canada in 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/hate-crimes-targeting-blacks-jews-muslims-on-rise-statcan-says/wcm/9ccbab60-a97a-4e85-aa2c-6c33793f239b ), with incidents targeting black people, Jews and Muslims accounting for most of the events.
Toronto Mayor John Tory, meanwhile, has designated Jan. 29 as a day of action against Islamophobia in his city.

"Mr. Legault wanted to say there is no current of Islamophobia in Quebec," the statement said. "Islamophobia exists in Quebec, xenophobia, racism and hatred but not a current of Islamophobia. Quebec is not Islamphobic or racist."
Reached later, Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Legault, further clarified.
"Unfortunately, there are still too many racist acts that occur in our society and we have to do all that is possible to denounce and fight hatred and intolerance," said Sauves.
"However, there is no trend or culture of Islamophobia in Quebec. Quebecers are open and tolerant and they shall continue to exhibit these qualities.
Legault's statement follows a chorus of complaints.
Earlier, the province's Liberals and the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) called on Legault to retract the comment, which he made the comment after a caucus meeting of Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs in Gatineau.

And arriving for the caucus meeting, Liberal MNA Gaétan Barrette, the former health minister who now acts as the opposition's treasury board critic, waded into the debate as well.
"To say there is nobody who is Islamophobic here ... it exists as it does elsewhere( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments )," Barrette told reporters. "I am not saying it's systemic. I am not saying society is Islamophobic, but there are people, without a doubt, who are.
"To make such a categoric statement seems to me short-sighted, but coming from Mr. Legault it it not surprising."
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Friday that there are Islamophobic acts in Quebec.
"We can't deny this. We can't forget that two years ago, some men were killed in cold blood when they were praying in a mosque. This is the reality," she said. "Is this what defines the Quebec people? No, but there are Islamophobic acts, and we have to be able to call it out, and act, and to raise awareness. This is for sure."

Full text: MONTRÉAL, Jan. 31, 2019 /CNW/ - What do you get when you add a white-hot economy to North America's most livable and vibrant cultural city?  A 'perfect storm' where employers are going out of their way to attract the best and brightest employees. That's the message from this year's   Montréal's Top Employers , announced this morning by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which organizes the annual Canada's Top 100 Employers project.

"Montréal has long offered a remarkable quality of life, with a rich history and cultural attractions," says Anthony Meehan, Publisher at Mediacorp. "The city also now has the second-lowest unemployment rate on record – people are surprised to learn that it's lower than Toronto's – making the city an even more attractive place to work and live.  No other city in North America can match all of its strengths, both old and new."
"This year's winners reflect the city's stature as an educational powerhouse," adds Richard Yerema, Managing Editor of the Canada's Top 100 Employers project. "You don't find world-class technology and software companies in places that haven't invested in education and skills development – Montréal is home to strong, world-class educational institutions.  The city has benefitted from forward-thinking public investment that has built the foundation for these employers to thrive."
First published in 2006, Montréal's Top Employers is a special designation that recognizes employers in Greater Montréal that lead their industries in offering exceptional places to work. Employers were evaluated by the editors at Canada's Top 100 Employers using the same criteria as the national competition: (1) Physical Workplace; (2) Work Atmosphere & Social; (3) Health, Financial & Family Benefits; (4) Vacation & Time Off; (5) Employee Communications; (6) Performance Management; (7) Training & Skills Development; and (8) Community Involvement. Employers are compared to other organizations in their field to determine which offer the most progressive and forward-thinking programs. The annual competition is open to any employer with its head office in Greater Montréal; employers of any size may apply, whether private- or public-sector.
Founded in 1992, Mediacorp Canada Inc. is the nation's largest publisher of employment periodicals. Since 1999, the Toronto-based publisher has managed the Canada's Top 100 Employers project, which includes 18 regional and special-interest editorial competitions that reach over 15 million Canadians annually through a variety of magazine and newspaper partners. Mediacorp also operates Eluta.ca, the largest Canadian job search engine, which includes editorial reviews from the Canada's Top 100 Employers project and is now used by almost 8 million users in Canada each year. Together with Willis Towers Watson, Mediacorp also hosts the Top Employer Summit, Canada's largest conference for senior-level HR professionals.
The full list of Montr é al's Top Employers (2019)  was released today on the competition homepage. The winners were also announced in a special magazine published in the Montreal Gazette today. Detailed reasons for selection, with hundreds of stories on the winning employers and photos, were released by the editors today and are accessible via the competition homepage.

Stay indoors, Urgences-santé pleads as ice-related injuries rise

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/stay-indoors-urgences-santé-pleads-as-ice-related/docview/2171205985/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: Despite the city of Montreal making progress in its attempt to clear more than 40 centimetres of snow that had fallen since Sunday, the ice left behind by that weather remained a real danger for pedestrians on Friday - so much so that Urgences-santé urged Montrealers to stay indoors unless they have no choice but to go out.
"We are asking the population to delay any non-essential trips (outdoors)," the agency warned on its Twitter account. "The number of calls received for falls because of ice is more than three times the usual number. If you can get to an emergency room or clinic, do so!"
Urgences-santé spokesperson Catherine Domingue said Friday morning's Tweet was resorted to after the first responding service found itself receiving 140 calls per hour Friday morning concerning injuries from falls on ice.
"Normally we deal with about 70 calls (reporting ice related injuries) per day," she said. "We are really at emergency mode today...It's extreme."
Urgences-santé is also asking anyone who witnesses a fall to make sure of the person's condition before calling 911.
The warning came after Thursday's surreal images of intersections turned into slush-filled swamps, pedestrians capering like mountain goats to deal with ice-covered sidewalks and vehicles plowing through bumper-high waves of rain and slush. Still, by Friday morning snow removal efforts finally seemed to be getting the better of a week that included snowstorms, freezing rain and showers better suited for spring than January.
As of 9:30 a.m. Friday, the city was reporting that 62 per cent of Montreal's streets and sidewalks had been cleared of snow( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ) - three percentage points higher than Thursday, and a jump that apparently included some extra efforts being carried out in two heavily populated boroughs.
Sud-Ouest and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which reported clearance rates of 48 per cent on Thursday, saw their numbers spike to 60 per cent less than a day later.
The borough with the highest completion rate - 90 per cent - was Verdun. Outremont had the lowest, at 36 per cent.
A snow-removal worker moves his vehicle onto the sidewalk and gestures to motorists to make way for an ambulance on Cote-des-Neiges Rd. on Wednesday January 23, 2019.
The overnight clearing blitz came after Mayor Valérie Plante acknowledged Montrealers had experienced a difficult week, as a weather cocktail that began with a sub-zero snowstorm Sunday transformed into a 15-cm snowfall Wednesday, followed by freezing rain Wednesday night and rain Thursday.
Plante said Friday that city crews are working very hard to clear streets and sidewalks. Eight ice breakers are among the machines being used in snow clearing operations.
"With ice removal it's a particular situation; yesterday we couldn't put sand or abrasives or break the ice until we cleared the water," she said.
"But we have to remember, winter is our lot in life. It always has been. We're adapting, this (latest) meteorological cocktail has been exceptionally challenging. We haven't exactly been lucky."
Friday's weather forecast calls for periods of light snow beginning in the morning with a high of -5 C and a wind chill near -16. By nightfall, the forecast low is -12 C, with a wind chill near -18 and a 40 per cent chance of flurries.

Full text: This is the second instalment of a three-part farewell by Montreal Gazette restaurant critic Lesley Chesterman, looking back at the people and places she encountered and lessons learned during 20 years on the beat. "This couldn't be the right place," I said in disbelief. It was the spring of 2000, and the restaurant I was standing in front of was Tokyo Sukiyaki. "Oh yes it is," said one of my dining companions, who had recommended I review what was then Montreal's oldest Japanese restaurant.
Cynical as all get-out, I entered the old house, which had definitely seen better days. We were greeted by an elderly, kimono-clad lady. She asked that we remove our shoes, then handed us plastic slippers - red for me, black for the men - before leading us down a dark corridor. Shuffling along, I marvelled at the surroundings, complete with little red bridges criss-crossing a rock-lined stream that meandered through the room toward a small bar. We were shown into one of the 15 closed tatami rooms, where dark red lanterns lined the top of the walls. I couldn't see any other diners, but I could hear faint chatting around me.
Was this a restaurant, I wondered, or a Quentin Tarantino movie? Predicting a bleak outcome, I ordered a few dishes, rubbed my hands in a steaming towel and shot many an evil eye at my friend, before storming out to the pay phone in the corridor to make a reservation at another restaurant. While I was on hold, a kimono-clad waitress slipped past me carrying platters of glistening chicken yakitori and golden shrimp tempura. Suddenly optimistic, I hung up the phone and raced past the waitress to our cubicle, where we enjoyed a, shall we say, unexpectedly delicious Japanese meal.
If ever there was a case for not judging a book by its cover, it was Tokyo Sukiyaki, where the campy decor and top-quality cuisine were completely at odds with the seedy impression the restaurant conveyed from the outside. Lesson learned! That epiphany happened decades ago, and there have been countless eye-opening meals since: many good, as many bad, some frustrating, others life-affirming, a few mind-blowing, several deathly dull, and more than I care to admit that wiped out my bank balance with the push of a button.
Over the course of 20 years, I've written more than 1,000 reviews. Entering with preconceived notions is the worst way a critic can approach a restaurant, and some of my best meals were enjoyed in restaurants where I didn't have a clue what to expect.
Two occasions come to mind when I entered completely neutral but exited utterly floored. The first was at Quebec City's Initiale in the fall of 2000. Chef/owner Yvan Lebrun and maître d'/co-owner Rolande Leclerc served up what remains my most gastronomic experience in Quebec, featuring pure, wellthought-out flavours, masterful cooking techniques and a serene atmosphere. A highlight was the cheese course, which included some 15 specimens from this province. Along with Toqué!, Initiale was one of the first restaurants to convince me that Quebec gastronomy had the potential to become world-class.
Fifteen years later, another unexpected newcomer, Le Mousso, solidified that impression. I entered Le Mousso expecting sparks, but got fireworks - not only because the food was so delicious, but because chef Antonin Mousseau-Rivard had chosen the risky artistic route at a time when even Montreal's top chefs were leaning casual.
I always favour meals that provide a revelation, which was the case at Le Latini in 2000. While lapping up the restaurant's famed tomato, veal and porcini risotto, I finally understood the greatness of this classic - and often poorly conceived - Italian dish. Made from scratch and presented in a large copper pot at the table, theirs was a triumph. The rice was firm yet creamy, the veal was tender, the tomato flavour was rich and the seasoning was bang-on. To this day, it's still the best risotto I've ever tasted. Restaurant meals mark many moments in our lives, and I cherish memories of the first dates I enjoyed at Laloux and the countless celebrations at L'Express. Then there were all the birthdays - my fondest memory being of my 30th birthday at Les Caprices de Nicolas in 1997. I still recall the late chef Nicolas Jongleux's soigné plate presentations, dazzling technique and grasp of flavours.
A disciple of nouvelle cuisine legends Georges Blanc and Alain Chapel, Jongleux turned out the most sophisticated menu that night, including a choux pastry appetizer, a dreamy Béarnaise with the meat main and pommes Pont-Neuf (think oversized french fries) gingerly stacked with silver tongs by the waiter into a small tower on my plate. This was probably the last time I saw tuxedoed waiters in a Montreal dining room. And there were all the little details: beautiful bread baskets, cushy washrooms, tapestry pillows lining the banquettes. What a treat it was to dine at that restaurant, unmatched to this day for class and elegance.
Les Caprices was never haughty, which was hardly the situation at the many Michelin-starred restaurants I've frequented. More often than not at these establishments, the waiters are unfriendly, sommeliers are patronizing, and the food - seemingly assembled by elves holding rulers to make sure every sculpted vegetable is symmetrical - makes me long for a sloppy joe. As much as I admire the mad cooking skills on display, the tension and snobbishness of such institutions tend to wear down one's enthusiasm - especially when the bill arrives, because when you eat at the world's top restaurants, you really (really!) pay for it.
Though I've been one of the few who are lucky enough to have the cost of review meals covered by my employers, when I was off-duty at those lofty restaurants, I picked up the tab. And more often than not, I walked away feeling dumb for having paid so much for nothing more than - let's be honest here - dinner.
I remember the overwhelming dread when receiving bills at places like Astrance in Paris, reputed to be one of the more affordable three-star Michelin restaurants. We ate and drank like royalty, but when the bill rang in at $450 per person, the mood shifted from celebratory to morose. And that's just one of many such examples. (The lesson, obviously, has yet to be learned!) Truth is, even though restaurant reviewing was my chosen career, I couldn't afford to eat at the world's best restaurants that today are reserved for the super wealthy. I recall standing outside Anne-Sophie Pic's restaurant in Valence, France, reading the menu, doing the math and figuring the bill for two would easily amount to $1,000. We headed to her far cheaper - and still excellent - bistro next door.
I also began to notice that as exciting as those luxurious, multi-course menus read, they had become harder and harder to handle physically. A few years back, I ate a mind-blowing omakase menu at Park, with each dish prepared by Antonio Park right in front of me. I think I ate every fish under the sun that night, and when I was ready to keel over, Park was just getting going, following up with foie gras, aged beef loin and a medley of toro offerings. The man was on fire, and everything was so good I could hardly ask him to stop.
It took me three days to recover from that feast, as was the case with every visit to Cabane à sucre Au Pied de Cochon, where I never managed to get through even half the meal. During a marathon dinner at La Chronique, I had to get up at the midpoint of my fivehour meal to go for a walk. When I reviewed Le Vin Papillon in the company of two wine writers, the eating and drinking lasted for six hours. When the meal ended, I actually couldn't stand up. For all I remember, I may have crawled out the door on all fours. Dining one-on-one with visiting food writers has always been a treat, but there is something about eating with a tableful of them that brings out the ugly. I was once invited by Tourism Montreal to dine with a group of European journalists at Au Pied de Cochon. When chef Martin Picard came to greet the table, a woman blurted out: "We want to eat light!" Picard smiled and replied: "Then you're at the wrong restaurant."
Another night found me dining with Parisian journalists at Toqué! during the Montréal en lumière festival. Invited by festival organizers to cover the event, the Parisians had spent a few days touring the Montreal food scene, of which they enjoyed nothing. They told me our smoked meat wasn't authentic, our restaurants were mediocre and the wonderful chocolate shop they visited was "banal." Holding myself back from leaping at them across the table, I argued, rolled my eyes hard and eventually threw in the towel.
During another edition of Montréal en lumière, I joined a group of Québécois journalists at Toqué! to enjoy a tasting menu by Spanish chef Xavier Pellicer. There was no missing the excess saltiness in dish after dish. At the height of the meal, one especially pompous man clinked his glass, stood up and declared in all seriousness: "Messieurs, mesdames, tonight we are experiencing a great culinary experiment: salt used as an ingredient instead of a condiment!" I was surprised, yet they all applauded. When the meal was over, I asked Pellicer about the salting. He answered: "Was it really? When I get nervous, I tend to over-salt."
So many flashbacks come from nights at Toqué!, the epicentre of high gastronomy in Montreal for decades. For its 10th anniversary in 2003, I was invited to a sixcourse extravaganza paired with some of the world's costliest bubbly from the house of Dom Pérignon. Seated at a table of local wine wriers, we were treated to an unbelievable menu featuring luxurious ingredients like oysters, foie gras, princess scallops, lobster and Ossetra caviar. While I sat there marvelling over a plate of sautéed spring strawberries with rhubarb, the wine writers rambled on endlessly about the 1992 rosé Champagne with which it was served. I couldn't believe what I was hearing: not one of them mentioned the food! Some of my regular dining companions could also wreak havoc. For the most part, everyone behaved, but there were exceptions - like the time two friends were arguing and one eventually snapped, stood up and clocked the other one over the head with a menu. I was mortified and suggested he take a taxi home. The only problem: the restaurant was in Oka, and the fare came close to $100.
While reviewing, I've witnessed fights, tears, breakups and confessions, and not just at my table. At a much-loved Outremont restaurant, I saw the chef storm out of the kitchen and right out the front door. Forty-five minutes later, the owner emerged to serve our meal, which I figure he prepared. Chaotic moments aside, restaurant meals can also provide great comfort. When my first son was born, he was kept in the intensive care unit for two weeks, where I spent most of my time in the parents'room sleeping on a couch. Since I didn't take maternity leave, I embraced the distraction of going out on a review dinner, and chose to drown my sorrows in rich French food at Les Halles for a few hours before heading back to the NICU.
When my father passed away two years ago, we planned a family dinner after his funeral at Moishes. Despite our profound sadness, we feasted hard that night - in an effort, I believe, to fill the deepest of voids.
During the 1998 ice storm, my then-husband and I moved from friend's house to friend's house in search of electricity and company. One dark night while walking down the icy streets of the Main, we were surprised to see the lights on at Globe and went inside for dinner. I recall a very young and far less famous David McMillan showing us to a banquette and serving us a perfect meal of roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, dishing up the food himself at our table. That cheered us up no end, as did several breakfasts at Beautys during those grim January weeks. Whenever I hear the term "comfort food," those meals always come to mind. So, with all those dinners under my belt, you might wonder whether one ranks as the best. The critic in me would say dinner at the Joël Robuchon restaurant at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas back in 2009, which featured a plethora of sublime ingredients transformed by some of the most skilled chefs on the planet. It was utterly flawless, and I recall taking notes and pictures between every jaw-dropping sip and bite. And yet, when it comes to sheer deliciousness, a meal enjoyed during a press trip to Greece in 2014 quashed the nouvelle cuisine perfection at every turn.
The feast began at 11 p.m. at the Gavrilis Tavern in the village of Kouvaras, a 40-minute drive south of Athens. Along with a few sommeliers and wine writers, I was seated with winemaker Vassili Papagiannakos and his wife, Tonia, of Domaine Papagiannakos. Our dinner began with a flurry of small plates, including grilled peppers, stuffed vine leaves, Greek salad and oliveoil-fried french fries. We dipped pieces of crusty bread into tzatziki. We sipped the taverna's homemade retsina. Mid-meal, we gathered around a butcher block in the open kitchen, where we marvelled as a lamb, reared by the tavern's owners, was expertly sectioned into chops, legs and shoulder cuts, which were then salted and grilled in a metal basket over open coals. As instructed, we picked up the long and delicate lamb chops with our fingers and munched our way through to the bone. The combination of grilled lamb fat, salty meat, dried oregano and the garlicky side dishes with the retsina was intoxicating. It was a profoundly authentic meal, and never have I seen people so proud of what they were serving. In a word: heaven.
Honestly, either of those meals would rank as the best. But choosing the ultimate dining experience is a futile exercise: as any true restaurant lover knows, there's always something new on the horizon.

During a marathon dinner at La Chronique( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/local-food-reviews/restaurant-review-23-years-on-la-chronique-rises-to-any-occasion ), I had to get up at the midpoint of my five-hour meal to go for a walk.

A mind-blowing menu prepared by Antonio Park left Lesley Chesterman reeling in more ways than one.

Dining one-on-one with visiting food writers has always been a treat, but there is something about eating with a tableful of them that brings out the ugly. I was once invited by Tourism Montreal to dine with a group of European journalists at Au Pied de Cochon. When chef Martin Picard came to greet the table, a woman blurted out: "We want to eat light!"

During another edition of Montréal en lumière( https://montrealgazette.com/life/food/everythings-on-the-table-at-the-montreal-en-lumiere-festival ), I joined a group of Québécois journalists at Toqué! to enjoy a tasting menu by Spanish chef Xavier Pellicer.

Toque! has been the epicentre of high gastronomy in Montreal for decades.

That cheered us up no end, as did several breakfasts at Beautys during those grim January weeks. Whenever I hear the term "comfort food," those meals always come to mind.
A family dinner at Moishes was intensely therapeutic.

So, with all those dinners under my belt, you might wonder whether one ranks as the best. The critic in me would say dinner at the Joël Robuchon( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/lesley-chesterman-the-culinary-perfectionism-of-joel-robuchon ) restaurant at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas back in 2009, which featured a plethora of sublime ingredients transformed by some of the most skilled chefs on the planet. It was utterly flawless, and I recall taking notes and pictures between every jaw-dropping sip and bite. And yet, when it comes to sheer deliciousness, a meal enjoyed during a press trip to Greece in 2014( http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/lesley+chesterman+some+mediterranean+inspiration+your+cooking/10111395/story.html ) quashed the nouvelle cuisine perfection at every turn.
The feast began at 11 p.m. at the Gavrilis Tavern in the village of Kouvaras, a 40-minute drive south of Athens. Along with a few sommeliers and wine writers, I was seated with winemaker Vassili Papagiannakos and his wife, Tonia, of Domaine Papagiannakos. Our dinner began with a flurry of small plates, including grilled peppers, stuffed vine leaves, Greek salad and olive-oil-fried french fries. We dipped pieces of crusty bread into tzatziki. We sipped the taverna's homemade retsina. Mid-meal, we gathered around a butcher block in the open kitchen, where we marvelled as a lamb, reared by the tavern's owners, was expertly sectioned into chops, legs and shoulder cuts, which were then salted and grilled in a metal basket over open coals. As instructed, we picked up the long and delicate lamb chops with our fingers and munched our way through to the bone. The combination of grilled lamb fat, salty meat, dried oregano and the garlicky side dishes with the retsina was intoxicating. It was a profoundly authentic meal, and never have I seen people so proud of what they were serving. In a word: heaven.
Honestly, either of those meals would rank as the best. But choosing the ultimate dining experience is a futile exercise: as any true restaurant lover knows, there's always something new on the horizon.

Full text: A man with ties to Quebec far-right groups( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-guide-to-the-far-right ) discussed staging a fake terrorist attack to "wake up" people in the province and encouraged his peers to start training with firearms.
In private chat logs obtained by the Montreal Gazette, a man calling himself Phénix le Patriote wrote that "(there) would have to be a fake terrorist attempt" to "scare the hell out of" Quebecers.
He followed the post by adding, "don't worry ... many actions coming up."
Phénix also shared an image of targets he had fired on with a 9-mm and .22 calibre pistol at a shooting range in Joliette. Alongside the image, dated Jan. 22, 2018, he added the caption, "do as I do brothers."
That comment was met with the reply, "Great job, Patriote. Keep your aim true" from another member of the private chat.
The logs belong to a fringe right-wing group that calls itself Patriotes du Québec and includes members of Storm Alliance, Le Front Patriotique du Québec and Atalante Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-couple-attacked-after-defying-far-right-group-to-file-report ).
The activist who uncovered the chat logs shared them with the Sûreté du Québec last January, alongside evidence that suggests Phénix may be a member of the right-wing group La Meute.
"(Phénix is) not the type of person we're looking for as a member," said La Meute spokesperson Sylvain Brouillette. "The Patriotes (online group) has nothing to do with La Meute. There's actually tension between us."
A representative from Storm Alliance denied any knowledge of the chat group.
The SQ received the complaint last winter and passed the information along to a unit that investigates hate groups, according to a police source.
"We can't comment on this particular group but we do keep an eye on extremism of all stripes for criminal activity," said Lt. Hugo Fournier of the SQ. "But again, we can't confirm or deny anything about this group."
A detective with the Montreal police says people should report these types of incidents to law enforcement.
"It's a criminal act to encourage others to commit violence," said Line Lemay, a lieutenant-detective with the department's hate crime task force. "You don't want something terrible to happen and then, after the fact, you hear about how there were all these signs.
"Just because you report someone doesn't mean we'll treat them like a criminal. Often it's just a matter of contacting the person and letting them know their words have consequences."
One anti-radicalization expert told the Gazette he was "extremely worried" about Phénix's posts.
"Someone who says these things - in public or in private - is clearly in a dangerous state of mind," said Maxime Fiset, a project co-ordinator with the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence. "People around him should call the police to make sure those words aren't backed up with action."
While it's difficult to gauge how serious the posts are, Fiset says the images of Phénix's target practice suggest he may have the means to commit a violent act. He added it's troubling to see none of the other group members challenge him on his extremist ideas.
"When no one discourages you, when the exchanges only escalate, the idea of real world violence becomes normalized," Fiset said. "And it becomes possible for him to commit a violent act."
One of Phénix's associates, in the chats, goes by the username Heinrich Himmler - a reference to the Nazi commander who directed the killing of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.
People who post hateful or extremist comments online are frequently isolated, angry and suffer from mental illness, according to Lemay.
"They often take the anger about whatever is going wrong in their life and they target immigrants or some group of people with that anger," she said. "Our job is to assess how serious the threat is and sometimes simply to put people in touch with mental health services, a local clinic and just work to the root of the problem."
When police do intervene, they can refer cases to the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence.
One of the challenges of investigating online extremism is that users often use pseudonyms and post in secret Facebook groups, away from prying eyes. Because police don't actively monitor right-wing groups, they rely on tipsters to report problematic online behaviour.
Often, the work of investigating these networks is carried out by online vigilantes who infiltrate the groups and gather intelligence on them. In this case, a Twitter user who runs the anonymous @LeTroupeauQC( https://twitter.com/LetroupeauQC/ ) account uncovered the secret chat logs.
On social media, Phénix also writes about taking classes at a martial arts gym in Joliette. He uses the Quebec Patriotes flag - which symbolized the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion - as his social media avatar.
In the Patriotes chat group, members talk about wanting to act as advisers to Aline Lafond. Lafond is an activist whohas called for the abolition of the Quebec Liberal Party( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xq3lCCt0AU ) because, she claims, it wants to "destroy Quebec identity, destroy our borders and allow the free circulation of illegal, potentially dangerous immigrants."
In public, Storm Alliance and La Meute strongly deny any claims that they target Muslims or immigrants. Leaders in both groups insist they only have a problem with illegal immigration and Islamic extremism.
However, on their private pages, some share anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and have in the past joked about gift-wrapping a pig's head and leaving it at the door of a Quebec City mosque.
Months after the exchange about the mosque, someone left a gift-wrapped pig's head at the foot of the Centre Culturelle Islamique de Québec.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/pigs-head-was-discussed-on-facebook-before-quebec-city-incident )
It's impossible to know when or how a person goes from posting extreme rhetoric online to carrying out real-life actions. But in cases where users begin to suggest the use of violence, Fiset says it's imperative their friends or loved ones reach out for help.
"It doesn't have to be the police; you can call the prevention centre," Fiset said. "Just because you ask for our help or call the police doesn't mean someone will get arrested and charged. In the end, you're helping that person."

Full text: Shovelling, driving, power-failure survival guide
Shovelling can be bad for your back - and your heart.
Shovelling
Shovellers have more to fear than ill-timed city snow plows undoing hours of work.
The combination of physical exertion and cold weather can increase the risk of a heart attack, especially in inactive people and those with heart disease.
"Scooping heavy, wet snow raises your heart rate quickly," the Heart and Stroke Foundation warns. "Add in cold temperatures that raise blood pressure and increase the likelihood of developing blood clots, and it can be deadly."
If you load your shovel with five kilograms of snow every five seconds, you'll have moved almost 1,000 kg of snow after 15 minutes. That's hard on the heart and the back.
Here are some shovelling tips( https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/snow_shovelling.html ) from the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety:
. Pace yourself( http://blog.heartandstroke.ca/2016/01/shovel-smart-this-winter/ ). Take frequent breaks and drink warm, non-alcoholic beverages.
. Push snow rather than lift it.
. If you must throw snow, only pick up as much snow as you can easily lift. Then, rather than twist at the waist, turn your feet toward the direction at which you're aiming.
. Avoid overheating; wear thin, breathable layers.
. Don't shovel on a full stomach. Digest your meals first; otherwise, shovelling could put an extra strain on your heart.
. Stop shovelling if you experience sudden shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, light-headedness, nausea, dizziness, or severe headache and immediately seek medical attention.
Shovels should:
. Be light (about 1.5 kilograms or 3 pounds), and sturdy.
. Feature a handle that reaches the users's chest to reduce forward bending.
. Include a shaft with a bend.
. Have the right blade for the job at hand. A large push-style shovel will let you move more snow but may lead you to lift heavy loads. Smaller blades are best for lifting and throwing snow.
Slowing down on snow and ice will give your tires more time to grip the road.
Driving
Before you drive in wintry weather, consider these tips from CAA-Québec and Transport Canada:
. Remove all snow( https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/safevehicles-safetyfeatures-winterdriving-index-693.htm ) from your vehicle's hood, roof, windows and lights. Clear windows of frost and fog.
. Get a tune-up( https://www.caaquebec.com/en/storage/graffiti-some-tips-for-prevention-and-cleaning/winter-driving-tips/ ), including an inspection of electrical components, as well as air-intake, fuel, exhaust, ignition, cooling system and windshield wipers.
. Slow down on snow and ice. Your tires will have more time to grip the road. Give yourself extra travel time in bad weather.
. Avoid using cruise control on slippery roads.
. Always turn the steering wheel slowly to retain control.
. Front-wheel skids are often caused by excessive speed on a turn or the wheels locking up. If you find yourself in a front-wheel skid, gently ease up on the accelerator or brake pedal and steer in the direction of the turn while looking in the direction you want to go.
. For rear-wheel skids, turn the front wheels in the direction in which the back end has started swinging, while looking in the direction you want to go.
. Be alert for deceptive conditions. Invisible black ice can form when the temperature hovers around zero, especially on bridges, overpasses and underpasses. In rural areas, road conditions can change quickly from dry to snowy or ice-covered.
. Leave more space than normal between your car and the one ahead of you to give yourself time to respond if an emergency arises.
. Prepare an emergency kit for your trunk. It should include a shovel, a snow brush, a scraper, traction aids, booster cables, windshield-washer fluid, a reflective vest, a battery-free flashlight, basic tools, a first-aid kit, a warm blanket and some non-perishable snacks.
Hydro-Québec says storms, snow, freezing rain and winds are some of the main causes of power failures.
Home emergency kit
Authorities suggest you prepare a home kit with basic supplies( https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/yprprdnssgd/index-en.aspx ) that can help you take care of yourself and your family for 72 hours in case of an emergency such as an extended power failure.
Heavy snow and freezing rain can take down power lines, though Hydro-Québec says power outages are actually more common in the summer.
What should your emergency kit include?
Here are some basic( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/be-prepared-for-power-outage/index.html#conseils ) supplies suggested( http://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/family-safety-plan/emergency-kit.html ) by Public Safety Canada, Hydro-Québec and Quebec's public-security department.
. Water (at least two litres of water per person per day).
. Food that won't spoil, such as canned food, energy bars and dried foods.
. Manual can-opener.
. Crank or battery-powered flashlight (and extra batteries). Replace batteries regularly.
. Warm blankets.
. Battery-powered radio (and extra batteries) to monitor the situation.
. First aid kit (bandages, gauze sterile pads, scissors, tweezers, safety pins, antiseptic, pain medication).
. Other items such as prescription medication, infant formula and equipment for people with disabilities.

Green Christmas: 15 Christmases( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-a-green-christmas-in-montreal ) over the past 60 years have been "green," which Environment Canada defines as having less than 2 cm accumulated snow on the ground on Dec. 25.
First snow
The first snowfall (2 cm on the ground) typically happened by Nov. 29 in the years between 1871 and 1910. Between 1971 and 2010, the first snow on the ground was normally recorded on Dec. 12. This year it happened on Nov. 21.
Last snow
In the late 1800s, it was normally around April 8 by the time Montreal's last snow had all melted. In the years since 2000, the average snow expiry date had moved up to March 23.

Full text: What's in a name?
A whole heck of a lot if you look at the battle being waged at McGill University over whether it should keep the name Redmen for its varsity teams, or change it out of respect for Indigenous people.
In one camp are athletes, current and former, who say the origins of the storied Redmen are being misconstrued. They say that dumping it would dishonour their alma mater's history as well as negate the truth.
In the other are Indigenous groups, an overwhelming majority of the students who voted( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-redmen-tensions-mount-as-students-vote-on-controversial-name ) in a referendum, and more than 100 professors who signed a petition. They say the Redmen name is hurtful, no longer acceptable and must go.
So it's nostalgia versus evolving contemporary values, intended meaning versus popular interpretation. But what it really comes down to is pride in a sports team versus a small step toward making amends for centuries of cultural genocide, discrimination and marginalization. Should there really be any contest?
To be fair, there are reasoned arguments on both sides of the debate. It is true that the original moniker was a reference to the varsity teams' colours and university founder James McGill's Scottish heritage, not a supposed shade of skin. So Redmen isn't a blatant caricature of Indigenous people or misappropriation of culture, like the Edmonton Eskimos, Cleveland Indians or Washington Redskins.
But it is equally true that there were long and cringeworthy periods when the Redmen teams did overtly embrace Indigenous terms and symbols. Tomahawks and headdresses have served as logos. The men's teams were nicknamed the Indians, the women's the Squaws.
The use of racist stereotypes and offensive slurs then undermines the assertion now that the Redmen name is innocent, with no connection whatsoever to anything Indigenous. Even if the unfortunate associations of the past were mistaken references and rightly abandoned decades ago, it shows the name comes with connotations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-redmen-u-s-scholar-says-name-reinforces-white-settler-society ) from which it cannot be cleanly divorced.
The damage has been done and will continue to be done as long as McGill clings to the loaded name.
To the athletes and alumni who proudly competed as Redmen, the sadness of losing the name they sweat and bled for cannot compare to the pain of what Indigenous people have endured over the centuries and still endure. Saying it's all just a big misunderstanding is a minimization of racism, which is not merely hurt feelings, but a deep and abiding wound.
Plenty of other sports teams( https://www.totalprosports.com/2012/12/12/15-teams-that-changes-names-without-changing-cities/ ) have survived name changes, many for lesser reasons than avoiding offence. The Ottawa Redblacks were formerly the Rough Riders and the Houston Astros were previously the Colt .45s. St John's University in New York had used the Redmen nickname for its varsity athletic programs since the 1920s, referencing the red uniforms the teams wore. But before the 1994-95 season, amid pressure from Indigenous groups that considered Redmen a slur on their heritage, the university changed their name to the Red Storm.
The importance of atoning for past wrongs against Indigenous people should also outweigh adherence to tradition. McGill has made many strides in the wake of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report to open its doors to more Indigenous students and professors by providing more bursaries and scholarships, undertaking research and incorporating the indigenous perspective into programs from law to education. Many gatherings also begin with an acknowledgment that the campus sits on unrelinquished territory. These are positive and concrete steps in the right direction. But the task force that called for these measures also recommended the dropping of the Redmen name.
So it's not the "wrong gesture for the wrong reasons"( https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-mcgill-students-vote-to-scrap-redmen-team-name/ ) as those fighting for the Redmen name contend.
McGill is clearly feeling the pressure from alumni to keep the Redmen name and awaits a report by a working group on "commemoration and renaming" due next month before making a decision( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-university-waiting-for-dec-6-report-to-rule-on-redmen-name ). But it's hard to see how the administration can justify keeping it, with the protests,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-protesters-demand-change-of-redmen-name ) petitions and now the plebiscite on campus.
Even if the turnout was only 27 per cent and the result non-binding, the fact 79 per cent voted to change( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-redmen-tensions-mount-as-students-vote-on-controversial-name ) means students have spoken. Like the vote against Calgary bidding for the 2026 Olympics or Brexit, the results may be disappointing to some. But that's democracy and today's student body is ready to turn the page.
Just because the Redmen name was not or is not meant to be racist doesn't mean that it isn't. Just because it was not intended to injure doesn't erase the fact that it does. This is not political correctness run amok or capitulation to cultural over-sensitivity, this is about recognizing that words matter.
And for a university of McGill's calibre, the name in which it earns pride and seeks athletic glory matters all the more.

An earlier version of this story erroneously referred to Peter McGill as the founder of the university. The Montreal Gazette regrets the error.

It's no stretch: Playing the long game pays off for Leafs

Author: McGran, Kevin

Full text: It was Game 7 against the Boston Bruins last April, possibly the worst night of Jake Gardiner’s career.
With the Leafs down 5-4, Gardiner made a stretch pass from his own zone to the Boston blue line.
The intended receiver was Patrick Marleau, but Boston defenceman Zdeno Chara sent the puck back toward the Leaf net and David Pastrnak scored. It was 6-4 Bruins, who would add an empty-netter en route to a 7-4 win . Minus-5 for Gardiner. The Leafs’ season was over.
In an emotional post-game interview, Gardiner took the blame for the loss. At that moment, Carl Gunnarsson was texting his good buddy and former teammate.
“I wouldn’t put all the blame on Jake. I feel bad for him,” said Gunnarsson. “You need a little tip from the forward. Didn’t get it. It came back. You can’t blame him 100 per cent.”
Fans of the Maple Leafs, and maybe even Gardiner himself, might never be able to forget the moment. But they should. Because the stretch pass — from the defensive zone to a waiting winger across centre ice — is becoming more prevalent across the league as a means to create offence.
“It’s a big part of the speed game that’s being played today,” says Penguins coach Mike Sullivan. “The ability to stretch the ice, and pull defencemen back and create gap challenges. There’s a lot of strategy by utilizing the stretch guy, and taking advantage of the speed underneath.”
The statistics show the stretch pass is effective. When it works, it can be spectacular. When it doesn’t work, it hardly ever hurts the team making the pass.
“Defences are trying to move the puck up in a hurry,” says Kings coach John Stevens. “Players recognize when their team has possession, you start heading to open ice. We’re talking about how much the game is faster. It’s not just guys are skating faster. It’s the puck speed that’s making the game faster.”
If it is possible to be the best at something and the worst at the same thing — at the same time — then the Maple Leafs own those titles regarding the stretch pass.
According to thepointhockey.com, the Maple Leafs led the league last season in stretch-pass attempts (1,564) and were worst in the league in stretch-pass completion percentage (59.4 per cent).
The thing is, the Leafs’ 929 completed passes — second in the league — led to far more scoring chances for than the missed passes led to scoring chances against.
“Complete 10 stretch passes that lead to goals, screw one up that ends up in your net and guess what people remember?” said statistician Mike Kelly, who authored the stretch pass report for Point Hockey.
Kelly says the stretch pass is to hockey what home runs are to baseball: Pass completion rates and batting averages don’t matter as long as the play works often enough to create offence. Excluding goals following faceoffs, Kelly’s research shows almost 75 per cent of goals come within 10 seconds of entering the zone, with another 10 per cent coming in the next five seconds. Thus the effectiveness of a stretch pass.
“A completed stretch pass can lead to a controlled zone entry, odd-man rush or breakaway — all increasing a team’s chances of producing a scoring chance and ultimately a goal. ... As for incompletions, more often than not an incomplete stretch pass will lead to a neutral zone puck battle that can be won by either team. Rarely are these passes picked off clean and taken back the other way for a quality chance.”
The stretch pass is here to stay.
“If it works, most time it’s going to be an offensive chance,” says Gardiner. “If it doesn’t, you usually the get the puck in and go on offence.”
ON A STREAK: Sebastian Aho has points in all nine of Carolina’s games, inching closer to the franchise record of 11 games set by Ron Francis. ... Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen are tied for the franchise’s longest point streak to start a season (nine games) with Joe Sakic and Anton Stastny, who did it in 1988.
STICKING WITH IT: Ottawa sniper Mark Stone switched sticks and it paid off with a two-goal performance against Montreal over the weekend. “I’ve always wanted to use a bigger curve to help my shot,” he told Ottawa reporters. “I think, if you look at all the guys that are sharpshooters, they’re using pretty big curves, so I thought I’d give it a try. It’s a bit of a toe curve, but it’s just a bit bigger. I usually use a relatively straight curve and I handle the puck better, but I like this one. Everything is the same (about the stick). Just the blade is different.”
ON THE REBOUND: Dallas goaltending coach Jeff Reese said the team keeps internal numbers which say goalie Ben Bishop — off to his best start in a Stars uniform — has been good at redirecting rebounds and limiting opportunities. Reese also makes the distinction between a good rebound and a bad rebound. A good one heads out of harm’s way, likely to the corner. A bad one bounces back to the slot for another scoring chance. “When you throw a puck at the net, if we’re going to kick them right back out in the slot, it makes it really tough on your defence to find it,” Reese told the Dallas Morning News. “When you’re boxing out, they don’t know where it is. It makes it tough on the D. The better you can control your rebounds, obviously, the better it is for everybody.”
COLD KNIGHTS: The Vegas Golden Knights’ second line — featuring Max Pacioretty and Erik Haula — has yet to score a goal. Paul Stastny started on the line until getting hurt in the third game of the season. Tomas Hyka is on the right wing lately. Pacioretty and Haula have yet to find the net in the nearly 78 minutes they’ve played 5-on-5 with any other player on their line, though they have generated 56 total scoring chances together while allowing just 35. “Overall, me and Max are probably a little frustrated with not being able to get on the board,” Haula told the Las Vegas Review Journal. “Not that we’ve played bad or anything, it’s just one of those times where it’s not going in.”
BOWER POWER: Meadowvale Four Rinks in Mississauga will dedicate Rink 1 to Maple Leafs great Johnny Bower. It is the rink closest to where the late goalie lived. He wore No. 1 during four-time Stanley Cup winning careers. “It is an honour to recognize Johnny Bower at the arena where he was well known as a mentor to many young hockey players and where his grandchildren skated,” said Pat Saito, Councillor, Ward 9. Bower died on Dec. 26.
FROM THE KHL: Toronto-born defenceman Mathew Maione of Dinamo Riga is leading the KHL in scoring with six goals and 18 assists. The 27-year-old played for the Niagara Ice Dogs and Guelph Storm 2008-10. This is his first year in the KHL. ... Vienna will host its first KHL games later this week when Slovan Bratislava play a couple of home games there against CSKA and SKA.
FROM THE CWHL: The Toronto Furies won a pair of games in Worcester over the weekend, with Natalie Spooner scoring both in a 2-1 win over the Blades on Saturday, and Shiann Darkangelo scoring both in a 2-0 win in Sunday. ... In Montreal, the Canadiennes swept the Markham Thunder in a pair of games, 5-1 and 7-1. ... Canadian Olympian Jill Saulnier is leading the CWHL in scoring with three goals, four assists in four games.
REMEMBERING WRITERS: The Professional Hockey Writers Association is honouring two long-time Members who died last season, Red Fisher of the Montreal Gazette and Steve Harris of the Boston Herald. Profile pictures of both hockey writers are depicted on the bottom right corner of all PHWA membership cards for the 2018-19 NHL season. The cards this year feature the Red, White and Blue of the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals. Fisher covered hockey since 1955 until his death at 91 in January, and was a founder of the 300-member PHWA, established in 1967. His No. 1 PHWA card will be retired — the first badge number to be retired in the association’s history. Harris died in February at age 66. He had been covering the Bruins since the 1979.

Tornadoes not a new phenomenon

Full text: The global warming crowd blames climate change for the devastating tornado that struck the Ottawa area on Sept. 21, 2018.
Politicians have been leading proponents of that contention.
According to the Montreal Gazette, the mayor of Gatineau claims the tornado was caused by climate change. Other politicians echoed that belief.
But, weather history muddies that argument. Particularly illuminating is recent Russian-published research that shows the Northern Hemisphere has been cooling since 2013 and that recent extreme weather events are unrelated to the ongoing warming in the Southern Hemisphere.
According to the U.S.-based National Climate Data Center, Canada's first recorded tornado occurred near Niagara Falls in June 1792, in a climate interval (A.D. 1650-1850) so cold it was called the 'Little Ice Age'. Forbes.com confirms that Canada experienced exceptionally cold conditions virtually throughout those 200 years: Rocky Mountain glaciers expanded and the Great Lakes had unusually expansive ice cover.
Within that cold period were three significant Ontario tornadoes in 1829 (Guelph, Collingwood and Galt): the latter resulted in Ontario's first tornado-caused human fatality.
A very severe F4 tornado touched down near Elora, Ont. in 1884, and an 1888 tornado near Cornwall claimed three lives. In 1898, nine people died and dozens were injured in a tornado near St. Catharines.
On June 20, 1912, a major F4 tornado killed 24 people and injured over 300 near Regina, Sask., and two years later, a powerful tornado blew a freight train off its tracks near Medicine Hat, AB.
Multiple tornadoes in southern Manitoba in June 1922 killed five people and injured hundreds. In 1935, a deadly F4 tornado struck Benson, SK and five days later, an F3 tornado devastated Smiley, SK.
Closer to home, on May 4, 1953, an F4 tornado killed seven people, injured 40 and destroyed over 500 homes at Windsor, Ont. Aug. 20, 1974, nine people died and many were injured at Windsor due to an F3 tornado. In Aug. 1979, an F4 tornado struck Woodstock, killing two, injuring 150 and destroying 480 homes.
In 1980, there were 47 tornadoes recorded in Canada: 24 in Ontario. Between 2001 and 2004, there were 32 Canadian tornadoes, including an F1 tornado near Ottawa. In 2005, F2 tornadoes struck Fergus, Elmira, Salem and Guelph.
Between 2009 and 2013, there were 205 tornadoes recorded in Canada, almost half in Ontario. Between 2014 and 2017, there were 209 tornadoes recorded in Canada; 71 in Ontario.
Almost unbelievable wind speeds have been confirmed for some Canadian tornadoes. In June 2007, in Manitoba, a twister had wind speeds of up to 510 km/h.
Environment Canada researchers stress that tornadoes are weather phenomena generated by local storm conditions. Shifts in the Jet Stream are contributing factors.

Crown seeks maximum sentence in Vaudreuil-Dorion home invasion

Full text: Santiago Jimenez experiences anxiety every time he opens the front door to his home.
The simple action reminds the 74-year-old engineer and salesman of how a stranger stormed into his home in Vaudreuil-Dorion before noon on Nov. 27, 2015, and pummelled his face so badly he was unable to see anything as he was later rushed to a hospital.
"I was technically dead and I was lucky to be alive," Jimenez said at the Valleyfield courthouse on Thursday while he testified at a sentence hearing for Rakeim Terrence Floyd, the 27-year-old St-Lazare resident who pleaded guilty, on Jan. 11, to four charges related to the home invasion.
"I don't want to hurt you," Floyd was quoted as having told Jimenez when he forced his way into the home and then, seconds later, proceeded to repeatedly punch the victim in the face. The victim suffered several skull fractures and his eyes were so badly damaged he had to undergo two different types of surgery to correct his vision.
Jimenez was alone at the time and still can't recall how he managed to call 911 and his wife after Floyd left his home.
"I have lived and I continue to live terrible moments," Jimenez said while explaining to Quebec Court Judge Bertrand St-Arnaud how, three years later, emotions like anger, anxiety and panic continue to suddenly surface.
"Every time I wake up I feel different emotions. I experience panic attacks," he said. "Every time I open the front door I see (Floyd) standing there. No matter what I do I cannot put away my memories of this person."
Prosecutor Pierre-Olivier Gagnon asked that Floyd be sentenced to a 14-year prison term, the maximum sentence for the aggravated assault charge to which he pleaded guilty. Gagnon noted that Floyd has already been convicted in another home invasion, carried out with an accomplice on Dec. 15, 2011. In that case, Floyd received an overall sentence of 30 months. Back then, his youth and lack of a significant criminal record were considered mitigating factors that contributed to the sentence. Floyd cannot expect the same leniency this time around. His lawyer, Guy Lalonde, concedes his client merits a sentence somewhere between six and eight years.
To support his argument for the maximum sentence, Gagnon submitted a pre-sentencing report in which Floyd, who listened to Jimenez's testimony without registering any reaction, was assessed as being at high risk of reoffending. St-Arnaud was also shown images, recorded by surveillance cameras inside stores, that proved Floyd gassed up his car and purchased a pair of gloves just minutes before he assaulted Jimenez.
Jimenez and his wife were unable to return to their home for more than a month while police continued to search for the person responsible. He and his wife had security cameras installed in their home and a gate in an entranceway in the weeks that followed the attack. They also hired security guards to protect them for weeks while they continued to wonder why someone would storm into their home and carry out a crime with such brutal force. Jimenez's wife estimated they spent more than $70,000 in an effort to feel safe again.
Floyd was ultimately linked to the home invasion through his car, a gift from his father, Tyrone Floyd, and was arrested in January 2016. By the time police got their hands on the car it had been throughly cleaned except for the seatbelt buckles, where a forensics expert found traces of Jimenez's DNA.
Tyrone Floyd, 47, testified in support of his son on Thursday and urged St-Arnaud to consider that his oldest son (out of eight children) began abusing dugs and alcohol in high school where he was mocked for being overweight and managed to keep the abuse a secret for years.
"(The prosecution) is painting a picture of someone who is horrible. That is not Rakeim," the father said while adding that his son only opened up to him about his substance abuse following his arrest for the second home invasion.
"It's very difficult time for us also. That's not how I raised him," the father said.
While being cross-examined by Gagnon later in his testimony, Tyrone Floyd conceded that another of his sons is currently out on parole as part of a four-year sentence he received for carrying out a home invasion.
St-Arnaud said he will deliberate on the arguments and testimony he heard before he delivers his decision.

Full text: Here's what happened while you were enjoying some rest.
An 80-year-old motorcyclist died after a tractor accident in St-Georges-de-Clarenceville, Montérégie( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/motorcyclist-80-dies-after-colliding-with-tractor ). According to preliminary information collected by the Sûreté du Québec, the collision occurred when the driver of the tractor entered Beech Road in a southerly direction, after having stopped at an intersection on Highway 202, a little before 2 p.m. The motorcyclist did not have a mandatory stop, according to the SQ.
Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard said the situation in storm-ravaged Gatineau highlights the importance of a comprehensive plan to fight climate change( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-gatineau-disaster-highlights-need-for-climate-plan-couillard-says ). Suspending his campaign for most of Saturday, Couillard travelled to Gatineau on Saturday morning to survey the damage from a tornado that touched down in the region( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/tens-of-thousands-without-power-following-tornado-in-ottawa-region/wcm/8e9f41c6-00c7-4518-841f-b78c40a2a865 ). He was joined by Parti Québécois leader Jean-François Lisée( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-lisee-reroutes-campaign-bus-to-visit-tornado-aftermath ). Coalition Avenir Québec Leader François Legault also visited the region Saturday. Returning to Montreal to meet reporters, Couillard defended his party's plan, saying it is the right approach, despite the fact the PQ and Québec solidaire are proposing more ambitious plans to fight climate change that each include a plan to fully electrify the transportation sector. He said: "If we want to go forward in the environmental file, it must be together with the public, so to tell Quebecers at that date you won't be allowed to own gasoline-powered vehicles is not the right way to do it, according to me. Ramming this through the public is not going to do anything for the environment. There has to be a public buy in."
A maze cut into a cornfield featuring the likeness of a former NASA astronaut has been photographed by a satellite orbiting Earth. The image of Oklahoma-born Thomas P. Stafford is cut into a 10-acre field at P Bar Farms in Hydro, about 100 kilometres west of Oklahoma City. The maze was created in partnership with the Stafford Air and Space Museum, named for the astronaut, in nearby Weatherford. A satellite photographed the tribute from its orbit 650 kilometres away. The 88-year-old Stafford is a Weatherford native whose space missions included commanding the Apollo flight that linked with a Soviet spacecraft in 1975. It was the first meeting of American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts in space.

Full text: GATINEAU - Two of the five worst rainstorms in 90 years, the worst floods on record and, on Friday evening, a tornado - this western Quebec town has seen all four in less than 18 months.
For Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin the cause is clear: climate change.
"Are we going to take this threat seriously? It's not a theory, it's people who are displaced, people who suffered, people who have lost everything," Pedneaud-Jobin said on Saturday. "In Gatineau, we've suffered a lot, we're continuing to suffer and one of the main sources of that, it's clear, is climate change."
Standing beside Québec solidaire co-spokesperson Manon Massé and François Legault, the Coalition Avenir Québec leader, it was the second time in a few hours the mayor had appeared alongside two rivals for the premiership of Quebec who had temporarily put aside their difference to show their support for the tornado-ravaged community.
"It's important for citizens that are going through very tough times to understand that all the leaders are together," Pedneaud-Jobin said said of the visits. "I think it's a show of solidarity and it does count when you're going through tough times. It's also an occasion to speak about real problems that will need real solutions in the future."
Earlier in the day, it was Parti Québecois Leader Jean-François Lisée and Philippe Couillard - who temporarily suspended his campaign to act more as premier than Liberal leader - who visited victims of the storm.
By 4:30 p.m., the mayor said, the majority of people who had been displaced by the tornado, and spent the night in a temporary shelter in a CEGEP, were in the process of returning to their homes. While many would be returning to broken windows and rooms still without electricity, the buildings were at least structurally sound, Pedneaud-Jobin said.
For those whose homes were damaged, it could take much longer, he said.
The area most affected by the storm is a poorer one, Pedneaud-Jobin added.
The next step, according to Legault, is to compensate victims.
"We're talking about many poor people and they may have lost all the assets that they've built in their life, so it's important that they know as fast as possible how much will they get back from the government," he said.
For Massé, it has to go further than money - community support is needed for the victims, she said, many of whom are new arrivals and may have lost everything all over again.
"For me, it's very important to be here all together, to show solidarity, but also at the same time to acknowledge we have problems with climate change and we have to do something," she said.
Legault also talked about showing support for the community.
"It's not the time for politics," Legault said earlier in the day. "It's important that we're all united today behind the premier."
The CAQ leader said he also sees a connection between extreme weather and climate change.
"There have always been tornadoes, but it's obvious that now, because of climate change, there are more extreme events," Legault said.
However, one CAQ candidate, Éric Girard told HuffPost Québec( https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/09/17/changements-climatiques-eric-girard-caq_a_23530188/?ncid=other_trending_qeesnbnu0l8&utm_campaign=trending ) he isn't sure about the link between extreme weather events, including heat waves, and human-caused climate change. According to the article, which was published on Monday, Girard describes himself as a "climate skeptic."
"He said we cannot attribute one specific happening to this but, clearly, we see the numbers, it's clear that the climate change increased the kind of situation we see here today," Legault said.
For Legault, the largest contribution Quebec can play to fighting climate change is exporting hydro power - which will allow for the shutdown of coal and oil plants in other party of North America.
"There's no wall," he said. "We're all on the same planet."
But while Legault has called for more electricity exports from Quebec, he has opposed the Apuiat wind farm on Quebec's North Shore.
He said Quebec needs to sign more export agreements - and build transmission infrastructure - before it builds additional power-generation facilities, adding a dam can store energy in a way a wind farm can't.
Legault's climate plan has faced criticism from other parties.
"We have a credible plan to fight global warming. And the parties that don't are on the wrong side of history," Lisée said.
Before heading to Gatineau, Legault met with the mayor of Laval and other mayors from Montreal's North Shore,
In Laval, Legault was scheduled to talk with local mayors about transportation - he wants to expand the Réseau express métropolitain train network in Laval and extend Highway 19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-liberals-expected-to-announce-highway-19-extension ). Legault has called for the expansion of other highways and the building of a third connection - a bridge or tunnel - between Quebec City and Lévis.
Massé said politicians can't talk about fighting climate change and expanding highways at the same time.
"It's clear that it's incompatible, except for questions of safety and I don't think that's the main reason Mr. Legault wants to extend highways," Massé said.
She said her party's climate plan isn't about winning the provincial election, it's about saving the planet.

Quebec election: Gatineau disaster highlights need for climate plan, Couillard says

Full text: After suspending his election campaign for most of the day, Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard said the situation in storm-ravaged Gatineau highlights the importance of a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
Couillard left his campaign bus and its accompanying reporters in Montreal and travelled to Gatineau on Saturday morning to survey the damage from a tornado that touched down in the region( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/tens-of-thousands-without-power-following-tornado-in-ottawa-region/wcm/8e9f41c6-00c7-4518-841f-b78c40a2a865 ) on Friday night. He was joined by Parti Québécois leader Jean-François Lisée( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-lisee-reroutes-campaign-bus-to-visit-tornado-aftermath ). Coalition Avenir Québec Leader François Legault also visited the region Saturday.
Returning to Montreal to meet reporters, Couillard defended his party's plan, saying it is the right approach, despite the fact the PQ and Québec solidaire are proposing more ambitious plans to fight climate change that each include a plan to fully electrify the transportation sector.
"We have certainly the most ambitious plan in Canada, especially now that Ontario has left us (with Premier Doug Ford pulling that province out of the carbon exchange market)," Couillard said. He said his government enacted policies to encourage more electric vehicles and to electrify public transportation, and he touted the $6.3-billion REM( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-6-3-billion-rem-we-will-start-work-almost-immediately ) - an electric light-rail project being built in the Montreal region as a concrete example.
"If we want to go forward in the environmental file, it must be together with the public, so to tell Quebecers at that date you won't be allowed to own gasoline-powered vehicles is not the right way to do it, according to me. Ramming this through the public is not going to do anything for the environment. There has to be a public buy in."
Couillard's campaign made no new announcements on Saturday, but the Liberal leader was forced to defend the integrity of one of his caucus members after a Journal de Montréal report( https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2018/09/22/lex-ministre-pierre-paradis-fait-lobjet-dune-enquete-de-lupac-1 ) revealed the province's anti-corruption squad is investigating former Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Paradis.
Paradis was accused by the province's ethics commissioner of using a $25,000 housing allowance to pay for an apartment in Quebec City for his daughter, her spouse and their child.
Paradis has responded saying he did nothing wrong and vowed to fight the accusations.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/mna-pierre-paradis-says-hell-open-his-books-to-defend-himself-against-ethics-sanction )
Couillard welcomed Paradis back into the Liberal caucus over the summer after he was suspended while the ethics commissioner investigated the matter. Couillard defended Paradis again on Saturday.
"As far as I know, Mr. Paradis has not been charged with anything," he said, adding his party sought a legal opinion( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/pierre-paradis-wont-be-sanctioned-despite-ethics-commissioner-report ) that said Paradis did not violate any rules.
Paradis is not running for re-election in his Brome-Missisquoi riding in the Oct. 1 vote, so Couillard said there is no need for him to kick him out of the caucus.
Couillard had one campaign event he didn't cancel Saturday. He had a discussion with students and youth representatives at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.
He spoke about his party's plans to make daycare free for 4-year olds, his climate-change ambitions, and his plan to build a more inclusive Quebec by welcoming new arrivals and ensuring they are well integrated into the job market
During the event, Daye Diallo, the president of Force Jeunesse( http://www.forcejeunesse.qc.ca/ ) - which advocates to improve conditions for young people in the workforce - asked Couillard how a re-elected Liberal government would enact policies to ensure future generations are not adversely affected.
Couillard said his party would continue to make contributions to the Generations Fund to help reduce the province's debt so future generations are not penalized by crippling debt-servicing payments.
Afterward, Diallo said he was impressed with Couillard's answers about youth issues, saying he believed he has a clear vision. As a native of Guinea, he said the issue of integrating immigrants is also one of importance for him.
"I was born in Guinea, and I can tell you I am not a failed story of immigration," he said.

Quebec election update: $1 million donated and leaders united in Gatineau

Full text: GATINEAU - Hours after a tornado ripped through Gatineau, two rivals put political differences aside to visit the disaster zone Saturday morning.
Jean-François Lisée and Philippe Couillard walked shoulder to shoulder through a neighbourhood covered in debris.
Roofing, broken glass and bricks lay scattered across the street, the storm ripped balconies from apartment buildings and forced hundreds from their homes.
"Today our presence here is about showing our solidarity," said Lisée, the leader of the Parti Québécois. "People saw their roofs blown away, they saw their walls crumble, they feared for their lives.
"We can campaign tomorrow but today we're here for them, we're here to say all of Quebec is here with you."
Couillard, the incumbent Liberal premier, announced a $1 million donation from the government to the Red Cross( http://www.redcross.ca/ ) to make sure people displaced by the tornado have somewhere to stay over the weekend.
There were about 1,600 people forced from their homes overnight, according to Gatineau Mayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin. As of Saturday morning, over 600 people were still in emergency shelters or staying with family.
Couillard said it was a miracle that, given the scale of storm, no one sustained life-threatening injuries or died.
"It is affecting to see that, many of the people forced from their homes, they're not exactly at the top of the economic ladder," he said. "It's like they've been hit twice: They're less fortunate than others and now they've been hit by this storm."
Stéphane Tremblay was cleaning out his mother's apartment Friday when the wind gusts started to roll through. He says he looked out the window and saw roof shingles begin to fly before deciding to take cover behind a wall.
"A stick flew right through the window and everything shattered," said Tremblay. "There was glass everywhere."
Tremblay's mother recently passed away but his aunt, who lives in the same building, is staying with a relative until she's allowed back into her home.
After massive flooding in May 2017 and torrential rain last spring and fall, this is the fourth major weather event to hit Gatineau in the past 16 months.
Lisée and Couillard said this highlights the need for political parties to fight climate change.
Meanwhile, Coalition Avenir Québec's François Legault cancelled his scheduled activities Saturday to meet those affected by the storm( http://www.redcross.ca/ ). A representative for Québec solidaire said co-spokesperson Manon Massé would also be heading to the Ottawa-Gatineau area.
Hydro-Québec technicians and first responders are still on the scene, working to clear the wreckage and restore power to the tens of thousands still in the dark.
Asked if the presence of politicians and dozens of journalists might actually harm these efforts, Mayor Pedneaud-Jobin said he was heartened by their presence.
"You can't underestimate what it means - in the middle of an electoral campaign - to see the leaders on the ground," said Pedneaud-Jobin. "It sends a great message of solidarity.
"There's also a direct communication with (the premier and MNAs) that helps. There's a difference between directing a crisis from an office and being here on the ground."
As the leaders left the disaster zone, one resident shouted epithets at them, telling them to "get the f-k out of here!" Some voiced frustration at the unfolding crisis given that many are still recovering from last year's flood.
Lisée acknowledged there's work to be done in the government's long-term response but insisted that the immediate response to the tornado has been "excellent."
"It's been lightning-quick," he said. "There's a solidarity among Quebecers - of all political stripes - that's incredible to see in times like these."
After visiting a local high school and emergency command centre, Lisée hopped back on his bus and headed to Montreal to resume his campaign.

Indie rock
Wolf Parade (Thursday, Sept. 27 to Sunday, Sept. 30, 9 p.m., La Sala Rossa, 4848 St-Laurent Blvd., $30). One of the bands that put Montreal on the map as an indie music mecca, Wolf Parade plays not one, two or three, but four shows at this year's festival, with rotating guests in the opening slot. At publication time, tickets remained only for the Sunday show.
Soundclash
Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois (Thursday, Sept. 27, 7:45 p.m., Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave., $30).

Thousands of runners to converge on downtown Montreal this weekend

Author: Gyulai, Linda

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/thousands-runners-converge-on-downtown-montreal/docview/2110225882/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: For the first time since the city began hosting a marathon, downtown will serve as the start and finish line for 25,000 runners who are expected at the 28th edition of the Oasis International Marathon de Montréal this weekend.
The new venue for the two-day event, which features a half-marathon and 10-kilometre, five-kilometre and one-kilometre races along with the 42.2 kilometre distance, is part of what its new organizer calls a fresh direction aimed at bringing the races closer to spectators.
"We wanted to be more central to our public and to offer them another experience of Montreal," race director Dominique Piché said.
Piché, a former Montreal police officer, also serves as race director for the Ironman triathlons in Mont-Tremblant.
In June 2017, Ironman bought the Rock 'n' Roll marathon series of races in North America and Europe, which includes the Oasis International Marathon de Montréal, and appointed Piché to produce the Montreal races.
In recent years, the marathon and half-marathon races started on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge, wended their way down to Parc Jean-Drapeau, then travelled up Place Jacques-Cartier into Old Montreal and ended in Parc La Fontaine in Plateau Mont-Royal, following a fear-inducing climb up Berri St. under Sherbrooke St. W. near the finish.
This year, the marathon and half-marathon will start at René-Lévesque Blvd. and St-Urbain St.( https://www.runrocknroll.com/fr/evenements/montreal/courses/parcours ) on Sunday, Sept. 23, at 7:30 a.m. Both routes head west along St-Patrick St. to Monk Blvd. before returning downtown through Griffintown. Both races finish at Quartier des spectacles on Ste-Catherine St. W. at St-Urbain.
And both groups of runners will get to sweat their way up Robert-Bourassa Blvd., though the marathon route also travels up Berri St. to venture east to Parc Maisonneuve before returning downtown.
While changing the course routes and moving the event site downtown were big undertakings, Piché said he also worked to raise prize money to bring elite runners back to the marathon after an eight-year absence.
"For me, Montreal is an Olympic town and when we have such a marathon as we do, elites are part of our DNA," he said. Piché, who was born in Hull, said he has an attachment to the Montreal race since it was his first marathon in 1996.
But there's one notable absence this year - there's no free public transit being offered to race participants. The race fee used to include return transit fare, which runners could pick up with their race bibs ahead of race day.
The race organizer paid for the transit tickets.
However, Philippe Déry, a spokesperson for the Société de transport de Montréal, said the transit agency isn't a partner of the event this year and said it was the race organizer's decision to not offer free transit.
The STM will add staff for the event, he said, but the agency is suggesting that runners buy their transit tickets in advance rather than on race day to avoid long lineups. Déry also said the STM warned the race organizer.
Piché offered a mea culpa and said he "profoundly hopes" to bring back free transit passes next year.
It was a combination of factors, Piché said, including last year's decision to cancel the marathon due to a heat wave, which entailed reimbursing 5,000 participants while trying to plan the changes for this year.
"I called it the perfect storm," he said. There was also time pressure to select entertainment befitting the Quartier des spectacles and to find an alternative to distributing plastic water bottles to runners.
"I'm still very behind the (free public transit) because I believe that we all have a responsibility to make sure that public transit is utilized more," Piché said. "I'm working hard to give Montreal a marathon they're proud of."

Appreciation: Bill Shaw fought for anglophones' rights

Full text: On Sept. 22 in Pointe-Claire, there will be a memorial service for a former member of the Quebec National Assembly, William (Bill) F. Shaw, who died May 26. Shaw's own election as MNA coincided with the electoral victory of the Parti Québécois in 1976. Those of us old enough to remember that momentous event will recall the very disquieting era it would usher in for anglophones.
I can appreciate that the PQ's victory was greeted with joy and pride of heritage for francophones citizens, or I can empathize with one of PQ minister Camille Laurin's stated goals of curing the Québécois's sense of "incompleteness" and "flawed identity" through his 1977 language law, Bill 101.
However, it was tragic that this restoration of pride, which should have been celebrated by all Quebecers, came to be such a perfect storm for the anglophones even if it had not been intended to be. Many had to endure family separations due to the emigration of friends and family. Those who stayed sometimes encountered professional discrimination.
Responding to the PQ language law became an unfolding ideological challenge. Elected in the West Island riding of Jacques-Cartier for the Union Nationale, Shaw would later leave that party to co-found the Freedom of Choice Party. Central to its raison d'être was the proposition that the language of business should be left to free markets and not complex government regulation. And children's educational choices should not be determined by who their parents were. Of course, most famous was his advocacy of Quebec's political partition as a choice for federalists in the event of a Yes vote for Quebec independence.
While one can agree or disagree with these arguments, in the context of Western democratic thought, was this truly an extreme position? His goal was never to encourage anglophone unilingualism. He favoured personal bilingualism and spoke better-than-average French for an anglophone of the day. And in his later life, he lived at home in both languages and was married to a francophone.
Nevertheless, concerns that his libertarian outlook on language was a non-starter with Quebec nationalists led many self-proclaimed anglophone "moderates" to quickly sacrifice this view of freedom on an altar of pragmatism, and concede that some restrictions on liberties, to accord francophones a sense of cultural security, may be justifiable.

Dr. Bill Shaw, Quebec's unapologetic partitionist, dies at 85( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/dr-bill-shaw-quebecs-unapologetic-partitionist-dies-at-85 )
But whether sincere belief or Faustian bargain for later concessions, this strategy could not be entirely relied upon (for example, see the government-ignored 1992 Chambers Report, which requested that immigrant children from English-speaking countries be allowed to attend English schools).
It was as if a sort of fashionable groupthink had descended on our community that was almost as threatening to our sense of self as the legislative restrictions being imposed on us. Our link to our shared heritage with the rest of the English-speaking world, which at its most exemplary covets debate, diversity of views and political competition, seemed to loosen by the need to unite locally. And it is against this backdrop that Shaw's lasting legacy should be appreciated.
By running for office, he did more than speak out for the principle of freedom of choice in language-related public policy, he offered anglophones a democratic option by putting his name on a ballot. As a successful dentist, he didn't need to do it for money, and his efforts as an activist took his time away from his family, but he did it, nonetheless.
If his broader opposition to Bill 101 made him unreasonable, then perhaps we should view political change in light of acclaimed Irish polemicist George Bernard Shaw's aphorism: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
The memorial for Bill Shaw takes place Saturday at 1 p.m. at Cedar Park United Church, 204 Lakeview Ave., Pointe-Claire.

Lise Ravary: What resurgence of hate groups in Quebec?

Full text: In a recent article( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-couple-attacked-after-defying-far-right-group-to-file-report ), Ottawa-based human rights lawyer Richard Warman was quoted as saying that the ultra right-wing group Atalante Québec was part of a resurgence of right-wing hate groups in Québec.
Pardon moi? A resurgence? As I recall, the last time there were right-wing hate groups in Quebec, and in Canada, worth worrying about was in the 1930s.
Atalante Québec is a nasty piece of work. Its slogan "to exist is to fight against what denies my existence" carries images of street violence. However, a few thousand people give its Facebook page a like. Not quite a mass movement.
Better known and more moderate, despite a core of members with more extreme views, La Meute made the news last week when its leader, Sylvain Brouillette, said the group's manifesto was inspired by the CAQ's program.
François Legault was not pleased. "I don't like La Meute's discourse. It's borderline racism. I would prefer that La Meute does not like me."
Replied Brouillette: "If we're borderline racist, so are you Mr. Legault."
Oh dear. The kids are fighting.
Québec City-based La Meute has approximately 45,000 members on its Facebook page and yet, when they called for a big march in Montreal on July 1 against illegal immigration, the event drew 300 protesters, including Storm Alliance sympathizers.
Storm Alliance Canada, whose goal is "to protect Canadian culture and the rights of the People," has 2,553 members on its Facebook page. Please note the word "Canadian." Not Québécois. Many of these movements claim to be federalist.
Last but not least, Soldiers of Odin Québec, a vigilante group cum community organization (they feed homeless whites only) that just so happens to oppose Muslim immigration, is at war with the Canadian chapter of the organization, in a replay of federal-provincial politics.
This is pretty much the lay of the land as far as organized right-wing hate groups in Quebec at the moment. Quebec, unlike Ontario, the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy and even Sweden, does not have an extreme right-wing political party. And Montreal does not have an alt-right poster girl like Faith Goldy running for mayor.
So, again, I ask, are we living through a resurgence? A resurgence of what?

I tried to contact Richard Warman directly, but he is not easy to reach. Instead, I turned to my library for help. History is my favourite subject.
The 1930s were dark times in Quebec as in the rest of Canada, and the world, especially for Jews. Canada even had its own self-proclaimed "Canadian führer," a sad little French-Canadian man called Adrien Arcand who founded several anti-Semitic political parties as well as a Nazi-inspired organization called the Blueshirts, a poor man's copy of British aristocratic fascist Sir Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts.
Like Mosley, Arcand was jailed for most of the war. When he was released, no one cared for his theories anymore.
Arcand, writes Le Devoir's Jean-François Nadeau in his 400-page Adrien Arcand, führer Canadien, was not a Québécois nationalist. He was fascinated by the British Empire. He identified with Anglo-Saxon culture and English was the lingua franca of his anti-Semitic and anti-communist movements.
Arcand looms large in history books and prejudiced minds. As the only Nazi leader Quebec, he gets the spotlight, but he was a minor player. He never had more than 1,500 devotees.
The last time there was a violent radical group of consequence in Quebec was in the 1960s and '70s, but the Front de libération du Québec did not indulge in racial hatred for racial hatred's sake. It was a post-colonial extreme-left-wing terror organization that included anglophone members. One Nigel Hamer, an engineering student at McGill, belonged to the Libération cell responsible for the kidnapping of James Cross.
But even that was still a long time ago. Thankfully, much has changed. Resurgence? What resurgence?

Full text: Here's what happened as the world turned.
Hurricane Florence is zeroing in on the southeastern U.S. coast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/we-hope-to-have-something-left-fierce-hurricane-florence-zeroing-in-on-southeastern-coast/wcm/2614e65f-338d-4992-b983-8e14707929a8 ), with more than 10 million people in its sights. Florence's top sustained wind speeds dropped from a high of 225 km/h to 175 km/h as its outer rain bands approached the North Carolina coast early Thursday, reducing the storm from Category 4 to Category 2, but forecasters warned that the enormous wind field has been growing larger, raising the risk of the ocean surging onto land. "Do you want to get hit with a train or do you want to get hit with a cement truck?" said Jeff Byard, an administrator with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
A delegation of U.S. Catholic cardinals and bishops met Thursday with Pope Francis( https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/pope-summons-bishops-for-february-abuse-prevention-summit ) as a new bombshell dropped in the Catholic Church's long-running sex abuse and coverup scandal. Pope Francis on Thursday accepted the resignation of a West Virginia bishop, Michael Bransfield, and at the same time authorized a fellow bishop to investigate allegations that Bransfield sexually harassed adults, officials said. Bransfield had been implicated in 2012 in an infamous Philadelphia priestly sex abuse case, but he denied ever abusing anyone and claimed vindication years ago. He continued with his ministry until he offered to retire, as required, when he turned 75 last week.
Bill 101 strikes again.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/teen-in-grade-11-at-royal-west-academy-ensnared-by-bill-101 ) Alois Orozco, a Grade 11 student at Royal West Academy, has been told by the school board that he has to be transplanted - to a new school, in a new area, in French. Though he has been in English school since his family arrived in Montreal in 2010, the conditions have changed now that they are permanent residents. "I feel like they're taking the law too literally - especially since it's my last year and I've been studying almost my whole life in English," said Alois, 16. "There should be some exceptions. ... It won't hurt them for me to do a last year in English, but if I have to go to school in French, it'll cause a lot of damage."
The administration of École secondaire des Sources decided to close the school for the day Thursday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-school-will-be-closed-thursday-after-social-media-threats ) after Montreal police obtained reports of threats made toward the students on social media. Police would not provide any details about the threats, other than to say they targeted students at the Dollard-des-Ormeaux school. After other students alerted them of what they had seen on social media, the police took the threats very seriously, said Constable Jean-Pierre Brabant. "We're trying to identify and locate the person responsible," he said.

Full text: In Case You Missed It (#ICYMI) is a daily feature highlighting news in and around Montreal.
Shapes of things to come?
A Montreal bar has enlisted what's being touted as "the world's first interactive professional robot bartender." It - does it have a gender? - is called R1-B1 and doesn't take tips, apparently.
Columnist Bill Brownstein reports from the bar.( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/montreal-robot-bartender-serves-up-drink-song-dance-and-counsel )
***
No apology from controversial Parti Québécois candidate Michelle Blanc.
Blanc says she does not need to apologize for perceived anti-Semitic comments she made in the past.
"I don't have to defend myself," Blanc told the Montreal Gazette, saying the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs has "already defended me."

La Presse is reporting that documents related to legal proceedings ensuing from a massive anti-biker investigation were stolen from the homes of two Crown prosecutors on the same day last week.

A Montreal businessman who admitted this year that he bribed a Canada Revenue Agency employee is looking for a new lawyer before his case enters the sentencing stage, the Gazette's Paul Cherry reports
A sentence hearing for Reza Tehrani, 60, has been put off four times since May 22, when he entered guilty pleas to seven charges filed against him in 2012.

Things are going exceptionally well for the Montreal Canadiens - in the real-estate sector, that is, write the Gazette's Brendan Kelly.
Developers Cadillac Fairview and Canderel, along with their partners the Fonds immobilier de solidarité FTQ and the Canadiens, announced that construction has begun on what they're calling the Quad Windsor Skybridge, an elevated glassed-in pedestrian bridge that will be built above St-Antoine St. linking the Bell Centre and the Deloitte Tower.

And, finally, you've probably heard that a major storm is moving in on the U.S.
With Hurricane Florence on the verge of making landfall, forecasters say it's too soon to say if Canada will feel any of the effects of the storm expected to cause widespread damage in the southern U.S., reports the Gazette's Jason Magder.
Will it flirt with Canada?
We asked Bob Robichaud, a meteorologist at the Canadian Hurricane Centre.

Full text: With Hurricane Florence on the verge of making landfall, forecasters say it's too soon to say if Canada will feel any of the effects of the storm expected to cause widespread damage in the southern U.S.
"We're looking at a very intense storm, and it's getting bigger as it approaches the Carolinas," said Bob Robichaud, a meteorologist at the Canadian Hurricane Centre.
He said the Hurricane is expected to hit the coast of Georgia or South Carolina late Friday or early Saturday.
"These things tend to weaken fairly rapidly after they make landfall, so we're expecting it's going to weaken into the day on Saturday, and then morph into a tropical storm or a tropical depression."
Robichaud said weather modelling can predict the storm only into Monday, when the centre of the storm is expected to be in the centre of North Carolina.
It's possible the storm can take a turn and head back out to sea after Monday, but Robichaud said it's too soon to determine the storm's track.
"But what we're keeping an eye on is whether any remaining moisture from the storm would be pulled up into Canada," he said.
"We don't expect the centre of the storm to approach Canada at all. We'll have a better idea of that once it makes landfall."
If that happens, people in Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes can expect lots of rain, but winds will likely remain calm, he said.

While you were sleeping: Jeopardy's beard poll and California's pot

Full text: Here's a look at a couple of stories that bubbled up overnight while you were trying to conjure a dream of a new future for the Habs.
Wait. How does anyone under 30 know about Jeopardy? Alex Trebek sported a beard( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/entertainment-pmn/alex-trebek-launches-new-season-of-jeopardy-with-beard/wcm/33fcedda-3e67-4035-814c-659bc155d068 ) as he launched the 35th season of Jeopardy! and the look has led to a poll. The bearded host appeared in a video on Instagram( https://www.instagram.com/p/BnjZ3j0FEF-/?hl=en ) under the caption, "It's time to embark upon a magical journey." He opened the first show of the season by saying, "No need to inquire how I spent my summer vacation." The game show has started a beard or no beard poll on Twitter. There have been more votes for the beard than against it. One person wrote that the beard reminded her of the actor Sean Connery while another compared Trebek to Santa Claus.
To beard, or not to beard: that is the question. Vote now! #AlexTrebeard( https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlexTrebeard?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
- Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) September 10, 2018( https://twitter.com/Jeopardy/status/1039196814828699649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Is Cali pot more dangerous or more dangerously tested?( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/business-pmn/many-california-marijuana-products-failing-safety-tests/wcm/4c0aa512-4bb4-4202-9657-804cf97bb5d9 ) Nearly 20 per cent of marijuana products in California have failed tests for potency and purity since the state started requiring the checks on July 1, a failure rate some in the industry say has more to do with unrealistic standards and technical glitches than protecting consumer safety. The testing has been especially tough on cannabis-infused cookies, candies and tinctures: about one-third have been blocked from store shelves. In much smaller numbers, testing companies licensed by the state are finding unacceptable levels of pesticides, solvents and bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella, according to data provided to The Associated Press by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. Recreational pot becomes available in Canada on Oct. 17.
On a more sombre note, Eastern U.S. braces for Florence( https://nationalpost.com/pmn/travel-pmn/the-latest-hurricane-florence-slightly-increases-in-speed ): As of 5:20 a.m. Hurricane Florence had slightly increased in speed as it heads toward the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center said it is moving toward the west-northwest at nearly 24 km/h and the storm will continue a slight increase in speed during the next couple of days. Last night, the forecast was that Florence could inflict the hardest hurricane punch the Carolinas have seen in more than 60 years, with rain and wind of more than 130 mp/h (209 km/h). North Carolina has been hit by only one other Category 4 storm since reliable record keeping began in the 1850s. That was Hurricane Hazel in 1954.

Quebec election blog Sept. 10: Online outbursts, new ads and relaxed campaign moments

Full text: This was the Montreal Gazette's live blog on the Quebec provincial election for Monday, Sept. 10.
4:35 p.m.: New poll Tuesday
We have in our hot little hands the results of a new Montreal Gazette-Le Devoir- Léger poll, conducted Sept. 7-10.
Philip Authier will have a full story at montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) at midnight - and in the paper on Tuesday morning.
In the meantime, here's apreview by Phil( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-many-quebecers-still-undecided-poll-says ) and one by Stéphane Baillargeon on Le Devoir's site( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/536435/44-des-electeurs-pourraient-changer-d-avis-avec-les-debats-des-chefs ).
3:25 p.m.: PQ sticks with controversial candidate
Jean-François Lisée is still standing by Michelle Blanc( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-anti-semitism-question-continues-to-dog-pqs-lisee ), the Parti Québécois candidate in Mercier riding whose social media past continues to make headlines.
Lisée says she just has a twisted sense of humour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays ) and he had noted that she has apologized( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) for some of her outbursts.
The Parti Québécois leader has previously dumped two candidates( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ) after their hateful comments about Muslims( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-some-candidates-with-baggage-kept-safely-on-board ) were exposed.
So far, posts have surfaced in which Blanc has:
Accused a critic of being a pedophile( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ).
Suggested she would use the N-word( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) to describe an African.
Said she was sorry she had forgotten to "celebrate Hitler's birthday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays )."
Said she would be happy if Hasidic Jews "disappeared from my view( https://www.michelleblanc.com/2007/01/15/suis-je-raciste/ )" after a member of the community cut in front of her in line at a flower shop.
Asked voters to "vote white( https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/08/13/michelle-blanc-efface-un-tweet-apres-de-nombreuses-critiques-1 )," before deleting the tweet, which was an apparent play on her name (blanc=white).
If history is a guide, you should stay tuned for more.
In 2014, Blanc was a staunch defender of the PQ's proposed Charter of Values, which would have banned religious symbols in the public sector.
Lisée is sticking with Blanc even though her Internet tantrums have consumed a good part of his campaign over the past two weeks.
And even though election-projection sites suggest the PQ does expect Blanc to actually win in Mercier riding.
Qc125.com is forcasting a win, by a wide margin, by Québec solidaire's Ruba Ghazal, a business-administration expert who moved to Canada from Lebanan at age 10.
Mercier was the riding of Amir Khadir, the former QS co-spokesperson who is not seeking re-election. Khadir won the riding by more than 6,600 votes in 2014( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/francais/provincial/resultats-electoraux/elections-generales.php?e=74&c=1010&s=1#s ).
1:20 p.m.: Independence, GND, a vox pop, milking NAFTA
All four parties have posted new videos on social media in recent days.
Though it's promising not to hold a referendum, the Parti Québécois is touting independence in some ads.
Surprise - a Coalition Avenir Québec vox pop found voters ready to dump the Liberals and trash the PQ.
Québec solidaire is banking on the popularity of former student leader Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois
The Liberals, meanwhile, are hoping voters will be mooved by its promise to preserve milk quotas for Quebec farmers in NAFTA talks.
12:45 p.m.: Jobless immigrants
Last week, I put into context( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-putting-french-immigration-stats-in-context ) some of the numbers CAQ Leader François Legault uses when discussing immigrants and the French language.
Here's a look at another number.
On Friday, Legault suggested 15 per cent of new immigrants to Quebec are unemployed( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-legault-softens-opposition-to-new-montreal-metro-line ) during their first five years in Quebec. He used the figure when discussing his plan to cut immigrations by 20 per cent (10,000 fewer per year).
But just as newcomers tend to learn French the longer they stay in Quebec, so do they tend to find jobs.
Here are the Statistics Canada unemployment rates( https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410008301&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.7&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.8&pickMembers%5B2%5D=4.1 ) for 2017 by category:
6.1 per cent: total population.
15.8 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for less than five years.
7.6 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for between five and 10 years.
7.1 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for more than 10 years.
11:45 a.m.: Leaders weigh in
On Monday, CAQ Leader François Legault praised the Canadiens' early morning trade( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) of Max Pacioretty to the Vegas Golden Knights.
"Like with Quebec, we need change!" he tweeted before making a bad pun using the name of one of the new Montreal players (Slovakian Tomas Tatar).
Is Legault comparing himself to Marc Bergevin cleaning house at the Bell Centre, or to one of the Canadiens' new players( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) swooping into the city?
And if the trade is a sign that the Habs will spend years rebuilding, does that mean we won't have much to celebrate during the first few years of a CAQ government?
Legault was apparently a big fan of Pacioretty locker-room rival PK Subban.
During the last election campaign, in 2014, Legault wore a Subban jersey( https://journalmetrocom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/franccca7ois-legault-chute-hockey.jpg ) in a friendly game with supporters in Terrebonne. And a year before that, Legault tweeted that( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/391001148368232450 ) Subban was "the best Canadiens player since Patrick Roy."
Bon échange du #CH( https://twitter.com/hashtag/CH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ).
Comme pour le Québec, ça prend du changement!
Mieux vaut Tatar que jamais... https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5( https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5 )
- François Legault (@francoislegault) September 10, 2018( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/1039114996343549952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Couillard, who apparently is Max Pacioretty in Legault's analogy, was more muted in his response.
He suggested the Canadiens can now look to the future thanks to its two young new players.
Philippe Couillard parle de l'échange de Max Pacioretty. "Faut regarder l'avenir", dit-il, en disant qu'il y a désormais deux jeunes joueurs. #Quebec2018( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Quebec2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Pacioretty( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pacioretty?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
- Romain Schué (@RomainSchue) September 10, 2018( https://twitter.com/RomainSchue/status/1039117386178330624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Full text: This is the Montreal Gazette's live blog on the Quebec provincial election for Monday, Sept. 10. It will be updated throughout the day. Email me at ariga@montrealgazette.com( mailto:ariga@montrealgazette.com )
4:35 p.m.: New poll Tuesday
We have in our hot little hands the results of a new Montreal Gazette-Le Devoir- Léger poll, conducted Sept. 7-10.
Philip Authier will have a full story at montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) at midnight - and in the paper on Tuesday morning.
In the meantime, here's apreview by Phil( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-many-quebecers-still-undecided-poll-says ) and one by Stéphane Baillargeon on Le Devoir's site( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/536435/44-des-electeurs-pourraient-changer-d-avis-avec-les-debats-des-chefs ).
3:25 p.m.: PQ sticks with controversial candidate
Jean-François Lisée is still standing by Michelle Blanc( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-anti-semitism-question-continues-to-dog-pqs-lisee ), the Parti Québécois candidate in Mercier riding whose social media past continues to make headlines.
Lisée says she just has a twisted sense of humour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays ) and he had noted that she has apologized( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) for some of her outbursts.
The Parti Québécois leader has previously dumped two candidates( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ) after their hateful comments about Muslims( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-some-candidates-with-baggage-kept-safely-on-board ) were exposed.
So far, posts have surfaced in which Blanc has:
Accused a critic of being a pedophile( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ).
Suggested she would use the N-word( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) to describe an African.
Said she was sorry she had forgotten to "celebrate Hitler's birthday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays )."
Said she would be happy if Hasidic Jews "disappeared from my view( https://www.michelleblanc.com/2007/01/15/suis-je-raciste/ )" after a member of the community cut in front of her in line at a flower shop.
Asked voters to "vote white( https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/08/13/michelle-blanc-efface-un-tweet-apres-de-nombreuses-critiques-1 )," before deleting the tweet, which was an apparent play on her name (blanc=white).
If history is a guide, you should stay tuned for more.
In 2014, Blanc was a staunch defender of the PQ's proposed Charter of Values, which would have banned religious symbols in the public sector.
Lisée is sticking with Blanc even though her Internet tantrums have consumed a good part of his campaign over the past two weeks.
And even though election-projection sites suggest the PQ does expect Blanc to actually win in Mercier riding.
Qc125.com is forcasting a win, by a wide margin, by Québec solidaire's Ruba Ghazal, a business-administration expert who moved to Canada from Lebanan at age 10.
Mercier was the riding of Amir Khadir, the former QS co-spokesperson who is not seeking re-election. Khadir won the riding by more than 6,600 votes in 2014( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/francais/provincial/resultats-electoraux/elections-generales.php?e=74&c=1010&s=1#s ).
1:20 p.m.: Independence, GND, a vox pop, milking NAFTA
All four parties have posted new videos on social media in recent days.
Though it's promising not to hold a referendum, the Parti Québécois is touting independence in some ads.
Surprise - a Coalition Avenir Québec vox pop found voters ready to dump the Liberals and trash the PQ.
Québec solidaire is banking on the popularity of former student leader Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois
The Liberals, meanwhile, are hoping voters will be mooved by its promise to preserve milk quotas for Quebec farmers in NAFTA talks.
12:45 p.m.: Jobless immigrants
Last week, I put into context( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-putting-french-immigration-stats-in-context ) some of the numbers CAQ Leader François Legault uses when discussing immigrants and the French language.
Here's a look at another number.
On Friday, Legault suggested 15 per cent of new immigrants to Quebec are unemployed( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-legault-softens-opposition-to-new-montreal-metro-line ) during their first five years in Quebec. He used the figure when discussing his plan to cut immigrations by 20 per cent (10,000 fewer per year).
But just as newcomers tend to learn French the longer they stay in Quebec, so do they tend to find jobs.
Here are the Statistics Canada unemployment rates( https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410008301&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.7&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.8&pickMembers%5B2%5D=4.1 ) for 2017 by category:
6.1 per cent: total population.
15.8 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for less than five years.
7.6 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for between five and 10 years.
7.1 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for more than 10 years.
11:45 a.m.: Leaders weigh in
On Monday, CAQ Leader François Legault praised the Canadiens' early morning trade( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) of Max Pacioretty to the Vegas Golden Knights.
"Like with Quebec, we need change!" he tweeted before making a bad pun using the name of one of the new Montreal players (Slovakian Tomas Tatar).
Is Legault comparing himself to Marc Bergevin cleaning house at the Bell Centre, or to one of the Canadiens' new players( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) swooping into the city?
And if the trade is a sign that the Habs will spend years rebuilding, does that mean we won't have much to celebrate during the first few years of a CAQ government?
Legault was apparently a big fan of Pacioretty locker-room rival PK Subban.
During the last election campaign, in 2014, Legault wore a Subban jersey( https://journalmetrocom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/franccca7ois-legault-chute-hockey.jpg ) in a friendly game with supporters in Terrebonne. And a year before that, Legault tweeted that( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/391001148368232450 ) Subban was "the best Canadiens player since Patrick Roy."
Bon échange du #CH( https://twitter.com/hashtag/CH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ).
Comme pour le Québec, ça prend du changement!
Mieux vaut Tatar que jamais... https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5( https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5 )

Couillard, who apparently is Max Pacioretty in Legault's analogy, was more muted in his response.
He suggested the Canadiens can now look to the future thanks to its two young new players.
Philippe Couillard parle de l'échange de Max Pacioretty. "Faut regarder l'avenir", dit-il, en disant qu'il y a désormais deux jeunes joueurs. #Quebec2018( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Quebec2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Pacioretty( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pacioretty?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Le Devoir's Florent Daudens found that spikes in interest in Pacioretty have surpassed interest in both Legault and Couillard in recent weeks.

11:45 a.m.: Leaders weigh in
On Monday, CAQ leader François Legault praised the Canadiens' early morning trade of Max Pacioretty to the Vegas Golden Knights.
"Like with Quebec, we need change!" he tweeted before making a bad pun using the name of one of the new Montreal players (Slovakian Tomas Tatar).
Is Legault comparing himself to Marc Bergevin cleaning house at the Bell Centre, or to one of the Canadiens' new players swooping into the city?
And if the trade is a sign that the Habs will spend years rebuilding, does that mean we won't have much to celebrate during the first few years of a CAQ government?
Bon échange du #CH( https://twitter.com/hashtag/CH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ).
Comme pour le Québec, ça prend du changement!
Mieux vaut Tatar que jamais... https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5( https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5 )

Couillard, who apparently is Max Pacioretty in Legault's analogy, was more muted in his response.
He suggested the Canadiens can now look to the future thanks to its two young new players.
Philippe Couillard parle de l'échange de Max Pacioretty. "Faut regarder l'avenir", dit-il, en disant qu'il y a désormais deux jeunes joueurs. #Quebec2018( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Quebec2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Pacioretty( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pacioretty?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Le Devoir's Florent Daudens found that spikes in interest in Pacioretty have surpassed interest in both Legault and Couillard in recent weeks.

Special weather statement blankets Montreal as failed hurricane approaches

Full text: Tropical Depression Gordon, which never quite made hurricane status as it slammed into Mississippi and Alabama last week, is expected to rain down on Montreal early this week.
While border crossings are notoriously busy at the end of every weekend, Gordon was expected to make its way into Canada from the central U.S. unfettered on Sunday.
Environment Canada warns residents of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and Châteauguay to expect between 30 and 50 millimetres of rain starting Monday afternoon. Those areas could also experience thunderstorms.
Meanwhile in the south, Tropical Storm Florence( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/cruise-passengers-who-were-supposed-to-go-to-bermuda-arrive-in-atlantic-canada/wcm/d5c66f77-a133-4905-aded-faeb5e2ca6c0 ) is bearing down on the eastern U.S. and could hit the Carolinas on Monday.

When dining out, there may come a moment when the meal evolves from good to not so good, or even dismal. On the flip side, things can also go from good to very good, or even sublime. During some 20 years of restaurant reviewing, that "this isn't just good, it's freakin' great!" moment has happened to me maybe a handful of times, when you just know you're in the midst of people who really, really know how to cook. It's not simply about proper seasoning, beautiful plating, inventive flavour combinations or contrasting textures and temperatures. It's about all of those factors scoring in unison - a perfect storm of gastronomic excellence. Lucky for me, it happened just last week, in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, at a restaurant called Hélicoptère. Quel winner!
Hélicoptère is run by chef David Ollu, pastry chef Mélodie Perez-Mousseau (presently on maternity leave) and sommelier Youri Bussières Fournel, a threesome who last worked at one of the city's top restaurants, Bouillon Bilk. Under chef François Nadon, the style of cuisine at Bouillon Bilk is chic and precise, with exquisite plate presentations, an emphasis on seasonality and the use of local ingredients. Hélicoptère shares two of those three attributes - the plate presentations, though lovely, are more relaxed.
Pastry chef Natacha Lehmann and co-owners Youri Bussieres Fournel, centre, and David Ollu with Helicoptere's kitchen and wait staff: the east-end restaurant elevates the small-plates format.
The decor is casual as well, with its emerald-green walls, exposed brick, potted plants and hardwood floors. There's a small bar on the west side of the room and an intricate lighting fixture above it all that frames the space quite brilliantly. The buzz of discovery is in the air, and the sound levels, though elevated, are in no way overwhelming. As for the service, our waitress was sharp, fluently bilingual and as friendly as can be.
The menu takes the oh so popular small-plates format, and the wine list is filled with well-priced private imports, dominated by organic, biodynamic and natural wines. There are fun cocktails on offer, as well as a selection of craft beers. Thing is, this format is favoured by so many restaurants now that I feared Hélicoptère would be just more of the same. While the trend toward small plates is obviously appealing to chefs, trendy cooking goes against creativity. (Not that I want chefs to serve food in, say, flower pots, but it's always nice to see cooks do things differently.) But what makes Hélicoptère stand out is what's on those plates - and at prices that are significantly lower than what you'd find farther west.
Chicken liver mousse is served atop financier cakes at Helicoptere.
We ordered a bunch of dishes to start. The first to hit the table, a chicken liver mousse served atop financier cakes, was one of the best. Financiers are little almond cakes flavoured with brown butter, and these babies were topped with a luscious mousse de foie de volaille and scattered with blueberries and chopped pistachios. You'd think the base would be too sweet for the topping, but chicken liver has a nice sweetness to it that worked well with the moist cake.
Then came a dish of calamari, served with cucumber ribbons, pickles and a sort of thinned-out salsa verde. But the kitchen didn't stop there, as the added mint, chili and fried shallots provided a Southeast Asian flavour boost. Nice.
I can't think of a dish I enjoyed recently that tasted more of summer than Hélicoptère's heirloom tomato salad with baby basil, kombucha and a feta cream. Sprinkled with sumac, every bite of tomato tasted of perfectly ripe fruit, yet the texture remained firm. And the spice added such an original touch.
Helicoptere's beef tartare packs a punch.
Speaking of original, the beef tartare was just that, made with slices of green and yellow beans, a good hit of lemon and just enough chili to make your lips tingle. When the serving was finished, I scooped up three little cubes of remaining meat that, though small, still packed a flavour punch.
The next wave of dishes was just as strong. Vegetables are given big play on Hélicoptère's menu, and a dish of pattypan squash served over herbed yogurt, sprinkled with Berbère spices and garnished with tiny marigolds was another hit. Granted, it wasn't the most compelling dish, but it was lapped up in seconds, as was the plate featuring quail with leek, onions and harissa. Just imagine succulent morsels of quail meat served alongside rings of poached leek over a smear of velvety hummus swirled with harissa. This combination was so irresistible that my dining companion requested another small portion of the hummus and harissa, which we scooped up on nuggets of their dense homemade pain au levain. Yes!
Helicoptere's quail is served alongside poached leek over a smear of hummus swirled with harissa.
The last round of savoury dishes carried on the deliciousness, starting with a seared arctic char filet served with beets, dill and a handful of chopped pistachios (the nut of choice these days). What a perfect mix of flavours and textures. The same could be said for the cavatelli. Topped with toasted bread crumbs and seared maitake mushrooms, this glorious mix of al-dente pasta, fresh corn, clams and lemon should not be missed. By now we had enjoyed more than a half-dozen dishes, but I couldn't stop myself from polishing off this bowl of loveliness.
Cavatelli with maitake mushrooms, corn, clams and lemon is a must at Helicoptere.
One of the only dishes that didn't wow was the tortellini with a bacon stuffing, served in a bacon stock with shiitake, scallions and sesame. As much as I liked the tortellini, I felt the bacon flavour was too faint, making this sort of gussied-up "pasta in brodo" surprisingly subdued.
After such a superb meal, I was also a little disappointed by the desserts. Of the four on offer, my favourite was the honeydew melon with meringue, lime, honey and a granité made from shiso leaf, mostly because of the potent melon cubes and that original, very "green"-tasting granité. The other three - strawberry shortcake with white chocolate cream, an ice cream sandwich with rhubarb, caramel and currants, and an almond cake with peach and white chocolate - were good, not great, lacking the vibrancy of the savoury menu.
Helicoptere's desserts include almond cake with peach and white chocolate.
I hate to end on a low note when discussing one of this summer's high points of dining, and I have no doubt that this team, which has been in business just over two months, can only improve. And I'm told they do brunch, where for $35 you receive a full menu. If you'd like something even more casual, try out their café, Hélico, right around the corner.
I sometimes get a little discouraged about the Montreal restaurant scene, in that the same names tend to be bandied around for years, with too few new stars on the horizon. But thanks to sharp cooking in restaurants like Hélicoptère, I feel the next generation is on the rise. And how great to see them doing their thing in the eastern part of the city, a bit far from the usual gourmet action. With food this good, Hélicoptère is a destination restaurant if ever there was one.

Full text: The Montreal area was under a severe thunderstorm watch Monday afternoon as Environment Canada warned of possible damaging wind gusts, hail and "torrential rain."
The watch covered the Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil-Varennes regions. In addition to storm warnings, the Eastern Townships and Richelieu Valley were under heat warnings.
Keep Environment Canada's advice in mind if you're caught in the weather: "When thunder roars, go indoors."

Full text: One of Montreal's most congested intersections due to ongoing construction isn't indicated on the city's Info-Travaux website and hasn't elicited so much as a tweet on the city's social media account that's dedicated to warning of traffic delays and road closures caused by fires, gas leaks and infrastructure work.
And yet the gridlock at Atwater Ave. and René-Lévesque Blvd. W. is real, as this week's return of Montreal police officers to control the traffic lights at the intersection indicates.
Who's responsible for the turgid traffic? No one, apparently, since everyone who was questioned this week, including the city, said they're not responsible, at least not for all of it.
The city says it isn't doing any construction work in the quadrilateral that includes René-Lévesque, Atwater and nearby Tupper and Lambert-Closse Sts.
Yet sections of road in at least five spots have been blocked with orange cones or opened up for construction work for months, reducing the number of lanes on each street.
All of the construction in the sector is the work of private companies, city spokesperson Audrey Gauthier said.
One of the companies she named is Démolition et excavation Démex Inc., which filed for municipal permits to obstruct Tupper and Atwater.
However, Démex, is in fact working for Devimco, the developer tearing down the former Montreal Children's Hospital at Atwater, between Tupper and René-Lévesque, for a multi-tower condo and apartment project.
The Devimco project has caused occasional obstructions on the north side of René-Lévesque and a continuing obstruction on Tupper, which is reduced to one lane, since last year.
This week, however, the developer's demolition company also shut down all three lanes on the east side of Atwater, between René-Lévesque and Tupper, which is forcing northbound traffic to deviate to the west side and reducing northbound and southbound traffic to one lane in each direction. Traffic in both directions is being squeezed through a one-block stretch like icing through the tip of a cake icing bag.
Pierre Langlois, a consultant who handles communications for Devimco, said the closure of Atwater is a security measure because the demolition company is tearing down the last building of the former Montreal Children's Hospital complex at Tupper and Atwater.
However, the shutdown of Atwater coincided with back-to-school and increased traffic this week.
The road closure, which started on Monday, is scheduled to last the entire week, Langlois said on Wednesday. On Thursday, he said the demolition company planned to reopen one lane of northbound Atwater as of Friday, with the rest reopening as planned next week.
The other company Gauthier named is Environnement Routier NRJ Inc., which obtained municipal permits to block off a little more than one lane along the south side of René-Lévesque, east of Atwater, a stretch of the east side of Atwater, below René-Lévesque, and at the southeast corners of Atwater and René-Lévesque and of Lambert-Closse and René-Lévesque.
But surprise: Environnement Routier NRJ is working on contract for a city agency, the Commission des services électriques de Montréal. The agency, which is responsible for burying electrical lines, issued the $1.2-million contract to Environnement Routier NRJ in June.
The commission's contractor is making room underground for additional lines to support the residential development in the area, commission chairman Serge Boileau said. However, he said he was unable to say on Thursday whether the additional lines are for the Devimco project, a second condo project being built by Prével on the south side of René-Lèvesque, just west of Fort St., or for both.
It's unclear who put up orange No Parking signs on both sides of Lambert-Closse, below René-Lévesque, this summer. However, construction workers are parking their personal cars in those spots each day.
Boileau said the electrical commission is also carrying out regular maintenance under the NRJ contract. The work is scheduled to be finished in October, he said, at which point the commission will bill the developer or developers for whatever portion of the work was done for either project.
Langlois said the electrical commission's work isn't for Devimco's project.
Prével didn't respond to the Montreal Gazette.
The police presence to manage traffic on Atwater, meanwhile, is being charged to Devimco's demolition company.
A corner of the former Children's Hospital site lies in Westmount.
Démex had to purchase occupancy permits from both municipalities to close Atwater.
Westmount, but not Montreal, made the police presence a condition for its approval.
"That was part of the deal to get the occupancy permit," Westmount Mayor Christina Smith said.
Devimco, through its contractor, is being charged $90 an hour per police officer, Langlois said.
The transformation of the hospital site is a complicated operation, and the developer has been working with the city and residents to minimize disturbances, he said.
The city's Gauthier said the Ville-Marie borough charged Démex $123,450 for the permits. No permit fees are charged to the electrical commission, she added.
"It is a bit of a perfect storm," Smith said of the different obstructions. "And it's having a huge impact on the residents who live around that neighbourhood because there's a ton of dust and the traffic is a gridlock. Between that and the Turcot, it's very hard to get around that area."
During morning rush hour on Thursday, traffic on northbound Atwater was backed up as far south as Lionel-Groulx Ave., 600 metres and three traffic lights below René-Lévesque. And during evening rush hour on Wednesday, the traffic jam on westbound René-Lévesque began 400 metres and two traffic lights east of Atwater, at Fort St.
Atwater/René-Lévesque has become a critical intersection because it leads to what is for now the only way to get onto westbound Highway 20 for kilometres around due to the Turcot project. Vehicles coming from the north take Atwater south to St-Antoine St. W., which leads to the temporary highway entrance on Rose-de-Lima St.
And despite Montreal's insistence that it isn't doing construction work in the sector, the city is upgrading the Lambert-Closse pumping station 150 metres south of René-Lévesque.
It's the only one of the construction zones in the sector that's indicated on the city's Info-Travaux website - although the website locates the work east of Atwater. But real-life construction workers have closed a lane of Atwater and are digging next to the sidewalk on Atwater. lgyulai@postmedia.com

Full text: As Quebecers picked up the pieces - and branches - shaken loose by the storm front that bulldozed across Montreal Wednesday, Hydro-Québec reported that almost 6,300 customers remained without power as of 12:30 p.m. Thursday.
Most of those affected live in Montreal (3,354 clients) and the South Shore (2,942 clients) and indicated how much work the power utility had done since 6 a.m., when 15,000 clients were without power in those areas.
On Wednesday afternoon and at the height of the storm activity, a total of 175,000 clients saw their power interrupted as a line of storms thundered eastward across Montreal and Repentigny to Trois-Rivières. The storms were pushed along by wind gusts clocked at up to 93 km/h and tore branches off trees and, in one case, the roof off a residential building in St. Léonard.
A second line of storms tore across the Eastern Townships toward the Beauce region on Wednesday evening.
The heat warning for the Montreal area has been lifted, however, and today's forecast calls for clearing skies, with a high of 22 C and a low this evening of 11 C.

Far-right group supports federal bid of Trudeau heckler Matthieu Brien

Full text: The man arrested during a confrontation with Justin Trudeau in June says he's running to become the Bloc Québécois candidate in the prime minister's riding and he can count on support from Quebec's far right.
Storm Alliance - which has staged rallies at the Canada-U.S. border to "protect" Quebecers from refugee claimants - sent a delegation to the campaign launch of Matthieu Brien Wednesday.
Brien says he wants to represent the Bloc in the Papineau riding in the 2019 federal election. The 31-year-old confronted Trudeau during an event to celebrate Quebec's fête nationale, calling the prime minister "mon tabarnak" and accusing him of betraying Quebecers.
He was arrested in Jarry Park that day and pleaded guilty to a charge of obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty. Brien pleaded not guilty and was released under a court order not to participate in political activities.
On Wednesday, just moments after Brien's lawyer had that condition lifted, he stood on the steps of Montreal's courthouse and declared his candidacy for federal office.
In a livestream of the press conference( https://www.facebook.com/100018249364818/videos/263433997608244/?fb_dtsg_ag=AdwtRFCj6b3o4So_gVz0EGcxRqpAlxOmIwOZxkukFkKtRA%3AAdyE4VFIMM6VRSYGpx_9P3ilv0UgBK0AdfRpBkeA_9fueg ), one of the attendees can be seen wearing a Storm Alliance sweatshirt. Maxime Fiset, an anti-radicalization expert and former white supremacist, compares Storm Alliance to groups like La Meute.
Fiset told the Montreal Gazette last May that the groups preach right wing, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim populism. For its part, Storm Alliance argues that it isn't against Islam itself but merely radical Islam and illegal immigration.
Julie Amarok, an administrator of Storm Alliance's Facebook page, confirmed the attendance Wednesday of several group members.
"We are supporting his cause because, among other things, he supports the right to free expression," said Amarok, who added that Brien is not a member of the group.
Storm Alliance is probably best known for staging rallies at the Lacolle border crossing in response to a recent influx of refugee claimants. Some members wear black masks and clash with counter-demonstrators who frequently outnumber the group.
When the federal government began processing refugee claimants in the Olympic Stadium last summer, Storm Alliance tried to stage a protest outside the sports complex. Sources tell the Montreal Gazette they ultimately cancelled the event because it would also be attended by members of the radical right-wing group Soldiers of Odin (SOO).
Dave Tregget, who founded Storm Alliance in 2016, was also a founding member of the Soldiers of Odin's Quebec chapter. SOO began in Finland and has been linked to European neo-Nazi movements.
One of SOO Quebec's most infamous members - Phil Gendron - has been photographed giving the Nazi salute, wearing SS paraphernalia and has posted Nazi slogans on social media.( https://mtlcontreinfo.org/soldiers-of-odin-a-montreal-la-police-protege-encore-les-nazis/ )
Tregget is no longer a member of SOO and no longer the president of Storm Alliance. Amarok says there is "not a single connection" between SOO and Storm Alliance.
During Brien's address on the courthouse steps, he thanked his supporters for donating $7,166 to his legal defence fund. Beyond affirming his goal to make Quebec an independent nation, he railed against Trudeau's broken promise to reform Canada's electoral system.
He also took aim at the Liberal government's plan to nationalize the Trans Mountain Pipeline.
"I'm inviting all of the patriots of Quebec, all of my friends and comrades ... to take back your membership cards and join the Bloc," he said. "I'm inviting you to become volunteers in Papineau."
The Facebook livestream of his speech was shared 500 times and viewed by 8,400 people as of Wednesday evening. The Bloc Québécois could not immediately be reached for comment to clarify its relationship with Brien.
The Bloc Québécois was once a political powerhouse in Canada - winning 54 seats in the House of Commons to earn its spot as the official opposition party in 1993.
But after nearly being wiped off the map by the New Democratic Party in 2011, the Bloc has been beset with infighting and political defeat. Only five Bloc members remain in the House of Commons.
Brien lives in Papineau and failed to get the Bloc nomination there in 2015.
He is to return to court on Feb. 7.

Full text: The man arrested during a confrontation with Justin Trudeau in June says he's running to become the Bloc Québécois candidate in the prime minister's riding and he can count on support from Quebec's far right.
Storm Alliance - which has staged rallies at the Canada-U.S. border to "protect" Quebecers from refugee claimants - sent a delegation to the campaign launch of Matthieu Brien Wednesday.
Brien says he wants to represent the Bloc in the Papineau riding in the 2019 federal election. The 31-year-old confronted Trudeau during an event to celebrate Quebec's Fête nationale, calling the prime minister "mon tabarnak" and accusing him of betraying Quebecers.
He was arrested in Jarry Park that day and pleaded guilty to a charge of obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty. Brien pleaded not guilty and was released under a court order not to participate in political activities.
On Wednesday, moments after Brien's lawyer had that condition lifted, he stood on the steps of Montreal's courthouse and declared his candidacy for federal office.
In a livestream of the press conference, one of the attendees can be seen wearing a Storm Alliance sweatshirt. Guillaume Fiset, an anti-radicalization expert and former white supremacist, compares Storm Alliance to groups like La Meute.
Fiset told the Montreal Gazette last May that the groups preach right wing, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim populism. For its part, Storm Alliance argues that it isn't against Islam itself but merely radical Islam and illegal immigration.
The Bloc Québécois could not immediately be reached for comment to clarify its relationship with Brien. ccurtis@postmedia.com The Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Passenger accuses Air Canada of dangerously poor lost-baggage security

Full text: An Air Canada passenger is worried about the airline's safety protocols after he said hundreds of bags were left unmonitored in an open space at Montreal's Trudeau International Airport.
Lachine resident Kyle Rougeau said he first noticed piles of uncollected luggage Saturday morning when he arrived in Montreal from Toronto, where his flight had been delayed due to thunderstorms. After waiting for an hour at baggage claim, Rougeau was told by an Air Canada agent that his bags had likely been left in Toronto due to the storm and that they should arrive later in the day and would be delivered to his home.
Throughout the day, Rougeau said he kept checking Air Canada's website with a tracking number provided by the company but his bags still had not been located. When he called customer service later that afternoon, he said the agent was unable to tell him where the bags were between Saskatoon, where he began his trip, and Montreal.
He returned to the airport in an attempt to obtain more information and once again noticed the piles of luggage around domestic baggage claim. When he asked an Air Canada agent if he could search for his bags, he said he was jokingly told, "Sure, have fun!"
After finding his luggage among the bags, Rougeau told another agent and said they replied, "Oh really? I'm glad you found your bag."
"It's pretty much a free for all," Rougeau said. "A coat check at a restaurant does a way better job with your jacket than Air Canada does to protect your suitcase."
He said his biggest concern was that if he could search the pile of bags without being questioned by staff, that anyone could walk into the airport and take or tamper with the bags without being stopped.
"I don't know how long I would have had to wait, with my bag sitting here in Montreal, for them to actually go through (the lost baggage)."
A statement from Air Canada blamed the baggage pileup on the bad weather in Toronto, which caused flights to be delayed, rerouted or cancelled.
"In these situations, we move customers but bags, which can move more slowly, sometimes misconnect," the statement says.
Air Canada also says that the uncollected bags were moved to a "stanchioned-off and monitored" area in the Montreal airport, but Rougeau disputes their claim, pointing out he had unfettered access to the supposedly monitored bags.
Kim Porter, who went to the airport to pick up a relative just after midnight Sunday, also insisted that the bags were left out in the open, unprotected. Those that were piled between carousels, she said, became safety hazards as passengers tried to navigate around them.
"It was outrageous," she said. "There was luggage everywhere."
The Aéroports de Montréal's website( https://www.admtl.com/fr/guide/bagages-securite ) says that airlines are solely responsible for transporting and delivering baggage.

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Montreal invests $7.6M to create 151 new affordable housing units( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-invests-7-6m-to-create-151-new-affordable-housing-units )
The city of Montreal will be creating 151 new affordable housing units in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Rosemont, Mayor Valérie Plante announced Thursday, following up on her administration's promise to create 12,000 new social or affordable units in four years.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-moves-on-mobility-accessibility-housing-for-seniors )
The city will be investing $7.6 million to purchase and renovate the 61 units in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and 90 in Rosemont. It will also offer a subsidy and interest-free loans to non-profits Habitations communautaires Olympia and Habitations du trentaine de la Société d'habitation populaire de l'Est de Montréal, who will be overseeing the projects. The Fonds d'investissement de Montréal, led by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert, will also be collaborating on the project.
This funding model is a pilot project that will allow Montreal to study how to best proceed with future affordable housing programs, the city says.
McGill and MUHC given $500,000 for cannabis, cancer research projects( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-and-muhc-given-500000-for-cannabis-cancer-research-projects )
McGill University and the McGill University Health Centre have received $500,000 for two international research projects.
Announced Thursday, the funding is to be shared between two projects at the MUHC Research Institute. Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, a mental health researcher and expert in mood disorders, will look at the pharmacological properties of cannabidiol, an active chemical of cannabis, and its ability to reduce the anxiety and depression that's often associated with chronic pain. Dr. Pnina Brodt, a cancer researcher whose work focuses on the biology of cancer metastasis, will look for a new treatment of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer.
Brodt and Gobbi's laboratories are aiming to start clinical studies.
The projects are to be carried out in collaboration with university laboratory researchers in Canada, France, Israel and Italy.
McGill's funding is part of the Quebec government's research initiative plan, Stratégie québécoise de la recherche et de l'innovation 2017-2022 - Oser innover.( https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/objectifs/informer/recherche-et-innovation/strategie-quebecoise-de-la-recherche-et-de-linnovation/page/strategies-22541/?no_cache=1&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5Bmode%5D=single&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5BbackPid%5D=21871&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5BcurrentCat%5D=&cHash=b807607612a4dc8a18e052b985532619 )
Far-right group leader's court appearance postponed in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/far-right-group-leaders-court-appearance-postponed-in-montreal )
A leader of the far-right group Atalante Québec arrested for storming Vice's Montreal offices in May( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-called-after-members-of-far-right-group-storm-into-vices-office ) saw his court appearance postponed on Thursday.
Raphaël Lévesque, 35, was scheduled to appear at the Montreal courthouse, but his case has now been pushed back to Sept. 28.
He was expected to be formally charged with breaking and entering, mischief, intimidation and threats.
Most of the group's members were wearing masks when they stormed the Vice offices on May 23, but Lévesque was wearing only sunglasses. He was arrested at his home in Quebec City in June.
Several police officers were present outside the courthouse Thursday to keep watch on roughly 20 people protesting against the far-right group.
The protesters distributed flyers titled "Atalante fascists aren't welcome in Montreal (or anywhere else)."
Atalante Québec had planned to have a presence outside the courthouse as well, but it didn't seem to be the case.

Alouettes QB Johnny Manziel placed under the CFL concussion protocol

Full text: Montreal Alouettes quarterback Johnny Manziel was placed under the CFL concussion protocol on Wednesday afternoon.
He was rocked by a hit while trying to run the ball over the goal line in a 24-17 loss in Ottawa last weekend in his second career CFL start.
"On Tuesday morning, Johnny Manziel mentioned to our medical staff that he felt symptoms that could be associated with the prescribed medication he uses for a previously diagnosed medical condition," the Alouettes said in a statement. "He then missed practice in order to have some blood work done.
"In view of the hit he received on Saturday and the potential mitigating side effects of his prescribed medication, the Alouettes medical staff has placed Manziel under the CFL concussion protocol for further observation and precautionary reasons. Manziel will be closely observed and assessed in the next few days."
The 2012 Heisman Trophy winner struggled in his CFL debut, but looked better against the Redblacks. He did fumble after taking the hit, but Montreal recovered for the touchdown.
After Manziel missed the team practice on Tuesday, Alouettes head coach Mike Sherman said there was no correlation between Manziel's absence and the vicious head shot he took in the third quarter of Saturday's game in Ottawa.
Sherman noted that Manziel wasn't feeling any effects from the hit, denying the former first-round NFL draft choice suffered a concussion.
The Alouettes are in Edmonton to face the Eskimos on Saturday night.

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and the Projet Montréal administration should be praised for their ongoing efforts to protect wilderness, wetlands, green space and former farm land on the island.
This includes recent land acquisitions to increase the size of the proposed national urban park that will include Angell Woods, all 365 hectares of the L'Anse-à-l'Orme wilderness/wetlands, threatened forests and fields in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue and the Morgan Arboretum; the plan to save the Anjou golf course from development and link it to an existing municipal park; and the proposed new Falaise St. Jacques regional nature park, linking the escarpment forest and a green corridor to a new park on the south side of the Turcot Interchange.
The city stressed this commitment in its July 12 appeal of a June 7 Quebec Superior Court ruling concerning the St. Pierre River in Meadowbrook golf course. The court gave the city 18 months to stop the pollution from entering a 200-metre-long open section of the river and 24 months to decontaminate the land. The pollution stems from 218 homes and buildings in Côte-St-Luc and Montreal West that are sending raw sewage into the storm sewer.
Part of Montreal's appeal, a request for more time to complete the repairs, was rejected by the Quebec Court of Appeal on July 25. This increases the threat to the last remaining open portion of the river.
Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook, which wants Meadowbrook to be converted into a regional nature park, and Technoparc Oiseaux, which is calling for all the remaining wetlands, forests and fields on the site of the Technoparc Montreal in St-Laurent to become a bird and wildlife sanctuary, appreciate the city's appeal, which emphasized the protection of water, rivers, wetlands and wilderness rehabilitation.
"Channelling the Meadowbrook creek into an underground storm sewer would result in lost opportunities to rehabilitate this sector, create new, green infrastructures downstream and allow an outlet for excess water that would relieve pressure on underground infrastructures," the city noted in its appeal, as recently reported in the Montreal Gazette.
Protecting the St. Pierre is a key element for a Meadowbrook park - a wildlife refuge that could be used year-round by local residents.
Meanwhile, the Technoparc wetlands are threatened by the Techoparc's plan to build the Hubert Reeves Eco-Campus on the site - several buildings and large parking lots. The St-Laurent borough has already extended Alfred-Nobel Blvd. roughly 500 metres into the wildlife habitat, added a dike, and a new drainage infrastructure is removing huge quantities of water annually that is damaging the wetlands and destroying food resources, such as fish. More than 3,000 trees have already been cut down, and more will be lost should the development occur.
The wetlands are used by nearly 185 kinds of birds, many of which migrate to Montreal from points south. That the wetlands survived development is a miracle, and their destruction would be a disaster for the wildlife and cause the loss of the premier birdwatching site on the island.
The area is a confirmed breeding site for four officially endangered birds - the Least Bittern, Wood Thrush, Eastern Wood Peewee and Barn Swallow. It is also a habitat and migration stop used by five endangered birds, including the Bobolink, Short-eared Owl and Chimney Swift.
The site also is home to beavers, bats, Monarch butterflies and several species of fish. Should the damage done already be repaired and road and other infrastructure be removed, Montrealers will have a mini-Everglades from spring to mid-fall.
The federal government can intervene to protect this fragile wildlife habitat based on the threatened species calling it home.
We're at a crossroads in terms of wilderness protection.
Plante and Luc Ferrandez, executive committee member responsible for parks, green spaces and large projects, have demonstrated a desire to protect wilderness and green space. They should add Meadowbrook and the Technoparc wetlands to their list. Louise Legault is director of Les Amis du parc Meadowbrook. Joël Coutu is affiliated with TechnoparcOiseaux.

Full text: If Johnny Manziel's on the field Wednesday and is practising with the starting offence, his one-day absence will be nothing more than a footnote. Otherwise, things are about to get infinitely more serious for the Alouettes - as if that's possible.
Montreal's quarterback wasn't at practice Tuesday, although he was at Olympic Stadium in the morning for meetings, head coach Mike Sherman said. And Sherman was quick to state there was no correlation between Manziel's absence and the vicious head shot he took in the third quarter of Saturday's game in Ottawa.
According to Sherman, Manziel had a previously diagnosed medical condition that required blood work. Sherman obviously would have preferred it be done on Monday, when the team didn't practise.
Sherman said he expects Manziel to practise Wednesday, and sees no reason why he wouldn't play Saturday, when the Als travel to Edmonton. Sherman said Manziel isn't feeling any effects from the hit, denying the former Heisman Trophy winner and first-round NFL draft choice suffered a concussion.
Manziel would have scored on a 17-yard draw more than nine minutes into the third quarter. But as he was about to reach the end zone, he was rocked by Redblacks' cornerback Jonathan Rose and fumbled. Montreal centre Kristian Matte recovered the loose ball for a touchdown.
A team doctor and the Als' athletic therapists worked on Manziel's neck at the bench. Although he sported a nasty welt on his chin after the game, Manziel continued playing. The Als had four consecutive series in which they failed to generate a first down following the hit.
"It felt like I ran into a brick wall," Manziel said. "Their defence is fast, big and aggressive. They hit hard. I told (his teammates) no matter what, you're not going to take me out like that. I'm going to come back and keep fighting. It's going to take a lot more.
Montreal Alouettes' Johnny Manziel does his best to evade Hamilton Tiger-Cats' Justin Capicciotti in Montreal, on Friday, August 3, 2018.
"I'm exactly where I wanted to be. I want to be fighting with these guys. I want to be their quarterback. I want to be the quarterback of this team, in this city. That's all I've asked for. I've been sitting out a long time, waiting for another opportunity. I take pride in this. I take pride in leading these guys. They mean a lot to me. I hope they continue to believe in me and believe in what we're doing."
Antonio Pipkin practised with the starting offence in Manziel's absence Tuesday. Pipkin relieved Matt Shiltz last November during the Als' regular-season finale at Hamilton, completing two of nine passes for 14 yards during a 33-0 loss. He returned this season only to be released following the first game, but resurfaced recently because of an assortment of injuries to Montreal quarterbacks.
Manziel completed 16 of 26 passes for 168 yards against Ottawa. After throwing four interceptions against Hamilton in his Als debut the week before, Manziel didn't turn the ball over, although Montreal produced only one offensive touchdown. His yardage would have been better had some of his receivers done a better job of securing the ball.
Meanwhile, Tommie Campbell was back at his customary boundary cornerback position Tuesday after surprisingly being a late healthy scratch against the Redblacks. Following the game, Sherman said he didn't play for personal reasons, although the Montreal Gazette reported Campbell and Sherman got into a disagreement when the player refused to completely buckle his chinstraps - securing only one - during Thursday's walk-though practice.
"I look at football teams like a family. You have disagreements. You have issues. You move on. We fixed it and have moved on," Sherman said. "It's personal between he and I.
"I wouldn't do it if it wasn't the best decision for the team. That's what I'm supposed to do, make a good decision for our team. I feel very comfortable with it. It actually brought us closer together."
Campbell on Tuesday also was reluctant to provide many details, although he denied the decision was related to his chinstraps. He did, however, admit his culpability in the matter.

"Not one person's bigger than the team," said Campbell, who signed with Montreal last February as a free agent. "It has been resolved. Anytime something negative happens, you have to look at the positives of it. A lot of things can change in the future. I just have to communicate better with coaches, and they communicate better with the players, and we'll be good.
"If you're going to give one person leeway, you have to give everyone leeway. That's not the type of team we're trying to be or the type of culture we're trying to instill in the players. I have to lead by example. That's what the coaches expect from me. That's what we talked about. That's what we're going to do."
While Montreal's defence scored a touchdown on an interception return - one of five turnovers it created - it also allowed 487 yards passing and 587 yards' net offence.
"We look at it and study it. We have to have some continuity in the back end with players," Sherman said. "We have to settle down. We're working on it real hard, trying to fix it."

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and the Projet Montréal administration should be praised for their ongoing efforts to protect wilderness, wetlands, green space and former farm land on the island.
This includes recent land acquisitions to increase the size of the proposed national urban park that will include Angell Woods, all 365 hectares of the Anse-à-l'Orme wilderness/wetlands, threatened forests and fields in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue and the Morgan Arboretum; the plan to save the Anjou golf course from development and link it to an existing municipal park; and the proposed new Falaise St. Jacques regional nature park, linking the escarpment forest and a green corridor to a new park on the south side of the Turcot Interchange.
The city stressed this commitment in its July 12 appeal of a June 7 Quebec Superior Court ruling concerning the St. Pierre River in Meadowbrook golf course. The court gave the city 18 months to stop the pollution from entering a 200-metre-long open section of the river and 24 months to decontaminate the land. The pollution stems from 218 homes and buildings in Côte-St-Luc and Montreal West that are sending raw sewage into the storm sewer.
Part of Montreal's appeal, a request for more time to complete the repairs, was rejected by the Quebec Court of Appeal on July 25. This increases the threat to the last remaining open portion of the river.
Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook, which wants Meadowbrook to be converted into a regional nature park, and Technoparc Oiseaux, which is calling for all the remaining wetlands, forests and fields on the site of the Technoparc Montreal in St-Laurent to become a bird and wildlife sanctuary, appreciate the city's appeal, which emphasized the protection of water, rivers, wetlands and wilderness rehabilitation.
"Channelling the Meadowbrook creek into an underground storm sewer would result in lost opportunities to rehabilitate this sector, create new, green infrastructures downstream and allow an outlet for excess water that would relieve pressure on underground infrastructures," the city noted in its appeal, as recently reported in the Montreal Gazette.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-appeals-court-order-to-bury-meadowbrook-stream )
Protecting the St. Pierre is a key element for a Meadowbrook park - a wildlife refuge that could be used year-round by local residents.

Technoparc Montréal shakeup brings hope to environmentalists( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/technoparc-montreal-shakeup-brings-hope-to-environmentalists )
Meanwhile, the Technoparc wetlands are threatened by the Techoparc's plan to build the Hubert Reeves Eco-Campus on the site - several buildings and large parking lots. The St-Laurent borough has already extended Alfred-Nobel Blvd. roughly 500 metres into the wildlife habitat, added a dike and a new drainage infrastructure is removing huge quantities of water annually that is damaging the wetlands and destroying food resources, such as fish. More than 3,000 trees have already been cut down, and more will be lost should the development occur.
The wetlands are used by nearly 185 kinds of birds, many of which migrate to Montreal from points south. That the wetlands survived development is a miracle, and their destruction would be a disaster for the wildlife and cause the loss of the premier birdwatching site on the island.
The area is a confirmed breeding site for four officially endangered birds - the Least Bittern, Wood Thrush, Eastern Wood Peewee and Barn Swallow. It is also a habitat and migration stop used by five endangered birds, including the Bobolink, Short-eared Owl and Chimney Swift. The site also is home to beavers, bats, Monarch butterflies and several species of fish. Should the damage done already be repaired and road and other infrastructure be removed, Montrealers will have a mini-Everglades from spring to mid-fall.
The federal government can intervene to protect this fragile wildlife habitat based on the threatened species calling it home.
We're at a crossroads in terms of wilderness protection. Plante and Luc Ferrandez, executive committee member responsible for parks, green spaces and large projects, have demonstrated a desire to protect wilderness and green space. They should add Meadowbrook and the Technoparc wetlands to their list.
Louise Legault is director of Les Amis du parc Meadowbrook. Joël Coutu is affiliated with TechnoparcOiseaux.

Full text: OTTAWA - Throughout the winter, knowing what little he had inherited at the position, Mike Sherman was always non-committal when asked whether the Alouettes had a legitimate starting quarterback.
After two games of the Johnny Manziel era, the new Als head coach still won't go out on a limb and make any wild proclamations. But he doesn't have to. Manziel has displayed enough raw potential and talent that it has become clear this team has its first bona fide pivot since the days of Anthony Calvillo.
That doesn't mean there won't be hiccups in the evolution of Manziel. It simply means, finally, there could be a reason for optimism with this franchise, although it might already be too late to salvage this season.
"You know me. I'm not quick to rush to judgement or praise a lot of the times," Sherman said. "I think John showed enough out there today to make us feel more comfortable at that position.
"I thought John made drastic improvement from last week. He made unbelievable improvement from his first game. He threw the ball well and made some really good decisions. I thought he did a good job - and he'll just get better and better."
After throwing four first-half interceptions in his Montreal debut against Hamilton( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/football/cfl/montreal-alouettes/johnny-manziels-debut-a-dud-as-alouettes-embarrassed-at-home ) and being benched in the fourth quarter, Manziel displayed marked improvement Saturday night against Ottawa.
It wasn't enough to end the Als' losing ways - their losing streak is now at five games following a 24-17 defeat against the Redblacks - but there was enough there to believe this run of futility might finally be coming to an end.
"Anything's better than last week," Manziel quipped. "It sucks to lose the game. I'm not happy with the outcome but, as far as improvement, we're close. We're a lot closer than we were a week ago.
"It sucks when you don't see results," added Manziel, who came to the Als in a blockbuster five-player trade from the Tiger-Cats on July 22. "I hope they keep believing in what we're doing and see the improvement. We'll get there, (but) it's going to take some time."
Although 10 games remain, the Als are quickly falling out of contention, even in the weak East Division. Their latest defeat leaves them with a 1-7 record, and they're in the midst of a stretch that sees them playing three out of four games on the road before their next bye week in the schedule.
Montreal was 1-7 under Tom Higgins in 2014 and went on an incredible second-half run to finish 9-9 before losing the division final. It's hard to believe history might be repeated, but with Manziel, perhaps it's possible.
He completed 16 of 26 passes against Ottawa for a modest 168 yards, but displayed a strong arm and would have done better had his receivers not dropped the occasional ball. His footwork improved, and he saw the field better. This game, he also took advantage of his mobility, gaining 36 yards on three carries. This is what a running quarterback must do in Canada.
But the Als, nonetheless, had their offensive struggles, with the unit accounting for only one touchdown. Although linebacker Chris Ackie returned an interception 35 yards for a touchdown, Montreal's offence failed to take advantage of the five turnovers - including three fumble recoveries - the defence created.
Montreal Alouettes' Tyrell Sutton (20) is tackled during second half CFL action against the Ottawa Redblacks, in Ottawa on Saturday, Aug. 11, 2018.
"I understand it's close. I get it. We looked better than previous weeks, but it's still the same result," said tailback Tyrell Sutton, who gained 63 yards on 10 carries while adding another 25 on three receptions.
"He can play some ball, man," Sutton said of Manziel. "We have to catch the f-ing ball. We have to capitalize on the turnovers the defence gave us. It was the closest game we've had. This was the closest to a complete game we've played all year. We were in the game, but it's the details that are killing us."
Manziel had passed for 128 yards by halftime against Ottawa - more than he generated the entire game against the Ticats. It's not that he necessarily struggled over the final 30 minutes; the Redblacks simply controlled the ball. Manziel threw for only 40 yards in the second half, the visitors having the ball for slightly less than nine minutes.
The Als couldn't finish the game and were outscored 13-0 in the final quarter; 19-8 overall in the second half. And, while the defence created turnovers, much improvement on that side of the ball is still required.
Ottawa Redblacks quarterback Trevor Harris (7) throws the ball during first half CFL action against the Montreal Alouettes, in Ottawa on Saturday, Aug. 11, 2018.
Redblacks quarterback Trevor Harris completed 44 passes - the second-highest one-game total in Canadian Football League history - for a mind-boggling 487 yards. Incredibly, he passed for only one touchdown.
Ottawa had 34 first downs, 587 yards' net offence and controlled the ball for slightly more than 36 minutes. When the Als' beleaguered defence required a stop down the stretch, Harris instead led his team on a seven-play, 69-yard drive, culminating in William Powell's 10-yard, game-winning touchdown with 15 seconds remaining in regulation time.
"We have to watch the film and figure out what went wrong that last series," Ackie said. "We fought hard that entire game. I felt like we left it all on the field. Sometimes things don't go your way."
The Als were missing boundary cornerback Tommie Campbell, a late scratch for personal reasons, according to Sherman and general manager Kavis Reed. However, a source indicated Campbell didn't play because he refused to completely buckle his chinstraps - securing only one - during Thursday's walkthrough.

Full text: OTTAWA - A 10-yard touchdown run by Williams Powell with 15 seconds remaining in regulation time carried the Ottawa Redblacks to a 24-17 victory over the Alouettes Saturday night before 25,161 spectators at TD Place.
The Redblacks, first in the East Division, improved to 5-3 while the beleaguered Als lost their fifth consecutive game, their record dropping to 1-7.
Als rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel, in his second game since being traded from Hamilton last month, displayed marked improvement, a strong arm and plenty of potential.
It wasn't enough to get Montreal into the win column, but at least Manziel didn't turn the ball over after being intercepted four times last week, against the Tiger-Cats.
Boundary cornerback Tommie Campbell was a surprise scratch by the Als, the move announced one hour before the opening kickoff. Both head coach Mike Sherman and general manager Kavis Reed said the player was dealing with a personal issue that couldn't be resolved in time.
The Als also were forced to play a man short when backup linebacker and special teams member Nicolas Boulay suffered a calf injury during the pre-game warmup.
Campbell was replaced by Branden Dozier.
The Redblacks offence, operating without a huddle throughout most of the night, drove the ball downfield on their opening possession. Montreal has had a tendency to allow touchdowns on the first series of games, and it appeared that would be the case again.
But with the ball at the Als' 41-yard line, J.C. Beaulieu fumbled. The fumble was forced and recovered by strong-side linebacker Chip Cox. Beaulieu, a former Alouette, was traded to the Redblacks for Patrick Lavoie last January.
On the Als' second series of the game, Manziel completed a 27-yard pass to Ernest Jackson. Tyrell Sutton also gained 16 yards on a draw. But Manziel was hit for a 13-yard loss after recovering his own fumble.
The Als scored a single point on Bede's punt at 10:35.
Montreal's defence created another turnover on the Redblacks' next possession.
Harris passed to Brad Sinopoli, but linebacker Chris Ackie forced the fumble and the ball was recovered by rush-end Ventral McMillan at the Montreal 35.
Manziel quickly found Jackson for another 27-yard gain. But two plays later, new receiver Adarius Bowman fumbled. The ball was recovered by Jonathan Newsome, who was removed prematurely from the six-game injured list for this game, as teams are permitted to do.
The opening quarter ended without any additional scoring, although Ottawa receiver Diontae Spencer was wide open and dropped what might have been a touchdown pass late in the period.
Bede conceded a safety early in the second quarter rather than attempting a punt out of the end zone for a 2-1 Ottawa lead.
On the next play, Montreal defensive-tackle Ryan Brown tipped a Harris pass at the line of scrimmage. The ball was intercepted by Ackie, who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown at 1:13, giving the Als an 8-2 lead.
It was the first interception return for a touchdown by a Montreal player since last Aug. 19, when Dominique Tovell turned the trick against Toronto.
Rookie kicker Lewis Ward narrowed the deficit to 8-5 with a 45-yard field goal at 11:06. Ward, an undrafted free agent, has missed only one field goal this season.
The Als made it 9-5 on a single after Bede was wide left on a 49-yard field goal attempt two minutes later. It appeared to be a low snap on the play.
The Redblacks engineered an impressive drive at the end of the half, thanks in part to a 22-yard pass to Greg Ellingson and a 10-yard gain to Dominique Rhymes.
Harris was hit for a nine-yard loss but then found Ellingson for an 18-yard gain to the Als' 12-yard line. Rather than attempt an easy field goal from there, Ottawa gambled on third-and-one.
Head coach Rick Campbell sent backup quarterback Dominique Davis into the game. He ran a bootleg, but his attempted pass to Marco Dubois was low and behind the receiver. The Redblacks turned the ball over on downs.
The home team opened the second half with a 12-play, 101-yard scoring drive. The key plays of the drive were passes of 19 yards to R.J. Harris and a 13-yard gain by Rhymes. William Powell also scampered for a 10-yard gain.
Harris eventually connected with Harris, the receiver, for a 14-yard touchdown at 6:16. Harris beat defensive-back T.J. Heath on the play. An attempted two-point convert failed, giving the Redblacks an 11-9 lead.
But the Als rebounded nicely, Manziel directing them on a six-play, 75-yard drive, thanks to some nifty running by the quarterback, who gained 11 and 13 yards on consecutive plays. He also found Jackson for a 12-yard gain.
Manziel ran 18 yards on a quarterback draw and was about to score, but Jonathan Rose forced the fumble after the rookie pivot took a vicious hit and hurt his neck. Fortunately for Montreal, centre Kristian Matte fell on the loose ball in the end zone for a touchdown at 9:33, giving the Als a 16-11 lead.
Bede then added a single on the ensuing kickoff.
But Ward tied the game, 17-17, in the fourth quarter on field goals from the 32 and 15.
Montreal's next game is next Saturday night, at Edmonton.

Full text: OTTAWA - Joe Rankin was training and teaching at a Maryland middle school, wondering whether another professional football opportunity might come his way, when he got a surprise call recently from Alouettes' general manager Kavis Reed.
It was a week ago Friday night, and Rankin couldn't sleep. He spent much of the night tossing and turning, figuring he wasn't done playing.
"I know I still have juice in the tank. I was wondering when will the opportunity come again?" he said.
He woke up Saturday morning, went to a nearby field to train, returned home and was relaxing when the phone rang not long after. He saw a Montreal area code.
"It was unbelievable. Unexpected. Unheard of. I can't make it up," he said.
Rankin was on the field Monday with the Als and was scheduled to start at field cornerback Saturday night (8 p.m., TSN, RDS, TSN Radio 690) against the Ottawa Redblacks at TD Place.
The Als have been ravaged by injuries to their secondary, losing both Joe Burnett and Mitchell White. That's why they recently traded for defensive-back T.J. Heath and then, subsequently, signed Rankin.
He played six games with the Toronto Argonauts in 2016 after going to training camp the previous season with the Cleveland Browns. In 2014, he attended rookie mini camp with the Baltimore Ravens on a tryout basis.
Rankin was teaching Grade 7 English and world studies at Montgomery Village middle school in Gaithersburg, Md. following his stint with the Argos.
Although the 28-year-old is a modest 5-foot-9 and 185 pounds, he said he won't be encumbered by his lack of size.
"Just play fast and trust your keys," he explained. "Believe and play with your feet. Trust what you see."
Rankin believes his experience with Toronto will help with his transition to life in the Canadian Football League.
"I walk into a situation with a group of guys in the secondary that fly around and believe in each other," he said. "As soon as I stepped in they welcomed me. They've allowed me to play fast and trust my calls."
Saturday night's game will mark the first regular-season return to Ottawa for Als fullback and tight end Patrick Lavoie.
The 30-year-old Lavoie played collegiately at Université Laval before being the Als' second-round (11th overall) draft pick in 2012. He went to Ottawa in the expansion draft before the Redblacks debuted two years later.
"I was surprised. I didn't think it was going to be me. I thought I'd be protected," he said. "You talk about that kind of thing in the locker room. The players said you're going to be safe. I was surprised. After that, it's just part of the business. You go there and play the best you can play.
"I was fine with the idea of playing for an expansion team," added Lavoie, who was reunited with Redblacks GM Marcel Desjardins, the Als' former assistant GM under Jim Popp. "I was happy that a team wanted me that much.
"We did something great here. We started something."
Lavoie, 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, played four seasons with Ottawa, reaching the Grey Cup twice and winning one championship. Then, last January, he was traded back to the Als for J.C. Beaulieu, another fullback and tight end, although one who's younger and earns less money.
"They saved $30,000 and flipped one for one," Lavoie said. "That's fine. It was a business decision. I understand. No hard feelings."
Although the Als have a 1-6 record, Lavoie said the mood on the team and inside the dressing room remains high, the players are optimistic they'll pull out of their funk, including a four-game losing streak. Ottawa is 4-3 and first in the East Division, but the Redblacks squandered a 24-point third-quarter lead last week at Toronto, were outscored 22-3 over the final period and lost, 42-41.
"The thing is, they (the Redblacks) are not unbeatable," Lavoie said. "I'm not saying we're better than them, but I think they're beatable."
When Ottawa defeated the Als, 28-18, last month at Molson Stadium, Beaulieu opened the scoring with a 47-yard pass-and-run touchdown.
This Monday, Als linebacker and special teams member Nicolas Boulay will head up north to assist with the Kickstart Foundation. He'll be attending a summer camp and playing games with the kids, accompanied by kicker Boris Bede and long-snapper Martin Bédard.
"We're going to have some fun with the kids and just show them a good time," Boulay explained. "A lot of kids, especially these days, they try so hard. Focus on one sport. Go and be a kid.
"A lot focus on trying to grow up and being an adult now. You forget to have fun as a kid. Especially with social media. It's forcing kids to grow up even faster instead of enjoying the moment."
Boulay, who has always been heavily involved in charitable work, is in his fourth season of operating Club 52 in conjunction with the Alouettes Foundation. Each home game, he invites 52 underprivileged youths under the age of 18 to Molson Stadium. Along with their game ticket, they receive a pre-game Subway sandwich and get to meet Boulay and some of his teammates post-game for an autograph session.
More than 1,500 have participated since its launch.
And finally, if former Als defensive co-ordinator Noel Thorpe looks like a shadow of his former self, it's because he's lost 25 pounds by eliminating sugar, carbs, grains and starches. Once 205, Thorpe now comes in at a svelte 180.
Thorpe, who was fired along with head coach Jacques Chapdelaine last September by Montreal, now is the Redblacks' DC.

'You flush it and move on,' Als' Johnny Manziel says after horrid debut

Full text: Four days removed from the Friday Night Massacre - one of several the Alouettes have endured this season, but the first of Johnny Manziel's career in Montreal - the quarterback said it's ancient history.
And the 25-year-old Canadian Football League rookie believes he still has the faith of his teammates. He certainly has head coach Mike Sherman's, who announced following the game Manziel remains the team's starter.
"I feel this team has faith in me. I hope they continue to have faith," Manziel said on Tuesday, the first time he has addressed the media this week. "It's not easy. You sit there and watch your quarterback throw four (interceptions), especially with all the hype and buzz that was surrounding everything. You flush it and move on.
"I stood in front of the guys after the game. I put a lot of that on myself. I take pride in what I put on film, the way I play the game. It wasn't a good day."
No, it wasn't. The Als were obliterated 50-11 by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats - Manziel's former team - while the former Heisman Trophy winner and first-round NFL draft choice threw four first-half interceptions, including his second CFL regular-season pass.
Montreal was down by four touchdowns barely 11 minutes into the game, and Manziel was on the bench by the fourth quarter, having completed 11 of 20 passes for 104 yards - less than the length of a CFL field. Now it will be interesting to see how he responds, moves forward and, the organization hopes, improves as the days and weeks pass.
In Manziel's first career NFL start for the Cleveland Browns, he completed 10 of 18 passes for 80 yards, while being intercepted twice in a 30-0 loss to Cincinnati. He started eight games, winning only two, over two seasons before being released. He passed for 1,675 yards and seven touchdowns, while also throwing seven interceptions.
Three seasons later, Manziel has gone from a bad NFL team to one in the CFL equally as challenged to display some competence. The Als are 1-6 this season after ending 2017 with 11 consecutive defeats. They are on track to miss the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season.
"What happened Friday happened to our team. It didn't happen just to him," Sherman said. "Friday's debacle was on a lot of fronts, not just our quarterback. The whole team has to move forward from Friday, not just John."
While Sherman announced immediately following the thrashing that Manziel would start this Saturday night at Ottawa, the decision became academic when backup Vernon Adams suffered a foot injury during Friday's blowout. He was in a walking boot Tuesday and could miss up to six weeks. He becomes the fourth Als quarterback, after Drew Willy, Jeff Mathews and Matt Shiltz, to be injured.
Montreal has re-signed quarterback Antonio Pipkin, who played a portion of the final 2017 game at Hamilton, but was released after the first game this season.
Starting after only two weeks' practice many - including Manziel's agent, Erik Burkhardt, who called it "insane" - thought Sherman's decision was premature. Manziel, conversely, said he has never wanted to win a game so badly, adding he put in the necessary work, and was prepared to win, although he has been criticized by U.S.-based writers for neither preparing or putting in the necessary time while with Cleveland.
Sherman said he doesn't know how early Manziel arrives at Olympic Stadium, since he's usually in his office, watching tape. CFL rules stipulate no player is obligated to spend more than 4 1/2 hours daily at the stadium, between meetings and practice. Any additional time is the player's prerogative.
"Any time you spend in the building, on the field or in the meeting rooms, you want it to be productive," Sherman said. "We're looking for productivity in everything we do."
Manziel said he slept little, if at all, Friday night, reiterating how humbling an experience it was. He had never thrown four interceptions in a game.
"For the first 24 hours, it's a tough pill to swallow. From there, what can you do about it?" he said. "Hamilton's over. It's done. It's not ideal, how we wanted to start, especially my first game here.
"It couldn't have got much worse. You look at it as a test," Manziel added. "I've been away (from the game) for two years. It's a test for our team, being in the hole that we're in and the record we have. There's going to be a lot of people who write us off because of that game. Not me. I look at it as a test and challenge. I prepared to win the game. It didn't go our way. It's hard to swallow that and move forward (when) you get beat up like that. You take it like a man."
There were dropped passes in the game along with miscommunication between Manziel and the receivers. And he frequently was running for his life behind the Als' porous offensive line.
"How can it fall on Johnny? You (media) want it to fall on Johnny?" tailback Tyrell Sutton said. "We had drops. He made bad plays, trying to do too much. We didn't do enough. It's a team effort. Did you expect him to come in here and put up 70 points? That wasn't going to happen."
In other news, veteran rush-end John Bowman suffered a partially torn biceps muscle that could sideline him up to six weeks.

Johnny Manziel's debut a dud as Alouettes embarrassed at home

Full text: Seriously, should we have expected anything else in Johnny Manziel's Canadian Football League debut with the Alouettes?
Manziel, acquired in a stunning five-player trade from Hamilton on July 22, made his much-anticipated debut Friday night and was forced to eat humble pie.
Manziel, the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy and a former first-round draft choice of the Cleveland Browns, saw his first CFL pass intercepted. He had three more pilfered before the opening half ended.
In short, the Tiger-Cats, his former team, made him look like the raw rookie that he is. The Als were eviscerated 50-11 before 18,576 Molson Stadium spectators in what is becoming a familiar theme for this team.
Montreal hasn't won a home game since last Aug. 11 and is now on a four-game losing streak. It saw its record drop to a league-worst 1-6. Had the Als won, they would have moved into a three-way tie for second place in the weak East Division.
Instead, one has to wonder if the Als will win another game this season?
The Ticats also were on a three-game losing streak, but Montreal proved to be the perfect antidote for a team that has been experiencing its own offensive troubles. Hamilton improved to 3-4 and solidified its hold on second place in the division. The Ticats trail division-leading Ottawa by two points.
The Als, who revamped their defence through free agency over the winter, have now allowed a league-high 242 points in seven games, including 94 in the last two. One must wonder whether there will be any repercussions for defensive co-ordinator Rich Stubler.
Oh yes, the Als have scored 103 points.
Alouettes quarterback Johnny Manziel throws against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Montreal on Friday, August 3, 2018.
Manziel's agent, Erik Burkhardt, along with former CFL quarterback Matt Dunigan were among the many who questioned head coach Mike Sherman's decision to start Manziel on two weeks' practice. Burkhardt called the decision "insane."
While Sherman insisted this was a football and not a marketing decision, he could never have fathomed how quickly things would deteriorate for Manziel and his team. Sherman believed Manziel knew enough of the playbook to be competitive. And he figured the 25-year-old might have an advantage, being familiar with Hamilton's defence.
But with the Als already trailing 7-0, after the visitors opened the game with a six-play, 79-yard drive - capped by a 17-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Banks - Manziel's first pass, on second down, was thrown directly into the hands of middle-linebacker Larry Dean at the Montreal 12-yard line.
Three plays later, Alex Green scored on a one-yard run. The game wasn't even six minutes old, and the Als already trailed, 14-0.
Things continued to deteriorate.
The Als were held without a first down on their next series. Kicker Boris Bede had his punt blocked by Curtis Newton. It was recovered by Sean Thomas-Erlington, who played collegiately at Université de Montréal. He returned it 10 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead.
The game was barely eight minutes old.
On Montreal's next possession, Manziel scrambled and attempted a pass for tailback Tyrell Sutton. But the ball deflected and was intercepted by cornerback Jumal Rolle at the Hamilton 48.
Ticats quarterback Jeremiah Masoli, whose play made Manziel expendable, required only four plays for a fourth touchdown. He passed 21 yards to Jalen Saunders at 11:09, increasing the lead to 28-0.
When any team's trailing by four touchdowns, it becomes difficult to assess the play of a quarterback. But Manziel certainly isn't boring. He is elusive and can escape the rush. And he throws a good, strong ball - when it's on target.
He got the Als' offence moving at the end of the first quarter. He passed 10 yards to Ernest Jackson and 12 to Eugene Lewis. Sutton ran for 17, but the drive stalled. Bede, who missed three field goals last week, against Edmonton, kicked a 30 yarder on the opening play of the second quarter.
The Als seemed to have a spark moments later, when safety Dominique Ellis intercepted a pass that was deflected. But three plays later, Montreal gambled on third down. Manziel's pass was underthrown and easily intercepted by Rolle.
The Ticats immediately went on an eight-play, 83-yard drive - thanks to a 17-yard run by Green, a 19-yard pass to Luke Tasker and a 31-yard gain to Saunders. Green eventually scored on a one-yard run at 8:17, making it 35-3.
Hamilton Tiger-Cats defensive end Justin Capicciotti (94) and linebacker Simoni Lawrence (21) celebrate a pass interception as Alouettes quarterback Johnny Manziel (2) looks on during first quarter CFL football action in Montreal on Friday, August 3, 2018.
Still, at times, Manziel was brilliant.
On the Als' next possession, he found Lewis for a 21-yard gain. Three plays later, although Lewis was well covered and Manziel only had a small window in which to complete a pass, he did so, finding Lewis for 31 yards.
Following a six-yard sweep by B.J. Cunningham, the Als were at the Hamilton 14. Manziel then attempted a poor throw that was intercepted by safety Mike Daly.
Lirim Hajrullahu kicked a 42-yard field goal in the final minute of the opening half, sending the teams to their dressing rooms with the visitors comfortably ahead, 38-3.
Hajrullahu added a 48-yard field goal five minutes into the third quarter. Early in the fourth period, the Ticats went 97 yards on nine plays, culminating in Masoli's six-yard touchdown run.
Vernon Adams, who started last week, against the Eskimos, replaced Manziel with 12:52 remaining in the game. Adams scored on a one-yard run at 12:21.
Montreal's next game is Aug. 11, at Ottawa.

Full text: On the night news broke of the Johnny Manziel trade in Canada, it was the most read story on American-based website ESPN. This week, Sports Illustrated also posted a small story on its site.
Everyone - save for Vernon Adams last week - wants to talk about Manziel and has made this Alouettes story about the former Heisman Trophy winner and one-time first-round draft choice of the Cleveland Browns.
When TSN has advertised Friday night's game (7:30 p.m., TSN, RDS, TSN Radio-690) between Montreal and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Molson Stadium, it has billed the match as Manziel and the Als. The phenomenon has been unique to witness at it unfolds, but Montreal's Canadian Football League team suddenly is relevant again. There's finally some excitement, along with some intrigue, surrounding the struggling club.
"I think there's two parts to people. Some want to see him succeed. Others probably want to see him fail. He has both parts to that story," Alouettes head coach Mike Sherman said. "That's what people are looking for. It sells newspapers and internet spots and tweets to this point, and I don't expect anything different."
After receiving a reprieve from the media last Monday, Manziel has spent three straight days facing the horde that comes to practice, it seems, exclusively to watch and interview him. He spends no more than several minutes answering a limited number of questions - his responses tend to be soliloquies, not that there's anything wrong with that - before he's whisked away by a team official.
The media who cover the team on a regular basis must adjust to this new reality although Anthony Calvillo, in 16 seasons with the Als, never had a limited window in which to answer queries.
Truthfully, there's nothing much left for Manziel to say at this point. The time has come to play the game, providing the organization - and fans - with the first glimpse of what it acquired on July 22. Manziel was one of five players involved in the trade with the Ticats.
Manziel becomes the 14th different quarterback for the Als since Calvillo suffered a career-ending concussion in August 2013. This is Montreal's seventh game this season and they've already utilized four pivots - Drew Willy, Jeff Mathews, Matt Shiltz and Adams.
"I'm hoping to come in and just provide above-average, solid quarterback play and give us something consistent, week in and week out," Manziel said. "I don't feel like I need to come up here and completely light everything on fire and throw for 500 yards a game. I just want to come in and be a solid starter, eliminate turnovers and, hopefully, go out and make some plays. I feel like I can contribute that for sure.
"If you have a quarterback you believe in and is going to be your guy, you hope that elevates your team and offence as a whole to get to where you need to be, get to the right plays and make the right throws. Can one person help boost a team's profile and history and get them to where they need to be? Sure. It could be a missing piece. But at the end of the day, it's a full team sport."
Sherman said he has been impressed with Manziel's knowledge of the offence in a limited amount of time - although his agent, Erik Burkhardt, said it was insane to start him this quickly following his arrival. Sherman added the CFL rookie is extremely intelligent and can assimilate information at a very high rate. He simply wants him to manage the game while leaning on the players around him.
"Johnny's a very smart kid," Sherman said. "He can articulate his thoughts as well as any 25-year-old I've been around. He's very talented in a lot of ways. He remembers things out there ... the formations, motions and waggles I struggle with. He's got them down. Sometimes I have to think twice about it. Physically, he has made the throws in practice. There's not a throw he can't make.
"With all due respect to his agent, what defence does John know better? He's going to have to start eventually. He's going to have some growing pains. If I didn't think he was ready ..."
Historically, CFL rookie quarterbacks struggle. But that doesn't mean Manziel can't catch lightning in a bottle. It has happened before in Montreal.
In his first CFL start, Sept. 4, 2013 against Toronto, Tanner Marsh passed for 309 yards and a touchdown in a 20-9 victory. Two seasons later, on July 3, 2015, Rakeem Cato threw for 241 yards and three touchdowns in a 29-11 upset against Calgary. Both games were played at home.
Manziel has impressed his teammates as well with his leadership qualities. They seem to believe he can walk on water.
"You listen to this man talk and watch him play. He's a player," tailback Tyrell Sutton said. "At the end of the day, he knows what he's doing. He's a natural-born leader.
"He's poised. He knows what he's doing. He flies around. He's competitive. He takes control. That's what you like to see from your quarterback. He lets everyone know what they're supposed to do, when and how."
The talking's over. Now the time has come to play ball. Enjoy the ride.

Full text: A Montreal couple is filing a police report after they were attacked and had their lives threatened by defenders of a fascist group last weekend.
"Matthew" and his girlfriend were out for a night on the town Saturday when they walked into an Ontario St. pub and noticed something strange; a table full of black-clad men and women, most of them heavily tattooed and wearing shirts that read "Québec au Québécois."
"At first I thought they were just (Quebec) nationalists, but when I heard what they were saying, it was clear they were more like skinheads," said Matthew, who does not want his real name published for fear of reprisals.
"We had to leave the bar because I wanted to confront them and it just wasn't worth it."
They walked for a few blocks and settled at a bar in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. As he sat on a terrace facing the street, Matthew saw five people putting up stickers for the far-right group Atalante Québec. He said he recognized them from earlier that night.
"I probably shouldn't have said anything, but I told them their ideology is shit," he said. "Things escalated quickly."
One of the men slapped Matthew in the face and before he could react, the others started shoving his girlfriend and then knocked him over.
"My girlfriend is Latin American, so they started telling her to go back to her country," said Matthew. "Then one of them - he was a big dude with a spider web tattoo and really short hair - said something like 'If you don't get the f*** out of here I'll kill you.'"
Atalante Québec would not say if their members were involved in the attack. They did not respond to repeated interview requests from the Montreal Gazette.
The group is based out of Quebec City, but has been active in Montreal for months. Last May, masked Atalante members ransacked VICE News' downtown office,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-arrested-in-connection-with-right-wing-group-storming-vice-quebec-office ) threw papers at reporters and shouted them down.
Raphäel Levesque, their leader, was charged with intimidation for his alleged role in the incident. He's scheduled to appear in court this month.
Levesque - also known as Raf Stomper - has served a prison sentence for drug trafficking. He was a founding member of the skinhead band Légitime Violence, whose lyrics allude to fighting immigrants and starting a new Holocaust.
Last year, someone calling themselves Raf Stomper threatened to burn down the offices of the province's anti-radicalization force if it set up shop in Quebec City.
Atalante members have also attended rallies at the Quebec-U.S. border to protest against Muslim asylum seekers coming into Canada.
Montreal police will not say if they're investigating Atalante's activities.
"From an intelligence perspective, it's entirely likely that the Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec have taken a much larger interest in their activities," said Richard Warman, a human rights lawyer who fights against online hate propaganda.
"It's one thing when they're simply engaging in border harassment of migrants coming into Quebec, it's another thing entirely when you start storming journalists' offices in a gang format - wearing masks - and start committing fairly serious criminal offences.
"In this case, members or supporters are threatening people with death for taking down a sticker, they're pushing themselves up the police's list of people of interest."
Though Atalante refused to comment on the alleged attack, it posted an online response to the Montreal Gazette's initial report. The post acknowledges its members were in the city for a "militant day" Saturday, but that allegations of Atalante members engaged in violence are unfounded.
The "Anglo-Saxon" media, according to Atalante, is stirring up resentment of "French Canadian nationalists."
Warman says Atalante is part of a resurgence, in Quebec, of right-wing hate groups. In May, the Montreal Gazette reported( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ) that one of North America's most prominent white nationalists lives in Montreal and organized white-supremacist meetings on the island.
The meetings included members of Atalante, but also La Meute, Soldiers of Odin and Storm Alliance.
Much of the propaganda these groups use focuses on "radical Islam" and migrants, which Warman calls "a strategic choice."
"(Muslims) are a more socially acceptable target than Jewish people or people of colour," said Warman, a board member of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "But make no mistake about it, that's just a shifting focus. Their ideology targets all kinds of minority and religious groups."
A member of the left-wing group Montréal Antifasciste said they removed 150 Atalante stickers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/far-right-group-and-anti-fascists-embroiled-in-montreal-turf-war ) in and around the Hochelaga Maisonneuve district Sunday.
Matthew, who said Saturday's attack traumatized his girlfriend, stated he is confused about how to fight back against groups like Atalante. On Saturday, he chose to place himself between the assailants and his girlfriend instead of striking back.
Bystanders mostly just sat in stunned silence, watching as five assailants swarmed the couple.
"When it was over, I just wondered how we can chase these groups out of our city," he said. "I spoke to the manager at the first bar and he said (Atalante's) presence really upset the staff and if they came back they'd get really bad service.
"But we have to do more than that. We have to be able to take a stand, we have to fight back."

Appeal court upholds order forcing Montreal to bury Meadowbrook creek

Full text: The Quebec Court of Appeal has rejected a motion by Montreal asking it to suspend a judgment ordering the city to bury a contaminated creek on the Meadowbrook Golf Club.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-appeals-court-order-to-bury-meadowbrook-stream )
In the July 25 ruling, appeal court judge Geneviève Marcotte notes that the city has known about the contamination since at least 2002, yet done nothing about it.
She rejected Montreal's argument that it shouldn't be forced to divert the creek into the sewer system because it would be preferable to fix crossed sewer pipes in Côte St-Luc and Montreal West that are causing the contamination.
Marcotte also threw out the city's claim that it will suffer irreparable prejudice if it fixes the crossed connections, but is ordered to bury the creek anyway.
Documents filed in the case show the city has known for years that about 218 addresses in Côte St-Luc and Montreal West have been spewing sewage into a storm sewer that is polluting the creek. Montreal tried unsuccessfully to name the two other municipalities as co-defendants, arguing they should share responsibility since the contamination is coming from their territory.
From the court documents, "it is difficult for me to conclude that the public interest would be better served by perpetuating the city's inertia while the creek remains an open-air sewer. By its own admission, the city has been aware of the contamination since 2002. It has known the cause since 2004 and apparently has done nothing since then to fix the situation, aside from trying without success to involve the other towns in the legal debate," she writes in the judgment.
Marcotte adds she does not want to "condone the city's inertia" and orders it to act within the deadlines set by the court instead of complaining that they are too short.
On July 12, the city appealed a ruling by Quebec Superior Court( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/last-remnant-of-st-pierre-river-could-be-buried ) on June 7 ordering it to turn the creek into an underground sewer, arguing that burying a river is contrary to Quebec's Environment Quality Act. City lawyers noted that the Meadowbrook creek is the last surviving remnant of the St-Pierre River, which once wound from Mount Royal to Old Montreal.
The city also said the deadlines set by the court are too short. The ruling had ordered it to apply to the Quebec environment department for a permit to bury the creek within four months, "cap" (bury) the creek within 18 months and decontaminate the riverbed and banks within 24 months.
The appeal court will rule on other aspects of the city's appeal at a later date.
Developer Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc. had sued the city to force it to bury the brook. Even though Groupe Pacific won, it is also appealing the ruling and is asking the court to order the creek buried even if the environment department refuses a permit, and even if it is no longer contaminated.
Louise Legault, director of Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook, said that while the judge's frustration with the city's failure to clean up the contamination is understandable, eliminating the creek is not the answer.
"I'm disappointed," she said.
"We don't want the creek buried. It's got a role to play environmentally," she said, noting that waterways are important for providing natural drainage and combatting heat islands.
Legault said it would be tragic to lose the last remnant of the St-Pierre, which once meandered through present-day Snowdon, Côte St-Luc, Ville St-Pierre and St-Henri( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-the-archives-our-islands-lost-rivers ) - flowing into a lake on the site of the Turcot Yards before joining the St. Lawrence River in Old Montreal. Explorer Samuel de Champlain described the river when he explored Montreal in 1611.
"You get rid of that and there's nothing left of that river. It's an opportunity lost," Legault said.
"When you consider that other cities are daylighting their rivers, they're going to be burying it," she said.
Daniel Green, co-president of the Société pour vaincre la pollution (SVP), said the ruling should come as a wake-up call to the city.
"They haven't done a damn thing since 2001," he said.
"They seem to be competent on identifying the source of the problem, but incompetent to do something about it," Green added.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific bought the land for $3 million in 2006, which straddles Montreal and Côte St-Luc, and later proposed a 1,600-unit residential complex called Petite Rivière, of which the creek would be a prominent feature.
Montreal blocked development on the site by designating it as recreational green space in 2015, while Co^te St- Luc zoned its portion of the site as recreational in 2000.

Als' Johnny Manziel 'excited, not nervous' ahead of first CFL start

Full text: Johnny Manziel might be preparing for his first Canadian Football League start, but this is hardly his first rodeo.
Manziel became the first freshman in NCAA history to win the Heisman Trophy while playing for Texas A&M. And he was a first-round draft choice of the Cleveland Browns who started eight games - two wins - over two seasons.
Nervous? No. Excited? Indeed.
"This is just going to be a game. Go out and execute our plan and see where it goes," he said following Wednesday's practice at Olympic Stadium. "This is the start of my time up here in the CFL. I'm looking forward to whatever this journey holds.
"I'm very excited, not nervous at all," added the 25-year-old. "This isn't my first start ever. It's not my first time getting behind centre and having to direct the whole offence and trying to score. It is up here, but I feel like I have a firm enough grasp to be able to be in the game and do what I need to do, or (head coach Mike) Sherman wouldn't have let that happen."
Manziel, one of five players involved in one of the league's biggest trades in history, July 22, will start Friday night at Molson Stadium against the Tiger-Cats. Hamilton signed him in May, but before the trade, Manziel sat on the bench for five games, unable to dislodge incumbent quarterback Jeremiah Masoli.
Manziel, to the chagrin of many who came to the McGill University venue last week, didn't play in Thursday's loss against Edmonton, but has practised with the starting offence since Monday. On Tuesday, Sherman stated the obvious, proclaiming Manziel would start.
Sherman said it wasn't until Tuesday's practice that he finalized his decision.
"I needed to see how quickly he could adapt to the playbook," Sherman explained. "Over the weekend, I needed to see him coming in and working. He connected with the receivers on different occasions around town to make sure they were on the same page. His work ethic was demonstrated over the weekend.
"When he came on the field (Monday), going through his progressions, he was pretty on."
Cleveland eventually soured on Manziel. While his on-field play had some inconsistencies, it was more his off-field transgressions that eventually led to his demise. The Browns, like the Als, have spent years struggling on the field while having a carousel of starting quarterbacks.
"I'll never forget the 30-0 beating I got in my first start in the NFL," Manziel remembered. "I'll never forget going into Pittsburgh, dropping back on the first play of the game and the ball slipping out of my hand and bouncing off the top of my helmet, fumbling to the other team.
"I've been in situations. I've had the chance to get a lot of the jitters out of the way."
This is only the Als' seventh game this season, but Manziel incredibly will become the fifth quarterback utilized, after Drew Willy, Jeff Mathews, Matt Shiltz and Vernon Adams, who played the entire game against the Eskimos. Both Willy and Mathews are injured.
While Adams performed admirably last week, passing for 217 yards and rushing for 72, it wasn't enough to generate a victory. Despite the Als' 23 points, equalling their most-productive output this season, they scored only two touchdowns. Virtually everything around the quarterback on this team remains unchanged. Expectations of Manziel should be tempered, at least until he gains more experience. That's only logical.
Sherman, at least, has done him a favour, starting him at home, where the spectators will be in Manziel's corner. And against a defensive scheme and personnel with which he should be familiar. The Als have a 1-5 record, but the Ticats aren't much better, at 2-4. Both teams are on three-game losing streaks.
"There are some things I'm familiar with that we have in this offence that mesh with what I've done in the past," Manziel said. "We've had a solid week. We're coming together and trying to build some chemistry. We have some things that are beneficial to my skill set.
"Look, not everything's going to go the way we want it to. We're going to have some struggles and they're going to make some plays. That's the name of the game. You're going to do some good, some bad, some you wish you'd have thrown and some you wish you wouldn't have."
If the Als win, and given the weak East Division, they would be tied with the Ticats for second place and, for the moment, be in a playoff position with 11 games remaining. Incredibly, Montreal hasn't won at home since last Aug. 11, against Toronto, which was without quarterback Ricky Ray. The Als then ended the season with 11 successive defeats.
"We just need a win at home. That's step one," Sherman said. "I always feel games are must-wins, but we're one-third through the season. We just need to win a game at home, in front of our fans.
"I'm sure there's going to be times (Manziel) struggles. It's his first start in quite some time. He's going to have struggles. Him being able to work through some of those struggles is important."
Meanwhile, boundary cornerback Tommie Campbell (hamstring) didn't practice Wednesday. But Sherman still expects him to play.

Full text: Skywatchers should get set for the best meteor shower of the year coming in August. The Perseids - is the cosmic old faithful - offering up a flurry of shooting stars across the late night skies. The shower's peak performance is in the hours before dawn Aug. 13 but a trickle of meteors can be seen days before and after, even after nightfall.
Because the peak occurs on a moonless night this year, as many as 30 shooting stars may be visible from dark locations around the West Island region and up to 90 from the dark countryside - an hours' drive from the city.
The meteor shower is caused by Earth slamming into a giant cloud of debris left behind by a passing comet. When sand-sized particles hit the atmosphere at speed s of 200,000 km per hour they burn up and create streaks of light in the upper atmosphere.
Look carefully and you will notice they all appear to radiate out from one spot in the sky - the shower's namesake constellation, Perseus, the mythological hero. To catch the fireworks show it's best to find a location with no direct lights and with a clear view of the overhead sky. No need for telescopes or binoculars - the unaided eye is best since the meteors will appear to zip across most of the sky. Face towards the eastern sky where the shower's constellation will appear to rise after midnight.
Also making an appearance in the starry skies in August evening skies are the planets, Venus in the low west, while Mars and Saturn are high in the south after darkness falls.
About a half hour after sunset on Aug. 14 look for a thin waxing crescent moon joined by the super-bright evening star - the neighbouring planet Venus as both set in the west. On the night of Aug. 20 look for the waxing gibbous moon just to the upper right of golden Saturn, sitting in the constellation Sagittarius. Then on the evening of both Aug. 22 and 23 look for a waxing moon above the brilliant orange Mars high in the southern late night sky. The Red Planet just passed opposition a few weeks ago and is currently shining at its brightest in 15 years. A global dust storm has been raging for two months on Mars, and has visibly changed the colour of the planet - from its usual orange-red to a golden-yellow. It's amazing to think that despite Mars being over 58 million kilometres from Earth you can see the effect of this dust storm with nothing more than just your eyes!
The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada will be holding a public Perseids viewing party at the Morgan Arboretum in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue on Saturday, Aug. 11, starting at 7:30 p.m. with a talk followed by observations of the meteor shower.

Hot damn! July was one of hottest on record in Montreal

Author: Litwin, Kelsey

Full text: This July was the hottest the island of Montreal has experienced in nearly 100 years.
The month's average temperature of 24.2 C fell just half a degree shy of the all time high of 24.7 C, recorded 97 years ago in 1921.
"It's not a record-breaking month, but it's close to the maximum ever recorded in Montreal," said Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault. "We can definitely say we're in the Top 3 in the Montreal area."
The 2018 average is also three degrees above the mean July temperature of 21.2 C. From day to day, a three-degree increase might not seem like a lot, but over a month, Legault said, it makes a difference. He explained that mean monthly temperatures tend to vary by one degree year to year, so a difference of three degrees is "way (above) normal for a month-long period."
Dominique Paquin, a climate simulation and analysis specialist with research consortium Ouranos, said it's too early to definitively attribute the waves of extreme heat that spread across the northern hemisphere in July to climate change, "but we know that with climate change, the number of days with extreme heat will increase."
"We can't formally attribute it to climate change based on statistics," she said, "but it's clear that it gives us a look at what will become the norm."
In efforts to mitigate the effects of extreme heat, Paquin said new regulations are being implemented across Quebec to combat heat islands, which are described by the city of Montreal as spaces that absorb and store heat, including parking lots and flat rooftops. Increased green spaces and green infrastructure are crucial, she said.
And that is not lost on the city of Montreal. In its 2015-2020 Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Agglomeration of Montreal, the city said that heat islands cover 28 per cent of the island, making it particularly susceptible to extreme heat. One measure the city hopes to implement as a part of the action plan is a regulation that dictates the ratio of green to built spaces in the city. How the plan has progressed since it was announced in 2015( https://montrealgazette.com/news/the-city-of-montreal-unveils-its-climate-change-action-plan?video_autoplay=true ) is unclear.
While it's too early to predict what August will be like as a whole, Legault said it is shaping up to be around the norm - despite starting with a short hot spell this weekend. Unlike theearly-July extreme heat that is reported to have caused the deaths of 54 Montrealers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends ), Legault expects the upcoming heat wave to be "normal," with temperatures at or slightly above 30 C and with milder humidity.
The level of humidity and how long the high temperatures last are the biggest differences between normal and extreme heat waves, Legault explained. We also tend to become acclimated to new norms, he said, so while it will be hot, it might not feel as bad compared to what July put us through.

Mars in opposition: You can still catch the tail end of the Martian flyby

Full text: Mars has just buzzed the Earth, but don't despair if you missed the flyby early Tuesday morning.
The Red Planet hasn't been this close to us - a mere 54.6 million kilometres away - since 2003, and its orbit won't bring it this close again for another 15 years or so. You can still see Mars, but the trick is to get up before dawn and find a good view of the horizon - over the water or from high ground outside the city.
The "blood moon" eclipse seen from Siliguri on July 28, 2018. Mars is visible below the moon, closer to the horizon.
Mars will be the bright reddish star below the moon, near the horizon. It can be seen by the naked eye, but try looking with a good set of binoculars if you don't have a telescope handy. It's not going to be as big as the moon, so delete that spam email that promises it will be. NASA is in no mood for that: "The message is that Mars will look as big as the moon in our night sky. If that were true, we'd be in big trouble given the gravitational pulls on Earth, Mars and our moon!"
You won't be able to see them, especially because of a "planet-encircling dust event" going on right now, but there are two NASA rovers on Mars. Selfie-taking Curiosity, the best-known of the two, is drilling into the hard rock of the planet to find out whether small life forms called microbes could ever have lived on Mars. Curiosity is a long way from home, so take a minute to send it a postcard( https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/participate/postcard/ ) from the Mars Science Laboratory.
Fans of the Mars rover Curiosity can send it postcards via NASA's website.
Cousin Opportunity is also drilling - it's a robot geologist looking at the possible history of Mars, including what effect water might have had on the landscape. The rover is solar-powered, and the dust storm is making it difficult to recharge, so Opportunity is "putting herself to sleep only to wake when the skies eventually clear."
You'll be able to see Mars into the fall, but it will get smaller and smaller as its orbit takes it farther away from Earth. Mars's next close approach is Oct. 6, 2020.

Far-right group, anti-fascists embroiled in city 'turf war'; Pair attacked outside bar for removing fascist group Atalante Québec stickers

Full text: A man and woman were attacked outside a Montreal bar late Saturday while trying to remove fascist propaganda from a street sign, witnesses say.
Jonathan Turcotte Summers said he was walking along Ontario St. that night when he saw a young couple who appeared to be shaken up.
"They seemed very agitated," Turcotte Summers said. "They just happened to see a sticker from a neo-fascist group and when they went to take it down, they were attacked.
"It was three men, two women ... they shoved one and then the other victim. Then they said that: 'If you take the sticker down we'll kill you.'" No one called police and the assailants fled on foot, but Turcotte Summers said the attack rattled the young couple. He was not there at the time of the incident, but two witnesses confirmed his account of the events to the Montreal Gazette.
The stickers belong to Atalante Québec - an extreme-right group that stages anti-immigration rallies and boasts of its ties to the skinhead band Légitime Violence. There is no evidence the attackers belong to either group.
Atalante is based in Quebec City, but its members have ramped up activities in Montreal this year. They ransacked the Montreal offices of VICE News in May to protest its coverage of extreme right movements.
On Saturday, about a dozen Atalante members pasted their lightning-bolt logo across the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. Within hours, members of Montréal Antifasciste went about removing the propaganda.
Sources say roughly 150 Atalante stickers showed up on street signs, bus shelters and lamp posts in the east end.
"Postering" is a tactic in the long-standing turf war between the extreme right and its opponents in Canada, according to one expert.
"These turf battles were common in the 1990s," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "Back then you'd have Anti-Racist Action and the neo-Nazi Heritage Front duking it out for space on universities campuses and in cities across Canada.
"(The turf battle) was far more violent back then. There have been some recent incidents outside rallies in Quebec, for example, but in terms of fighting each other while postering, I haven't heard of anything happening in years."
Balgord's network monitors extreme-right-wing movements in Canada and says there has been a rise in Quebec-based hate groups in the past decade.
Atalante members "poster" as a way of initiating its members from the online world into taking reallife action, according to Balgord. Its Facebook following numbers about 5,900, but Atalante Québec's events rarely draw more than a few dozen young men.
On its Facebook page, Atalante describes itself as a Quebec "identitarian" community group. But Balgord and Maxime Fiset - of the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence - say it mainly exists to spread fascist ideology.
"Putting up posters or going for drinks at a bar is, at least, a real life activity that they use to try to legitimize the movement," Balgord said. "Of course it's also meant to radicalize young white men into the hate movement."
The right-wing group - whose slogans include "Quebec for Quebecers" and "Globalists go home" - hands out food to "Québécois" homeless people in an effort to soften its image. On Saturday, they handed out lunch bags in Montreal featuring their logo.
The group has marched alongside Soldiers of Odin, and some of its members have ties to far-right groups like Storm Alliance and La Meute. During rallies last spring and last summer, its members wore masks and demonstrated at the Lacolle border crossing to protest the arrival of asylum seekers from the United States.
Their rallies are often met with counter-demonstrations from anti-fascists and the riot police frequently intervene in the clashes.
Members of Atalante tend to cover their faces with bandanas to conceal their identity. But Raphäel Levesque - the group's leader and the frontman for skinhead band Légitime Violence - carries out his actions in the open.
After infiltrating the VICE News office last May, Levesque was charged with intimidation. Atalante did not answer the Montreal Gazette's request for comment Monday.
When Levesque appears in court on Aug. 16, Montréal Antifascist will show up to "send him a message."
"We expect that his little friends from Atalante will show up so we'll be there, too," said one of the protest's organizers. "The idea is to make sure they don't have a platform, that as much as possible they have zero space to spread their hateful ideas." ccurtis@postmedia.com twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text: A man and woman were attacked outside a Montreal bar late Saturday while trying to remove fascist propaganda from a street sign, witnesses say.
Jonathan Turcotte Summers said he was walking along Ontario St. that night when he saw a young couple who appeared to be shaken up.
"They seemed very agitated," Turcotte Summers said. "They just happened to see a sticker from a neo-fascist group and when they went to take it down, they were attacked.
"It was three men, two women ... they shoved one and then the other victim. Then they said that: 'If you take the sticker down we'll kill you.'"
A sticker from Atalante Québec depicts a quote from far-right author Dominique Wenner. It was removed by anti-fascist activists several hours after it went up last weekend.
No one called police and the assailants fled on foot. Tucotte Summers was not there at the time of the incident, but two witnesses confirmed his account of the events to the Montreal Gazette.
The stickers belong to Atalante Québec - an extreme-right group that stages anti-immigration rallies and boasts of its ties to the skinhead band Légitime Violence. Some of its posters refer to non-whites as "parasites" and to liberals as "traitors."
There is no evidence the attackers belong to either group.
Atalante is based in Quebec City, but its members have ramped up activities in Montreal this year. They ransacked the Montreal offices of VICE News( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-arrested-in-connection-with-right-wing-group-storming-vice-quebec-office ) in May to protest its coverage of extreme right movements.

On Saturday, about a dozen Atalante members pasted their lightning-bolt logo across the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. Within hours, members of Montréal Antifasciste went about removing the propaganda.
Sources say roughly 150 Atalante stickers showed up on street signs, bus shelters and lamp posts in the east end. "Postering" is a tactic in the long-standing turf war between the extreme right and its opponents in Canada, according to one expert.
"These turf battles were common in the 1990s," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "Back then you'd have Anti-Racist Action and the neo-Nazi Heritage Front duking it out for space on universities campuses and in cities across Canada.
"(The turf battle) was far more violent back then. There have been some recent incidents outside rallies in Quebec, for example, but in terms of fighting each other while postering, I haven't heard of anything happening in years."
Balgord's network monitors extreme-right-wing movements in Canada and says there has been a rise in Quebec-based hate groups in the past decade.
Atalante members "poster" as a way of initiating its members from the online world into taking real-life action, according to Balgord. Its Facebook following numbers about 5,900, but Atalante Québec's events rarely draw more than a few dozen young men.
On its Facebook page, Atalante describes itself as a Quebec "identitarian" community group. But Balgord and Maxime Fiset - of the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence - say it mainly exists to spread hateful ideology.
"Putting up posters or going for drinks at a bar is, at least, a real life activity that they use to try to legitimize the movement," Balgord said. "Of course it's also meant to radicalize young white men into the hate movement."
The right-wing group - whose slogans include "Quebec for Quebecers" and "Globalists go home" - hands out food to "Québécois" homeless people in an effort to soften its image. On Saturday, they handed out lunch bags in Montreal featuring their logo.
The group has marched alongside Soldiers of Odin, and some of its members have ties to far-right groups like Storm Alliance and La Meute. During rallies last spring and last summer, its members wore masks and demonstrated at the Lacolle border crossing to protest the arrival of asylum seekers from the United States.
Their rallies are often met with counter-demonstrations from anti-fascists and the riot police frequently intervene in the clashes.
Members of Atalante tend to cover their faces with bandanas to conceal their identity. But Raphäel Levesque - the group's leader and the frontman for skinhead band Légitime Violence - carries out his actions in the open.
After infiltrating the VICE News office last May, Levesque was charged with intimidation. Atalante did not answer the Montreal Gazette's request for comment Monday.
When Levesque appears in court on Aug. 16, Montréal Antifascist will show up to "send him a message."
"We expect that his little friends from Atalante will show up so we'll be there too," said one of the protest's organizers. "The idea is to make sure they don't have a platform, that as much as possible they have zero space to spread their hateful ideas."

Full text: It all happened so quickly, as automobile crashes do, right before the disbelieving eyes of Jermaine Robinson. In an instant, he knew there was only one thing to do: act. And do so without thinking.
"The odds of you seeing a car accident ... " the Alouettes' safety said this week. "Usually you drive past (one) and figure that looks bad. We saw the whole thing."
It was the afternoon of Sept. 3, 2017. Robinson was in the passenger seat. Behind the wheel was Brandon Peguese, a defensive lineman and his teammate on the Sioux Falls Storm of the Indoor Football League. They were en route to their day jobs, working as youth counsellors at a juvenile centre.
They were approaching an intersection, prepared to stop at the red light. Two other vehicles were travelling the other way and in opposite directions, driving on the green. One was going straight. The other attempted a turn. They might have both sped up. Instead, a crash occurred. One car ground to a halt in a parking lot, but the other, driven by Tami Crate, went directly into a light standard and burst into flames.
"She was in pretty bad shape because she was slumped over in the car," Robinson remembered. "She was knocked out, the seat belt still on her. The car was on fire. We're trying our best to pull her out, one by one. I'm trying to pull her out. He's trying to get the seat belt (unstrapped). We're taking turns, because ... we're trying to make sure we don't get hit with the flames."
It wasn't easy. The airbags had deployed on impact and the seat belt had her wedged in, but Robinson and Peguese, who plays for the Calgary Stampeders, had no time to hesitate. And they were concerned the car might explode.
"I just reacted. I didn't panic. It was instinct. Something took over," said Robinson, in his first season with Montreal.
Crate eventually was extricated, although she suffered a broken breastbone and three fractured ribs in the crash. At the hospital, according to a published report in the Argus Leader, family members were told Crate wasn't expected to survive. But, miraculously, she did.
Almost 11 months later, Robinson relives the act of valour as though it was a common occurrence, believing neither he nor Peguese did anything out of the ordinary. Robinson said, had he done nothing, it would have disturbed him indefinitely.
"That would have worried me more, that I had the opportunity to do something, or called 911," he said. "At that time, I didn't worry. We just wanted to get her out of the car. We didn't have time to think, we just reacted. We weren't thinking about the fire. To me, at the time, it didn't seem that bad.
"We go through life and just take, take, take. We never give back. You can give money. You can give a gift. But we never put our life on the line to give back or put ourselves in a situation where we might get harmed. That was my one time where it wasn't about me."
Montreal Alouettes' Jermaine Robinson and Tyquwan Glass defend against Winnipeg Blue Bombers' Darvin Adams during at Molson Stadium on June 22, 2018.
One month after the accident, Sioux Falls Fire Rescue bestowed Citizen Hero Awards on Robinson and Peguese. The mayor of the city also sent a letter of appreciation to the players. Crate presented both with worry stones, the word "courage" carved into them. Robinson said he keeps the memento in his wallet. He remains in occasional contact via social media with Crate.
Robinson vehemently denied the two players are heroes. Robinson, who lives in downtown Montreal, across the street from a fire station, said those are the true heroes because they're risking their lives on a daily basis.
"I did it one time," he said, shrugging. "They do it every day and put their life on the line. I did it one time in 20-something years.
"I didn't even feel I was doing something right. I was just doing what I thought I needed to do."
Robinson, 29, took a circuitous route to the Als. He has Canadian Football League experience with Ottawa and Hamilton but also spent three seasons with the Storm, where players receive barely more than $200 per game - provided their teams win. Per diem on the road is $20. The season runs from February until July, practices held at night so players can augment their income by working day jobs.
Robinson flew from South Dakota to Atlanta this spring, at his own expense, to attend a free-agent tryout camp staged by the Als. While the 6-foot-3, 205-pounder was invited to mini-camp and then cracked the roster out of training camp, he was recently released - only to be re-signed after Joe Burnett suffered a serious lower-body injury at Calgary last week.
Robinson remained in Montreal the brief time he was a free agent and was scheduled to return home to Pittsburgh the day after the game against the Stampeders.
"Everything's a lesson. That just reminded me how hard I worked to get back here," he said. "It reminded me ... don't think you've arrived or you're comfortable; keep working.
"This brought me back to life. It showed me I still love the game, even more."

Full text: Re: "Court says city must bury last bit of old river" (Montreal Gazette, July 11) The brook at Meadowbrook Golf Course is near and dear to my heart, both physically and emotionally.
The stream has been the tail-off of the storm sewer for at least the past 60 years and so far nobody (that I know of) has suffered at all, least of all the golfers who pass by there, who dip their hands in to retrieve golf balls, who (and I have seen it on one occasion) drive their golf carts into the stream.
It was certainly a happy home for a few duck families this spring and has provided nourishment for foxes and groundhogs all summer.

Montreal appeals court order to bury Meadowbrook stream

Full text: Montreal is appealing a ruling ordering it to bury a contaminated creek on the Meadowbrook Golf Club that is the last remnant of the St- Pierre River.
In an appeal presented in the Quebec Court of Appeal Wednesday, the city argues that Quebec Superior Court Judge Chantal Corriveau erred in her June 7 judgment( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/last-remnant-of-st-pierre-river-could-be-buried ) obliging it to turn the creek into a sewer within 18 months. It notes that Quebec's Environment Quality Act calls for integrated management of wetlands and bodies of water in keeping with the principles of sustainable development and requires authorities to prevent the loss of wetlands and bodies of water.
As part of a natural drainage basin, the brook "constitutes an important asset for which upgrading work is to be implemented," the city argues, adding that plans to rehabilitate part of the St-Pierre River are being studied and a master plan on drainage basins on the island of Montreal is underway.
Restoring the creek could be a key feature of a plan for rainwater management in an area stretching from the Blue Bonnets site at Décarie Blvd. and Jean-Talon St. to the Lachine Canal, including a possible green corridor from the Meadowbrook Golf Course to the canal, the appeal says.
"On the other hand, channelling the Meadowbrook creek into an underground storm sewer would result in lost opportunities to rehabilitate this sector, create new, green infrastructures downstream and allow an outlet for excess water that would relieve pressure on underground infrastructures," it says.
The winding, 200- metre creek on the 57- hectare golf course is "the last section of the former St-Pierre River that is still in existence," the city notes.
The golf course straddles Côte St-Luc and Montreal, but the creek flows above ground only on the Montreal side, since Côte St-Luc diverted its section into the sewer system decades ago.
Developer Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc., which owns the golf course, had sued Montreal, demanding that the creek be buried, describing it as nothing more than a ditch and an open- air sewer.
However, judge Corriveau ruled the creek is indeed a river, based on a study by the Quebec environment department confirming it is part of the former St-Pierre. Originating on Mount Royal, it flowed through present-day Snowdon, Côte St-Luc, Ville St-Pierre and St-Henri( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-the-archives-our-islands-lost-rivers ) - where it fed a lake on the site of the Turcot Yards - to Old Montreal. Explorer Samuel de Champlain described the river, then teeming with fish, when he explored Montreal in 1611.
The Meadowbrook creek is fed by a storm sewer in Côte St-Luc and disappears into a combined sewer in Montreal. Repeated studies have shown it is contaminated by fecal coliform bacteria originating in crossed sewer and storm-water pipes at as many as 218 addresses in Côte St-Luc and Montreal West.
In its appeal, the city argues the solution to the contamination is not turning the creek into a sewer but rather fixing the crossed connections.
Montreal had tried unsuccessfully to have the other two municipalities named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, since the contamination originates on their territory.
It also argues that the timetable set by Corriveau is not feasible. The judge ordered the city to apply to the provincial environment department for a permit to bury the river within four months, to clean up the contamination within 18 months and to decontaminate the former riverbed and banks within 24 months. That simply isn't enough time to get the jobs done, the city says.
Based on previous experience of correcting crossed sewer pipes in Kirkland, it would take at least two to five years to fix the crossed pipes in Côte St-Luc and Montreal West, not counting the time needed for further investigation, the city says.
It asked the appeal court for permission to present new evidence on a viable solution, on a realistic timetable, and on which contaminants are polluting the creek.
Even though Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific won the case, it is also appealing the ruling. In an appeal filed July 5, the developer asks the court to order the city to eliminate the creek whether or not the environment department gives its permission, and whether or not it is contaminated.
The appeal seeks to "modify the earlier judgment so that the order clearly forces the city to achieve a result that puts an end to any flow of water on the surface of the property of the appellant and that this obligation not be subject to any condition."
Since the creek is fed by a storm sewer, the city should be ordered to cut off the flow of water whatever the environment department decides, the appeal argues.
In September, Quebec Superior Court Judge rejected a $44- million lawsuit by Groupe Pacific against Montreal claiming that the city had engaged in a "disguised expropriation" to block a proposed 1,600-unit housing project on the Meadowbrook site.
Groupe Pacific was demanding $28.5 million for the value of the land, and another $15 million for lost potential profits. Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific, a subsidiary of Groupe Pacific, bought the land in 2006 for $3 million.
In 2015, the city of Montreal designated its portion of the Meadowbrook site as "large green space or recreational," marking a victory for conservationists who had battled for a quarter -century to preserve the site from development.
Co^te St- Luc zoned its portion of the site as recreational in 2000.

Full text: Re: "Court says city must bury last bit of old river" (Montreal Gazette, July 10) The fate of the last remaining piece of the St-Pierre River turns on the legal question of whether the brook that goes through Meadowbrook golf course is a river at all, or whether it's just a ditch fed by a storm sewer.
That very question shows just how far we've come in transforming our urban environment. Storm sewers are, of course, the city's underground rivers, pipes that were created to carry the water that once flowed above ground.
Our urban rivers were buried throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries out of fear there was no way to keep contaminants out of these waterways. Today we know better, and most modern sewage systems separate storm water from the industrial and household waste that has to be treated before going back into the environment. In principle, this should give cities the opportunity to bring the underground rivers back to the surface, creating more diverse urban environments for people and the other critters with whom we share the city.
To bury the Meadowbrook creek would not only mean losing an important piece of history and urban biodiversity, it would also signal a failure of urban planning and of the urban imagination.
The only reason the water needs to be buried is that Côte-St-Luc and Montreal West have failed to keep raw sewage out of the city's most important underground river, the St-Pierre. The problem is upstream, and burying the river would only be conceding to those municipalities'inability to get their s--together.

Cowboy Junkies explore personal politics on All That Reckoning

Full text: When listening to All That Reckoning, Cowboy Junkies'( http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/ ) first album in six years, it's hard not to survey political storm clouds. Vocalist Margo Timmins practically invites us to do so in the dread-laced When We Arrive: "Welcome to the age of dissolution ... everything unsure, everything unstable." But just as the Canadian quartet found widespread fame with a rare hush, even the collection's most overt protest songs eschew a megaphone.
"I didn't necessarily start writing the record in terms of the political or social climate," guitarist and songwriter Michael Timmins said during a backstage interview with sister Margo before a concert at Montreal's Corona Theatre in May. "It was more about an internal climate and internal politics - a personal reckoning, which then melded with a social reckoning. I began to notice these nice parallels between what's happening in the outside world and the inside world."
The gently ticking The Things We Do to Each Other alludes to the impossibility of stemming a tide of hatred. But, Margo said, "when I was singing that song, I wasn't thinking of it on a global level. I was thinking of it on an intimate level - the way we treat each other in our social situations. Then you start to think of the bigger issues."
Released on Friday, July 13, All That Reckoning isn't the first Junkies record in which intimate traumas fuse with politics; Early 21st Century Blues (2005) tapped into a global anxiety at the midpoint of the George W. Bush presidency. But while that album's topical anti-war sentiments were voiced mostly through subtle covers, giving the feel of a quality stopgap release, Michael Timmins's nuanced and questioning lyrics help make All That Reckoning as ambitious in its way as the Junkies' Nomad Series, a sequence of four themed albums released in a flush of activity from 2010 to 2012.
"I don't want to write a record just about what's happening outside today, because then in five years it becomes irrelevant. It has to have an internal dialogue, otherwise to me the songs don't last," Michael said. "Also, I want to make sure that any aspect of it from the social side, the political side, is not stating a hard viewpoint. We have lots of fans who I know would be on a very different side of the political spectrum than we are, especially in the States, and I feel it's necessary to get them into the conversation as well."
The new album's interior/exterior mirror is reflected in two versions of the title track - the first summoning the creeping unspoken dread of a relationship under attack from within, the second a serrated psychedelic surge brimming with anger.
"That's happened before: on Lay It Down (1996) we had two versions of Come Calling," Michael said, "one slow( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cb-ebRxfvM ), one fast( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxjVgVHCkmc ), basically."
"We can't make up our minds," Margo said with a laugh.
"Especially with this one, there seemed to be a reason for it, like bookends," Michael added. "It kind of fed into the title - the way we relate to each other, and the personal and the social - so it made sense in a high-concept way. But in a very basic way, we just liked the way both of them put the song across."
The radically different presentations of the track speak to the scope of one of the Junkies' most eclectic albums. From acoustic warmth to electric rage, all their strengths are here, with Margo Timmins continuing to display a striking ability to sound at once reassuring and battle-scarred. Rounded out by sibling Peter Timmins on drums and lifelong family friend Alan Anton on bass, the band is as uncommonly tight as ever, in personal and business terms as well as musical terms. Few other groups have maintained an unchanged lineup for more than three decades while cultivating such a devoted fan base and managing to keep the industry at arm's length.
"Thankfully, the four of us have always had the same attitude toward the business side of things," Margo said. "It's not the end-all - we don't have to sell tons of records and we don't have to get on every magazine. We've always been casual about that."
Even when they were on major labels from the late '80s to late '90s, the Junkies were gloriously insular. Their 1988 breakthrough The Trinity Session( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zufpr8BwY9U ) was remarkable for any number of reasons - from the single-microphone setup to its whispered holiness and intuitive folk/blues crawl - but they all had to do with an intimate bond.
"My son was listening to that the other day and I walked in," Michael said of the 30-year-old landmark. "I can see him listening to it in the same sense I think a lot of people listened to it back then: 'What is this? How was this made?' It's such an honest record, and I think we're back to that point again where people aren't making very honest records anymore. There are some very cool records, some really amazing records production-wise, but you don't hear stuff like that: Here it is. People playing together."
It was a once-in-a-lifetime album, "capturing some magical thing that happens on a specific day," he added.
"We often will be working on something new," Margo said, "or even old, and we'll play it and we look at each other and go, 'Well, we'll never do it like that again. That was the moment. And if the tape had been going, we would have caught it.' "
AT A GLANCE
All That Reckoning is released on Friday, July 13.

Full text: Despite the situation in which the Montreal Canadiens find themselves, one filled with uncertainty and a plethora of question marks, there are a few players who are primed for a breakout season in 2018-19.
Last season, we saw the perfect storm, including an endless stream of injuries, a complete meltdown on defence and multiple players who simply couldn't score despite an abundance of opportunities.
But just as good luck can't last forever, the same can be said about an incredible streak of bad luck. By taking a look at individual scoring chances in 2017-18, we can identify players who have the odds on their side when it comes to their projected output next season.
Artturi Lehkonen
Coming off an impressive 18-goal rookie season, Lehkonen's play was the epitome of frustration last year. No one can fault him for not trying hard enough, or giving up on the team. It was simply the case of a player enduring half a decade's worth of bad luck in one season. His shooting percentage was effectively cut in half.
But when we look a little closer at his numbers, Lehkonen's season showed some promise. Despite injuries and a frustrating lack of finish on quality opportunities Lehkonen, pro-rated to an 82-game season, scored 15 goals
More importantly, he was second on the team in individual scoring chances per 60 minutes of ice time, and almost produced the same amount of high-danger shots as Brendan Gallagher.
While Lehkonen was on the ice the Canadiens almost always controlled the play, which is illustrated by their 52.4-per-cent shot advantage, 52.6-per-cent scoring-chance advantage and 54.7-per-cent high-danger shot advantage.
Any way you cut it, those are excellent numbers, and when you combine them with his individual chances, it establishes Lehkonen as a player to watch next season.
Lehkonen is also a player who unanimously passes the eye test. His defensive prowess is undeniable and his work ethic is boundless.
Charles Hudon
In most cases, scoring 10 goals and adding 20 assists as a third-liner during a rookie campaign would be seen as a successful entry into the NHL. But last season, Hudon left a lot of points on the table.
The potential for more is quite evident, not only because he finished as a top-five scoring-chance producer on the team, but also owing to his evolving role.
He mostly played a shutdown role throughout the year, with the majority of his time spent on a line with veteran stalwart Tomas Plekanec.

That speaks to his ability to play a solid defensive game while chipping in offence whenever possible. Much like Lehkonen, Hudon is a tireless worker who leaves everything on the ice, which endeared him to his coaches at every level.
Given the way the Canadiens roster has shaken out this summer, there's a possibility that someone along the lines of Matthew Peca - who is more offensively inclined than Plekanec - or Jacob de la Rose might end up centring the third line. If that's the case, expect Hudon to start cashing in with more frequency on his impressive individual scoring-chance numbers.
His shooting percentage was only 4.9 per cent last year, which leaves a lot of room for improvement if a little luck goes his way.
Jake Evans
The 22-year-old forward is my dark-horse pick for a player to watch next season, although it's likely he'll start his professional career with the AHL's Laval Rocket rather than the Canadiens.
Evans had a very encouraging NCAA career with Notre Dame, increasing his productivity every season and culminating with Evans captaining the team to the Big Ten championship and landing on the first all-star team in the process.
And though scoring at just over a point-per-game pace might seem somewhat unimpressive - considering the league in which he was playing is traditionally much lower scoring than other development leagues - it's a very interesting amount of productivity.
When watching Evans play, there's nothing that particularly stands out in his skill set, but there are also no obvious deficiencies. Essentially he's a well-rounded player who has been heralded as incredibly smart by his coaches.
Given that he was a seventh-round pick (No. 207 overall in 2014), the fact that we're even discussing his professional hockey potential is already impressive.
Don't expect him to tear up the NHL next year, but don't be surprised if he establishes himself as one of the better players in Laval.

Montreal ordered to bury or divert contaminated last remnant of St-Pierre River

Full text: The owner of the Meadowbrook Golf Course has won a case in Quebec Superior Court ordering Montreal to bury a creek that is the last remnant of the St-Pierre River, which once wound its way from Mount Royal to Old Montreal.
But even though it won, developer Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc. is appealing the ruling to ensure that the Quebec environment department cannot block the judgment from being carried out.
Judge Chantal Corriveau ruled on June 7 that the city must apply for a permit from the Quebec environment department "to undertake work to put an end to all contamination by the Meadowbrook creek ... by covering it over, diverting it or other measures to stop the flow of contaminated water within four months of the present judgment and complete the work within 18 months."
The winding, 200-metre creek emerges from a storm sewer pipe at one end of the 57-hectare green space and disappears into a stone culvert at the other end.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific had sued the city, saying it is nothing but an open-air sewer and should be "capped" (diverted underground into a sewer).
But environmentalists say turning the last surviving section of the river into a sewer would cause a loss of biodiversity and destroy a rare and precious natural feature of the landscape.
"It's a historic river," said Louise Legault, director of Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook, pointing to a worldwide trend to revive lost urban rivers.
"A lot of cities now daylight rivers - they don't cover them," she said.
The group says the creek should be cleaned up, not buried, and is calling on Quebec environment minister Isabelle Melançon to refuse Montreal a permit for the work.
Melançon's press attaché, Anne-Hélène Couturier, said neither the environment minister nor her department would comment since the matter is before the courts.
The city of Montreal acknowledged during the court case that the creek is contaminated but said the cause of the problem is crossed sewer and wastewater pipes in Côte-St-Luc and Montreal West that are diverting household sewer waste into the storm sewer that flows into the creek. It claimed that the other two municipalities had not cooperated with its efforts to solve the problem.
However, Montreal was unsuccessful in convincing the court that Côte St-Luc and Montreal West should also be named as defendants in the case.
Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook demonstrated at Côte St-Luc city council meeting Monday night to ask that city to join Montreal in solving the contamination problem at the source so the river can be saved.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc. said in the lawsuit that it had been complaining to the city since 2012 that the creek is contaminated. In addition to eliminating the creek, the city should be forced to decontaminate the land around it, it argued.
The judge agreed - saying the city must clean the land around the creek to remove all traces of fecal coliforms and other contaminants within 24 months, as well as pay all legal costs.
In an appeal filed Thursday, Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific says it is filing in case the provincial environment department decides not to authorize Montreal to bury the river. It asks the court to "modify the earlier judgment in order that the order clearly forces the city to achieve a result that puts an end to any flow of water on the surface of the property of the appellant and that this obligation not be subject to any condition."
It also refers to the creek as a "ditch" and argues that Judge Corriveau erred in agreeing with an expert report by the environment department that it is a river. Since the creek is fed by a storm sewer, the city can simply cut off the flow of water and should be ordered to do so whatever the environment department decides, the appeal argues.
Daniel Green, co-president of the Société pour vaincre la pollution (SVP), said that if the environment department authorizes the city to bury the river, it would set a precedent that could result in the elimination of all the other remaining creeks on the island of Montreal, since most are also contaminated to varying degrees.
"That would be a loss of biodiversity," he said. "These creeks have fish. Ducks populate them. In some instances, beavers populate them."
Simply diverting the contamination underground, rather than fixing the problem by repairing the cross-connected sewer pipes, is a poor solution, Green said.
The lost rivers of Montreal.
The St-Pierre River once rambled through present-day Snowdon, Côte-St-Luc, Ville St-Pierre and St-Henri,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-the-archives-our-islands-lost-rivers ) where it fed a lake on the site of the Turcot Yards and continued on to Pointe à Callière, while another branch headed to Verdun and LaSalle. Samuel de Champlain described the river, then teeming with fish, when he explored Montreal in 1611.
Cross-connected sewer pipes have caused contamination in past years in Kirkland( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kirkland-citizens-association-launches-online-petition-over-crossed-sewer-pipes ), Pierrefonds-Roxboro( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pierrefonds-tackles-133-cases-of-cross-connected-pipes ) and Nuns' Island.
In September, Quebec Superior Court Judge rejected a $44-million lawsuit by Groupe Pacific( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/meadowbrook-developer-suing-city-for-46-million ) against Montreal over a proposed housing development on the Lachine side of the Meadowbrook Golf Course that failed to materialize.
Groupe Pacific was demanding $28.5 million for the value of the land, and another $15 million for lost potential profits.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific, a subsidiary of Groupe Pacific, bought the land in 2006 for $3 million, and later presented a plan to build a 1,600-unit residential complex named Petite Rivière.
In 2015, the city of Montreal designated its portion of the Meadowbrook site as "large green space or recreational,"( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-of-montreal-gives-meadowbrook-golf-course-a-green-designation ) marking a victory for conservationists who had battled for a quarter-century to protect the land from development.
The designation under the Montreal urban agglomeration's land use and development plan provides guidelines for future development.
Côte-St-Luc changed the zoning on its portion of the site to recreational in 2000.
Montreal West Mayor Beny Masella declined to comment on the ruling.
Côte St-Luc city councillor Dida Berku said: "We are studying the judgment and exploring our options."
"As we have just received the judgment, our legal department is currently analyzing it," said Youssef Amane, a spokesperson for Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.

But even though it won, developer Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc. is appealing the ruling to ensure that the Quebec environment department cannot block the judgment from being carried out.
Judge Chantal Corriveau ruled on June 7 that the city must apply for a permit from the Quebec environment department "to undertake work to put an end to all contamination by the Meadowbrook creek ... by covering it over, diverting it or other measures to stop the flow of contaminated water within four months of the present judgment and complete the work within 18 months."
The winding, 200-metre creek emerges from a storm sewer pipe at one end of the 57-acre green space and disappears into a stone culvert at the other end.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific had sued the city, saying it is nothing but an open-air sewer and should be "capped" (diverted underground into a sewer).
But environmentalists say turning the last surviving section of the river into a sewer would cause a loss of biodiversity and destroy a rare and precious natural feature of the landscape.
"It's a historic river," said Louise Legault, director of Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook, pointing to a worldwide trend to revive lost urban rivers.
"A lot of cities now daylight rivers - they don't cover them," she said.

The group says the creek should be cleaned up, not buried, and is calling on Quebec environment minister Isabelle Melançon to refuse Montreal a permit for the work.
Melançon's press attaché, Anne-Hélène Couturier, did not respond to questions from the Montreal Gazette.
The city of Montreal acknowledged during the court case that the creek is contaminated but said the cause of the problem is crossed sewer and wastewater pipes in Côte-St-Luc and Montreal West that are diverting household sewer waste into the storm sewer that flows into the creek. It claimed that the other two municipalities had not cooperated with its efforts to solve the problem.
However, Montreal was unsuccessful in convincing the court that Côte St-Luc and Montreal West should also be named as defendants in the case.
Les Amis du Parc Meadowbrook demonstrated at Côte St-Luc city council meeting Monday night to ask that city to join Montreal in solving the contamination problem at the source so the river can be saved.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific Inc. said in the lawsuit that it had been complaining to the city since 2012 that the creek is contaminated. In addition to eliminating the creek, the city should be forced to decontaminate the land around it, it argued.
The judge agreed - saying the city must clean the land around the creek to remove all traces of fecal coliforms and other contaminants within 24 months, as well as pay all legal costs.
In an appeal filed Thursday, Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific says it is filing in case the provincial environment department decides not to authorize Montreal to bury the river. It asks the court to "modify the earlier judgment in order that the order clearly forces the city to achieve a result that puts an end to any flow of water on the surface of the property of the appellant and that this obligation not be subject to any condition."
It also refers to the creek as a "ditch" and argues that Judge Corriveau erred in agreeing with an expert report by the environment department that it is a river. Since the creek is fed by a storm sewer, the city can simply cut off the flow of water and should be ordered to do so whatever the environment department decides, the appeal argues.
Daniel Green, co-president of the Société pour vaincre la pollution (SVP), said that if the environment department authorizes the city to bury the river, it would set a precedent that could result in the elimination of all the other remaining creeks on the island of Montreal, since most are also contaminated to varying degrees.
"That would be a loss of biodiversity," he said. "These creeks have fish. Ducks populate them. In some instances, beavers populate them."
Simply diverting the contamination underground, rather than fixing the problem by repairing the cross-connected sewer pipes, is a poor solution, Green said.

The St-Pierre River once rambled through present-day Snowdon, Côte-St-Luc, Ville St-Pierre and St-Henri,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/from-the-archives-our-islands-lost-rivers ) where it fed a lake on the site of the Turcot Yards and continued on to Pointe à Callière, while another branch headed to Verdun and LaSalle. Samuel de Champlain described the river, then teeming with fish, when he explored Montreal in 1611.
Cross-connected sewer pipes have caused contamination in past years in Kirkland( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/kirkland-citizens-association-launches-online-petition-over-crossed-sewer-pipes ), Pierrefonds-Roxboro( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pierrefonds-tackles-133-cases-of-cross-connected-pipes ) and Nuns' Island.
In September, Quebec Superior Court Judge rejected a $44-million lawsuit by Groupe Pacific( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/meadowbrook-developer-suing-city-for-46-million ) against Montreal over a proposed housing development on the Lachine side of the Meadowbrook Golf Course that failed to materialize.
Groupe Pacific was demanding $28.5 million for the value of the land, and another $15 million for lost potential profits.
Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific, a subsidiary of Groupe Pacific, bought the land in 2006 for $3 million, and later presented a plan to build a 1,600-unit residential complex named Petite Rivière.
In 2015, the city of Montreal designated its portion of the Meadowbrook site as "large green space or recreational,"( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-of-montreal-gives-meadowbrook-golf-course-a-green-designation ) marking a victory for conservationists who had battled for a quarter-century to protect the land from development.
The designation under the Montreal urban agglomeration's land use and development plan provides guidelines for future development.
Côte-St-Luc changed the zoning on its portion of the site to recreational in 2000.
Montreal West Mayor Beny Masella declined to comment on the ruling.
Côte St-Luc city councillor Dida Berku said: "We are studying the judgment and exploring our options."
"As we have just received the judgment, our legal department is currently analyzing it," said Youssef Amane, a spokesperson for Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.

Full text: Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Quebec's week-long heat wave contributed to 54 deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends )
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday morning, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department, explained that physicians and first responders who declare deaths look for one of two things when determining whether they're potentially heat-related. The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week. The majority of deaths, Kaiser said, have been cases of someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home. None of the 28 deaths have occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified.
Environment Canada lifted its week-old heat warning for the Montreal area early Friday. The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years. However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first. The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé. Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
Merchants at Jean-Talon Market decried a plan to replace part of a parking lot with an outdoor seating area( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jean-talon-merchants-oppose-plan-to-build-public-square-in-parking-lot )
The city announced a plan last month to permanently close Shamrock Ave. to cars and make it a place for people to walk and sit, with several seating areas, a picnic area and newly planted trees and plants. Construction on the project began last month and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. However, merchants are miffed that the pedestrianization of Shamrock will result in a new public sitting area near the market's Casgrain Ave. entrance. Lino Birri, whose stall is right near the planned square, said its construction will necessitate removing about 10 parking spots, some of which he uses regularly for deliveries, and others that are used by his customers. Birri, who employs 50 people at the market and another 100 in his fields around Montreal, said the city should be adding, not removing parking spaces to an area that's already difficult to access by car. Charles Gingras, the manager of Chez Louis, another longtime shop on the market's southern end, said the city has known for years that parking is a problem in the area but has not put in place any meaningful solutions. "For people who want to come and buy a lot of stuff, it's too complicated," Gingras said. Although the city recently built a 50-space indoor lot under the SAQ shop on the western side of the market, it doesn't help those with mobility issues because a promised elevator still has not been built - three years after the parking lot opened.
Montreal International Jazz Festival cancelled the remaining performances of SLAV on Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/jazz-fest-cancels-remaining-slav-performances?video_autoplay=true )
Billed as "a theatrical odyssey based on slave songs," the show had been accused of cultural appropriation and insensitivity. Its director, Robert Lepage, and star, Betty Bonifassi, are both white. A swiftly-organized protest on the first night of the run, Tuesday, June 26, set in motion a wave of reactions in the press and online. Social media exploded with debate on the topic. Two shows were cancelled last Friday after Bonifassi fractured her ankle. Two days turned into four, as Monday and Tuesday's performances were subsequently cancelled. But it was L.A. post-soul singer Moses Sumney's decision to pull out of the jazz fest and instead perform an off-festival show at La Sala Rossa, Tuesday night (which turned into two shows after the first one sold out), that may have been the tipping point. Tuesday afternoon, Sumney made public his letter to the jazz fest( http://mosessumney.tumblr.com/post/175516153503/i-recently-decided-to-pull-out-of-the-montreal ) explaining in detail why he would not be performing at the event. On Wednesday morning, an open letter of protest( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK2rgBhNjQSQy8LWtu7y9ClVGl_XFsv57A8FNIqZzuPjvHeg/viewform ) against the show was released, bearing over 1,500 signatures.
"Since the beginning of SLAV performances, the festival team has been shaken and strongly affected by all the comments received," the jazz fest said in a statement Wednesday. "We would like to apologize to those who were hurt. It was not our intention at all. For the Montreal International Jazz Festival, inclusion and reconciliation between communities are essential."Lepage said the move was a "direct blow to artistic freedom( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav )." Hours after his statement was released, the Parti Québécois threw its support behind Lepage, with leader Jean-François Lisée likening the cancellation to censorship and MNA Maka Kotto describing it as "intellectual terrorism."
Montreal Canadiens defenceman will be out until mid-December after knee surgery( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-shea-weber-out-until-mid-december-after-knee-surgery )
The Canadiens announced that Weber had arthroscopic surgery last month to repair a meniscal tear in his right knee and the veteran defenceman's recovery period is expected to be six months. Weber also had surgery in March to repair tendons in his left foot. The knee surgery was performed by Dr. Robert LaPrade, an orthopedic surgeon in Vail, Colo. Said Canadiens general manger Marc Bergevin in the team's news release: "We were very disappointed to learn that this knee injury will extend Shea's recovery period. Unfortunately, this is out of our control and we have to fully trust the medical group in these situations. We are confident that his recovery will go as scheduled and that Shea will return to action as soon as possible." Weber missed one game last season against the Minnesota Wild on Nov. 9 at the Bell Centre because of the knee injury. The other 54 games he missed were because of his foot injury. In the 26 games Weber played, he posted 6-10-16 totals and was minus-8 while averaging a team-high 25:21 of ice time.
Friday marked the five-year anniversary of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy( https://montrealgazette.com/news/lac-megantic-growing-up-after-a-tragedy )
For youth from Lac-Mégantic, where the train derailment and explosion killed 47, grief has been a formative experience. A recent study examined the impact of the fatal train derailment on young people in Lac-Mégantic. Although it draws some stark conclusions, one of its authors says the overall message is a hopeful one. Although 25 per cent of the children surveyed showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the rate among adults was 50 per cent, according to Danielle Maltais, a humanities professor at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. "These kids are incredibly resilient, and the adults in their lives have done a great job at caring for them in an impossible situation," Maltais said. The study, however, does hint at a link between the tragedy and self-harming behaviour. Some 39 per cent of teenage respondents said they had suicidal thoughts in the last year - roughly twice the provincial average. Twenty-one per cent of high school students seriously considered harming themselves. That's three times higher than the Quebec average. If they didn't lose a parent or a loved one, the youth in Lac-Mégantic lost their town square - a place that contained memories of St-Jean Baptiste celebrations in the park or trips to the ice cream parlour.

Josh Freed: Heat wave more evidence Montreal has a split personality

Full text: Welcome home after your weeklong holiday in Death Valley, Quebec, during the hottest, longest stretch of thermonuclear heat since 1946.
It was so muggy Thursday afternoon, you needed a straw to breathe, as if the air was a milkshake. It was so humid, birds were plummeting from the sky with heat stroke, squirrels were spontaneously bursting into flames - and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were spotted stuck in traffic on Décarie Blvd.
But looking back, we did learn a bit about ourselves and our times from the Great Heat Wave of 2018. Just look at:
Weather Wealth: The heat wave revealed an important new gap between haves and have-nots, as climate change increases - the haves can afford air conditioning, while the have-nots have nowhere to retreat from the heat.
Fortunately, that's the group the city targeted all week. Montreal police, firefighters and City Hall did a great job going door to door like anti-heat Swat teams - helping people in apartments-turned-saunas.
But it has me wondering: If this is our new climate, maybe landlords should be required to put air conditioners in every apartment, as an essential service - like heating. Is air conditioning a basic right in our new global warming world?
Until then, perhaps we should just share the air. My son left his apartment and moved back into our house's cooler climate - bringing a friend trapped in an apartment that felt like a furnace. So we took them in as weather refugees.
Maybe there should be a government program urging everyone to adopt-a-heat-refugee next time the temperature soars. I'd be happy to take in a few myself as long as they promise not to clean up anything in my messy office.
Weather tech: The city used weather technology well, issuing updated heat advisories, alerts and other emergency warnings.
But I'm not sure we were well served by our own personal addiction to weather technology. It's bad enough we spend all winter staring at our phone's weather apps obsessing over arctic cold fronts, the windchill factor or the latest polar vortex.
Now we're obsessed in summer, too. Last week almost everyone I met was glued to their phones having conversations like this: "Omigod! It's 35 degrees outside, but with the humidex and the UV factor it's actually 47 degrees - and with the "real feel" index it could be up to 80C!
"There's no way I'm stepping outside without sunblock 600 and a heat shield."
I think weather technology is part of the reason some Montreal municipalities cancelled Canada Day celebrations last Saturday, or postponed them to "fun days" later in the year.
Yes, I realize there were at least 28 heat-related deaths in Montreal in the past week, but these were largely vulnerable people stuck indoors - not outdoors at Canada Day events. Were municipalities anxious about legal risks? If so, why not just issue a warning: "Canada Day festivities will take place as usual, but a heat warning is in effect. Come celebrate at your own risk."
In fact, while I spent recent days working in my air-conditioned office, I lived a pretty normal week otherwise, biking or playing tennis late afternoons, when it was somewhat cooler. Why? Because I shut off my weather apps and refused to judge the weather until I had experienced it. It's hot enough out there at 30-plus degrees without having to worry that it "really feels" 15 degrees hotter.
I know this was a difficult week for many. But we complain about the cold from November through April, so when the heat arrives I think most people should take a break - unless they are an air conditioning have-not.
In addition, our weather apps should have restricted-use warnings like this: "Sorry Josh, you have consulted this app 49 times in the last 7 minutes. No further access permitted for the next 53 minutes." On the plus side, huge crowds turned out at the jazz fest every night, especially for Wednesday's mega-concert, where tens of thousands crammed up against each other. Amid all those sweating, breathing, screaming people, it did "really feel" seven degrees hotter than anywhere else.
Weather schizophrenia: The heat wave was more evidence that our city has a split personality - summer Montrealer and winter Montrealer - alter egos living opposite lives, because they reside in opposite climates.
Winter Montreal is a voracious eater who loves stews, steak, smoked meat and poutine - which summer Montrealer barely touches. Like many in last week's heat wave, I went vegetarian seeking salads, smoothies, iced coffee, iced tea and ice cream. I've lost five pounds on my Great Heat Wave of 2018 Diet, though I don't know whether that's from eating less, or just perspiring more. Whatever the reason, I suspect summer Montreal weighs 10,000,000 pounds less than winter Montreal. Meanwhile, enjoy the cooler air while it lasts. I hear an inverse summertime UV bombogenesis thundersnow tsunami solar blast heat storm is coming our way.
So duck and cover!

The week-long heat wave is now over, but the death toll in Quebec climbed to 54 on Friday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-warning-storm-watch-dropped-for-montreal-area-as-heat-wave-ends ). A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday morning, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. The majority of deaths involved someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home, said Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department.

Brace for a traffic nightmare centring on the Décarie Expressway in N.D.G.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/traffic-nightmares-forecast-for-decarie-expressway-in-n-d-g ) Starting Monday at 5 a.m., construction work on the Décarie Expressway and Highway 15 will force the closure of the Sherbrooke St. entrance to the Décarie Expressway northbound, and the exit leading to Sherbrooke St. off of the Décarie northbound. Drivers who usually exit there are being advised to take the Côte-St-Luc/Queen Mary exit, which is already heavily used. "This could be the worst," said Notre-Dame-de-Grâce city councillor Peter McQueen, which is saying a lot coming from a neighbourhood so negatively affected by the reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange it has spawned headlines like "Escape from N.D.G." But McQueen added a light at the end of the tunnel. The Sherbrooke St. entrance to the Décarie is expected to re-open in September. The Sherbrooke St. exit will reopen at the end of October. And the lane reductions are expected to be completed by November, said Transports Québec spokesman Martin Girard.

The Parti Québécois is backing director Robert Lepage following the cancellation of SLAV, his jazz fest show( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/robert-lepage-breaks-his-silence-on-jazz-fest-decision-to-muzzle-slav ). Lepage broke his silence over a decision by the Montreal International Jazz Festival to shut down his controversial production after just three performances, saying the move was a "direct blow to artistic freedom." Hours after his statement was released, the Parti Québécois threw its support behind Lepage, with leader Jean-François Lisée likening the cancellation to censorship and MNA Maka Kotto describing it as "intellectual terrorism." PQ MNA Pascal Bérubé called on Quebec Culture Minister Marie Montpetit to take a stand, saying the shuttering of the show sets "a precedent that will leave its mark on creators and artists." Friday afternoon, Montpetit weighed in, calling on Lepage and festival officials to begin a dialogue. "Freedom of expression and creation are fundamental elements in our society and should always be protected," she tweeted. "However, we can't control or judge the way people feel." The production, which features songs composed by slave cultures including black slaves in the United States, was criticized for having a mostly white cast and a white director. Protesters accused the show of appropriation of black culture.
Construction entrepreneur Antonio Accurso has filed a request to be released from a penitentiary while he appeals his conviction for his role in Laval's municipal corruption( https://montrealgazette.com/news/accurso-asks-for-release-while-he-appeals-laval-corruption-conviction ). Accurso, 66, received a four-year prison term for taking part in the system of collusion created by former Laval mayor Gilles Vaillancourt through which contracts were awarded, between 1996 and 2010, to dozens of companies before they were put to tender. Accurso's lawyer, Marc Labelle, said he expects to be able to argue for Accurso's release before the Quebec Court of Appeal in Montreal on Tuesday. As part of his arguments in his request to be released, Accurso states he wants to be free while he deals with his other legal woes, including two impaired driving-related cases he faces at the municipal courthouse in Deux-Montagnes, the city where he resides. In one case, that dates back to 2011, he is accused of driving while impaired. The other case, filed last year, alleges Accurso refused to submit to a breathalyzer test after being pulled over just before midnight on May 15, 2017.

Full text: Despite the much-needed cooler weather, public health officials were still on high alert Friday as the week-long heat wave that contributed to the deaths of 54 Quebecers comes to an end.
The new death toll, up from 33 the day before( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ), was confirmed by a press attaché for Lucie Charlebois, the provincial minister for public health.
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that, as of Friday afternoon, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat. The others occurred in the Eastern Townships (9), Mauricie (7), Montérégie (6), Quebec City/Chaudière-Appalaches (1), Lanaudière (1), Laurentians (1) and Laval (1).
Dr. David Kaiser, a specialist with the public health department, explained that physicians and first responders who declare deaths look for one of two things when determining whether they're potentially heat-related.
The first indicator would be someone presenting symptoms of heat stroke before death or an elevated body temperature. Deaths of those types, however, are less common, he said, counting for only one or two of the 28 deaths over the last week.
The majority of deaths, Kaiser said, have been cases of someone dying of an underlying conditions, such as diabetes, within a hot environment at home. None of the 28 deaths have occurred in hospitals or long-term care facilities, he specified.
Kaiser continued that the individuals who have died due to heat are identified in a variety of ways. Some deaths are discovered more quickly, after an individual does not come down from their room in a residence for breakfast, whereas others take longer, such as cases in which a person is socially isolated, he said.
Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and day-old storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday.
The temperature was expected to drop to 13 C overnight Friday.
The last time Montreal saw a seven-day heat wave with temperatures above 30 C was in 1973, according to meteorologist Alexandre Parent. He said extreme weather like this has a tendency to occur every 20 years.
However, the weather station at McGill University's downtown campus has never picked up more than five consecutive days of weather over 33 C in its 147 years of operation, making this heat wave a first.
The cumulative effect of the prolonged heat, during which humidex levels reached up to 40 C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, a spokesperson for Urgences-Santé.
Throughout the last week, the number of calls to emergency services jumped by about 30 per cent, Overhoff said, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
"Today, we're not expecting a decrease in the number of transports," Overhoff said.
Kaiser explained that is because it can take longer for someone who lives with a pre-existing condition to return to their regular temperature after several consecutive days in the extreme heat.
"Their body gradually just gets overwhelmed, so the heat stress just adds to the underlying disease," he said. "That will take a few days of more normal temperatures to get back to normal."
Santé Montréal director Mylène Drouin confirmed on Twitter that the city will be continuing its door-to-door checks on vulnerable residents.

Lac-Mégantic: Growing up after a tragedy

Author: Curtis, Christopher

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Ludovic Théberge tells people he's from Lac-Mégantic, it elicits an uncomfortable question.
"They'll ask you, 'Did you lose someone?' It's the first thing they want to know," said Théberge, a 20-year-old university student. "It's normal, I guess. But once the answer is no, they're just like 'Ah, okay! You didn't have to grieve.'
"I don't think I had some great sense of loss, but you often wonder if you are grieving or if you have grieved. Have I been moving too fast, and was this too big an experience to understand?"
Théberge was a high school senior when a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in downtown Lac-Mégantic five years ago.
He may not have been close friends with any of the 47 people killed on July 6, 2013, but Théberge lived through something most teenagers will never have to. For youth in Lac-Mégantic, grief has been a formative experience of their lives.
A recent study examined the impact of the fatal train derailment on young people in Lac-Mégantic. Although it draws some stark conclusions, one of its authors says the overall message is a hopeful one.
Although 25 per cent of the children surveyed showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the rate among adults was 50 per cent, according to Danielle Maltais, a humanities professor at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi.
"These kids are incredibly resilient, and the adults in their lives have done a great job at caring for them in an impossible situation," Maltais said.
The study, however, does hint at a link between the tragedy and self-harming behaviour. Some 39 per cent of teenage respondents said they had suicidal thoughts in the last year - roughly twice the provincial average.
Twenty-one per cent of high school students seriously considered harming themselves. That's three times higher than the Quebec average.
If they didn't lose a parent or a loved one, the youth in Lac-Mégantic lost their town square - a place that contained memories of St-Jean Baptiste celebrations in the park or trips to the ice cream parlour.
What Théberge remembers from that summer is a sense of powerlessness. He was on his way to bed when the train careened off the tracks and levelled downtown.
"I saw the lights flicker all around the house. I thought, 'Maybe there's a storm,'" said Théberge, now a journalism student at Université du Québec à Montréal. "The next morning, at 7 a.m., my uncle called in a panic. He wanted to know if I was okay. I had no idea what had happened."
Théberge stepped outside his parents' home in Nantes - a neighbouring village - and saw plumes of black smoke waft above the valley.
That day, he was supposed to work a three-hour shift at the local McDonald's. Instead, he worked nine hours without taking a break.
"Everyone did what they could to keep the town running in a crisis," Théberge said. "You learn a lot about your friends and neighbours in a situation like that."
Maryse Talbot was named principal of the local high school, Polyvalente Montignac, the day before the explosion. The school lost one of its youngest faculty members - math teacher Mathieu Pelletier. Talbot made it her mission to give teenagers like Théberge some sense of stability when classes finally resumed.
She told her staff that if teachers were ready to come back, mental health professionals would be on hand to help them through the transition.
"After what we went through that summer, none of us were in a place where we could care for an entire classroom," Talbot said. "But we had no choice. We had a job to do."
When the kids came back to school, they filled their social calendar with activities. About 50 per cent of the student body enrolled in a sport. Meanwhile, the theatre and improv club, music class and student government breathed life back into the building.
A collective sense of grief filled the halls, but Talbot said it was accompanied by raucous laughter and the sounds of hundreds of kids being kids.
"If there's a hard part about this sort of collective grief, it's that maybe you lost someone you know but someone else might have lost a mother or a sibling," Théberge said. "So you wonder if your sadness is valid; you wonder why you would ask for help when others are going through something so much worse.
"But people leaned on each other, they checked up on each other. It really did bring us closer together. There was a great tenderness with which people interacted."
Théberge, who now lives in Montreal, said he has had a fairly normal life in the five years since the tragedy. He thinks back to that summer when he visits his parents, but said it isn't something that haunts him.
"It hasn't been easy for everyone," Théberge said. "You'll probably read headlines like 'Mégantic is back on its feet' over the coming days, but that's an oversimplification.
"For a lot of people, it will never be the same. They'll carry that grief forever. Some of us have moved on, but some of us lost something or someone that simply can't be replaced."

Full text: Despite the much-needed cooler weather, public health officials are still on high alert Friday as the week-long heat wave that contributed to the deaths of 50 Quebecers comes to an end.
The new death toll, up from 33 the day before( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ), was confirmed by a press attaché for Lucie Charlebois, the provincial minister for public health.
A spokesperson for Santé Montréal confirmed that as of Friday morning, 28 deaths in the city may have been related to the extreme heat.
Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and day-old storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday.
The forecast for Friday calls for a high of 25C and a Humidex of 31C. The temperature is expected to drop to 13C Friday night.
The cumulative affect of the prolonged heat, during which Humidex levels reached up to 40C, may still impact residents, explained Stefan Overhoff, spokesperson for Urgences-santé.
"Today we're not expecting a decrease in the number of transports," Overhoff said.
Through the last week, Overhoff said, the number of calls jumped by about 30 per cent, from 1,000 calls a day to anywhere between 1,200 to 1,350 interventions.
"The level alert remains relatively high, even though the level of humidity has gone down."
Santé Montréal's director Mylène Drouin confirmed on Twitter that the city will be continuing its door-to-door checks on vulnerable residents.

Provincial authorities have thus far attributed at least 33 deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ) to the extreme heat, which at some points over the past week created Humidex factors in the mid 40s.
The forecast for Friday calls for a high of 25 C and a Humidex of 31 C. The temperature is expected to drop to 13 C Friday night.

Musical Under Fire; Slave Songs Sung By White Singers Sparkprotests Atmontreal Jazzfestival

Full text: The musical SLAV that premiered last week at the Montreal International Jazz Festival is billed as a "tribute to music as a tool for resilience and emancipation." But so far it has succeeded in highlighting art as an instrument of division, with protesters gathering outside shows, patrons entering under the protection of police and one festival performer this week cancelling his concert in protest.
SLAV has run into trouble because it is a show based on slave songs from the American South, conceived by a white director and singer and performed by a predominantly white cast.
The American singer Moses Sumney, who is black, announced on Twitter Monday night that he was pulling out of his festival concert, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night. Instead he chose to play two discounted shows at an off-festival Montreal venue.
Sumney called SLAV "hegemonic, appropriative and neo-imperialistic," in a letter to festival organizers announcing his cancellation, posted to his website Tuesday.
"The point you are missing is that there is no context in which white people performing black slave songs is OK. Especially not while they are dressed like poor field workers or cotton pickers. Especially not while they are directed by a white director and in a theatre charging loads of money," he wrote.
"This kind of black imitation is very reminiscent of blackface minstrel shows. The only thing missing is black paint." There had been rumblings of concern since the collaboration between theatre director Robert Lepage and singer Betty Bonifassi - both white - was announced last fall.
But it broke into the open at last week's premiere, with protesters gathering outside the Theatre du Nouveau Monde on Ste. Catherine St.
Bonifassi is the show's star, backed by a sixmember chorus, two of whom are black. At one point the chorus, wearing scarves in their hair and holding baskets, mime picking cotton. At another, Bonifassi plays the role of Harriet Tubman, the American abolitionist who was born into slavery.
In an open letter calling for the cancellation of the show, which had its run extended through July 14 after initial performances quickly sold out, local musicians, artists, academics and community organizers expressed "astonishment and disgust" at the use of slave songs.
"These slave songs were born out of the myriad types of violence established, perpetrated, and maintained by a white power structure," the letter says. "To now have that violence exploited for profit by white artists and producers both embodies and perpetuates the historical exploitation and marginalization of Black populations in Quebec and the world over." The storm of protest appears to have caught the festival off guard. Media spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. In a statement last Wednesday, following the initial protests, the festival defended the production and said it felt lucky to have it as part of its program.
"For 39 years, the festival has been synonymous with the global village, where there was neither race, sex nor religion and where all human beings were equal," the statement read. "This year is no exception." In a statement published on Facebook, Lepage and Bonifassi challenged the notion that their race disqualifies them from exploring the music of slaves.
"Do we have the right to tell these stories? Audience members will have the opportunity to decide after having seen the show," they wrote. "From our point of view, whether black or white, we all have a responsibility to look at the darkest episodes of our history and try to find some light in them." Bonifassi has been performing slave songs for years, and in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, she said her work comes from "a big heart" and detailed research. "I don't see colour; to me, it doesn't exist, physically or in music," she said.
This is not the first time a question of race has stirred controversy in the Quebec theatre world. In 2015, Montreal's Theatre du Rideau Vert was criticized for using a white actor in blackface to play the part of professional hockey player P.K. Subban in a year-end review.
The theatre's artistic director, Denise Filiatrault, was unapologetic. "I did not know that people were so crazy and petty," she said.
So far, there is no sign the jazz festival intends to bend either. But the show has been dark since June 29 after Bonifassi broke her ankle following a performance. According to the festival website, performances will resume Wednesday night.

So far, there is no sign the jazz festival intends to bend either. But the show has been dark since June 29 after Bonifassi broke her ankle following a performance. According to the festival website, performances will resume Wednesday night.

Stars Above: Summer offers best views of Mars in 15 years

Full text: With the nights shortest of the year, there are not too many hours left for stargazing, but they are filled with celestial happenings and seasonal stellar landmarks.
Look up after 10 p.m. any night in July and the famous Summer Triangle pattern formed by the bright stars Deneb, Altair and Vega rides low in the southeastern sky while the iconic Big Dipper dominates the high northwest sky. Face the south around 10 p.m. on a clear night and the S-shaped constellation Scorpius stretches up from the horizon. Pinning down the scorpion in the sky is its heart, represented by the bright orange star Antares. A red supergiant with a diameter about 830 times larger than our Sun, Antares shines 60,000 times brighter and is a distant 553 light-years away.
Not sure how to find Antares? On July 22 the Moon will be parked just above the bright star, making for a convenient guidepost.
If you have binoculars or a telescope, it's worth scanning this part of the sky, and even from light-polluted suburbs you can see the region is chock full of clusters and clouds of stars. That's because Scorpius lies in the same direction as the Milky Way core, making it one of the best panoramic stargazing tours of the summer.
In planetary action, you don't want to miss Mars since it will be at its biggest and brightest in our skies in 15 years. On July 27, the Red Planet will reach its closest approach to Earth as it orbits the Sun. Astronomers call it an opposition when the planet will be directly opposite the Sun in Earth's sky, so that Mars appears to rise in the east at sunset and set in the west at sunrise. By 1 a.m. local time it will appear high in the southern sky in the constellation Capricornus - the sea goat.
Mars makes a close pass by Earth every two years, but this month's cosmic geometry places Mars only 55 million kilometres from us, offering amazing views for skywatchers. It is nearly as close as its best encounter back in 2003 when it was the nearest to us in 60,000 years! It will only be 2 million km farther this time around - nothing an average skywatcher will notice.
With just the naked eye it will appear as an unusually bright orange-hued star rising in the east as darkness falls. It's amazing to think that despite being so far away we can still see its distinct colour due to the reddish iron-oxide-rich dust and sand that covers most of the surface. Normally if you have a telescope you can also catch sight of its bight white polar caps and the darker highlands and lighter-toned deserts. But NASA has recently confirmed that Mars is undergoing a global dust storm, so unless it dissipates in the next few weeks, it may obscure some of the finer surface features.
Adding to the cosmic spectacle, on the nights of July 26 and 27, just in time for its best performance, the Red Planet will pair up with the brilliant Moon. Both these celestial gems will be eye-catching, gliding together across the night sky.

Musical Under Fire; Slave Songs Sung By White Singers Spark Protests At Montreal Jazz Festival

Full text: The musical SLAV that premièred last week at the Montreal International Jazz Festival is billed as a "tribute to music as a tool for resilience and emancipation."
But so far it has succeeded in highlighting art as an instrument of division, with protesters gathering outside shows, patrons entering under the protection of police and one festival performer this week cancelling his concert in protest.
SLAV has run into trouble because it is a show based on slave songs from the American South, conceived by a white director and singer and performed by a predominantly white cast.
The American singer Moses Sumney, who is black, announced on Twitter Monday night that he was pulling out of his festival concert, which had been scheduled for Tuesday night. Instead he chose to play two discounted shows at an offfestival Montreal venue.
Sumney called SLAV "hegemonic, appropriative and neo-imperialistic," in a letter to festival organizers announcing his cancellation, posted to his website Tuesday.
"The point you are missing is that there is no context in which white people performing black slave songs is OK. Especially not while they are dressed like poor field workers or cotton pickers. Especially not while they are directed by a white director and in a theatre charging loads of money," he wrote.
"This kind of black imitation is very reminiscent of blackface minstrel shows. The only thing missing is black paint."
There had been rumblings of concern since the collaboration between theatre director Robert Lepage and singer Betty Bonifassi - both white - was announced last fall.
But it broke into the open at last week's première, with protesters gathering outside the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde on Ste. Catherine St.
Bonifassi is the show's star, backed by a sixmember chorus, two of whom are black. At one point the chorus, wearing scarves in their hair and holding baskets, mime picking cotton. At another, Bonifassi plays the role of Harriet Tubman, the American abolitionist who was born into slavery.
In an open letter calling for the cancellation of the show, which had its run extended through July 14 after initial performances quickly sold out, local musicians, artists, academics and community organizers expressed "astonishment and disgust" at the use of slave songs.
"These slave songs were born out of the myriad types of violence established, perpetrated, and maintained by a white power structure," the letter says. "To now have that violence exploited for profit by white artists and producers both embodies and perpetuates the historical exploitation and marginalization of Black populations in Quebec and the world over."
The storm of protest appears to have caught the festival off guard. Media spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. In a statement last Wednesday, following the initial protests, the festival defended the production and said it felt lucky to have it as part of its program.
"For 39 years, the festival has been synonymous with the global village, where there was neither race, sex nor religion and where all human beings were equal," the statement read. "This year is no exception."
In a statement published on Facebook, Lepage and Bonifassi challenged the notion that their race disqualifies them from exploring the music of slaves.
"Do we have the right to tell these stories? Audience members will have the opportunity to decide after having seen the show," they wrote. "From our point of view, whether black or white, we all have a responsibility to look at the darkest episodes of our history and try to find some light in them."
Bonifassi has been performing slave songs for years, and in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, she said her work comes from "a big heart" and detailed research. "I don't see colour; to me, it doesn't exist, physically or in music," she said.
This is not the first time a question of race has stirred controversy in the Quebec theatre world. In 2015, Montreal's Théâtre du Rideau Vert was criticized for using a white actor in blackface to play the part of professional hockey player P.K. Subban in a year-end review.
The theatre's artistic director, Denise Filiatrault, was unapologetic. "I did not know that people were so crazy and petty," she said.
So far, there is no sign the jazz festival intends to bend either. But the show has been dark since June 29 after Bonifassi broke her ankle following a performance. According to the festival website, performances will resume Wednesday night.

Thnx so much to all for the support around the MTL show! I'm very surprised. & no love lost towards the festival; I hope this can be a learning experience for us all. I'm getting LOTS of press requests but am not doing interviews right now as I didn't do this for media attention.

In an open letter calling for the cancellation of the show( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK2rgBhNjQSQy8LWtu7y9ClVGl_XFsv57A8FNIqZzuPjvHeg/viewform ), which had its run extended through July 14 after initial performances quickly sold out, local musicians, artists, academics and community organizers expressed "astonishment and disgust" at the use of slave songs.
"These slave songs were born out of the myriad types of violence established, perpetrated, and maintained by a white power structure," the letter says. "To now have that violence exploited for profit by white artists and producers both embodies and perpetuates the historical exploitation and marginalization of Black populations in Quebec and the world over."
Betty Bonifassi sings during the media preview of SLAV, a theatrical production that is part of the Montreal International Jazz Festival Tuesday June 26, 2018.
The storm of protest appears to have caught the festival off guard. Media spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. In a statement last Wednesday, following the initial protests, the festival defended the production and said it felt lucky to have it as part of its program.
"For 39 years, the festival has been synonymous with the global village, where there was neither race, sex nor religion and where all human beings were equal," the statement read. "This year is no exception."
In a statement published on Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/exmachina.ca/posts/1876730789045047 ), Lepage and Bonifassi challenged the notion that their race disqualifies them from exploring the music of slaves.
"Do we have the right to tell these stories? Audience members will have the opportunity to decide after having seen the show," they wrote. "From our point of view, whether black or white, we all have a responsibility to look at the darkest episodes of our history and try to find some light in them."
Bonifassi has been performing slave songs for years, and in an interview with the Montreal Gazette, she said her work comes from "a big heart" and detailed research. "I don't see colour; to me, it doesn't exist, physically or in music," she said.
This is not the first time a question of race has stirred controversy in the Quebec theatre world. In 2015, Montreal's Théâtre du Rideau Vert was criticized for using a white actor in blackface to play the part of professional hockey player P.K. Subban in a year-end review.
The theatre's artistic director, Denise Filiatrault, was unapologetic. "I did not know that people were so crazy and petty," she said.
So far, there is no sign the jazz festival intends to bend either. But the show has been dark since June 29 after Bonifassi broke her ankle following a performance. According to the festival website, performances will resume Wednesday night.

Full text: Ry Cooder (Théâtre Maisonneuve, Place des Arts)
The blues has taken on many forms over the decades. In the hands of Ry Cooder, who recently returned to his roots as an Americana explorer, it becomes something earthy and primordial. Following an opening set by his son Joachim (who returned as Cooder's drummer), the singer-guitarist sat on stage at Théâtre Maisonneuve, imbuing the politically-tinged songs of his new album Prodigal son with timeless depth.
Jean-Michel Blais (Maison symphonique de Montréal)
There has been no shortage of buzz around Quebec pianist Jean-Michel Blais over the past few years. And so a double bill with Icelandic multi-instrumentalist Ólafur Arnalds at the state-of-the-art Maison Symphonique on the first Friday night of jazz fest was entirely earned. Blais composes like he plays - with epic sweep and intuitive subtlety, like Yann Tiersen's Amélie Poulin soundtrack with a modern twist. Spoken word samples and subtle electronic touches lent dashes of mystery, the whole levitating to otherworldly dimensions.
Mélissa Laveaux (Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts)
Former Montrealer Mélissa Laveaux, now based in Paris, is a force to be reckoned with. She sings songs influenced by her Haitian heritage, yet they come out with a rock-soul-Caribbean twist. Her smoky voice bends and swerves with thrilling ease, while her electric guitar cuts through her lilting compositions. The resulting impression is of a vastly talented young artist fully in control of the disparate elements at her disposal.
Davina and the Vagabonds (Rio Tinto Stage)
In the 30-degree evening heat, Davina and the Vagabonds" New Orleans-tinged swinging sound was vintage jazz fest fun. The site was packed and the wildly diverse crowd was digging every minute. When she pulled out a fiery cover of Ain't That a Shame, standing still was not an option.
Boulevards (TD Stage)
"Bonjour y'all." Ten minutes into his show on the jazz fest main stage, Jamil Rashad was a hot, sweaty mess. The North Carolina funk revivalist was shimmying up a storm as he and his band plunged deep into the groove. The crowd stretched from de Maisonneuve down to Ste. Catherine St. on Place des Festivals, and the party was officially on.
The Montreal International Jazz Festival continues to July 7. For more info, visit montrealjazzfest.com( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/ )

Concordia's sexual misconduct task force calls for more education

Full text: A Concordia University task force set up in the wake of highly publicized complaints of chronic sexual misconduct by certain professors in the university's creative writing program has issued dozens of recommendations to try to ensure that such a toxic environment is not allowed to fester on campus in the future.
"I truly believe that this is an integral step in our continuous goal to foster an educational and working environment free from any form of sexual misconduct or sexual violence," said Concordia University president Alan Shepard in a statement released Tuesday.
Shepard announced the creation of the task force in January, after an essay( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-in-creative-writing-program-president ) was published online describing inappropriate conduct by several professors in the creative writing unit of the English department. That essay touched off a storm of online accounts by students and alumni of misconduct and sexual impropriety in that department.
Concordia responded by launching an external investigation into the climate of the English department by former Quebec Court of Appeal Judge Pierrette Rayle (which is ongoing), issuing guidelines( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-issues-guidelines-on-professor-student-relationships ) discouraging instructors from becoming romantically or sexually involved with students, and launching a task force to get feedback and make recommendations to improve on Concordia's policies and procedures.
The task force issued a 19-page report Tuesday. Recommendations are mainly focused on improving awareness among students, faculty and employees of the university's existing policies, procedures and resources.
The task force recommends the university create a dedicated web hub with information on sexual misconduct and sexual violence, including a clear, step-by-step guide for those wishing to file complaints or disclose improper behaviour. It also recommends the university re-examine all services that handle sexual violence complaints and ensure they are properly staffed. All members of the Concordia community should benefit from mandatory basic training on what sexual violence and misconduct is, how to file a sexual violence complaint, how to get support on campus and how to help a student who discloses a case of sexual misconduct or violence, the report recommends.
"We have a lot of things in place at the university to support people who have experienced sexual violence, but there is a big gap in terms of what the community knows and understands," said Concordia deputy provost Lisa Ostiguy, who chaired the task force.
"The take-away for me is that we have some work to do in terms of training, education and communicating our processes and making things much more clear to the members of the community. When people don't understand our processes or people have a misperception of what happens when they come forward with a complaint or how complaints are treated, I think it builds a mistrust and it makes people reluctant to come forward."
The task force report calls special attention to the issue of consensual intimate relationships between faculty members and students.
"Although the university cannot legally forbid consensual sexual or intimate relationships between faculty and adult students, the task force recommends that the university reiterate strongly to faculty and staff that such relationships are strongly discouraged," the report notes.
Initial reaction from student groups was positive, but there was concern that the task force recommendations do not go far enough to move Concordia toward a stronger, standalone policy on sexual violence.
Concordia's administration issued a sexual violence policy in 2016, which it considers to fit the definition of a "standalone" policy. Some student groups disagree.
Sophie Hough-Martin, general coordinator of the Concordia Student Union, points to the fact that the survey done by the task force revealed major shortcomings in how students' complaints are handled. Some reported nothing was done, there was no follow-up and they did not feel supported.
"Those are massive issues within the system, so you can point people to the system, but if you report (a complaint) and if there is nothing done or you are told that the existing policies can't do anything for you, then that doesn't address the issue."
"We commend the fact that Concordia is looking at creating a standing committee and mandatory training, (but) we are apprehensive about the fact that Concordia is focusing on the lack of communication of existing anti-sexual violence resources and policies," said Connor Spencer, director of mobilization for Our Turn, a national student-led organization working to end campus sexual violence.
That organization issued a report last year grading universities across Canada on their sexual violence policies and Concordia scored the lowest (52 per cent), mainly because it did not have a truly stand-alone policy on sexual violence.
"Before better communicating the existence of policies and resources, Concordia must make sure that they are the best they can be and that they will properly support folks who come forward."

Canadiens draft pick Cam Hillis is 'little engine that never stops'

Full text: Cam Hillis( http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectdetail.htm?cat=1&dpid=112011&sort=finalRank&year=2018 ) had plenty to celebrate on his 18th birthday Sunday after the Canadiens selected him in the third round of the NHL Draft.
"It's very special to have this dream come true," Hillis told reporters in Dallas after being drafted on Saturday.
When it was pointed out to Hillis by a reporter that he will now be of legal drinking age in Quebec when the Canadiens open their four-day evaluation camp Thursday in Brossard, Hillis smiled and said: "Yeah, that's true."
La Belle Province is familiar territory to Hillis since his family has a condo in Mont Tremblant, which they visit at least once a year. The Oshawa, Ont., native also speaks some French after going through a French-immersion program in school.
"It's a surreal feeling," he said about being drafted by the Canadiens. "You dream of this as a kid and to kind of finally experience it with friends and family it's second to none. You can't really describe it."
In 60 games with the OHL's Guelph Storm last season, Hillis posted 20-39-59 totals. He was ranked No. 67 among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting.
Hillis and the 10 other players selected by the Canadiens at the NHL Draft in Dallas will take part in the team's evaluation camp this week. Canadiens assistant general manager Trevor Timmins described Hillis as "the little engine that never stops." But Hillis, a centre who is listed at 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds, will have to make that engine bigger before he's ready to play in the NHL.
"I think maybe I can put on a couple of more inches and I definitely got to fill out a little more if I want to play at that next level," Hillis said.
"I rely on my hockey sense and my compete level every night, seeing the ice and making those little plays because I'm not the biggest player out there," he added. "I kind of have to think the game a little faster and play a lot harder. So that's definitely something I use to my advantage."
Said Timmins about Hillis: "This kid's driven. He has outstanding VO2. He never stops. ... He was a pure rookie in the OHL this year and ended up being the first-line centre for that Guelph team, who had a number of NHL drafted players on it. Made it to the Canadian national under-18 team at the end of the year. But he's a kid that never stops and he's got good hockey sense, so that's a good combination."
Merci @CanadiensMTL( https://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) for believing in me #Habs( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Habs?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/7cyjcClP1w( https://t.co/7cyjcClP1w )
- cam (@cam_hillis) June 24, 2018( https://twitter.com/cam_hillis/status/1010711653686628352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
Before joining the Storm, Hillis played for St. Andrews College - a private prep school in Aurora, Ont. - posting 37-62-99 totals in 73 games during the 2016-17 season. He said the part of his game that needs the most improvement is his skating.
"I've never really worked with a skating coach before and I'll be working with (former Canadian Olympic figure-skater) Barb Underhill two or three times a week this summer," Hillis said. "A guy I kind of watch is (the Canadiens') Brendan Gallagher and he's got that breakaway speed. He can kind of push off guys and create that gap for him, so that's definitely something I'm looking to kind of develop down the road. Obviously, I'm not the biggest guy out there so I kind of have to rely on my speed and smarts to play the game. So skating's going to be a huge aspect for me."
Timmins said he sees some similarities between Hillis and Gallagher.
"The way he competes, sure, yeah," the Canadiens' assistant GM said. "I wouldn't say (Hillis) is as physical, but he's as determined as Gallagher is."
Said Hillis about Gallagher: "I love his tenaciousness. That's kind of what I try to bring every night. I try to be the hardest-working player on the night every night. He's definitely a guy that does that, too. I see some similarities in our game. It would be pretty cool to meet the guy down the road."

Canadiens conclude NHL draft with a flurry of smallish centres

Full text: DALLAS - The Canadiens went all-in at centre at the 2018 NHL entry draft, but it will be at least a year before the picks pay a dividend at the NHL level.
The prize is Jesperi Kotkaniemi and the Habs went out on the limb to pick him with the third overall pick Friday.
"We hope Kotkaniemi plays in the NHL soon, but that's something that will sort itself out at training camp," said assistant general manager Trevor Timmins. "We're in this for the long haul and the goal is to develop players who are going to get better and help us make the playoffs consistently
The Canadiens continued to look at the middle as the draft concluded Saturday with Rounds 2 to 7. Montreal had 10 picks on the second day and six of them were centres. The one thing the picks had in common Saturday was that most of them are on the small side. Swede Jacob Olofsson, who was selected in the second round at No. 51, was the only centre on Day 2 who tops 6 feet.
Surprisingly, for a team that values defencemen, the Canadiens selected only two blueliners. They started the second round by picking Alexander Romanov, who is the definition of flying under the radar. There wasn't a single scouting analyst who had him higher than the fourth round, but the Canadiens picked him at No. 35.
Here's a look at players selected Saturday:
Jesse Ylonen (35th overall), 6-foot-1, 168 pounds, right wing. The son of former NHLer Juha Ylonen had 14 goals and 13 assists in 48 games with Espoo in the Mestis, the Finnish Second Division. One of the older players in the draft - he'll be 19 in October, he played against men and will move up to Lahti Pelicans jn the top-level Liiga next season. He's a good skater and has a good shot, but he needs to fill out his frame.
"He has the bloodlines and he has phenomenal quickness," Timmins said. "He makes plays at high speed. He has a lot of potential and room for growth both physically and as a hockey player.
Alexander Romanov (38th overall) 5-foot-11, 185 pounds, defenceman. This pick came out of left field. Romanov, who plays for the CKSA junior team, was ranked No. 115 among European skaters by the Central Scouting Bureau. A two-way defenceman, he said he expected to go late in the second round or early in the third. The Canadiens interviewed him in Stockholm. He has two years remaining on his contract in Russia and expects to move up to the KHL next season. He plans to come to North America when his contract expires.
"He's going to remind you a little of (Alexei) Emelin, but with a ton of energy," Timmins said. "He already plays like a pro. He plays the game fast. He moves puck quickly. We wanted a left-shot defenceman and we stepped up to take him."
Jacob Olofsson (51st overall) 6-foot-2, 190 pounds, centre. Olofsson is a responsible two-way centre and represents a safe choice. There are few weaknesses in his game, but there are also no aspects of his game that stand out. He has good size and scored 10 goals and 21 points to help Timra earn promotion to the Swedish Elite League last season.
Cam Hillis (67th overall) 5-foot-11, 168 pounds, centre. Being drafted by the Canadiens was an early birthday present for Hillis, who turned 18 on Sunday. The undersized centre said he wasn't surprised Montreal drafted him because they had a number of interviews and they have a shared philosophy. He prides himself on his work ethic and he patterns his game on Brendan Gallagher. "I can be a real pain in the butt, a pest," Hillis said. He had 20 goals and 59 points in 60 games with the Guelph Storm in his first season of major junior.
"Hills is 5-foot-10, but he plays like he's 6-foot-4," Timmins said. "He has an engine that never stops. He was a rookie and he ended up as the first-line centre on a Guelph team which had quite a few players drafted."
Jordan Harris (71st overall) 5-foot-11, 180-pounds, defenceman. A new-wave defenceman who moves the puck well, Harris figures to be a long-term project. He's coming out of a low-profile prep school program at Kimball Union and will enrol at Boston's Northeastern University in the fall. He says earning a degree is important and he also needs time to get stronger. He said he will probably spend four years in college unless the Canadiens feel he's ready to make a jump to pro hockey. He said Chicago's Duncan Keith in his role model.
DALLAS, TX - JUNE 23: Jordan Harris reacts after being selected 71st overall by the Montreal Canadiens during the 2018 NHL Draft at American Airlines Center on June 23, 2018 in Dallas, Texas.
"We wanted an offensive defenceman, a dynamic skater and he was available," Timmins said. "We like his upside and he'll have four years to develop."
Allan McShane (97th overall) 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, centre. Another smallish centre, McShane averaged nearly point a game with the Oshawa Generals, collecting 20 goals and 65 points in 67 games. He's an excellent skater and he sees the ice well, but there are concerns he spends too much time on the perimeter.
Jack Gorniak (123rd overall) 5-foot-11, 180 pounds, left wing. Gorniak said his stock in trade in his speed and his role models are Gallagher for his tenaciousness and Brayden Point for his speed. He played high school hockey close to home in Wisconsin and has enrolled at the University of Wisconsin. He scored 28 goals and 56 points in 24 high school games. He said the Canadiens scouted him extensively in high school and his stock went up with a strong performance at the combine in Buffalo. He has an accurate shot, but he needs to work on his velocity.
"He's another guy with speed and he's going to a good program with good coaches," Timmins said.

Cole Fonstad (128th overall) 5-foot-10, 159 pounds, left wing/centre. A speedy, creative player, Fonstad's biggest drawback in his lack of size. He had a breakthrough this past season with 22 goals and 73 points in 72 games with the Prince Albert Raiders. The big question is how much of that offence resulted from playing with Winnipeg Jets draft choice Jordan Stallard. Fonstad was a fifth overall choice in the WHL draft as a centre and he may get another look at that position with Stallard moving into the pro ranks.
"He's been playing left wing, but he's been a centre all his life," Timmins said. "It's good to have that versatility. You can always take a centre and put him on the wing, but you can't put a winger at centre."
Samuel Houde (132nd overall) 6-foot, 161 pounds, centre. A first-round draft pick in the QMJHL, Houde is a smart player, but he needs to bulk up. He had underwhelming numbers in Chicoutimi with 16 goals and 32 points in 54 games.
Brett Stapley (190th overall) 5-foot-10, 170 pounds, centre/right wing. The Canadiens traded to get this pick from Philadelphia and the 19-year-old Stapley is another long-term project. He's been scoring at a point-a-game pace the past two seasons for the Vernon Vipers in the BCHL. He'll go to the University of Denver to add some strength.
"We've had him at two combines and we think the world of him," Timmins said. "He's a smaller player and he's been a bit under the radar."
The Canadiens made several trades where they moved down and picked up fourth- and fifth-round draft choices next year.

Montreal's Red Roof homeless shelter facing shutdown as funds dry up

Full text: One of Montreal's longest-running homeless shelters is in dire straits.
Donations have dried up and so too has government funding. As it stands, St-Michael's Mission( https://www.stmichaelsmissionmtl.org/ ) barely has enough cash on hand to cover rent and payroll for the seven employees who keep the place running.
"We're living hand to mouth right now," says George Greene, the shelter's executive director. "It's not clear how much longer we can keep going."
Greene says St. Michael's - also known as the Red Roof - has been hit with a perfect storm. Exceptionally cold weather forced the downtown day shelter to stay open overnight through much of the winter so homeless men and women wouldn't freeze to death on the streets.
A few weeks back, two of the mission's biggest donors pulled $100,000 in funding. Meanwhile, the Quebec government is diverting grants to "housing first" initiatives.
The Red Roof gets its name from the roof of the Church of St-John the Evangelist that houses it on President-Kennedy Ave.
Last year, the provincial government set aside $11 million to get homeless people off the streets and into low-cost apartments in Montreal, Quebec City and the Montérégie region.
The Public Health Ministry says the goal is to get 1,000 people into homes and says it's hit about 85 per cent of that target.
Much of that funding goes to programs run by larger shelters like the Old Brewery Mission and the Welcome Hall Mission - leaving places like the Red Roof out in the cold.
Greene said the Red Roof could very well close its doors this summer after nearly 90 years of service to downtown Montreal.
That could be disastrous for Charlie Nuktie.
At 63, Nuktie is getting a bit old for the street life. Three years ago, a stroke left him with paralysis in his left leg and he needs a walker to get around.
Nuktie sleeps on the concrete steps outside St-Michael's most nights.
"I'm not as tough as I used to be but I'm still here," says Nuktie, a retired electrician who struggles with alcohol addiction. "And I'll still be here tomorrow."
When he rises every morning, he can count on the Red Roof for a warm shower, a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of tea. He'll sit in the cafeteria, read the newspaper and catch up on the neighbourhood gossip with any one of the dozens of homeless men and women who frequent the centre.
"It feels like home," says Nuktie. "They know me and I know them."
The people who flock to the downtown mission do so because of this personal touch. When Greene spotted Nuktie smoking a cigarette across from the Place des Arts métro earlier this week, he noticed something was off.
Nuktie's walker is so short, the elderly man has to hunch over just to lean on it.
"We're getting you a new walker today," says Greene. "You can't go on like this, Charlie."
George Greene, who runs the Red Roof, chats with worker Mateo Pablo in the clothing storage room.
Despite the presence of housing programs and shelters that can give people like Nuktie a warm bed every night, thousands chose to sleep on the streets every night in Montreal.
For safety reasons, overnight shelters don't allow people to show up intoxicated. And there have been problems with elderly, more vulnerable people having their personal effects stolen as they sleep.
Whatever the reason, many chose to take their chances on the streets and use shelters like the Red Roof during the day. In St-Michael's case, their clientele includes roughly 40 homeless men and women and they serve about 250 meals per day.
Nearly half of its clients are Indigenous and many among them are survivors of the residential school system.
But earlier this week at a general assembly, Greene broke the news to his volunteers workers and donors that their work may all be coming to an end.
It's difficult to overstate how attached Greene is to the centre.
He still keeps a photo of Kimberly Gloade on his desk. Gloade, who was a regular at the Red Roof, died of cirrhosis two years ago after being turned away at the McGill University Health Centre's Glen Site( http://montrealgazette.com/feature/the-life-and-death-of-kimberly-gloade ).
The shelter held a vigil in her honour that winter and Greene says her death still haunts him.
"I can't picture my life without the Red Roof, I can't picture it without people like Charlie or Kim (Gloade) in it," says Greene. "We're a family and I know I'll keep fighting for that family."

Four Montreal softball parks that will scare the hell out of you

Full text: In light of recent news that the Projet Montréal administration will close a popular softball field in Jeanne-Mance Park( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-says-its-too-risky-to-reopen-softball-field-in-jeanne-mance-park ) over "safety concerns," here's an (incomplete) list of Montreal's most dangerous ball parks.
Editor's note: I compiled this over seven seasons spent slumming it in the city's co-ed beer leagues. Some of these observations may reflect my own biases as a hopeless left-fielder who plays in dangerously low-cut jean shorts.
1. Kent Park - 3220 Appleton Ave., Montreal
I'm not kidding when I say this may be the scariest softball field in Montreal. On a hot summer night, Kent is swarming with hordes of sugar-crazed children, each one bolder than the next.
The kids in Côte-des-Neiges like to play a little game I call "storm the outfield." Their goal, it seems, is to get beaned in the head and score themselves a free ambulance ride.
I swear the median age in that neighbourhood must be six. If you drop your guard for a moment, the children will leave the adjacent water park and invade the playing surface like viking conquerors.
Picture Lord of the Flies but with splash pads and terrified, overweight middle-aged dudes panic-drinking cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Other than harbouring the constant fear that you may maim a small child, I'd say your softball experience at Kent will generally be a good one.
2. Le Ber Park - Ash Ave., Montreal
There's a storm drain hidden somewhere in the outfield, and if you happen to plant your cleats in it while running... say goodbye to your foot. Your body will continue its forward trajectory while the ligaments that hold your leg in place will burst open like a soggy watermelon hitting the pavement.
Think of it as playing softball with a bear trap cleverly hidden in the grass. You know it's there because it nearly ensnared you a few weeks back, but you forgot to make a note of where it is.
For some people, the prospect of being injured in a co-ed beer league ball game is a turn off, but I like to think it adds a layer of strategy to the game.
"Aim for left field, Karen, and make them pay for their misguided bravery."
As an added fear-factor bonus, the park is located next to a regulation-size football field where teams practice during rec league games. Have you ever chased down a fly ball and accidentally wandered into a game of tackle football? It's invigorating!
3. Clifford Park - 7001 Blvd. de la Vérendrye, Montreal
Whoever engineered the lighting system at this park surely has a cruel sense of humour. Instead of crisp, white beams that illuminate the field, the lights at Cliff Park cloud the sky with a yellow fog.
If someone hits a pop fly, you will lose track of the ball for a few moments as it disappears into the mustard-tinted night. Of course by the time you've found the damn thing again, it's headed straight for your teeth.
For some reason - and this is a very specific complaint - there's a local dog owner who insists on having the mule-sized beast run onto the field and "do his business" during league play. Does he pick up the dog's excrement? Of course he doesn't.
If you thought the storm drain was bad, try fielding with the knowledge that somewhere in the grass is a steaming pile of manure waiting for you.
4. Angrignon Park - 3400 Blvd. des Trinitaires, Montreal
Have you ever wondered what would happen if you crushed a home run out of the park only to see the ball smash into a moving city bus? Well if you play at Angrignon, you may find out what happens next.
Spoiler alert: the driver had a bad day, and he's not going to take your s*** much longer. It isn't that the outfield is too short, it's that it leads into one of the busiest arteries in LaSalle.
For some reason, every team in our league has at least one batter intent on proving he could have played in the majors if coach had just given him that one chance. So buddy cracks one over the fence, past a row of parked cars and into traffic.
And did you say rock-hard infield? If you happen to slide to second or third base, the skin on your calf will peel off like batter from a fried chicken wing. Sweet Jesus it hurts!

Retroactive fund to help Montreal retailers cope with construction

Full text: Merchants affected by roadwork projects will be eligible for up to $30,000 per year under a new policy to help Montreal's struggling retail arteries.
The city is creating a $25-million fund to compensate retailers coping with construction, Mayor Valérie Plante announced Wednesday.
The aid is part of a four-year, $74-million program to assist on-street stores facing a "perfect storm"( http://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/retail/montreal-retail-industry-facing-perfect-storm-new-report-warns ) of competition from online shopping, rising taxes, skyrocketing rents and an unprecedented level of road construction that hinders shopping.
"The action plan that we are unveiling today is historic. For the first time, Montreal is recognizing storefront businesses as essential social links in the urban environment and as a priority for the metropolitan economy," Plante said at a press conference on St-Denis St.
Merchants on St-Denis who endured 10 months of roadwork in 2016 are still eligible for aid, she noted, since the program for stores affected by construction is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2016.
The city plans to approve a bylaw in late summer and retailers will be able to apply for aid starting in the fall. To be eligible, the construction projects must have lasted at least six months and merchants must be able to demonstrate the work caused them to lose business.
Infrastructure repairs aren't the only problem the retail sector - which employs 112,000 people, nearly one in 10 of all jobs on the island of Montreal - is facing these days, according to a report released Monday by a committee of experts Plante created in March, under the leadership of Guy Cormier, president and CEO of Mouvement Desjardins.
"Business on our commercial arteries is going through profound transformations to which retailers must adapt, in particular in changing their business model," the mayor noted.
The action plan for 2018-2022 also includes measures to enhance the city's nightlife, beautify shopping streets and encourage short-term rentals in vacant storefronts rather than leaving them empty.
Plante also announced plans for a permanent committee on retail, to include both businesspeople and experts, to advise the city. The mandate of the PME MTL( https://pmemtl.com/en ) network, which provides advice and financing to entrepreneurs, will also be widened to include help for retailers and specialized expertise on attracting and retaining local businesses, she said.
Cormier's committee also recommended decreasing the tax burden on merchants by reducing the gap between residential and non-residential property tax rates, lowering rates on the first $500,000 of evaluation and allowing merchants to pay their taxes in six instalments.
Plante provided no specifics on how the city will follow up on those points, but said the city will "work to reduce the fiscal burden on merchants" and streamline paperwork to make it easier for them to navigate municipal bureaucracy and apply for assistance.
The mayor said the city will follow in the steps of Paris, Lyon, London and New York by creating a nightlife policy, which was one of her campaign promises.
"The nightlife policy will help protect cultural venues for arts and entertainment and alternative theatre venues, as well as boosting our commercial arteries," she said.
Léopold Turgeon, the president and director of the Conseil québécois du commerce de détail, warmly praised the policy as long-awaited recognition of the importance of retailing, which he said accounts for one dollar out of three in the Quebec economy and pays one-third of municipal property taxes.
"For us, it's really a historic moment," he said, thanking the city administration and Cormier's committee "for presenting encouraging perspectives for the commercial development of Montreal."
However, the municipal opposition blasted the plan for lacking specifics on reducing the tax burden on retailers.
"Ask any Montreal merchant what is his main concern: he'll tell you taxes are too high," said Ensemble Montreal Leader Lionel Perez, noting that the city raised non-residential taxes by three per cent this year.

Full text: Montreal is getting off with a warning - or more accurately, without a warning - as severe storms sweep across parts of the province, bringing with them the possibility of hail, strong winds and flooding.
Quebec City has been put under storm surge and coastal flooding warnings by three federal agencies: Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Meteorological Service of Canada and Environment Canada.
Strong winds and high tides could cause coastal erosion, the warning says: "People close to the shoreline should stay on the lookout for worsening conditions."
To the west of us, Environment Canada has issued severe thunderstorm watches that stretch from Témiscamingue to Gatineau.
People in those areas can expect hail, strong wind and heavy rain. Alarmingly, "boaters may be surprised by strong gusts on smaller bodies of water," the warning says.
Meanwhile in Montreal, thundershowers could begin any time this afternoon. Rain is in the forecast till Thursday, and Friday and Saturday should be hot and sunny.

Full text: Montreal is getting off with a warning - or more accurately, without a warning - as severe storms sweep across parts of the province, bringing with them the possibility of hail, strong winds and flooding.
Quebec City has been put under storm surge and coastal flooding warnings by three federal agencies: Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Meteorological Service of Canada and Environment Canada.
Strong winds and high tides could cause coastal erosion, the warning says: "People close to the shoreline should stay on the lookout for worsening conditions."
To the west of us, Environment Canada has issued severe thunderstorm watches that stretch from Témiscamingue to Gatineau.
People in those areas can expect hail, strong wind and heavy rain. Alarmingly, "boaters may be surprised by strong gusts on smaller bodies of water," the warning says.
Meanwhile in Montreal, thundershowers could begin any time this afternoon. Rain is in the forecast till Thursday, and Friday and Saturday should be hot and sunny.

Full text: Merchants affected by roadwork projects will be eligible for up to $30,000 per year under a new policy to help Montreal's struggling retail arteries.
The city is creating a $25-million fund for retailers coping with construction, Mayor Valérie Plante announced Wednesday.
The aid - which applies retroactively to Jan. 1, 2016 - is part of a four-year, $74-million program to assist commercial arteries, facing a "perfect storm"( http://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/retail/montreal-retail-industry-facing-perfect-storm-new-report-warns ) of competition from online shopping, rising taxes, skyrocketing rents and an unprecedented level of road construction that hinders shopping.
This story will be updated.

Alouettes OT Xavier Fulton takes mistaken release in stride

Author: Zurkowsky, Herb

Full text: Xavier Fulton slept in Sunday morning and said he doesn't own a cellphone.
The Alouettes' offensive-tackle was unaware of the temporary storm created on social media when he was released because his name was "mistakenly included" in a release of transactions the team dispatched. But his wife fielded a flood of calls.
"I'll be honest, I missed a good portion of all that craziness," he said following Monday's practice, laughing. "That's the nature of this business. When that time comes, it comes. But as long as I'm here, I'm going to give everything I have. Make sure I'm on top of my game."
When the Als legitimately released left offensive-tackle Jovan Olafioye on the day before training camp last month, and then Fulton, who has been practicing with the starting offence most of training camp, it raised eyebrows.
For the record, general manager Kavis Reed on Monday said it was a clerical error that won't happen again and shouldn't have occurred. He and the organization apologized to Fulton.
Offensive-tackle Xavier Fulton.
The 6-foot-5, 287-pound Fulton is expected to protect the blind side of first-string quarterback Drew Willy Saturday night, when the Als launch their regular season at Vancouver. But nothing's set in stone. Indeed, the team utilized numerous combinations up front on Monday, still seeking the strongest five-man unit.
Potentially hampering the decision is right-guard Ryan Bomben recovering from a broken right hand and working with a cast, making his status questionable. Head coach Mike Sherman said the line remains a work in progress.
"It's tough to play with a cast on the offensive line," Sherman said. "You use that hand as a guide hand a lot of times. You're not holding, but the extension of your fingers braces you a bit. That'll be a challenge, but I've had players play with casts before."
Willy, who played the entire first half on Saturday against Hamilton, as well as one series of the third quarter, was sacked twice. Fulton didn't have his best game and, on one play, was driven back into Willy by defensive-end Adrian Tracy.
"My footing was all over the place," admitted the 31-year-old, a seven-year Canadian Football League veteran who has played for Saskatchewan and the Tiger-Cats. "It wasn't pretty, but I knew where I was going. It was just getting there. It seemed like I was getting in my own way a lot.
"I'm penciled into the (left-tackle) spot. I've played this game for a long time. Maybe I've lost a step or two in some ways, but my game wisdom has allowed me to maintain that level of game speed and intensity."
Willy, who was under pressure despite the Ticats leaving a number of their starters at home, predictably said he believes the line will come together.
"We'll get it figured out," he said. "They want to keep me protected. I know the effort's going to be there. I know they're going to fight to the end for me."
It behooves the Als to keep Willy healthy and upright. His backup, Matt Shiltz, has a muscular problem in his lower back and is expected to miss two games. That means Antonio Pipkin, a rookie who briefly played in the last 2017 regular-season game, becomes Willy's understudy.
In other news, veteran rush-end John Bowman was limited on Monday due to an ankle injury. The Als still are hopeful he'll play against the Lions.
Defensive-back Greg Henderson, who played 11 games last season for Montreal, has been released along with defensive-tackle Alan-Michael Cash and receiver Jamal Robinson, who was acquired from Hamilton along with Bomben. Cash might resurface on the practice roster in the future.

Montreal retail industry facing "perfect storm," new report warns

Author: Bruemmer, Ren

Full text: There are roughly 7,700 retail stores on the island of Montreal employing 112,000 people, which account for nearly one in 10 of all jobs in the agglomeration. With restaurant and bars factored in, the total number of employees is 189,000. That number has remained relatively stable since 2011.
Yet the retail industry in Montreal is facing a "perfect storm" of factors putting its future at risk, a new report commissioned by the city of Montreal states. More individuals are buying online. Owners and renters are being hit by rapid and repeated hikes in their valuations, driving up taxes and rents. More and more mini-businesses are popping up on streets and on the Internet that bring direct competition. Montreal is undergoing an unprecedented level of road construction that hinders shopping. Yet the industry has rarely been taken seriously by local or large governments, the study finds, and has been left to fight for itself.
In response to retailers' concerns, the city administration under Mayor Valérie Plante formed a committee in March to come up with a plan to aid merchants that would support Montreal's economic development strategy.
Released Monday, the 30-page report( https://bit.ly/2LBCjKL ), developed by a team of academics, retail experts and retailers and led by Guy Cormier, president and CEO of Mouvement Desjardins, outlines 23 recommendations to improve the vitality of local commerce, which in many sectors defines the livelihood and spirit of the neighbourhoods they serve.
"Already today, and more so for tomorrow, if we don't pay attention, retail shops could leave our traditional main arteries," the report reads. "If that were to happen, the city of Montreal would find itself seriously weakened, and Montrealers would lose out."
Among the main recommendations are:
Improve the co-ordination of the city's numerous construction sites and compensate retailers who suffer serious losses.
Decrease the tax burden on merchants by reducing the gap between residential and non-residential property tax rates
Reduce rates on property taxes on the first $500,000 of evaluation
Allow merchants to pay their taxes in six instalments
Simplify the regulations and administrative procedures required in dealing with the city of Montreal
Improve the city's online capabilities so merchant requests for aid and the issuing and payment of permits can be done over the Internet
Have the city take greater stock in the importance of major shopping arteries and optimize mobility options to access them, be it by public transit, car or bike.
The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal applauded the recommendations in the plan, noting that Montreal retailers face the highest tax rates of any large Canadian city.
"The challenge is now (for the city) to put these solutions into practice quickly, so that merchants can benefit as soon as possible," Board of Trade president Michel Leblanc said in a statement released Monday.

Canadiens' prospective draft picks for 2018: Ryan Merkley, defence

Author: Hickey, Pat

Full text: During the weeks leading up to the NHL Entry Draft, we're taking a look at players who might be selected by the Montreal Canadiens. The team has five selections in the first two rounds, including the No. 3 overall pick. Check back daily from Thursday to Monday up until the draft on June 22-23 in Dallas, and weigh in on their potential in the comments section below.
Ryan Merkley, defence
Height/weight: 5-foot-11, 170 pounds
NHL Central Scouting Rank: No. 21 among North American skaters
What the scouts are saying: Stop me if you've heard this one before. It seems there's this defenceman in the Ontario Hockey League whose skills are off the chart. He can skate like the wind, sees the ice well, makes passes that other defencemen wouldn't see. He put up 67 points in 63 games with the Guelph Storm. The only question mark is whether he understands that being a defenceman means you occasionally have to play defence. Ryan Merkley carries the same high-risk, high-reward tag that was attached to P.K. Subban before the Canadiens picked him in the second round. The one difference between Merkley and the young Subban may lie in their attitude. Anyone who has witnessed a Subban training session has never questioned his work ethic. He made himself an elite defender with a vigorous push from Michel Therrien. The question surrounding Merkley is whether he has the determination to be more than a one-trick pony. If he does, he's a first-rounder, but there aren't many scouts who believe he belongs in that group.
Why the Canadiens would be interested: The Canadiens should take a flyer on Merkley if for no other reason than to see if they learned any lessons from the way they mishandled Subban - beginning with the early stages of his career when he stayed in Hamilton for far too long to his inevitable departure because he dared to be different. Then again, maybe the Canadiens should pass because accommodating players who are different isn't part of the team's DNA.
Coaching connection: Without beating the Subban comparison to death, it should be noted that Merkley's coach in Guelph is McGill grad George Burnett, who found a way to get the most out of Subban when he was coaching the Belleville Bulls.

Blurring the lines between Quebec's far right and political mainstream on Facebook

Full text: With polls showing the Parti Québécois in third place ahead of the Oct. 1 provincial election, observers are concerned some PQ activists may be bending too far to the right on immigration issues - and flirting with extremist groups online - to try to bring in more voters.
An investigation into two closed Facebook groups, whose stated goals are to bolster the base of the party, shows a growing coziness between far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance on the one hand, and members and supporters of the Parti Québécois on the other - from grassroots activists to aspiring candidates to officials on the executive council.
The investigation focused on the Facebook groups PQ!!!... Rien d'autre!!! and Patriotes du Parti Québécois, with 1,544 and 2,023 members respectively.
It found that many participants, while supporters of the PQ, were also members of La Meute and/or Storm Alliance.
"We went fishing with the names of aspiring (PQ) candidates, and then saw what groups they were in, and what was being said," said Jeff Ray, an anti-racist activist who published his findings on the blog Onjase.org( https://onjase.org/post/2018/05/26/177-le-PQ-et-l-islamophobie-ignorance-connivence ).
"There are at least a dozen of these kinds of groups, but these two groups stand out. Key personalities of the far right are participating in these groups and there's a strong focus on Islam, Muslims, 'illegals' and closing borders - all the themes of the far right."
Ray vows to expand his research to include the Coalition Avenir Québec, currently in first place in the polls. The CAQ says if elected, it will impose a values test on new immigrants.
The Liberals, on the other hand, are so universally despised by the extreme right that they may be immune, he said.
In the meantime, however, Ray says the links between this fringe of PQ supporters and the far-right are worrisome.
The administrators of the Rien d'autre group, for example, include two women who are members of both La Meute and Storm Alliance.
A third administrator, Gérard Gerry Sévigny, is a member of Storm Alliance.
In July 2017, Sévigny was given a special welcome to Storm Alliance by then-leader Dave Treg.
Months later, just before Storm Alliance's September protest at the Lacolle border crossing against so-called "illegal" immigration, he posted a message saying, "I am separatist and tomorrow I'LL BE WITH YOU... TOGETHER we will overcome."
In the Venn diagram, the intersection between historically progressive nationalists and the far right seems to be expanding.
Among the participants in both Facebook groups are also key figures in the extreme right, like Matt Galarno, the head of Storm Alliance in Montreal; Sylvain Lacroix, the head of the Mouvement Républicain Québécois; and André Pitre, a.k.a. Stu Pitt, a self-described "socio-political commentator" sponsored by La Meute.
"Quick quick quick, Nation. There's only the PQ for October," wrote Denise Girard, an administrator on Rien d'autre, in April, reposting a conspiracy story about the Muslim lobby in Quebec. "And we're called crazy when we say that soon there will be sharia law here."
"I hope with all my heart that no Muslim will be elected in our country, Quebec. We have no need for representatives of that satanic religion," responded another member.
Three days later, another administrator, Diane Rose, suggested people refuse to be served by Sikhs, Muslims or people wearing veils. "Leave the restaurant in that case. At some point they won't have many clients left."
None of the administrators responded to requests for an interview.
The investigation revealed hundreds of posts like these, with stories published on xenophobic sites like Le Peuple, and fake news from around the globe. Reports on how Europe is on the verge of decriminalizing rape, for example, to suit new immigrants; and refugee children in Halifax attacking others at school.
As recently as April, members were posting about that imaginary second Muslim shooter at the mosque in Quebec City.
Ray, who uses a pseudonym to protect himself from on- and off-line harassment, says there is a difference between the content on these sites and what is found in far-right groups, however.
La Meute members are all of one mind, he said, while here there is a diversity of opinion.
There are also attempts made by some members to counter fake news and conspiracy theories on the site.
In early May, for example, someone posted a story about a man being stabbed in Granby, with the following comment: "Apparently a majority of criminals are passing through our borders with the doors wide open."
Another member asked what Roxham Rd. had to do with the story - the stabbing involved several local men with previous criminal records.
Here, far-right themes are mixed in with more garden-variety PQ issues, and talk of how to mobilize PQ supporters. It's impossible to determine how many members of these Facebook groups are officially members of the PQ. Lists of members are confidential. Asked in March for a "show of hands" of how many members of Rien d'autre were PQ members, about 130 people responded.
But the discussion often returns to how immigration is another way that Canada is imposing itself on Quebec - and how migrants are invading the country.
"These are not organized far-right groups with all their hierarchy," Ray said. "But I've seen a lot of shared content that would be very much at home with Storm Alliance or La Meute. ... It's copy and paste."
It's all the more troubling, Ray says, given the presence of representatives of the PQ, some of them in high places.
(Story continues below image)
***
PQ Leader Jean-François Lisée declined to be interviewed for this story. His press attaché, Bruno-Pierre Cyr, said:
"We have no comment to make on groups that have no official link with our political organization. These groups are formed at the initiative of citizens or members and what is said (on these platforms) is their business and do not represent official positions."
And yet one aspiring PQ candidate, Muguette Paillé, was summarily dropped( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/muguette-paille-withdraws-from-pq-after-comments-on-far-right-sites ) from the PQ ticket last month when her anti-Muslim comments on similar sites were revealed.
Just days after Lisée called her the "voice of popular wisdom," the PQ announced she would not be running as a candidate.
On PQ!!!... Rien d'autre!!!, where Paillé was also a member, others in the group were incensed.
"We're no longer free to think what we want. Gang of hypocrites," said one.
"To say Madame Paillé is Islamophobic IS INSULTING ALL OF US who are defending our rights," said another.
Lisée is not a member of either of these groups. But he has made public statements that appeal to the far-right, suggesting in 2016, for example, that women in burkas could potentially be hiding AK-47s( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/480241/course-au-pq-les-grandes-entrevues-du-devoir-rouvrir-la-boite-de-pandore ), and more recently that Canada should build a fence at Roxham Rd. - and have Mexicans pay for it( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/lisees-border-fence-plan-draws-ridicule-from-opposition-parties ).
(He later downgraded the fence to a cedar hedge.)
At the PQ convention May 26, Lisée also announced( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/pq-platform-proposes-moving-toward-free-university-education ) the party, if elected, would table a law to prevent public sector workers from wearing religious signs, including police, judges, teachers and daycare educators.
But other politicians besides Paillé are - or were until very recently - on Rien d'autre or Patriotes.
The list of Facebook group members who have interacted on the site include Marie-Louise Séguin, a former candidate for the PQ and now the president of the PQ executive in the Soulanges riding; Mario Beaulieu, the former leader of the Bloc Québécois; Thierry Bilodeau, a vice-president of the PQ's youth wing; and Luc Lemoine, a member of the PQ executive in Montreal.
Attempts to contact them through Facebook, email and by phone were unsuccessful. Beaulieu and Bilodeau appear to have unsubscribed from the Patriotes group since screen grabs of their participation in the Facebook groups were published on Onjase.org.
Ray makes the distinction between these participating members and those who may not even be aware that they are members of the group.
Some high-ranking members of the PQ are listed as members of the Rien d'autre group, for example, but there is no evidence of them interacting on the site.
One of them was Jean Bottari, who hopes to be the PQ candidate for the riding of Bertrand.
He told the Montreal Gazette that he recently joined the group because he thought that as a candidate it was a good idea to be part of groups disseminating information about the PQ.
But when alerted to the kind of content regularly found on the site, he did his own research and unsubscribed himself.
"It's incredible! These are not the positions of the PQ!" he said. "Maybe there are a lot of people who are duped, like I was. You're asked to join a group and you accept without verifying the content."
Manon Bévillard, the president of the PQ executive in Argenteuil, had a similar reaction - she said she didn't understand why her name was mentioned on the Onjase blog because "she always denounces the excesses of certain PQ members and activists." She has also unsubscribed in the past week.
Even those PQ members who are participating, by liking certain posts or commenting, are not necessarily Islamophobic or anti-immigrant, Ray insisted.
"But they are participating in a dialogue where Islamophobic sentiments are legitimized and they let it happen," Ray said. "It's up to them to explain why. Perhaps they tolerate it to get at those voters."
Aurélie Campana, the head of research on terrorism and extremism at Université Laval in Quebec City, who has just finished five years of research into extreme-right groups in Canada, said she has seen an evolution in the way they are interfering in Quebec and Canadian politics.
"These far-right groups and militants no longer hesitate to speak up and get into the public debate, either in protests in Quebec City or on open or closed Facebook pages," she said, declining to comment specifically on the two groups mentioned here. "But we can't say whether this is a strategy of the group or of individuals who decide to participate."
It can be a way to place far-right content into the mainstream discourse, as La Meute and Storm Alliance both try to appear socially acceptable to the so-called oppressed, white majority, she said.
"It's worrisome, because it shows that the ideas we associate with the far right are taken up by people who either don't necessarily understand or are looking for votes. But it can be dangerous."
In Europe, mainstream parties began to veer right to undercut the far right. But that strategy didn't work, Campana says. Far-right parties are now in government in several countries.
And in Canada, her studies have shown that the aim of far-right groups is not to infiltrate the mainstream parties, but to discredit them.
"Over and above everything else, they are anti-establishment, anti-pluralist and anti-democratic," she says. "The lesson for all political parties is be careful who you recruit."

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
Loving the heat? Prepare for a cooler than usual June in Montreal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/loving-the-heat-prepare-for-a-cooler-than-usual-june-in-montreal )
If you enjoyed the burst of heat in Montreal this week, savour your last bit of it over a weekend that's expected to be sunny and dry. After a May that was slightly warmer than usual, Montrealers can expect a cooler than usual first half of June, according to Environment Canada. Subtropical storm Alberto, which caused evacuations and states of emergencies in some parts of the United States this week before it started to recede on Wednesday, is responsible for the warm and humid weather that Montreal saw this week. "We expect the rest of the summer to be maybe close or slightly over the normal" temperature, said meteorologist Simon Legault.
Turtles need crossing guards to help them survive on Quebec roads( http://montrealgazette.com/news/turtles-need-crossing-guards-to-help-them-survive-on-quebec-roads )
June is a dangerous month for turtles. It's then that the females hit the road - figuratively and literally. They leave the relative safety of their wetlands habitats, including rivers, lakes and ponds, to search out a spot to lay their eggs. You might see them on sand or gravel road shoulders - and that's a behaviour that puts them at risk for being struck by passing vehicles, said Caroline Gagné, a biologist with the Nature Conservancy of Canada( http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/ ) (NCC). Quebec has eight native species of turtle: The Blanding's turtle, map turtle, musk turtle, painted turtle, snapping turtle, spotted turtle, spiny softshell turtle and wood turtle. To help reduce their mortality rate on the roads, the NCC developed a website for reporting turtle sightings, carapace.ca( https://www.carapace.ca/en/ ).
Blanding's turtle, one of several species of turtle found in Quebec.
Bertrand Charest case: Geneviève Simard, 3 others win right to speak out( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/4-sexual-assault-victims-of-bertrand-charest-want-chance-to-speak-out )
Former Canadian Olympic skier Geneviève Simard and three other women who were sexually assaulted by former national ski coach Bertrand Charest had publication bans on their identities lifted on Friday so they can share their experiences in the interests of preventing similar abuse of athletes. The four women, who will speak publicly Monday, were among the nine victims Charest was convicted of sexually assaulting during the 1990s. His trial was held last year in St-Jérôme. Simard, 37, filed a complaint against Charest on Feb. 5, 2015. Twelve women in all ended up filing complaints and, last year, Charest was found guilty on 37 charges involving nine of the victims.
Class-action suit filed against Canadian banks over mortgage prepayment charges( http://montrealgazette.com/business/class-action-suit-filed-against-canadian-banks-over-mortgage-prepayment-charges )
A Montreal law firm has filed a class-action lawsuit against Canada's major financial institutions over what the suit describes as "abusive" mortgage prepayment charges. The class action, which will need to be authorized by a judge, argues the country's major banks charge unreasonable prepayment fees when Quebec homeowners pay off their mortgage before the end of the term. The suit claims banks include clauses in loan agreements that require people who pay off their mortgages early to pay one of two possible penalties, depending on which is highest: three months' interest calculated on the prepayment amount, or what banks call the "interest-rate differential." The firm behind the class action, LPC Avocat Inc., contends the latter is virtually impossible to calculate and is always the highest.

Opinion: My life as a Starbucks orphan in Montreal

Full text: Almost 20 years ago, my life hit rock bottom.
I had lost my business. But what I didn't fully comprehend back then is that I had lost myself.
I had no idea of the storm coming. All I did know is that it was coming. The days became impossible, reminding me of what I didn't want to know, let alone face.
Today my mind is blank about those early weeks and months. Everything seems blocked out, except for one strange detail. I remember vividly my days in the local Starbucks, where I took refuge.
From my late 20s to late 40s I had raced to build my own business. Long before the words "startup" and "pivot" were in vogue, I was beginning a business and adapting every step of the way. For a while, I was successful. But I didn't know what I didn't know. Back then, I didn't understand many things.
I didn't fully understand then how lucky I was to meet the love of my life waiting in line for a taxi at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Behind me was this beautiful woman. We shared a cab ride into Manhattan, just like in the movies. Only this was my movie. Three years later we were married in the Big Apple by a priest and a rabbi. But that is a whole other story.
Back to Starbucks. It became normal, a 49-year-old spending eight to 10 hours a day doing absolutely nothing but drinking coffee and going out of my mind.
Strangely, or maybe not, I became quite close to some of the regulars, especially Gary.
Gary was like the bartender just before closing hour. Just you, him and lots of booze. But with Gary there was no booze. Just tons of very strong coffee. Gary heard my story maybe a hundred times, word for word, but he listened every time as if my life depended on it.
Some days were so bad he had to keep reminding me about my wife and kids and how lucky I was. Most days, I walked around in a trance. The antidepressant medication I was on became so powerful it took over my life.
My anxiety decreased. But I felt nothing. I don't know what would have become of me if I hadn't met Gary.
Several months went by with me feeling I was the only one in the universe living this nightmare.
But I was wrong. The people I met and shared stories with gave me more comfort than family and friends.
These people were like me, Starbucks orphans, we called ourselves. Nowhere to go. Nobody to see. Our lives frozen. They too were trying to figure things out.
Those days became the most inexpensive therapy sessions I will ever experience. We talked about our families. We shared stories. Most of all, we talked "small talk."
Starbucks became the antidote to my pain. Literally, it was the kindness of strangers that helped me cope and stay together, or at least somewhat together. Learning that I was not alone made all the difference. Knowing that I could talk forever about the same thing and have an audience was my saviour.
Sometimes, I think about Gary and some of those I met. Unfortunately I lost track of them all, except Gary. We stayed in touch for a brief period as he wanted to know all about the book I was writing. But in time, I lost touch with Gary as well, being too busy trying to stay afloat.
No doubt there will always be Starbucks orphans. I only hope that their stay is brief and like me today, when they do go back, they go only to chase their dreams.

Alouettes' Jermaine Robinson plays for the love of the game

Full text: Last month, seeking another playing opportunity in the Canadian Football League, Jermaine Robinson flew from Sioux Falls, S.D., to Atlanta to attend a free-agent camp being operated by the Alouettes.
Between the flight, rental car, food and the entrance fee, Robinson likely spent close to US$1,000. He displayed enough to be invited to mini-camp and, since May 20, has been attending training camp at Olympic Stadium, attempting to crack the team's roster.
Robinson has a degree in criminal justice from the University of Toledo. He was working as a youth counsellor at a juvenile centre in Sioux Falls while playing Arena ball and was contemplating entering the military. He didn't need to try to play for a team that hasn't reached the playoffs since 2014.
Montreal Alouettes Jermaine Robinson stretches during a team practice in Montreal on Monday May 28, 2018.
"I still think there's something out there left for me," said the 29-year-old Pittsburgh native. "I'm still young. I don't think I've reached my potential. I think this year I can finally put it together and become the dominant player I was in 2016.
"You don't get this opportunity often. People don't understand the CFL's a great game," added the 6-foot-3, 205 pounder, who has played for both Ottawa and Hamilton. "When you don't play it, that's when you realize how amazing it was when you did. It puts everything in perspective. I want it even more than before. You understand the importance of it and the opportunity that you have."
Montreal fans should have vivid memories of Robinson. It was during a game on June 30, 2016, at Molson Stadium that he administered a helmet-to-helmet hit on former Als receiver Duron Carter after he scored a touchdown( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/football/cfl/montreal-alouettes/duron-carters-sideline-antics-one-of-many-alouettes-lowlights-against-redblacks ). Carter then taunted the Redblacks bench, knocking down head coach Rick Campbell. Both Robinson and Carter were subsequently suspended by the league.
"It was a fun game," Robinson remembered, laughing. "As a fan, you want to see that type of intensity."
Montreal Alouettes Duron Carter makes a catch in front of Ottawa Red Blacks Jermaine Robinson during Canadian Football League game in Montreal Friday August 29, 2014.
Following a stellar 46-game collegiate career, Robinson turned pro with the Sioux Falls Storm before signing with Ottawa as a free agent. He spent 135 days on the injured list in 2015 after suffering a wrist injury against Montreal, and was limited to two regular-season games, although he dressed for the Grey Cup loss against Edmonton.
He played 10 games the following season, intercepting a pass, before being released in early September. Eleven days later, he signed as a free-agent with the Tiger-Cats, starting four games.
A free agent in 2017, he worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs and had been expecting an invitation to mini-camp, but that fell through. Instead, Robinson played in the Spring League - arguably made famous this year by the appearance of Johnny Manziel, who then signed with Hamilton - before returning to Sioux Falls.
"You have to love football to play at that level," Robinson said, and he wasn't kidding. Players received barely more than $200, provided their team won. The per diem for road games was $20. Travel was by bus, practices at night - to allow the players to hold down day jobs - and they had to carry their equipment to practice.
"You're doing it for the passion," he said. "To be honest, after that season, I figured football was over for me. It's hard to get into the CFL, just because of the ratio."
Robinson is serious about prolonging his career, if possible. After spending so much time injured in 2015, he decided to spend the winter in Ottawa, while modifying his diet. He now eats five times daily, drinks protein shakes after workouts and before sleep. He takes fish oil in the morning and no longer eats fried food or drinks juice.
Robinson has been practicing at safety, his natural position, through the opening nine days of Als camp. And he has seen plenty of time with the starting defence, while Joe Burnett recovered from a scalp issue that prevented him from wearing his helmet for several days. Burnett also returned to Florida last weekend to attend his grandfather's funeral.
But Burnett returned on Monday and, although he never has played safety in the CFL, he is getting starter's reps. Burnett also was signed in February as a free agent from Calgary.
Robinson, predictably, doesn't want to look too far ahead.
"Just go out there and play. Give it all I've got," he explained. "At the end of the day they'll pick both of us. Or Joe. Or whomever they pick. I'm just happy to be out here and have the opportunity to play and compete.
"Out here, nobody has any advantage. We're just names on a board right now. We're all competing. If I worry about those things, it's going to hold us back. The coaches are just trying to find the best DBs as a group."
The Als launch their exhibition schedule Thursday night, at Ottawa.
Notes: Veteran linebacker Chip Cox still hasn't started practicing with the Als, although he returned to Montreal several days ago. According to GM Kavis Reed, Cox is suffering from a stomach virus. There's no sense rushing him back at this point, since he wouldn't have played against the Redblacks. ...
Although head coach Mike Sherman wants to take as many players as possible to Ottawa, he's not yet prepared to divulge his plans at quarterback for the game.

Efforts To Unmask Key Neo-Nazis Make Waves; Alt-right organizer 'Zeiger'disappears, masked group invades Vice Canada offices

Full text: It's been a tumultuous month for the alt-right in Montreal.
In early May the Montreal Gazette exposed one of the most prominent neo-Nazi figures in North America.
"Zeiger" was known as the No. 2 writer on the Daily Stormer - said to be the world's largest neo-Nazi website - and an influential figure in neo-Nazi recruiting circles.
He was considered a thought leader in North America's neo-Nazi movement, having helped to develop recruitment strategies that focused on internet culture, as well as claiming responsibility for the resurgence of Siege - a 1980s manifesto that called for the neo-Nazi movement to adopt individual acts of terrorism as political strategy. Siege, which Zeiger digitized, was the main inspiration for the American neo-Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division.
This information was given to the Montreal Gazette by a group of anti-fascists, who had scoured through 12,000 messages on a closed forum and connected Zeiger to a Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie man named Gabriel Sohier Chaput. (A home address that Zeiger provided during a discussion on the closed forum matched the address where Sohier Chaput lived.)
The news spread across the city like wildfire.
Mayor Valérie Plante denounced the presence of neo-Nazis, saying, "any hateful and neo-Nazi propaganda obviously has no place in Montreal; it goes against the values of tolerance and respect promoted by the city. I strongly denounce any display promoting this ideology."
Quebec Public Safety Minister Martin Coiteux also condemned targeted hatred against communities in a tweet, and said Quebec was an "open and inclusive society."
The next day, posters went up around Sohier Chaput's neighbourhood that included his name, face and address as well as a brief description of Zeiger's online and real-world neo-Nazi activity. Similar posters would go up in the following weeks identifying others in the movement, including Shawn Beauvais MacDonald, Vincent Bélanger-Mercure and Philippe Gendron.
Montreal police haven't confirmed whether they are investigating Zeiger's neo-Nazi activism and propaganda, because it is police protocol to not comment on ongoing investigations. They did, however, tell La Presse that the posters identifying Sohier Chaput could be considered incitement to hatred.
"It's beyond ironic," said Venkman, one of the anti-fascists who participated in the effort to unmask Zeiger. "You're talking about Nazis who are talking about gassing Jews. Just putting their posters up with their name and their picture and address is inciting hatred? We don't know if they're serious about this, but it seems completely ludicrous."
Evan Balgord, executive-director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, said the posters have a historical precedent. "That actually comes from a Canadian tradition," he said, describing how the Anti-Racist Action Network of the 1990s would poster neighbourhoods in Toronto identifying members of the Heritage Front, a large national neo-Nazi organization.
"They saw that as an act of community self-defence."
Balgord specified that the Canadian Anti-Hate Network is not an activist organization, in that it will never be involved in planning rallies or "on-the-ground organizing."
Instead it will focus on gathering intelligence on hate groups and providing that information to the public.
Sohier Chaput, whose landlord confirmed that he still lived at the address in question shortly before the exposé was published, has disappeared.
Journalists knocked on his door, called his family members and went through every avenue possible to attempt to reach him.
Following the Montreal Gazette's story on Zeiger, rumours began to spread about his whereabouts: he had gone into hiding in rural Quebec, some sources said. He was at a family member's house somewhere else in Montreal, said another. He had hopped on a plane to Vancouver, or he had gone to the United States. One thing was for certain - he was no longer at his known address.
After a few days of silence on the alt-right sites that Zeiger was known to frequent, the Daily Stormer finally published an update.
The text - written by founder Andrew Anglin and titled "In a Wild Storm of Shuttenings, Man Overboard" - eulogized Zeiger and referred to him in the past tense.
After describing how American white nationalist Richard Spencer's website had been shut down by its web-hosting service, Anglin wrote that "instead of these monumental developments weighing on my mind, it's the fact that our guy has been run out of his home and job. There's people hunting for him in the streets.
"Zeiger was a brave and noble warrior, both online and off. This is a huge blow to a man who did so much for our struggle for many years," Anglin wrote. "Now finally the system has come to grind him into dust."
Elsewhere on the alt-right internet, things were changing. The largest neo-Nazi podcast in Canada - where Zeiger appeared as a guest semi-regularly - released its 90th episode, subtitled "Will We Make it to Episode 100?" The hosts lamented the loss of Zeiger.
Shaken by the efforts to unmask Zeiger, the hosts advised their neo-Nazi fan base to scrub their information from the internet, afraid that more unmaskings were on the way.
Days after that podcast was released, the hosts followed their own advice - deleting all of their podcasts from the sites on which they were hosted, and deleting their accounts on social media and various hate forums. Then, on May 16, Vice Canada and the Canadian Anti-Hate Network claimed to have revealed the identity of one of the podcast hosts.
Panic about being identified is visible on various far-right forums. The Right Stuff, a neo-Nazi podcast network whose forum Balgord describes as the principal platform of communication for the alt-right in Canada, made its forum private. Previously, anyone - even without an account - could view the forums. This was changed so that the forums could only be viewed by users with accounts. The freeaccount option was also removed, effectively moving the entire forum behind a paywall.
The effects of these changes reach beyond the internet. Balgord said that individuals such as Zeiger, along with having a high profile online, "vouch for other members in the movement, which would allow for those members to become trusted and be welcomed into both online and off-line networks."
As a result, he said, the journalists and anti-fascists who exposed Zeiger and others like him "disrupted the alt-right neo-Nazis'ability to spread hate propaganda and to organize in real life."
While the websites went underground, Montreal's alt-right network retaliated by posting stickers of the Fédération de Québécois de souche - a white supremacist group in Quebec that describes itself as a "nationalist political organization focusing on ending political correctness." The stickers went up over the posters identifying Zeiger in the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough.
Graffiti referencing two other alt-right figures also went up overnight on May 7, marking a series of Plateau-Mont-Royal apartment buildings and restaurants. Antifascists responded by organizing a family-friendly demonstration that marched through Sohier Chaput's neighbourhood. The protest stopped at his apartment, before continuing up the street to the residence of another well-known neo-Nazi named Philippe Gendron.
His apartment was heavily guarded by members of the farright group Soldiers of Odin - who were armed with "iron bars, sticks, masks or bulletproof vests," said Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie resident Isabelle Baez, who wrote an article for the Huffington Post on her experience at the march.
Venkman said he expected that neo-Nazis would attempt some form of retaliation, and that the anti-fascists are preparing for it. He was proved right earlier this week when a group of masked members of the far-right group Atalante invaded the Montreal offices of Vice Quebec, just days after the Vice Canada-Canadian Anti-Hate Network report claiming to reveal the identity of a prominent neo-Nazi podcast host.
Venkman is continuing to gather information about the alt-right in the city. The posters that were put up also included an email address where people could send tips about suspected neo-Nazis, and Venkman said that the tip line is overflowing with information.
"Just in the last 10 days we were able to identify several more of these guys," he said.
"We're going to keep doing this.
We're going to keep putting names to faces and exposing them."

Full text: It's been a tumultuous month for the alt-right in Montreal.
In early May the Montreal Gazette exposed one of the most prominent neo-Nazi figures in North America.
"Zeiger" was known as the number two writer on the Daily Stormer - said to be the world's largest neo-Nazi website - and an influential figure in neo-Nazi recruiting circles.
He was considered a thought leader in North America's neo-Nazi movement, having helped to develop recruitment strategies that focused on internet culture, as well as claiming responsibility for the resurgence of Siege - a 1980s manifesto that called for the neo-Nazi movement to adopt individual acts of terrorism as political strategy. Siege, which Zeiger digitized, was the main inspiration for the American neo-Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division.
This information was given to the Montreal Gazette by a group of anti-fascists, who had scoured through 12,000 messages on a closed forum and connected Zeiger to a Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie man named Gabriel Sohier Chaput. (A home address that Zeiger provided during a discussion on the closed forum matched the address where Sohier Chaput lived).
The news spread across the city like wildfire.
Mayor Valérie Plante denounced the presence of neo-Nazis, saying "any hateful and neo-Nazi propaganda obviously has no place in Montreal; it goes against the values ??of tolerance and respect promoted by the city. I strongly denounce any display promoting this ideology."
Martin Coiteux, the Public Safety Minister of Quebec, also condemned targeted hatred against communities in a tweet, and said Quebec was an "open and inclusive society."
The next day, posters went up around Sohier-Chaput's neighborhood with his name, face, and address on it, as well as a brief description of Zeiger's online and real-world neo-Nazi activity. Similar posters would go up in the following weeks identifying others in the movement, including Shawn Beauvais MacDonald, Vincent Bélanger-Mercure, and Philippe Gendron.
Montreal police haven't confirmed whether they are investigating Zeiger's neo-Nazi activism and propaganda because it is police protocol to not comment on ongoing investigations. They did, however, tell La Presse that the posters identifying Sohier Chaput could be considered incitement to hatred.
"It's beyond ironic," said Venkman, one of the anti-fascists who participated in the effort to unmask Zeiger. "You're talking about Nazis who are talking about gassing Jews. Just putting their posters up with their name and their picture and address is inciting hatred? We don't know if they're serious about this, but it seems completely ludicrous."
Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, said the posters have a historical precedent. "That actually comes from a Canadian tradition," he said, describing how the Anti-Racist Action network of the 1990s would poster neighbourhoods in Toronto identifying members of the Heritage Front, a large national neo-Nazi organization. "They saw that as an act of community self-defense."
Balgord specified that the Canadian Anti-Hate Network is not an activist organization, in that it will never be involved in planning rallies or "on-the-ground organizing." Instead it will focus on gathering intelligence on hate groups and providing that information to the public.
Sohier-Chaput, whose landlord confirmed that he still lived at the address in question shortly before the exposé was published, has disappeared. Journalists knocked on his door, called his family members, and went through every avenue possible to attempt to reach him.
Following the Montreal Gazette's story on Zeiger, rumours began to spread about his whereabouts - he had gone into hiding in rural Quebec, some sources said. He was at a family member's house somewhere else in Montreal, said another. He had hopped on a plane to Vancouver, or he had gone to the United States. One thing was for certain - he was no longer at his known address.
After a few days of silence on the alt-right sites Zeiger was known to frequent, the Daily Stormer finally published an update. The text, written by founder Andrew Anglin and titled "In a Wild Storm of Shuttenings, Man Overboard," eulogized Zeiger and referred to him in the past tense.
After describing how American white nationalist Richard Spencer's website had been shut down by its web hosting service, Anglin wrote that "instead of these monumental developments weighing on my mind, it's the fact that our guy has been run out of his home and job. There's people hunting for him in the streets."
"Zeiger was a brave and noble warrior, both online and off. This is a huge blow to a man who did so much for our struggle for many years," Anglin wrote. "Now finally the system has come to grind him into dust."
Elsewhere on the alt-right internet, things were changing. The largest neo-Nazi podcast in Canada - where Zeiger appeared as a guest semi-regularly - released its 90th episode, subtitled "Will We Make it to Episode 100?" The hosts lamented the loss of Zeiger.
Shaken by the efforts to unmask Zeiger, the hosts advised their neo-Nazi fanbase to scrub their information from the internet, afraid that more unmaskings were on the way.
Days after that podcast was released, the hosts followed their own advice - deleting all of their podcasts from the sites on which they were hosted, and deleting their accounts on social media and various hate forums. Then, on May 16, Vice Canada and the Canadian Anti-Hate Network claimed to have revealed the identity of one of the podcast hosts.( https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/59qb93/the-racist-podcaster-who-started-a-neo-nazi-coffee-company-to-fund-white-nationalism )
Panic about being identified is visible on various far-right forums. The Right Stuff, a neo-Nazi podcast network whose forum Balgord describes as the principle platform of communication for the alt-right in Canada, made its forum private. Previously, anyone - even without an account - could view the forums. This was changed so that the forums could only be viewed by users with accounts. The free-account option was also removed, effectively moving the entire forum behind a paywall.
The effects of these changes reach beyond the internet. Balgord said that individuals such as Zeiger, along with having a high profile online, "vouch for other members in the movement, which would allow for those members to become trusted and be welcomed into both online and offline networks."
As a result, he said, the journalists and anti-fascists who exposed Zeiger and others like him "disrupted the alt-right neo-Nazis' ability to spread hate propaganda and to organize in real life."
While the websites went underground, Montreal's alt-right network retaliated by posting stickers of the Fédération de Québécois de souche - a white supremacist group in Quebec that describes itself as a "nationalist political organization focusing on ending political correctness." The stickers went up over the posters identifying Zeiger in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough.
Graffiti referencing two other alt-right figures also went up overnight on May 7, marking a series of Plateau-Mont-Royal apartment buildings and restaurants. Anti-fascists responded by organizing a family-friendly demonstration that marched through Sohier Chaput's neighbourhood. The protest stopped at his apartment, before continuing up the street to the residence of another well-known neo-Nazi named Philippe Gendron. His apartment was heavily guarded by Soldiers of Odin - who were armed with "iron bars, sticks, masks or bullet-proof vests," said Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie resident Isabelle Baez, who wrote an article for the Huffington Post on her experience at the march.
Venkman said he expected that neo-Nazis would attempt some form of retaliation, and that the anti-fascists are preparing for it. He was proven earlier this week when a group of masked members of the far-right group Atalante invaded the Montreal offices of Vice Quebec( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-called-after-members-of-far-right-group-storm-into-vices-office ), just days after the Vice Canada-Canadian Anti-Hate Network report claiming to reveal the identity of a prominent neo-Nazi podcast host.
Venkman is continuing to gather information about the alt-right in the city. The posters that were put up also included an email address where people could send tips about suspected neo-Nazis, and Venkman said that the tip line is overflowing with information.

Police put buffer between duelling protests at Lacolle border crossing

Full text: A protest organized by the far-right group Storm Alliance to denounce the Canadian government's tolerance of what that group calls "illegal immigration" attracted about 250 people to the Lacolle border crossing Saturday afternoon.
A slightly smaller counter-protest organized by the migrant justice group Solidarity Across Borders managed to delay the Storm Alliance event, but in the end there was no confrontation, as police maintained a buffer zone between the two groups throughout the afternoon.
Storm Alliance's "United to Protect our Borders" rally was scheduled to start at 1 p.m., but counter-protesters had arrived at the site earlier and briefly blocked Highway 15.
Police moved in quickly to clear the road, but one protester, longtime migrant rights activist Jaggi Singh, was arrested. SQ spokesperson Sgt. Ingrid Asselin said Singh was still in custody Saturday evening and may be charged with assaulting a police officer and obstructing the work of a police officer.
A convoy of about 100 cars carrying protesters heading for the Storm Alliance rally had to wait along the side of the highway for about half an hour, while police corralled the Solidarity Across Borders protesters in front of the Hotel St. Bernard. Then SQ police cars escorted the Storm Alliance convoy to the protest site a little closer to the Lacolle border crossing station. Police in riot gear kept the two groups about 200 meters apart.
Protesters at the Storm Alliance event carried flags showing their adherence to various groups, including La Meute, Les Patriotes and Québec Libre en Action. Others carried Quebec flags, and several said they did not belong to any organized group.
Members of the right-wing group Storm Alliance hold a demonstration near the Canada-U.S. border at Lacolle on Saturday, May 19, 2018.
Several participants in the Storm Alliance rally told the Montreal Gazette they object to their opponents' portrayal of them as extreme right, anti-immigration racists or Islamophobes.
"My message is just that the government should do its job," said Cynthia Dupont of Longueuil, who brought her young children to the event. "We are not against immigration at all. We are not Islamophobic, either, or anything-phobic. All we want is for things to be equal for everyone. Other immigrants come across (the border) properly. Can we just have the same rules for everyone instead of having to clean up a big mess afterwards?"
Her partner, who did not give his name, said he is concerned asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at irregular locations, like Roxham Rd. near Hemmingford, might be criminals.
"We know who these people are," he said of the people who cross into Canada over the official borders. "We know they are healthy and not criminals. We know their names, their records. ... Those who come (across the border at unofficial crossings) we don't know who they are. They take off into the wilderness."
In fact, asylum-seekers who have been entering Quebec from the U.S. at Roxham Rd. are met by Canada Border Services officials and RCMP officers. They are held near that location until they can be positively identified and until officials have ascertained they do not pose a health or security risk. If they have nowhere to stay in Canada and no means to pay for accommodation, they are taken to one of four shelters in Montreal, and from there, they can apply for refugee status.
Jonathan Héroux of Trois-Rivières, who described himself as a former director of Storm Alliance and now an organizer with Quebec Libre en Action, said none of the groups at Saturday's rally qualify as "extreme right." He said Storm Alliance regularly expels people who are violent, or racist.
He said the assembled groups had one cause that is "The People." And he said that includes "iImmigrants who have been here a long time, and even the First Nations who were here before us. When I say 'The People' I am talking about tax payers, everybody on Quebec territory."
Immigration rights counter-demonstrators gather down the road near the Canada-U.S. border at Lacolle during a protest by right-wing group Storm Alliance on Saturday, May 19, 2018.
Storm Alliance leader Eric Trudel has said his group is not anti-immigration, but rejects the Trudeau government's tolerance of what he deemed "illegal immigration" into Quebec at the Roxham Rd. site.
But Aaron Lakoff, a member of Solidarity Across Borders, said the characterization of asylum-seekers as "illegal" is wrong and unfair. He said people in need are crossing at Roxham Rd. because of the Safe Third Country agreement, which requires them to claim refugee status in the first safe country they arrive in. If they cross at a regular Canada-U.S. border station, they will be sent back to the U.S., whereas if they manage to get into Canada some other way, they will get a refugee hearing. He said the agreement should be cancelled, since the U.S. is not a safe country for many refugee claimants.
"People don't cross at Roxham Road because they want to. It's because they have no choice," Lakoff said. "That's why one of our key demands is that the Safe Third Country agreement be cancelled. With the Trump administration cancelling the protected status of hundreds of thousands of people, they have no choice but to come up here irregularly at the Roxham Road crossing. We think these people should be welcomed. We have the resources. They exist or they can be found. It's about political will."

Full text: Members of the far-right group Storm Alliance hit the road Saturday morning, en route from Quebec City to the Lacolle border crossing to attend a rally against what they call illegal immigration.
"We are preparing for the big rally today," said Eric Trudel of Storm Alliance (province of Quebec) told his followers on a Facebook video early Saturday morning before getting into his car to lead a convoy from Quebec City. "I hope to see you in great numbers...It seemed to be going well up to yesterday so I hope people won't cancel at the last minute because they see some clouds in the (forecast)."
Meanwhile, counter-protesters from the pro-refugee group Solidarity Across Borders boarded three buses in Montreal and headed for the border for a rally of their own. They are planning a counter protest at the Lacolle border, as well as a kind of welcome party for asylum seekers crossing the boarder irregularly at Roxham Road, about eight kilometers west of the official border crossing, where increasing numbers of asylum seekers have been entering Canada. They will be joined by members of a group called Bridges not Borders, based in Hemmingford.
Aaron Lakoff, a member of Solidarity Across Borders, said spirits were high on the buses on Saturday morning.
"It's a challenge to get people to get up early on a Saturday morning and come down to the border to confront the far right," Lakoff said in an interview with the Montreal Gazette from the bus. "But spirits are high. People feel this is a really important thing to do."

The Storm Alliance rally, dubbed "United to Protect our Borders" was originally planned to take place at Roxham Rd., but organizers decided to change the location to the official border crossing at Lacolle late this week.
Solidarity Across Borders responded by claiming a victory, and vowing to be present at both spots Saturday to stand up for the rights of asylum seekers to claim refugee status in Canada.
Storm Alliance leader Eric Trudel has said his group is not anti-immigration, but rejects the Trudeau government's tolerance of what he deemed "illegal immigration" into Quebec at the Roxham Rd. site.

Full text: Two years ago, Emer O'Toole logged on to Twitter and found she'd been swarmed with hateful messages.
They came at her by the hundreds, a small army of mostly men calling her names and threatening her. One user Photoshopped her face onto the image of a naked woman with Froot Loops coming out of her anus.
While she was able to laugh most of it off, the sheer volume of the attack was overwhelming.
"It was a barrage of nonsensical, targeted harassment," said O'Toole, a professor at Concordia University's School of Irish Studies. "It made Twitter unusable for a week. There were hundreds of these people in my mentions. ... It was just an intense, viral, misogynistic madness."
O'Toole's apparent transgression? She'd written an article about sexism in the dictionary. In particular, how sample sentences in the definitions cited in Oxford Dictionaries tended to reinforce stereotypes about women.
Hours after the article was published, they came after her. She noticed two types of users seemed particularly incensed: online gamers and white nationalists.
Until that point, O'Toole hadn't made the connection, but now it seemed like the two groups were interwoven into a single toxic culture.
"It was part of a wider, almost organized type of online force that was being used to intimidate feminists," said O'Toole, also a regular columnist for The Guardian newspaper. "They had become radicalized, they were a new conservative force painting themselves as the rebellion.
"To them, feminism and anti-racism had been situated, ideologically, as the mainstream. ... They saw it as a sort of status quo against which this alt-right vanguard had to fight back."
She has since been swarmed by the alt-right again, and while O'Toole says she's thick-skinned, elements of the harassment are hard to ignore.
"The only time I've ever been scared is when people have taken the time to find my email address and send me death threats," O'Toole said. "Not like 'I'm going to kill you', but 'You deserve to die and here's the ways in which you will die.'
"That's when you think, 'Oh, my information is all online and someone could walk into this office with a gun.' "
Two weeks ago, the Montreal Gazette launched a series investigating the rise of the alt-right( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ) movement in Quebec. Some of the group's more prominent members didn't stumble into extremism by leafing through a dog-eared copy of Mein Kampf or The Turner Diaries. For many of these young men, the gateway to the alt-right began with a slow-burning hatred of women( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-encrypted-messages-show-white-supremacist-mindset ).
Some of these lonely young men met in forums where expert pickup artists promised tips to seduce women. Others organized around a video game culture that became obsessed with the notion that the industry is marginalizing young white men to make way for women.
Experts say the trend, if left unchecked, normalizes a culture of violence against women.

Before "DateofLies" was a white nationalist, he was a gamer.
Today, the man behind the moniker, who has elsewhere appeared as "LateOfDies," or sometimes simply "Date," is best known as one of the founders of ID Canada, a group that places propaganda stickers on university campuses and around Montreal.
Date is an associate of the infamous neo-Nazi Zeiger( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ), and led a delegation of Quebecers to the Unite the Right March in Charlottesville, Va., last summer( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-how-charlottesville-exposed-the-key-players-in-the-local-white-nationalist-movement ). Anti-fascists consider him one of the key figures of the white nationalist movement in Montreal.
As far back as 2004, when he was only a teenager, DateofLies frequented the gaming site NeoGaf, where he reached out to other young men about games. He told them he worked for a video-game testing company in Montreal. Sometimes the conversations veered into dating advice.
A few years later, Date posted in-depth instructions on how to dominate women.
"To be an efficient a**hole, you first have to be a man. Basically, don't ever be overly nice, don't be nice period, except when she deserves it," Date wrote. "You are completely indifferent and insensitive to girls you don't know, no matter how good looking they are. I never get out of a woman's way when I'm walking down a hallway, for example."
In a later post, he comments on the Jade Raymond controversy. Raymond worked as a producer at Ubisoft, a Montreal-based game development studio. In 2007, a horde of gamers harassed her because they said she got special treatment as a woman in a male-dominated industry. The harassment peaked when a web-comic designer drew a crude comic of Raymond engaging in sexual activity.
Shortly after, Ubisoft sent a cease-and-desist letter to the comic's creator.
"If I was working (at Ubisoft), I'd hate to work under Jade Raymond. What a publicity stunt that's been," Date said.
He also posted the offensive web comic on NeoGaf and defended its creator, saying it was "just a stupid comic."
NeoGaf permanently banned Date's account in 2009.
It appears that DateofLies became increasingly involved in misogynistic ideology as he got older.
A woman's worth is connected to her "fertility and beauty."
- Men's rights activist Roosh V
According to his Youtube channel, DateofLies developed an interest in Daryush Valizadeh in 2016. Valizadeh, also known as Roosh V, is a controversial author and men's rights activist( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/demonstration-held-against-anti-feminist-blogger-roosh-v ). He brands himself as a "pickup artist" from the United States and has a popular YouTube channel and website. DateofLies liked two of Valizadeh's YouTube videos in 2016.
Valizadeh has written a series of books on how to pick up, date and dominate women. He has also argued that rape should be legalized on private property, although on his website, he claims his earlier statements about legalizing rape were meant to be a "satirical thought experiment."
Valizadeh is an advocate of "neo-masculinity," a philosophy he coined, in which women and men adhere to their traditional gender roles. Valizadeh says that a woman's worth is directly connected to her "fertility and beauty."
Amy Hale, an anthropologist who has been studying the alt-right for years, says DateofLies' fascination with pickup artists and anti-feminism is a common path into extreme right-wing politics. Membership in these groups and activism within the men's rights movement often overlaps with the alt-right.
"A lot of these young men feel marginalized," Hale said. "So you've got a bunch of young men who may not have the best social skills, they may not be particularly adaptable or flexible in terms of how they think about things.
"So this movement requires very fixed ideas about right and wrong in the world, and what people's places are in the world. And a lot of them feel like they are now getting the short end of the stick and they feel a particular sense of entitlement, and they feel their identities are being threatened. And that not everything is in its right place, so this means that women need to be in their right place."
Last month, a 25-year-old Toronto man identified by police as Alex Minassian drove a rented van down 16 blocks of sidewalk in North York( http://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/newsalert-toronto-police-say-a-van-has-hit-up-to-10-people-extent-of-injuries-unknown/wcm/735b8c3a-a3f1-4d12-8a7a-74ffad9a736e ), killing 10 people. His victims were mostly women.
Minassian was a student at Seneca College. His peers thought he was quiet and removed but harmless. According to a post Minassian published on Facebook before the deadly attack, he considered himself an "incel," short for "involuntary celibate."
According to the incel.me website, an involuntary celibate is a man "who is not in a relationship nor has had sex in a significant amount of time, despite numerous attempts." The most ardent incels feel they are owed sex simply because they're men.
Hale said men's rights activists "got into it because they were initially pissed off that the moves of the pickup artists failed for them." In general, they feel as if society has failed them, she said. Fascist ideas provide them with a clear hierarchy that places them at or near the top.
After a years-long fixation with anti-feminism, DateofLies' ideas became more radical. Starting in 2016, he began subscribing to fascist channels on his YouTube account, consuming hours of videos hosted by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke or the Daily Stormer's Andrew Anglin.
There are still traces of something much more innocent on Date's YouTube - links to videos of people playing Minecraft, Final Fantasy or the alien shoot-'em-up game DOOM. But as you scroll forward in time, the path always leads to something much darker, to videos with titles like "Feminism Is For Idiots and Uglies" or "Women's Studies Must Die."

Since she criticized the right-wing outlet Rebel Media, Quebec City journalist Nora Loreto has had her Twitter account flooded with thousands of notifications, her personal information shared online and has received threatening phone calls.
At some point, Nora Loreto became numb to the death threats.
Since the Quebec City mosque shooting 16 months ago, men have sent her pictures of corpses on Twitter, they've detailed how they think she should die and threatened her with sexual assault.
"You become desensitized to it," said Loreto, a Quebec City-based journalist. "How many times can you be called a c**t and it still hurts? Twice? After a thousand times, the effect wears off.
"It's the same with the violence."
Loreto first drew the ire of the alt-right when she criticized Rebel Media's coverage of the mosque shooting in January 2017. At one point, she tweeted that she had considered encouraging people to smash the camera equipment used by Rebel Media reporters.
Early in its coverage of the attack, Rebel Media incorrectly reported that the shooter was a Muslim terrorist and that mainstream media wasn't giving that theory credence because of liberal bias. Even after the theory of a Muslim second shooter was roundly debunked, Rebel continued to refer to it in its coverage.
"I think misogyny is a gateway drug to hatred."
- Nora Loreto
After Loreto's tweet went viral, threats began pouring in. Within a few hours, there were thousands of notifications flooding her Twitter timeline.They followed a disturbing pattern.
"Pretty much any time someone criticizes what I write, they criticize me as a woman," she said. "It's very rarely about the writing. They jump immediately to 'You stupid bitch' and describe all the ways they want to hurt me or kill me."
Loreto says she has also been criticized by liberals and members of the New Democratic Party, but when the far-right attacks her, it gets ugly fast.
"I think misogyny is a gateway drug to hatred," she said. "Because for straight men who might have a hard time dating, it's very personal. Maybe they have difficulties with their sister or their mother. It's one thing to hate a group of people who you've never met and that kind of hatred is a huge problem.
"But everyone has contacts with women, so what is it about (far-right) political orientation that makes misogyny pervasive? I think it's just purely about power. When you attack a woman for being a woman, it's the most basic, kind of the most boring and elementary example of you asserting your power over someone else."
In the past, Loreto has had dozens of people call and email her boss and insist she be fired. She has had people share her personal information, and she has received threatening phone calls from the United States, despite being based in Canada and mostly writing about local issues.
Organizations like Ontario Proud, a non-profit online political group that favours Conservative politicians and causes, posted a photo of Loreto's tweet that coincided with increased harassment, and right-wing ideologues like writer Faith Goldy, who boasts a following of more than 80,000 on Twitter, have singled Loreto out.
"A Twitter storm is the perfect target because you can project everything you think about women on an individual," Loreto said. "You can start to make up an identity for that person. Because they're not real interactions. But the harm is real."

Two sources who know Vincent Bélanger-Mercure told the Montreal Gazette that long before they were aware of his activities in the alt-right, they knew about his militant anti-feminism.
Bélanger-Mercure joined Montreal Storm, a closed chat room used by white nationalists( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-encrypted-messages-show-white-supremacist-mindset ), in June 2017. In August, he made the trek down to Charlottesville with Zeiger and DateofLies. When he came back to Montreal, Bélanger-Mercure was engulfed in a media frenzy after his identity was revealed.
Some of his peers at the Université du Québec à Montréal say they were not surprised.
They said Bélanger-Mercure never really fit in, not because he was shy or introverted, but because they believed he was an outspoken misogynist and racist.
Many of the women in the biology program said they felt extremely uncomfortable around Bélanger-Mercure. In 2016, a group of 10 to 15 biology students approached UQAM's administration with a 14-page document, outlining examples of what they considered to be inappropriate and sexist messages Bélanger-Mercure had allegedly sent to them or posted on social media. They also alleged that he had sent death threats to a few of them.
According to another biology student, after UQAM's administration received the 14-page document, a representative told the students they "would no longer be seeing (Bélanger-Mercure) around anymore."
UQAM said it could not confirm or deny the statement because of confidentiality reasons.
Among the offensive material, Bélanger-Mercure posted a picture of a dead fish and wrote that it reminded him of the time he "hate f***ed" his ex-girlfriend. He refers to having violent sexual intercourse with women on several occasions, according to the students.
A student who did not want to be named for fear of retribution compared Bélanger-Mercure to Alek Minassian.
"He is the same kind of person," the student said. "I was reading all the articles (about Minassian) and I was imagining Vincent. All the profiles when they come out, it's always the same kind of person as Vincent, the same websites he goes on. The things he publishes... or he's single because you're a feminist and you don't like him so he will punish you. He's very mad about women in general."
The same student said that during their time at UQAM, the biology department co-ordinated a six-week internship in the wilderness for the students to study the flora and fauna. The student said that many of the women were very afraid of being around Bélanger-Mercure with no supervision.
"He was with us in the middle of nowhere in the woods. Everybody got scared of what he could do, in the woods, with all of us sleeping in the same place. So all the women closed and locked their doors (at night)."
No incident involving Bélanger-Mercure is known to have occurred during their internship. As for his trip to Charlottesville, he told The Canadian Press, "I did it mostly 'for the lulz,' meaning I expected to be entertained and it was indeed the case." In the same interview, he said while he isn't a white supremacist, "I'm not ashamed of being white, either," and added that attempts to make all cultures uniform "make the beauty of the world disappear."

There is a connection between the alt-right and anti-feminism, said Amy Hale.
"This movement (the alt-right) requires very fixed ideas about right and wrong in the world, and what people's places are in the world. And a lot of them feel like they are now getting the short end of the stick and they feel a particular sense of entitlement, and they feel their identities are being threatened."
Experts say a pillar of fascist ideology is the idea that social hierarchies are natural and unavoidable, and that any effort to dismantle them is an affront to human nature. This applies to the divisions between genders, ethnicities or religions. For some men in the alt-right, the first hierarchy they hoped to maintain was the one that entitled them to dominance over women.
"Men are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them."
- Margaret Atwood
Misogyny isn't the only entry point. Others wind up in the far right through Islamophobia or fear of immigrants. But misogyny has played a significant role in the development of the alt-right.
Since before GamerGate, a 2015 campaign of targeted harassment against women who worked in the video game industry, the alt-right has worked to launch co-ordinated online attacks. During that period, many of the alt-right's key leaders realized that they could marshal an army of anonymous online trolls to intimidate their political opponents.
The Daily Stormer, which describes itself as the largest alt-right site on the internet, describes its fan base as a "troll army" and regularly posts links to the personal social media accounts of its targets.
It was through this online culture, built around harassment (especially of women), that Montreal's alt-right developed. The users of Montreal Storm and the people who organized real-life actions met each other through the Daily Stormer. Zeiger pulled individuals out of the Daily Stormer's message boards and began trying to organize them into a real-world force. Before Zeiger was the subject of a Montreal Gazette report, his crew was becoming more and more connected to the real-world far-right.
But before any of that real-life action happened, many in Zeiger's crew honed their hatred on the internet, targeting women and anyone who stepped out of line.
"Margaret Atwood says men are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them," Emer O'Toole said, reflecting on her experience of being attacked by an online angry mob of alt-righters.
"One thing that we can take from that is laugh at them. If you pick one, and you flirt with one, they become so embarrassed that they make all the others go away."

Full text: Organizers of Saturday's so-called "United for Border Protection" protest have changed the location of the event from the irregular border-crossing site at Roxham Rd. to the official Lacolle border crossing.
The location change appeared Thursday in a post on the Facebook page of Storm Alliance, a splinter group of the openly anti-immigrant group Soldiers of Odin.
Solidarity Across Borders, which describes itself as a migrant justice network based in Montreal, hailed the change in location as a victory for anti-racist groups. The network claims media coverage( http://montrealgazette.com/news/far-right-and-anti-fascist-groups-to-protest-at-roxham-rd-on-saturday ) of its planned counter-protest Saturday at Roxham Rd. spurred the change of location.
Storm Alliance spokesperson Eric Trudel posted a video Wednesday afternoon in which he referred to "certain changes in the plans in order to keep everyone safe." In that video, he urged members of Storm Alliance, Les Patriotes, La Meute and other "Quebec identity groups, more commonly known as extreme right, racist groups" to attend the rally in great numbers, adding he would be disappointed if fewer than 200 protesters showed up.
In another video posted Thursday morning, he warned protesters not to show up at the rally site alone. He said group leaders would let protesters know by late Friday or Saturday morning where they should gather before the protest, so that they can move to the protest site together. Otherwise, he warned, Storm Alliance could not guarantee the safety of protesters.
He also said his group is concerned about infiltration, so he urged would-be protesters to register with regional group leaders and to bring identification with them to the rally. He said those who were not registered and did not have ID would be turned away from the protest.
Meanwhile, pro-migrant, anti-racist groups plan to go ahead with their "Open the Borders/Refugees Welcome" event on Saturday at Roxham Rd., an event organizers described as "festive and family-friendly." In a statement issued Thursday, Solidarity Across Borders said that event will go ahead and they also plan to maintain a "festive and determined presence" at the Lacolle border crossing on Saturday "in order to counter the racist far-right."
"The anti-immigrant Storm Alliance and their allies announced the change today, after seeing media coverage announcing the Open the Borders/Refugees Welcome demonstration planned by Solidarity Across Borders, Montreal Antifasciste and allied groups," said Solidarity Across Borders in its news release. "The decision by Storm Alliance to cancel their presence at Roxham Rd. is a defeat for the anti-immigrant far-right in Quebec."

Montreal pro-am hoops league Ballers Echelon tips off Friday night

Author: Peters, Dave

Full text: Orlando Magic forward Khem Birch was a bit skeptical at first. He had heard about previous failed efforts to launch a professional-amateur basketball league in his native Montreal.
"There have been people who've been trying to do this for a long time," said Birch. "So, in my mind, I was just like 'again?' "
The Buckley brothers, Damian, Dwayne, Dwight and Dillon, are the brains behind Ballers Echelon, a pro-am summer basketball league that's based in Montreal and slated for tip-off on Friday at 7:15 p.m. at the Concordia University Athletic Complex at the Loyola campus.
All four Buckley brothers played basketball in Montreal while growing up. Damian and Dwayne were all-stars for Concordia, and Damian is an assistant coach for the Stingers. But it was the youngest, Dillon, who came up with the Ballers Echelon idea before getting his brothers involved.
"I came to them and I was like 'listen, this is what I have in place and I think this could be something bigger than what I'm making it,' " Dillon said.
Launching a pro-am hoops league is difficult and the Buckleys are starting from scratch. Unlike the Toronto-based Crown League, Ballers Echelon doesn't have any big name sponsors or partnerships. Players also pay a fee to join the league and there's the added obstacle of availability, specifically for the pro players who can only commit to a few games because of their schedules.
There are also smaller issues, such as ordering uniforms, lining up people to run the scoring tables and staffing the canteen for food and drink sales.
"This is an everyday venture," Damian said.
Ballers Echelon claims to be the first of its kind in the city. The league will feature professional players, including Birch and two-time NBA champion Joel Anthony, on a limited-commitment basis. Ballers Echelon will also feature other professionals - such as former Syracuse guard Kris Joseph and National Basketball League of Canada star Kevin Loiselle - as well as Canadian university stars and former NCAA players.
"You want to play against the best so that you can push yourself to get better," Loiselle said. "(Ballers Echelon) is going to help a lot."
"In the summers, we do runs, but it's not the same as getting this kind of competition with games and actual refs," Stingers point-guard Ricardo Monge said. "It gives you the opportunity not to lose that feel for the game during the summer."
Dwight Buckley watches the from the sidelines during Ballers Echelon's combine at Concordia University in Montreal on Sunday, May 13, 2018.
Six teams will play until early July. All games will take place at the John Dore Court, named after the longtime Stingers men's basketball coach.
"In every big city across the United States and Toronto, there's a pro-am league," said Damian Buckley. "We don't have one here in Montreal. We have a lot of talented players, even way back when we used to play."
Last Sunday, the league held its inaugural draft, combine and media day at the Concordia University Athletic Complex. Coaches were on hand to scout players scrimmaging in the gymnasium before the draft took place in a conference room one floor up. Birch was the first player selected in the draft.
Two of the most well-known summer leagues, outside of the NBA's, are the U.S.-based Drew League and the Crown League. While NBA stars James Harden and DeMar DeRozan have made appearances in the Drew, the Crown has boasted its own star power since play began in 2015. The league has a sponsorship deal with Nike and has featured a number of top players, including Anthony, Miami Heat forward Kelly Olynyk, former No. 1 overall NBA Draft pick Anthony Bennett and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson.
Ballers Echelon commissioner Dwight Walton, a Montrealer and former Canadian international pro player, said the goal in Montreal is to reach the heights of the Crown League.
"This league is needed for provincial pride," Walton said. "Ontario is always the province that we talk about for basketball in this country."
It might take some time before Ballers Echelon reaches the status of the Crown or the Drew, but players like Birch see potential.
"Basketball's getting bigger in Montreal," said Birch, who averaged 4.2 points a game in 42 games with the Magic this season. "It's trendy right now. Everyone wants to play basketball. The timing is perfect and I think it can only get better from now."
Ballers Echelon's inaugural games Friday will see the Cyclone against the Wildfire at 7:15 p.m., followed by the Storm facing the Eclipse at 9 p.m. All Ballers Echelon games will be played at the Concordia University Athletic Complex at 7200 Sherbrooke St. W. On Saturday there are three games on tap at 3, 5:15 and 7 p.m.
Tickets for Friday's games cost $5 for adults $3 for youths age 8-17. Tickets for Saturday's games, and for the rest of the season, cost $7 for adults and $5 for youths age 8-17. Admission for children younger than 7 is free. Tickets can be purchased at the Concordia University Athletic Complex. Season membership cards, $50 for adults and $30 for youths age 8-17, can be purchased at ballersechelonlg@gmail.com( mailto:ballersechelonlg@gmail.com )

Far-right and anti-fascist groups to protest at Roxham Rd. on Saturday

Full text: Hundreds of people are expected to converge on the U.S. border at Roxham Rd. Saturday in yet another showdown between far-right groups protesting what they call "illegal" immigration through the porous border and counter-protesters hoping to drown them out.
Storm Alliance, created by the splintering of the anti-immigrant Soldiers of Odin, is planning a "United for border protection" protest at 1 p.m. On their Facebook page, members were busily trying to arrange transport from various Quebec regions to Hemmingford.
But counter-protesters, mostly migrant justice groups from both sides of the border, hope to arrive in greater numbers starting at 11 a.m.
At a news conference Wednesday, they said their message was simple: Refugees are welcome, racists are not.
"We have to stop the rise of the far right in Quebec," said Aaron Lakoff, of Solidarity Across Borders. "(Asylum-seekers) have no choice but to cross at Roxham Rd. because of the shameful Safe Third Country Agreement. ... But contrary to what politicians and journalists are saying, there is no migrant crisis."
The Safe Third Country Agreement stipulates that refugee claimants must apply for asylum in the first safe country they can, which often means in the U.S., for which it is easier to obtain a visitor's visa. But it doesn't apply to unofficial border crossings, like Roxham Rd.
"But they are not safe in the U.S. because of (President Donald) Trump's xenophobic and racist policies," Lakoff said.
Hashim Shaban's experience is a case in point.
Upon entry into the U.S. from Mexico, Shaban, a stateless Palestinian from the Gaza Strip, was detained in Arizona while he awaited his refugee hearing, he said at the press conference Wednesday. His application for asylum was ultimately rejected, but he continued to be detained for 18 months because the U.S. couldn't find a country that would accept him.
When he was finally released, he travelled through Michigan to Windsor, Ont. and applied for refugee status at the official border crossing. But because of the Safe Third Country agreement, he was sent back to the U.S.
When Shaban crossed into Canada via Roxham Rd. several months later, he learned that because he had applied at an official border crossing, he cannot apply in Canada again.
Saturday's duelling protests will come on the heels of several other protests against the far right in Montreal: one, after a Nazi flag was waved( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/condo-owners-denounce-nazi-flag-waver-but-decline-to-identify-him ) from a condo building in Park-Extension; another, at the home of influential neo-Nazi recruiter( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anti-racists-to-march-in-rosemont-la-petite-patrie-against-neo-nazi-on-saturday ) Zeiger, in Rosemont-Petite-Patrie.

Alt-right in Montreal: Anti-fascists ramp up fight against neo-Nazis( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-anti-fascists-ramp-up-fight-against-neo-nazis )
It will also be the third Storm Alliance protest at the border, since migrants began to cross at Roxham Rd. in greater numbers in 2017. Last September, an estimated 100 people marched with them, including local neo-Nazis Shawn Beauvais-Macdonald and Vincent Bélanger Mercure, both of whom had joined the alt-right protest last year in Charlottesville.
Along with other far-right groups like La Meute and Atalante, Storm Alliance wants the federal government to stop all immigration through Roxham Rd.
In their invitation to supporters to join the protest, Storm Alliance suggests that migrants put excessive strain on health and social services when Quebecers already have to "tighten their belts."
Olivier Prud'homme, a housing-rights activist in Montreal with POPIR, said that argument, often reused by Quebec politicians, is false - refugees and migrants have nothing to do with cuts to social services.
"Refugees aren't the cause of austerity," Prud'homme said at the news conference. "They are victims of it just like all other poor and working people in Quebec, regardless of where they're from."
From January 1 to April 30, 2018, the RCMP intercepted 7,612 people crossing the border irregularly across Canada, 7,307 of them in Quebec. That's about 60 per day.
But that number is likely to rise through the summer months, and as whole groups of people lose their immigration status in the U.S.
On May 4, the Trump administration announced that 57,000 Hondurans who have been in the U.S. for 20 years would soon lose their legal status.
Lakoff said the counter-protesters will offer a "festive" family-friendly atmosphere to show people crossing that they are welcome in Canada. But they will also use "direct action" to block Storm Alliance protesters from reaching the border, he said.

Anti-Fascists Vs. The Alt-Right; Taking The Battle To The Streets

Full text: For nine months the anti-fascists chased the infamous neo-Nazi Zeiger, scouring the web for clues that might link him to someone in the real world.
Finally those clues led them to a quiet street corner in Montreal's Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough. They watched the door of what they thought was his apartment for about 40 minutes before they decided to ring the bell and walk away.
"And for a good 20 seconds, I was thinking, 'ahh f--he's not there," said Venkman, one of the anti-fascists who uncovered Zeiger's true identity. He uses a pseudonym to avoid retaliation. "Then, lo and behold, he came out on the porch."
"I had been staring at that mother---for months, so it's no mistake - I know exactly what that guy looks like," said Venkman. "I was elated."
The information that linked Zeiger, one of North America's most notorious neo-Nazis, to Montreal IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput comes primarily from the detective work of people like Venkman. Their methods, beliefs and confrontational approach place them outside the mainstream political spectrum.
But after news of Zeiger's activities in Montreal broke two weeks ago, it's difficult to ignore the role they play in Quebec's struggle against right-wing extremism.
Activists regularly infiltrate farright networks to get intelligence and feed that information to others in the movement. Sometimes that means setting up fake accounts on far-right forum websites to monitor them, or systematically listening to neo-Nazi podcasts. Other times, it means getting emails from anonymous sources.
"So by cross-referencing the information that Source A, Source B, and Source C have, we can start building a picture," Venkman said.
There are also moles inside the far right, according to another group contacted by the Montreal Gazette.
The boldest among them act as double agents. But occasionally, members inside these extremist groups develop a guilty conscience and inform on their peers.
"The internet has itself become a space of contention," said Marcos Ancelovici, Canada Research Chair in the Sociology of Social Conflicts at the Université du Québec à Montréal. "It is not simply a means for carrying out actions in the real world; it is a battlefield in its own right, with its troops, movements, trenches and minefields."
The Montreal alt-right often spoke about anti-fascists, or "antifa," in a private chatroom. Users described attending anti-fascist events, saying "I just went to hit antifa." They share anti-fascist videos, encouraging others to watch them because "they clearly watch us."
For the Montreal anti-fascists who say they found Zeiger, this is less a game of cat-and-mouse than a matter of self-preservation.
"As soon as they exist, they become a threat in Jewish people's lives, people of colour's lives, women's lives, queer and gender non-conforming people's lives," said Venkman.
Montreal's anti-fascist movement began tracking down Zeiger following his prominent appearance at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.
They watched livestreams of the neo-Nazi demonstration. They read his Daily Stormer posts, and listened to hours of podcasts. When he slipped up during a March 11 podcast and revealed he went to high school in Outremont, they dug through a trove of old yearbooks.
Then they caught a break - they obtained thousands of messages from a private chatroom where Zeiger organized. There, amid the swamp of racist memes and violent fantasies, Zeiger revealed his home address. He had invited his neo-Nazi crew to a barbecue at his house.
That allowed them to find Sohier Chaput, and compare him to their photos of Zeiger.
The Montreal Gazette has confirmed that both Zeiger and Sohier Chaput live at the Rosemont address. Gazette journalists have left messages for Sohier Chaput through his landlord, brother, father and Facebook account. They have sent him a letter by courier, but as of Tuesday evening, he hasn't responded.
Venkman says rooting out racists and neo-Nazis is everyone's job.
Last week, a Montreal anti-fascist group organized a rally outside Zeiger's apartment. The march followed a postering campaign in which images of Zeiger and other suspected Montreal white supremacists were affixed to mailboxes, bus stops and lampposts. The idea, organizers said, was to "make racists afraid again."
The anti-fascists doubt police had taken any meaningful action to track Zeiger until he was unmasked two weeks ago. Montreal's hate crimes unit won't confirm whether it is investigating Zeiger. The task force does not actively monitor hateful or extremist websites.
But Lt.-Det. Line Lemay, who works on the task force, says her unit will look into online propaganda if someone reports it.
"Investigating online hate presents some unique challenges," Lemay said. "To start with, where is the person spreading this hate? Are they in Canada, and if so, what province are they in?" If investigators can determine that a Montreal-based user is violating Section 319 of the Criminal Code, which makes it a crime to spread hateful propaganda against an identifiable group, then they can arrest him. If it isn't clear that they've crossed the line from offensive behaviour to hate speech, police can issue a warning.
Meanwhile, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux have publicly denounced neo-Nazis. Venkman said he is not encouraged.
"The way we see things is that the political establishment is feeding the narrative," he said.
Venkman pointed out that last fall the Liberal government stripped down its public inquiry into systemic racism. The hearings were created in the aftermath of the Quebec City mosque shooting. But as the start date approached, the Parti Québécois and Coalition Avenir Québec claimed it would unfairly paint Quebec as a hostile place to religious and ethnic minorities. After a heated public debate, the Liberals moved the commission's public hearings behind closed doors.
Ancelovici said, "The current political discourse of mainstream political parties, such as the CAQ and the PQ, contribute to normalizing xenophobia and Islamophobia.
"In turn, (it) grants legitimacy to organizations like La Meute and Storm Alliance and even more radical, neo-fascist ones such as the Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Soldiers of Odin and Atalante."

Full text: They parked across the street from his apartment.
No one got out of the car at first. Instead, the anti-fascists waited for more than half an hour, hoping to catch a glimpse of someone coming in or out of the building, hoping to ID their target: Zeiger.
For nine months they chased the infamous neo-Nazi - scouring the web for clues that might link him to someone in the real world.
Their search took them to weird places: from YouTube videos about magic Nazi frogs to a series of Quebec funeral notices and, finally, a photo of a 16-year-old boy in a high school yearbook.
Now it had led them to a quiet street corner near a playground in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough. With any luck, Zeiger would peek his head out the door just long enough to be identified.
About 40 minutes had passed when they decided one of them should casually walk up to the apartment and see if anyone was inside. They rang the bell and walked away.
"And for a good 20 seconds, I was thinking, 'ahh f-k he's not there," said Venkman, one of the anti-fascists who uncovered Zeiger's true identity. He uses a pseudonym to avoid retaliation, and spoke to the Montreal Gazette on the condition that his identity be protected. "He's not' - and then, lo and behold, he came out on the porch, he looked down, looked around on each side, and then went back in."
The man he says is Zeiger looked like a normal guy. He was dressed in khaki pants and a white T-shirt and had a receding hairline, just like in the photos he posted of himself online.
"I had been staring at that motherf-er for months, so it's no mistake - I know exactly what that guy looks like," said Venkman. "I was elated."
The information that linked Zeiger, one of North America's most notorious neo-Nazis, to Montreal IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput comes primarily from the detective work of people like Venkman. Their methods, beliefs and confrontational approach place them outside the mainstream political spectrum.
But after news of Zeiger's activities in Montreal broke two weeks ago, it's difficult to ignore the role they play in Quebec's struggle against right-wing extremism.
***
Efforts to unmask Zeiger were just one front in a larger battle between anti-fascists and the so-called alt-right, especially the neo-Nazi wing that Zeiger represented.
Activists regularly infiltrate far-right networks to get intelligence and feed that information to others in the movement. Sometimes that means setting up fake accounts on far-right forum websites, or systematically listening to neo-Nazi podcasts as they are released. Other times, it means getting emails from anonymous sources.
"So by cross-referencing the information that Source A, Source B and Source C have, we can start building a picture," Venkman said.
"The current political discourse of mainstream political parties, such as the CAQ and the PQ, contribute to normalizing xenophobia and Islamophobia," one anti-fascist member says. (Vincenzo D'Alto/Montreal Gazette)
There are also moles inside the far right, according to another group contacted by the Montreal Gazette.
The boldest among them act as double agents. But occasionally, members inside these extremist groups develop a guilty conscience and inform on their peers.
"The internet has itself become a space of contention," said Marcos Ancelovici, Canada Research Chair in the Sociology of Social Conflicts at the Université du Québec à Montréal. "It is not simply a means for carrying out actions in the real world; it is a battlefield in its own right, with its troops, movements, trenches, and minefields."
The Montreal alt-right often spoke about anti-fascists, or "antifa," in their closed chat room, mentioning the term 65 times between August 2016 and January 2018. Users described attending anti-fascist events, saying "I just went to hit antifa." They met to plan the failed disruption of an anti-fascist workshop series at Concordia University in March 2017. They share anti-fascist videos, encouraging others to watch them because "they clearly watch us."
For the Montreal anti-fascists who say they found Zeiger, this is less a game of cat-and-mouse than a matter of self-preservation.
"As soon as they exist, they become a threat in Jewish people's lives, people of colour's lives, women's lives, queer and gender non-conforming people's lives," said Venkman. "Their mere existence is a threat to a lot of us."
It was with this sense of urgency that Montreal's anti-fascist movement began tracking down Zeiger following his prominent appearance at the Unite the Right rally( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-how-charlottesville-exposed-the-key-players-in-the-local-white-nationalist-movement ) in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. They watched livestreams of the neo-Nazi demonstration to identify as many clear photos of him as possible.
They read his Daily Stormer posts, and listened to hours worth of podcasts on which he appeared, hoping to gather scraps of useful information.
When he slipped up during a March 11 podcast and revealed he went to high school in Outremont, they dug through a trove of old yearbooks. They sifted through funeral notices before finding one that may have been for his grandmother.
"In this line of work, you can't leave any stone unturned," said Buenaventura - not his real name - another anti-fascist who worked on the Zeiger project. "A lot of the clues that were found were in places that you wouldn't have thought to look."
"Particularly since this guy ... he has been fairly careful about what he reveals. And I think that a lot of his missteps have to do with his own ego, particularly around Charlottesville."

Then they caught a break - they obtained thousands of messages from a private chat room where Zeiger organized. There, amid the swamp of racist meme and violent fantasies, Zeiger revealed his home address. He had invited his neo-Nazi crew to a barbecue at his house.
That allowed them to find Gabriel Sohier Chaput, and compare him to their photos of Zeiger.
The network of anti-fascists worked hundreds of hours in their effort to unmask Zeiger. And it all culminated on that day, sitting in a car outside his apartment.
The Montreal Gazette has confirmed( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ) that both Zeiger and Sohier Chaput live at the address in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Journalists have left messages for Sohier Chaput with his landlord, his brother, his father and his Facebook account. They have sent him a letter by courier and knocked on his front door, but as of Tuesday evening, he hasn't responded.

"We often say that a racist can be a racist in their own living room, but as soon as they try to organize, then it becomes everybody's problem," Venkman said.
He says rooting out racists and neo-Nazis is a job that everyone should play a part in.
Last week, a local anti-fascist group organized a rally outside Zeiger's Rosemont apartment, where they alternated between chants of "punch a Nazi in the face" and anti-racist slogans. There was a brief standoff with riot police who acted as a barrier between the marchers and a small contingent of counter-protesters from the far-right Soldiers of Odin.
The march followed a postering campaign in which images of Zeiger and other suspected Montreal white supremacists were affixed to mailboxes, bus stops and lamp posts. The idea, organizers said, was to "make racists afraid again."
The chat logs obtained by the anti-fascists show that Zeiger had been recruiting in Montreal and organizing white supremacist meetings in the city since at least 2016. It's unclear whether Montreal police caught wind of these meetings or the anti-Semitic propaganda being spread from Zeiger's computer, despite his high profile in the movement.
But the anti-fascists doubt that police had taken any meaningful action to track Zeiger until he was unmasked two weeks ago.
"They could've found this guy probably in a fraction of the time that we did with practically no resources," said Buenaventura. "It should have been fairly a no-brainer for them to find this guy if they actually considered him a threat. We considered him a threat, and so we spent a considerable amount of time trying to get him out."
As a matter of protocol, Montreal's anti-hate crimes unit won't confirm whether it is investigating Zeiger or was aware of his activities previously. The task force does not actively monitor hateful or extremist websites.
But Lieutenant-Detective Line Lemay, who works on the task force, says her unit will look into online propaganda if someone reports it.
"Investigating online hate presents some unique challenges," Lemay said. "To start with, where is the person spreading this hate? Are they in Canada and if so what province are they in? Are they here or in another city?"
If investigators can determine that a Montreal-based user is violating Section 319 of the Criminal Code, which makes it a crime to spread hateful propaganda against an identifiable group, then they can arrest him. But if it isn't clear that he has crossed the line from offensive behaviour to hate speech, police can issue a warning.

Meanwhile, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux have publicly denounced neo-Nazis. Venkman said he expected that, but isn't encouraged.
"Yes, of course you're against Nazis, but you're also part of the problem!," he said. The way we see things is that the political establishment is feeding the narrative."
Venkman says Coiteux's Liberal party "scrapped the very minimal thing they could have done that would have helped, which was the Commission on Systemic Racism last year."
Last fall the Liberal government stripped down its public inquiry into systemic racism. The hearings were created in the aftermath of the Quebec City mosque shooting, in which six people were murdered.
But as the start date approached, the Parti Québécois and Coalition Avenir Québec claimed it would unfairly paint Quebec as a hostile place to religious and ethnic minorities. After a heated public debate, the Liberals renamed the commission and moved its public hearings behind closed doors.
Ancelovici said that "the current political discourse of mainstream political parties, such as the CAQ and the PQ, contribute to normalizing xenophobia and Islamophobia."
"In turn, (it) grants legitimacy to organizations like La Meute and Storm Alliance and even more radical, neo-fascist ones such as the Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Soldiers of Odin and Atalante."

When asked about the posters identifying Zeiger, Venkman said he believes helping residents identify local neo-Nazis is crucial to pushing them out of the community.
"This guy has been living in this neighbourhood for seemingly a very long time," Venkman said. "Petite-Patrie is a historically working class and immigrant (area). This guy has been living there among this very tolerant, very left-leaning neighbourhood of Montreal, so it's just important to expose him to his neighbours and his community."
According to Ancelovici, Montreal "definitely has a vibrant anti-fascist scene. ... But you cannot think about the anti-fascist movement in a vacuum. It builds on other social movements.
"In this respect, it is worth pointing out that Montreal is a hotbed of radical (left-wing) activism, the strongest in Canada and among the most dynamic in North America."
Anti-fascism, Ancelovici said, has "a movement-countermovement dynamic" with the far-right. "Anti-fascists organize and mobilize when the radical right and neo-fascists seem to become more vocal and grow in the public sphere. Inversely, when the radical right and neo-fascists fade away or decline, anti-fascist organizing moves to the back burner and left-wing activists resume their previous militant work."
For now, anti-fascists continue to focus on disrupting far-right networks in the city. They say beyond targeting individuals in leadership positions, anti-fascist action also sends a message to would-be recruits.
"Another goal is to send a very clear and loud message that if you engage in this type of bulls-t, then we will find you and we will put you through the same treatment," Buenaventura said. "You will be outed to your community."

Full text: The Parti Québécois' would-be candidate in Maskinongé, Muguette Paillé, will no longer be running in the fall election, after a slew of her comments on far-right social media sites were brought to light Tuesday.
Although PQ Leader Jean-François Lisée called her the "voice of popular wisdom" only five days ago, his press attaché confirmed that after discussions relating to Paillé's controversial posts, she took herself out of the running.
Her comments, on sites like the Mouvement Républicain du Québec and Ensemble Nous Vaincrons, numbered in the hundreds and included repeated references to the Quebec premier as "Cheikh Couillard" and to the prime minister as "miniPET" (as in mini Pierre Elliott Trudeau), often calling him a "thief" and a "traitor."
Her online footprint also included vitriolic and hateful comments about Muslims.
On a closed Facebook group called Non à la Québécophobie et au racisme envers les Québécois (No to Quebecphobia and racism toward Quebecers), for example, she shared a fake news post May 2 about U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren that quoted the senator as saying "If women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it!"
Paillé replied: "So we could put her at the top of the list."
On MRQ, when one man characterized Muslims in Quebec as "invaders," she commented "Quebec for Quebecers of the Quebec nation."
Neither Lisée nor Paillé appeared wise or popular by Tuesday afternoon, when the short rise and fall of Paillé was complete.
Lisée, who recruited Paillé himself and tweeted his approval of her last Thursday, promptly erased that tweet Tuesday morning, as well as a Facebook post welcoming her to the fold.
Paillé, for her part, deactivated her personal Facebook page during the weekend, replacing it with a public page announcing her candidacy for the PQ - but not before some were able to sift through it and explore the links.
Xavier Camus, a philosophy professor at Collège Ahuntsic who investigates the far-right in his spare time, said it took him about five hours to get through Paillé's online comments to publish a synopsis of them( https://xaviercamus.com/ ) Tuesday morning.
He said Paillé, who had hoped to run in the last provincial election with Pauline Marois, was already well-known as a diehard PQ supporter.
But she was also a member of four far-right and/or nationalist groups whose membership often overlaps with that of La Meute and Storm Alliance.
"She doesn't have a structured ideology," Camus said. "She's what I would call an ordinary person influenced by anti-Islam discourse, and by others. ... But she also goes onto MRQ and NAQAREQ and tries to bring people to the PQ - to bring them voters and militants. But does she realize she's on a forum of the extreme right? They all think they're fighting "barbarians" and pedophiles. They don't see themselves as the extreme right."
Paillé, who is from Ste-Angèle-de-Prémont in the Mauricie region, about two hours east of Montreal, did not return phone calls Tuesday. Prior to last week, her only brush with fame was that she had asked a question to party leaders during a federal election debate in 2011: What were the leaders going to do to help people over 50 living in the regions find employment?
She was the talk of Quebec for days to come.
"There were discussions with Mme Paillé about certain ideas and comments on social media," said Lisée's press attaché, Bruno Pierre-Cyr, on Tuesday. "So she decided to leave us. ... There had been verifications made (of Paillé's online comments), but we were not aware of all of them."

U.S. rally outed alt-right players; Identities Of Quebec White Nationalists Exposed Afterviolent 'Unite The Right' March

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally empty-handed.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the altright use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us." The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
Within an hour of the attack, users of an encrypted white supremacist chat room in Montreal began posting memes congratulating the attacker and describing his vehicle as a "car of peace." Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord, an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of comingout party for the alt-right.
See CHARLOTTESVILLE ON NP3 The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned. In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere.
Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Belanger-Mercure would become public figures.
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville.
It quickly went viral.
The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal. It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.
In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post-Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Belanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," Friendly-Fash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Belanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with The Canadian Press, Belanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.
When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute, the largest farright organization in Quebec.
In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography.
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-Mac-Donald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Belanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f--ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it.
He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding.
That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind." "Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose." Another key Montreal player goes by the username "Late-OfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how Late-OfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, Friendly-Fash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server.
There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville.
Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017.
That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propaganda around Concordia and McGill in the past.
Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Federation des Quebecois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.
The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views.
"We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc." One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups.
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alt-right-in-montreal-encrypted-messages-show-white-supremacist-mindset ), an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of coming-out party for the alt-right. The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned.
In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere. Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Bélanger-Mercure would become public figures.
***
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIrcB1sAN8I ). It quickly went viral.
The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ). It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.
In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Bélanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," FriendlyFash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Bélanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full [fascist] and posted the 14 words with my profile picture [on Facebook]," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with the Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
***
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.
When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/pigs-head-was-discussed-on-facebook-before-quebec-city-incident ), the largest far-right organization in Quebec.
In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography( http://montrealgazette.com/news/suspended-la-meute-member-spotted-at-quebec-city-protest ).
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-MacDonald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Bélanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f-ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it. He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding. That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind."
"Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose."
***
Another key Montreal player goes by the username "LateOfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how LateOfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, FriendlyFash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server. There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville. Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017. That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propganda around Concordia and McGill in the past. Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.

The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views. "We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc."
One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups. The Daily Stormer, one of the largest white nationalist news sites on the internet, was kicked off American, Chinese and Russian servers before being pushed onto the dark web, a network of websites that are only accessible through a special internet browser.
"Charlottesville marked the beginning of a sharp downturn for the [far-right]," Balgord said. "Their ability to move money around was severely constrained. Their ability to operate on social media and use chat platforms was severely constrained."
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally empty-handed.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the altright use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us."
The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.

In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post-Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Bélanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," Friendly-Fash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Bélanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.
When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute, the largest farright organization in Quebec.
In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography.
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-Mac-Donald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Bélanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f--ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it.
He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding.
That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind."
"Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose."
Another key Montreal player goes by the username "Late-OfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how Late-OfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, Friendly-Fash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server.
There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville.
Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017.
That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propaganda around Concordia and McGill in the past.
Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.
The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views.
"We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc."
One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups.
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally emptyhanded.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the alt-right use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us."
The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
Within an hour of the attack, users of an encrypted white supremacist chat room in Montreal began posting memes congratulating the attacker and describing his vehicle as a "car of peace."
Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord, an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of coming-out party for the alt-right. The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned. In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere. Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Bélanger-Mercure would become public figures.
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville. It quickly went viral.
The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal. It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.

In an interview with the Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.

When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute, the largest far-right organization in Quebec.
In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography.
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-MacDonald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Bélanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f***ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
Signage unfurled from an overpass that reads "Unmask the enemies of the nation." It appears on the Facebook page of Atalante, a fascist organization based primarily in Quebec City. For use with a feature on the alt-right in Quebec to be published in print and online May 14.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it. He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding. That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind."
"Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose."

Another key Montreal player goes by the username "LateOfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how LateOfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, FriendlyFash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server. There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville. Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017. That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propaganda around Concordia and McGill in the past. Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.

The photo appears on the Facebook page of Atalante, a fascist organization based primarily in Quebec City. For use with a feature on the alt-right in Quebec to be published in print and online May 14.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.
The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views. "We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc."
One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups. The Daily Stormer, one of the largest white nationalist news sites on the internet, was kicked off American, Chinese and Russian servers before being pushed onto the dark web, a network of websites that are only accessible through a special internet browser.
"Charlottesville marked the beginning of a sharp downturn for the [far-right]," Balgord said. "Their ability to move money around was severely constrained. Their ability to operate on social media and use chat platforms was severely constrained."
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally empty-handed.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the alt-right use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us."
The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
Within an hour of the attack, users of an encrypted white supremacist chat room in Montreal began posting memes congratulating the attacker and describing his vehicle as a "car of peace."
Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord, an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of coming-out party for the alt-right. The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned.
In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere. Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Bélanger-Mercure would become public figures.

On Facebook, he described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist."

For use on Monday, May 14, online and print about alt-right groups in Montreal.
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville. It quickly went viral.
The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal. It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.
In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post-Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Bélanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," FriendlyFash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Bélanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full [fascist] and posted the 14 words with my profile picture [on Facebook]," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with the Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.

In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography.
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-Mac-Donald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Bélanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f--ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it.
He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding.
That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind."
"Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose."
Another key Montreal player goes by the username "Late-OfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how Late-OfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, Friendly-Fash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server.
There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville.
Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017.
That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propaganda around Concordia and McGill in the past.
Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.
The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views.
"We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc."
One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups.
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally empty-handed.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the altright use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us."
The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
Within an hour of the attack, users of an encrypted white supremacist chat room in Montreal began posting memes congratulating the attacker and describing his vehicle as a "car of peace."
Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord, an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of comingout party for the alt-right.
The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned. In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere.
Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Bélanger-Mercure would become public figures.
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville.
It quickly went viral.
The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal. It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.
In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post-Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Bélanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," Friendly-Fash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Bélanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.
When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute, the largest farright organization in Quebec.

There is, however, a person who uses the pseudonym "Date of Lies," or sometimes simply "Date" who regularly appears on white supremacist podcasts and in neo-Nazi literature connected to Montreal and Quebec.
It was Date who had asked to buy shields and gear from American users ahead of Charlottesville.
Date has also appeared on podcasts with Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald - who used the alias Friendly Fash (two words, rather than one), just like in Montreal Storm.
Date identifies himself as a leader within Generation Identity Canada in a white supremacist podcast from October 2017.
That group, which recently rebranded itself as ID Canada, has posted propaganda around Concordia and McGill in the past.
Date also claimed to have been involved in the "Make Canada Great Again" posters that went up around McGill shortly after Donald Trump's election.
In an interview with Harfang, the secret newsletter of the neo-Nazi group Fédération des Québécois de Souche, Date says that Generation Identity was formerly called Alt Right Montreal.
During the same interview, he also claims to have marched in Charlottesville.
The evolution of Generation Identity Canada's branding is reflective of a shift in strategy for various alt-right groups. As the term "alt-right" became toxic after the violence in Charlottesville, the groups which organized under its umbrella attempted to rebrand.
The switch from Generation Identity to ID Canada reflects the push, exemplified by Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer, for groups to adopt "patriotic" positions as cover for their white supremacist ideology.
ID Canada, whose membership seems to be mostly drawn from the Montreal Storm crew, appears to be an attempt to bring such a strategy to life. The group refers to itself as "identitarian," drawing on the European far-right theory. They frame their actions specifically in the language of patriotism, and reverence for (white) Canadian history.
On its frequently asked questions page, ID Canada even denies harbouring racist views.
"We do not see ourselves as superior to others on the simple basis of our skin colour. ... We are an identitarian movement that seeks to preserve our culture, customs, traditions and values etc."
One of the lasting effects of the violence in Charlottesville was its blow to the far-right's ability to raise money and spread propaganda online. In late August 2017, PayPal began cracking down on groups that use its site to fund hate groups.
Shutting down the alt-right's main platforms of communication hampered its ability to recruit, spread propaganda and radicalize new people, Balgord said.
"By exposing them, we contain them. By driving them off these platforms, we contain them. They never fully go away but we minimize the damage they do."

Full text: They didn't want to show up to the white nationalist rally empty-handed.
The Unite the Right march in Virginia would be the largest white supremacist gathering in a generation and the small, militant crew of Quebecers were eager to make an impression.
A few days before the long drive south, one of their leaders logged onto an American alt-right forum with a request.
"We are about 20 guys driving through the border from Canada and we obviously will not be able to bring protective gear like shields and so on through the border agents," wrote Date, a prominent Montreal white nationalist. "If you've got extra ones, some of our members are interested in buying them from you over there."
The following night, on Aug. 10, 2017, one of the group members withdrew $850 in Bitcoin to help cover expenses. Activists in the altright use the online currency because it's unregulated and difficult to trace.
They left for Charlottesville a few hours later.
On Aug. 11, the Montrealers would participate in a torch march through Charlottesville, blending into a crowd that chanted "Blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us."
The next day, they faced off with a crowd of anti-fascists in the southern college town. As the rally wound down, a white supremacist drove his car into a mass of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
Within an hour of the attack, users of an encrypted white supremacist chat room in Montreal began posting memes congratulating the attacker and describing his vehicle as a "car of peace."
Last month, the Montreal Gazette obtained roughly 12,000 closed messages from the closed "Montreal Storm" server on Discord, an encrypted chat service. Those documents, combined with information from sources close to the group, indicate that the initial thrill of Charlottesville quickly gave way to a culture of paranoia within the group.
Those days in Charlottesville were meant to be a sort of comingout party for the alt-right.
The torch march, the shields, the clubs, the guns, the beatings - these were meant to show the world that the white nationalist movement was a force to be reckoned with. Charlottesville was going to be their Kristallnacht.
It didn't go as planned. In the backlash that followed Heyer's death, the alt-right began to implode. Waves of men who participated had their identities revealed, lost their jobs and friends, and dropped out of the movement.
Previously small anti-fascist demonstrations suddenly numbered in the thousands, in Boston, Berkeley and elsewhere.
Heyer became a martyr, a symbol of resistance against the forces of hate.
It was in the days after Charlottesville that Montreal's Shawn Beauvais-MacDonald and Vincent Bélanger-Mercure would become public figures.
VICE News released a 20-minute documentary about the march six days after Charlottesville.
It quickly went viral. The opening scenes show American white supremacist Christopher Cantwell talking in a park to a handful of sympathizers, one of whom has a Quebec accent, and another who is wearing a T-shirt associated with Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations. The man with the accent was introduced in a separate live-stream of the event as Zeiger.
An investigation by the Montreal Gazette revealed last week that Zeiger lives and recruits in Montreal. It also linked Zeiger - one of the most prominent neo-Nazis in North America - to local IT consultant Gabriel Sohier Chaput.
In the Montreal Storm chats, Zeiger shares his home address with the other members. Sohier Chaput lives at that same apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
The men also share similar facial features and biographical details from their respective online profiles appear to intersect.
"In Canada, post-Charlottesville, Zeiger was the first real big catch," said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. "If Zeiger hadn't appeared in that VICE documentary, we wouldn't have caught him. When leaders in hate groups rise to a certain profile, inevitably they are caught for their activities."
Once word started to spread about Quebecers participating in the rally, anti-fascists in Montreal sprang into action. They began tracking down the identities of the locals who had participated in the violent demonstration. It didn't take long to identify two of them: Beauvais-MacDonald and Bélanger-Mercure.
"I got doxxed by going to Charlottesville and then irresponsibly letting myself be filmed by VICE during their Cantwell interview," Friendly-Fash said in the Montreal Storm chat. Bélanger-Mercure was "the other guy that got doxxed with me." Doxxing is when a person's identity is revealed publicly, and is a tactic the anti-fascists and far-right use against each other.
After posting about being unmasked, FriendlyFash shared links to VICE and Montreal Gazette articles about Beauvais-MacDonald.
"No regrets. I went full," FriendlyFash said. He was referring to the 14-word white supremacist slogan "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
The slogan was coined by American white supremacist David Lane while serving a 190-year prison sentence for the murder of a Jewish talk show host. On Facebook at the time, Beauvais-MacDonald described himself as the "friendly neighbourhood fascist," mirroring the username on the Discord encrypted chat.
"I'm in now with no going back," FriendlyFash wrote.
In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bélanger-Mercure said he was not a white supremacist, but went to the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville "for the lulz" and to be entertained.
Among rank-and-file members of Montreal Storm, the fear of having their identities uncovered was so significant that Zeiger wrote and distributed a guide on how not to get doxxed.
When Beauvais-MacDonald was outed, his connections to a network of Quebec far-right groups began to surface. Behind the scenes, he'd already told the Montreal Storm members that he was head of anglophone recruitment at La Meute, the largest farright organization in Quebec.
In public, La Meute distanced itself from Beauvais-MacDonald, suspending his membership and denouncing the rally in Charlottesville. But he still marched alongside them during a rally in Quebec City that summer, wearing the group's trademark wolf iconography.
During another rally to protest the arrival of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border in Lacolle, Beauvais-MacDonald marched next to members of the far-right group Storm Alliance. Most covered their faces with bandanas and sunglasses but he made no effort to conceal his identity.
Years earlier, Beauvais-Mac-Donald had been an aspiring mixed martial arts fighter. He competed on an amateur card at Bar Skratch in Laval in 2009, losing his first and only bout by unanimous decision.
A photo from the Lacolle protest shows that while his fighting days may be behind him, Beauvais-MacDonald remains an imposing figure. His neck bulges from a black T-shirt and his short stature seems only to emphasize a pair of wide, muscular shoulders.
He strikes a menacing pose in the photo, staring down a group of counter-protesters with his fists wrapped in black leather gloves. Bélanger-Mercure was also at the Lacolle protest, sporting a baseball helmet with a crucifix etched into it.
Before Beauvais-MacDonald's public split with La Meute, FriendlyFash privately heaped abuse on the group's older demographic. During chats with Montreal Storm, he called them "boomers" and "baby f--ers." He claimed his involvement with them was, among other things, part of a strategy to prevent the Jewish Defence League from gaining influence in La Meute.
The JDL is a far-right Jewish organization whose American branch was alleged by the FBI to be a terrorist group in a 2000-01 report. The Canadian branch is independent of its American counterpart.
FriendlyFash acted, it appears, as a bridge between different far-right organizations. In the lead-up to last summer's failed anti-immigrant demonstration at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, he wrote that the protest was cancelled because "a very blatant neo-Nazi" and "close acquaintance of mine" had organized it.
He then posted a photo of Philippe Gendron, an organizer with the Soldiers of Odin.
Beauvais-MacDonald maintains ties with another extremist group: Atalante Quebec. On that group's Facebook page, Beauvais-MacDonald is sometimes the only person with his face uncovered in photographs.
He also appears to have participated in a January 2018 action with Atalante branding.
That night, a group of people dropped banners targeting Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, CEGEP professor Xavier Camus, activist Jaggi Singh, and others. The targets were called "parasites" if they were people of colour and "traitors" if they were white. Each banner featured Atalante's lightning-bolt logo.
When the Montreal Gazette asked Beauvais-MacDonald to clarify his political views, he said that accepting an interview would be "as useful as trying to stay dry by pissing in the wind."
"Traitors like you often go on about wanting to prevent radicalization, but you do nothing but foment it," he wrote. "I've actively dissuaded young men from violence. ... When successful in your witch hunts you'll create men with nothing to lose."
Another key Montreal player goes by the username "Late-OfDies." He first appears in the Montreal Storm chat a few weeks after its creation and remains a moderator throughout the duration of the logs.
In late December 2017, another user describes how Late-OfDies acts as the gatekeeper for the crew's secret Facebook group, which requires in-person vetting by LateOfDies, Friendly-Fash or Zeiger in order to enter.
Unlike Zeiger, the name LateOfDies does not appear in forums outside the Discord server.

What the Puck: Canadiens' quickest path to success is John Tavares

Full text: There is one question uppermost in most Canadiens fans' minds in the weeks following yet another disastrous season for the bleu-blanc-et-rouge. What is Marc Bergevin's( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-canadiens-gm-marc-bergevin-didnt-make-the-grade-this-season ) famous plan that he keeps talking about?
If Habs president Geoff Molson is keeping his general manager even though the team Bergevin built finished 28th in a 31-team league, it's because Bergevin has convinced him he has a strategy to put the Canadiens back on track as early as next season. It's clear Molson and Bergevin have no plans to start a slow, long-term rebuild à la the Toronto Maple Leafs of recent years and it's equally clear there are not going to be major management changes during the summer.
So what's the plan, Stan? Picture this: Molson and Bergevin are huddled on the seventh floor of the Bell Centre and they know the rabble-rousing masses are gathered outside the rink, with pitchforks and clubs in hand ready to storm Fortress Habs. They can hear the chants through the closed windows - Fire Bergevin! Fire Trevor Timmins! Bring in a real president of hockey operations!
Now Bergevin is nothing if not a survivor. He lasted 19 years in the NHL even though he was never more than a journeyman defenceman. He wasn't good enough for any of us to have heard of him, but he was good enough to stay gainfully employed in the best hockey league in the world for nearly two decades. So he was doing something right.
And he's also survived six years as GM even though his team is failing. So he knows how to stay alive. He knows he brings a street credibility his boss doesn't have. Bergevin comes from down the hill, growing up on the tough streets of Pointe-St-Charles, and he also has the smarts that come from a couple of decades in NHL rinks and dressing rooms. When you think about it, it's not surprising that Molson retains this admiration for him.
Canadiens' Paul Byron pursues New York Islanders' John Tavares in Montreal on Jan. 15, 2018.
In any case, with the sound of the mob outside, Bergevin leans in and tells the boss he has a plan and it's directly related to his old-school hockey cred. He famously played alongside Mario Lemieux for the pee-wee AA Ville-Émard Hurricanes during the '70s, but he also played on the same team in the QMJHL with Pat Brisson, who is one of the top hockey agents in the world.
And guess who Brisson represents, among many other superstars? That's right. A chap named John Tavares. If he's not signed by the New York Islanders, the 27-year-old centre will become one of the hottest free agents to hit the NHL market in ages, and I have it from good sources Bergevin has suggested to the big boss he has an inside track on the ultra-talented player from suburban Toronto.
And maybe he does. Tavares loves Montreal, the team has the cap space to sign him, and, perhaps most importantly, Habs management has the desperation to maybe roll out the red carpet in a way that no other team will to snare this prize catch. Much will depend on Bergevin's sales job. Obviously, his key argument will be they are poised to win with a healthy Carey Price and Shea Weber on the back end. He'll argue Montreal faltered because those two superstars were ailing and the team lacked a No. 1 centre.
Price and Weber back in fighting form, plus Tavares, equals a contender. Or so goes the argument. And what if Paul Stastny is also part of the Bergevin plan. The 32-year-old Winnipeg Jets winger can also become an unrestricted free agent on July 1.

The biggest caveat here in this blue-sky scenario is Price. You don't win anything with bad goaltending and if you doubt that, you might want to have a chat today with Nashville Predators GM David Poile. There were other factors, but the fact is Preds goalie Pekka Rinne( https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/preds-rinne-says-let-teammates-terrible-feeling/ ) has almost single-handedly cost his team two key series - against Pittsburgh last spring and against the Jets on Thursday, when he was pulled from Game 7 after surrendering two bad goals in the first 11 minutes. You don't need the best goalie in the world to win, but you need a Top 10 goalie.
We used to think Price was the best goalie in the world, but he was the worst goalie in the league this season. Will he bounce back? Who knows. From the start of his mediocre play - which actually began at the end of Michel Therrien's tenure as coach - I've been saying the problem is between Price's ears.
No one except Price( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-8 ) and maybe his bosses know what those issues are between his ears, but you have to think his terrible play is going to be a factor in Tavares' decision to sign, or not sign, with Montreal. In the end, that might be the toughest part of Bergevin's sales job.

Alt-right in Montreal: Encrypted messages show white supremacist mindset

Full text: Warning: readers may find the language and ideas quoted in this story disturbing.
He recruited them from the dark corners of the web, on message boards littered with phrases like "race war now" and "gas the k***s."
They were unremarkable young men: lonely, bored and nursing a grudge about their place in the world. Some couldn't hold down a job and others just drifted from one paycheque to the next.
Nothing was ever their fault.
If they couldn't get meaningful work, it was because the "Jewish economic agenda" had kept it from them. When women refused to date them, it was part of some feminist conspiracy against white men.
Zeiger, a major neo-Nazi figure in North America, fed off this sense of self-pity when he began organizing a white supremacist group in Montreal. An investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to Gabriel Sohier Chaput( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ), a local IT contractor who lives in Rosemont-La-Petite Patrie.
The investigation found that Zeiger has been organizing a white supremacist network in the city for nearly two years.
Most of the early recruits either knew him through the alt-right( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/alt-right ) forums or from his work with the Daily Stormer, North America's foremost white nationalist website.
In 2016, Zeiger hatched a plan to move from the digital space into real life. That summer, he set up an encrypted chat room for fellow Montrealers he'd found on forums like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer.
It was in this chat room that Zeiger began organizing in-person meetings with his recruits, where he would vet them and initiate the young men into Montreal's underground white nationalist movement. (It was also in this chat room that Zeiger provided his home address, the same one where Sohier Chaput lives.)
The information in this article comes from a cache of more than 12,000 chat messages obtained by the Montreal Gazette. It offers a glimpse into the recruiting methods, ideology and organizational structure of this new generation of white supremacists.
***
It began in August 2016.
Banking on his notoriety within white supremacist circles, Zeiger created a closed chat room on Discord, an encrypted chat service meant for gamers. He called the group "Montreal Storm."
The handful of initial recruits began chatting about where they lived on the island: Dorval, Verdun, Ville Émard, the East End. There were a few college students, an unemployed sales rep and a man said to be studying a "medical trade." One claimed to be the father of a girl he called his "Aryan princess."

Montreal Storm attracted members with links to far-right groups( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/a-guide-to-the-far-right ) like Soldiers of Odin, La Meute and Generation Identity. But its rank-and-file members seemed like isolated young men with little to no social life outside the group.
They mostly prized their anonymity. A few, however, claimed to share their views publicly.
"I've been an open Nazi my whole life," Jim B wrote shortly after joining the group.
They were all men. Women weren't allowed on the chat. Some of them wrote about their girlfriends, but most users either openly spoke about their hatred for women, or about how afraid they were to speak to them.
"I've already had to deal with leaps and bounds of Jewish bullshit making it difficult to land quality women," Greg wrote.
"There's some (Muslim women) at my daycare and there's nothing I can do. I want to chase them out with a stick," wrote &*. "I'm so tired of this feminist province, these hot québécois women need to be serving their husbands in the kitchens not telling us what to do."
The Montreal Storm chats revolved around the assumption that they, or the young white men of the West, would "take back" what was rightfully theirs. They dreamed of enforcing a totalitarian regime where they could use women only as a means for reproduction.
"Then once she dies of overuse," FriendlyFash said, "you can grind her up for doggo food."
Messages from the Discord chat room "Montreal Storm" obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
They paired their fantasies with real-life interaction.
One week after it was created, Montreal Storm held its first meeting at an Ye Olde Orchard Pub on Prince Arthur St.
"These are nicer and are a little more upbeat ..." one user wrote on the chat, referring to two Irish pubs that had been suggested "... but may not be able to yell GAS THE K**** or ALL N****** HANG as easily as a classic 'va chier tabarnak' bar, which you guys may prefer."
Forty-eight users frequented the Montreal Storm chat from August 2016 to January 2018, the time period from which the encrypted messages were culled.
They used Discord to organize a "Book Club," a code word for real-life meetups of the Daily Stormer's readers. Zeiger told the group he wanted to merge the Montreal Book Club with the Montreal "Standard Pool Party," another code referring to meetings for followers of the Right Stuff, a white nationalist podcast network and forum.
They tried to hold at least one monthly activity. Zeiger took them axe throwing at Rage Montreal one Saturday and hiking in Rigaud a few months later.
The field trips cemented a bond between the lost young men.
"I don't mean to be all sentimental," Greg wrote. "But it's nice to have the support of you brothers. As you can imagine, I don't spend too much free time associating with normies (people outside the white nationalist movement), it's tedious to me."
Greg regularly confided in the group. He told them about losing his sales job and having to get rid of his condo to find a cheaper place to live.
They offered Greg a shoulder to lean on.
The meetings served another, much more practical purpose. Once Zeiger met and vetted a user, he would indicate to Montreal Storm members that the person had been verified - effectively elevating his standing within the group.
Verified members were invited to a secret Facebook group where they could chat individually.
Early on in the chats, Zeiger outlined his strategy.
"We have to be organized and strong before thinking about recruitment and outreach," he wrote in September 2016. "Me and the more high-agency (guys) are going to form a core soon, establish structure, and start adding people to that."
Sometimes, Zeiger acted as a moderating influence within the group. When members would write about their violent fantasies, Zeiger would reel them back in.
"We have to convert our rage into a cold, focused hatred, and use that to motivate action," Zeiger said.
***
They wore Make America Great Again hats and Donald Trump T-shirts.
Some users thought U.S. President Trump was the new messiah, here to bring the societal change they had hoped for. Others thought "he was just a step in the right direction," as Albo-HAMMERBRO wrote, denouncing Ivanka Trump's relationship with Jared Kushner - "his daughter is married to a Jew."
The group met at Bar L'Barouf on St-Denis St. to watch coverage of the U.S. election on Nov. 9, 2016. Zeiger said they would be surrounded by "normies" but it would be worth seeing their tears if Trump won the election.
When he did win, Montreal Storm users were elated.
"ALL HAIL GLORIOUS LEADER," user Greg wrote.
"WE WON. WE F******. YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS WE WON!," user Albo-HAMMERBRO wrote. "I can't f****** believe it. I'm in tears."
"Bro this is just the beginning. The West is taking back EVERYTHING!"
Eventually the group would monitor the number of Jewish people Trump appointed to his cabinet. They often referenced ZOG, a decades-old, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that America was secretly run by the "Zionist Occupation Government."
They idolized Hitler and his fascist dictatorship, wishing him a happy birthday on April 20.
The chat was riddled with Hitler memes, pictures of SS soldiers or ironic images Photoshopped with swastikas. One meme shows a Photoshopped image of former Montreal mayor Denis Coderre wearing an SS-inspired uniform, giving a Nazi salute with a pack of pit bulls standing in front of him.
Another meme affixed the tag line "RIGHT WING DEATH SQUAD" over a photo of Alexandre Bissonnette, the Quebec City mosque shooter.
Messages from the Discord chat room "Montreal Storm" obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
The line between humour and fantasy wasn't always clear.
In January 2017, the user Johnson asked Zeiger for help.
Johnson said he had an obsessive compulsive disorder, which made him afraid of germs and leaving his apartment. He said he was 18 years old and he'd developed OCD four or five years earlier. Zeiger said that if Johnson wanted to be a fascist he had to face his fears and "transcend his limits."
The conversation was personal. Johnson admitted that his parents had divorced when he was three, and he wanted a better life for himself. Zeiger suggested he should train at the gym and have a healthy diet, and if he wanted to get involved with their operations, Johnson would have to leave his home.
"The only thing ill be involved in (in real life) is a mass shooting spree before killing myself," Johnson said. "Just kidding."
Johnson was eventually bullied out of the group.
Most of what was unearthed in the 12,000 encrypted messages is just chatter - ranging from benign discussions about bodybuilding and girl trouble to debates on political strategy and organizing methods.
Even so, it's difficult to gauge when users are being serious about violent thoughts versus when they're merely blowing off steam.
But when taken at face value, the violent aspects of these chats are difficult to ignore.
They went to demonstrations together as a group. They showed up at La Meute's March 2017 protest against the federal motion M-103, a non-binding piece of legislation that condemned Islamophobia.
They gradually moved from chatting, to meeting up and drinking, to action.
Montreal Storm was created in August 2016, and by August 2017 members of the group were taking the 12-hour drive south to Charlottesville, Va., to participate in the Unite the Right rally. Photos and videos show members of the chat, including Zeiger, carrying torches and shields and chanting white supremacist slogans.
By January 2018, much of the activity on Montreal Storm had dissipated. There were increasing references to the secret Facebook group and real-life meetings.
There was also a growing paranoia within the group about being doxxed, the term used when a person's true identity and private information are leaked online.
"I can't tell you my age, i don't want to doxx myself," Gaius Kekkus wrote.
"If we get doxxed we get doxxed," Farenheit wrote. "If we die we die."
For its part, Discord has released public statements about its efforts to crack down on white supremacist servers on its platform. "Though we do not read people's private messages," the statement reads, "we do investigate and take immediate action against any reported (terms of service) violation by a server or user."
After the Montreal Gazette published an investigation into neo-Nazi groups Thursday, users on white supremacist forums elsewhere on the internet warned each other to "[get the f*** off] of Discord."

Full text: Warning: Readers may find the language and ideas quoted in this story disturbing. For nearly two years, a Montrealbased chat room became a forum for young white men to share violent, racist fantasies with each other.
They spoke about starting a race war, "gassing" Jewish people and one user joked that he would participate in a mass shooting. The Montreal Storm chat room, created by the influential Montrealbased neo-Nazi Zeiger, began in August 2016 and appears to have been deactivated last winter.
The Montreal Gazette recently obtained a cache of 12,000 encrypted messages from the group. Experts say while most of the chat room's 48 users will probably never move from talk to realworld violent actions, their online activity shouldn't be dismissed as idle chatter.
Maxime Fiset, a reformed neo-Nazi, works to deradicalize people who've drifted into extremist ideologies.
"You can only go so far into that mindset without becoming violent," said Fiset, who works for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence.
A common thread throughout the encrypted chats is that its users are lonely, bored and admit to feeling like outcasts. Some open up about their mental health problems and thank their "brothers" for supporting them through difficult times.
Fiset says the support these users get from Montreal Storm members might be contributing to their radicalization.
"These guys all consider themselves victims," he said. "So for them to band together in some unsupervised space, it's not going to create some support movement like Alcoholics Anonymous.
"It's the complete opposite. It's like putting a bunch of alcoholics together in a bar. They're not going to get better."
Ryan Scrivens is a researcher at Concordia University who specializes in right-wing extremism. He says groups like Montreal Storm present a dilemma.
"The vast majority are keyboard warriors, they're saying terrible things, but they're just venting," said Scrivens, a post-doctoral fellow. "I'd much rather they have these spaces online than in the real world.
"However there is that percentage that one of them could be the next (Alexandre) Bissonnette."
Bissonnette, the Quebec City mosque shooter, frequented farright websites and forums in the months before he murdered six people in their place of worship last year.
"We know (Bissonnette) was trolling, we know he was shitposting. I've spoken to people who know him who confirmed this to me," Fiset said. "Shit-posting" refers to the practice of flooding social media with offensive, racist content in an ironic fashion.
One of the challenges of determining the significance of the chat room messages is the alt-right's use of irony. The alt-right - an umbrella term used to describe the new generation of online white nationalists - is known to use humour to soften the edges of extremist ideology.
"They don't want us to know when they're serious," Fiset said. "But who cares if they're joking about violence? Maybe they're joking about joking. This whole thing is so ironic that the levels of irony can't be dismantled."
The humour, Fiset says, gives these young men cover to propagate dangerous ideas.
Zeiger appears to admit as much early in the chat logs. He describes an elaborate prank wherein he contacted newspapers across the United States and lied about an effort by the alt-right to radicalize children using Pokémon cartoon characters.
In a banner he posted online in September 2016, Zeiger depicted Pokémon characters alongside an animated Hitler. Zeiger said it was a ploy to lure the media into writing about the Daily Stormer for free outrageous publicity.
At one point, he claimed he contacted a journalist and posed as an angry mother whose child brought home Nazi Pokémon propaganda.
"The Pokemon banner is part of the campaign to troll the media," he wrote. "There's different reasons (I did this). Make the media look like fools is one. Make the altright look funny and genius-tier master minds is another.
"Create a vast wave of publicity, is third, by using 'child panic.'Then revealing it was all a hoax, for (laughs) ... If this succeeds, every 10-25 year old will instantly think 'the alt-right is where the fun stuff is happening.'" Based on his research, Scrivens says there's little evidence to suggest the young men who are active on these hate forums are the same ones going out to commit violent crimes in the real world.
"People in real organized hate groups are careful about their online activity," he said. "The vast majority of the keyboard warriors are just mouthpieces. But it's a tough call, especially for law enforcement, because you never know what people are capable of."

Investigating the alt-right mindset; White supremacist ideology revealed in encrypted online chats

Full text: Warning: readers may find the language and ideas quoted in this story disturbing.
He recruited them from the dark corners of the web, on message boards littered with phrases like "race war now" and "gas the k***s."
They were unremarkable young men: lonely, bored and nursing a grudge about their place in the world. Some couldn't hold down a job and others just drifted from one paycheque to the next.
Nothing was ever their fault. If they couldn't get meaningful work, it was because the "Jewish economic agenda" had kept it from them. When women refused to date them, it was part of some feminist conspiracy against white men.
Zeiger, a major neo-Nazi figure in North America, fed off this sense of self-pity when he began organizing a white supremacist group in Montreal. An investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to Gabriel Sohier Chaput, a local IT contractor who lives in Rosemont-La-Petite Patrie.
The investigation found that Zeiger has been organizing a white supremacist network in the city for nearly two years.
Most of the early recruits either knew him through the alt-right forums or from his work with the Daily Stormer, North America's foremost white nationalist website.
In 2016, Zeiger hatched a plan to move from the digital space into real life. That summer, he set up an encrypted chat room for fellow Montrealers he'd found on forums like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer.
It was in this chat room that Zeiger began organizing in-person meetings with his recruits, where he would vet them and initiate the young men into Montreal's underground white nationalist movement. (It was also in this chat room that Zeiger provided his home address, the same one where Sohier Chaput lives.)
The information in this article comes from a cache of more than 12,000 chat messages obtained by the Montreal Gazette. It offers a glimpse into the recruiting methods, ideology and organizational structure of this new generation of white supremacists.
It began in August 2016. Banking on his notoriety within white supremacist circles, Zeiger created a closed chat room on Discord, an encrypted chat service meant for gamers. He called the group "Montreal Storm."
The handful of initial recruits began chatting about where they lived on the island: Dorval, Verdun, Ville Émard, the East End. There were a few college students, an unemployed sales rep and a man said to be studying a "medical trade." One claimed to be the father of a girl he called his "Aryan princess."
Montreal Storm attracted members with links to far-right groups like Soldiers of Odin, La Meute and Generation Identity. But its rankand-file members seemed like isolated young men with little to no social life outside the group.
They mostly prized their anonymity. A few, however, claimed to share their views publicly.
"I've been an open Nazi my whole life," Jim B wrote shortly after joining the group.
They were all men. Women weren't allowed on the chat. Some of them wrote about their girlfriends, but most users either openly spoke about their hatred for women, or about how afraid they were to speak to them.
"I've already had to deal with leaps and bounds of Jewish bullshit making it difficult to land quality women," Greg wrote.
"There's some (Muslim women) at my daycare and there's nothing I can do. I want to chase them out with a stick," wrote &*. "I'm so tired of this feminist province, these hot québécois women need to be serving their husbands in the kitchens not telling us what to do."
The Montreal Storm chats revolved around the assumption that they, or the young white men of the West, would "take back" what was rightfully theirs. They dreamed of enforcing a totalitarian regime where they could use women only as a means for reproduction.
"Then once she dies of overuse," FriendlyFash said, "you can grind her up for doggo food."
They paired their fantasies with real-life interaction.
One week after it was created, Montreal Storm held its first meeting at an Ye Olde Orchard Pub on Prince Arthur St.
"These are nicer and are a little more upbeat ..." one user wrote on the chat, referring to two Irish pubs that had been suggested "... but may not be able to yell GAS THE K**** or ALL N****** HANG as easily as a classic 'va chier tabarnak'bar, which you guys may prefer."
Forty-eight users frequented the Montreal Storm chat from August 2016 to January 2018, the time period from which the encrypted messages were culled.

Full text: One of North America's most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal and is organizing a white supremacist network on the island.
"Zeiger" is the pseudonym for the second-most prolific writer on the Daily Stormer, an extreme right-wing news website that attracts upwards of 80,000 unique visitors a month.
The site traffics in conspiracy theories, refers to African-Americans as "nogs," to gay men as "f***ots" and devotes coverage to what it calls the "Race War" and the "Jewish Problem." Along with the Daily Stormer's other authors, Zeiger has helped spread this ideology to a new generation of young white men across North America.
Since emerging as a key figure in the movement four years ago, Zeiger's identity has been a closely guarded secret. But an investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to a local IT consultant in his early 30s.
Gabriel Sohier Chaput lives in an apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. That same apartment was listed by Zeiger as his home and as a rendezvous point for a local neo-Nazi group, according to documents obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early. He says in a podcast that he was 14 when he read about the Holocaust and "realized that it was a hoax."
The group also met at downtown bars, apartments and a hotel between August 2016 and January 2018. At various points, members self-identified as alt-right, alt-reich, Nazis, fascists and white supremacists.
They acted on the instructions of a man referring to himself as Zeiger from the Daily Stormer. Zeiger co-ordinated the time and place of most meetings.
"Zeiger is probably second to only Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's founder and chief propagandist," said Keegan Hankis, the Southern Poverty Law Centre's senior analyst. "[Zeiger] has been very influential in the strategies behind it."
The SPLC monitors the online presence of hate groups throughout North America.

White nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right exchange volleys of pepper spray with counter-protesters at Charlottesville in August 2011: For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early.

Zeiger used his infamy as a recruiting tool, sharing a manifesto he authored as well as hyperlinks to his Daily Stormer articles and podcast appearances with the local group.
They first met at an Irish pub on Prince Arthur St. in August 2016. Shortly afterward, he introduced them to another Montreal-based fascist group.
Over a one-and-a-half-year period, a core of between 10 and 15 members gathered in bars and apartments around the city. Only men were allowed to attend their official meetings, but they opened up some events to women and "normies" - a term they use to describe people outside the movement.
The information that links Zeiger to Sohier Chaput comes from anti-fascist activists who monitor neo-Nazi and other far-right groups online.

The anti-fascists cross-referenced Zeiger's profiles on white supremacist websites like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer with information Zeiger provided to a closed Montreal-based chat room.
A home address Zeiger shared with the chat group matches the corporate listing for GSC Gestion, a consulting firm whose owner and sole employee is Sohier Chaput.
Ironically, two key pieces of information linking both men came from Zeiger himself, who, during a March 11 appearance on a white supremacist podcast, revealed that he attended high school in Outremont. Although Zeiger did not name the school, it narrowed the activists' search down.
They also believed his real first name was Gabriel after digging into Zeiger's profile on the neo-Nazi website Iron March. The profile was connected to a Skype account registered under the name "gabriel_zeiger."
The anti-fascists then found and combed through a small library of yearbooks from Outremont high schools. They were searching for someone whose first name, age and appearance matched Zeiger's.
They found a 2002 yearbook from Paul-Gérin-Lajoie-d'Outremont, which Sohier Chaput attended in Grade 10. They saw a resemblance between the 2002 photo of Sohier Chaput and Zeiger's online profiles.
Compared to Zeiger's enormous digital footprint, there are only traces of Sohier Chaput online.
He was an IT manager at a UPS store before branching out as an independent contractor in 2016, according to his profile on a job networking site.
A Google search for his name yields a Soundcloud account and an entry noting his second-place finish in the 2012 St. Lawrence Toastmasters public-speaking competition.
He does not appear to have public profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn or other social media.
Instead, the anti-fascists claim, he exists under a Nazi alter ego: Zeiger.
Neither Sohier Chaput nor Zeiger responded to the Montreal Gazette's request for comment.
Sohier Chaput's brother hung up the phone twice when called by the Montreal Gazette. His father did not respond to email and telephone requests to pass along contact information to Sohier Chaput.
The Montreal Gazette also sent a letter to Sohier Chaput's apartment by courier and rang his doorbell twice to no avail. His landlord agreed to pass along a message but as of Wednesday, he has not replied.
On white nationalist forums, Zeiger and other Montreal users brag about beating anti-fascist protesters and pasting Nazi stickers on the métro and co-ordinate their attendance at far-right rallies.

They also refer to a 2016 meeting with a representative from Students for Western Civilization, which led a campaign in 2015 for the creation of white student unions on Toronto university campuses.
One of the Montreal group members claims to have hosted a lecture by Ricardo Duschene, a University of New Brunswick professor who believes mass immigration is causing the ethnocide of European Canadians, in the summer of 2017.
Duschene denies any association with the group.
"I spoke at a meeting in Montreal last summer but it was for another group that does not identify as 'alt right,' " he wrote in an email to the Montreal Gazette. "I don't identify myself as 'alt right', and less so would I ever speak at a meeting organized by Daily Stormer.
"I am aware that someone by the name 'Charles Zeiger' posted one of my talks, but this was done without my knowledge, and I have no idea who he is."
Zeiger's reach extends beyond the North American movement. When the British government disbanded the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, the group's final communiqué
personally thanked Zeiger and Andrew Anglin for their work in spreading propaganda.
"(It) gradually breaks down their inhibitions toward the most despicable forms of violence."
- Alexander Reid Ross
Anglin and Zeiger have repeatedly claimed their goal is to use internet culture as a way of making extremist ideas more palatable to a mainstream audience.
"(Young men) can go onto these forums and ... they'll be immersed in fascist culture, Nazi jokes, meme culture and (it) gradually breaks down their inhibitions toward the most despicable forms of violence," says Alexander Reid Ross, a lecturer at Portland State University. "Forum culture in general has helped to draw people into this fever swamp of fascist ideas."
Reid Ross is the author of Against the Fascist Creep, a sweeping history of post-Second World War fascist ideology.
Before founding the Montreal group, Zeiger claimed responsibility for the resurgence of Siege, a 1980s manifesto that calls for individual acts of terrorism as a means to create a white ethno-state. Posting on the forum the Right Stuff, Zeiger wrote that he digitized the book to help it reach a wider audience.
Siege's resurgence within white supremacist circles is mostly "self-marginalizing," Reid Ross said, adding that the book is "a thing 14-year-old boys read when they're angry at their moms."
"However, for those few people who do pick it up ... it is definitely extremely dangerous. It points to a movement of leaderless resistance that's been growing since Charlottesville."
Zeiger attended the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last summer with a small group of Quebecers. At the end of the march, a right-wing extremist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

The rally in Charlottesville marked a turning point for the neo-Nazi movement in the United States. Before Heyer's death, white supremacist ideology had been creeping its way into mainstream politics( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/the-trump-effect-and-the-normalization-of-hate ).
But the violence from that day triggered a backlash that forced the movement back underground, according to Reid Ross.
"It showed that you can't get a (large) group of Nazis together in one place without there being some kind of murder, attempted murder, assault or things like that."
After Charlottesville, the Daily Stormer published an article titled "Heather Heyer: A Woman Killed in Road Rage Incident Was a Fat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut." They were subsequently removed from web hosting by GoDaddy, Google and a series of international domains.
The site was hosted on the dark web for a brief period, but has re-emerged on the open internet through Eranet International Limited, a web hosting service based in China.
Hankis says there's a link between the ideology espoused on sites like the Daily Stormer and acts of mass violence in the United States.
After murdering nine people at a predominantly African-American church in South Carolina, Dylann Roof released a manifesto outlining his racist views. Verbatim sections of the manifesto appeared in the Daily Stormer's message boards in the months leading up to the 2015 massacre.
James Harris Jackson, who was charged with murdering a black man in New York City with a sword last year, told reporters he was an avid reader of the Daily Stormer.
Andrew Anglin and Zeiger did not respond to the Montreal Gazette's email request for comment.
However a disclaimer on the website says it opposes violence and seeks "revolution through the education of the masses." Further, it adds, "anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned."
One expert cautions that while Quebec's extremist movement is still relatively small, it is attracting a growing number of angry, disillusioned young men.
Maxime Fiset is a reformed neo-Nazi who now does outreach work for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence. He estimates that active support for "alt-right" groups in Quebec numbers in the hundreds or thousands.
Quebec's extremist movement is still relatively small, but it is attracting a growing number of angry, disillusioned young men.
While the rise of far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance have made waves in local media, Fiset says Zeiger's movement targets a much different demographic.
"La Meute is an older crowd, between 40 and 65 years old," he said. "With the alt-right, it's more like between 15 and 35. They're not as structured and organized but they're becoming more and more visible."
Fiset's job is to try to understand how young men are indoctrinated with hateful ideology in hopes that they can be rehabilitated.
He said that the process of radicalization often begins with a feeling of injustice and sense of isolation. This leads to the person questioning why they are unhappy, and then either coming to terms with their situation, or seeking retribution for their distress.
"The person usually begins a path of questioning, which is legitimate, because injustices are corrected by some of those who challenge them at first," Fiset said. "But it may become something much more dark when the person eventually arrives to more violent answers. That could be as common as hate speech or as dire as terrorism."
For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early. In a white supremacist podcast, he describes his process of radicalization.
"I think I was about 14 when I was reading about the Holocaust and realized that it was a hoax," he said. Later, he was exposed to a blog post that was "anti-semitic from a liberal perspective," in that it described Jewish people as racist.
"This resonated with me, because my sister she had dated a Jew for a while, but his family forbade him from marrying her."
"They're living in the very dark corners of the web, without any boundaries"
- Maxime Fiset
From there, Zeiger fell deeper into the online rabbit hole of anti-Semitic propaganda, binge-consuming hundreds of hours of white nationalist radio shows and YouTube videos.
"I saw a video ... and I wasn't that right-wing at that point so I thought 'Oh my God, this is so extreme, this is racist.' But I thought it was interesting," he said, on a December 2016 podcast. "So after that I listened to (hours of these) radio shows, one after the other.
"It took like a few weeks but I listened to all like 300 of them. After that I was like, 'Gas the k****, race war now.' "
Fiset says he doesn't believe that radicalized youth are irredeemable. He is living proof that a person can be drawn away from the extremist fringe.
But he worries that, left unchecked, the spaces that Zeiger inhabits can move beyond internet hate speech and into real-world violence.
"We need to address this because they're living in very dark corners of the web, without any boundaries, without any limits, without any structure or counter narrative," Fiset said. "These guys are just alone, evolving together, in what becomes more and more violent ideologies, and it's not getting any better. We're just starting to realize that we have a ticking time bomb on our hands."

Alt-right in Montreal: 'You never know what people are capable of'

Full text: Warning: readers may find the language and ideas quoted in this story disturbing.
For nearly two years, a Montreal-based chat room became a forum for young white men to share violent, racist fantasies with each other.
They spoke about starting a race war, "gassing" Jewish people and one user joked that he would participate in a mass shooting. The Montreal Storm chat room, created by the influential Montreal-based neo-Nazi Zeiger( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/major-neo-nazi-figure-recruiting-in-montreal ), began in August 2016 and appears to have been deactivated last winter.
The Montreal Gazette recently obtained a cache of 12,000 encrypted messages from the group. Experts say while most of the chat room's 48 users will probably never move from talk to real-world violent actions, their online activity shouldn't be dismissed as idle chatter.
Maxime Fiset, a reformed neo-Nazi, works to deradicalize people who've drifted into extremist ideologies.
"You can only go so far into that mindset without becoming violent," said Fiset, who works for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence.
A common thread throughout the encrypted chats is that its users are lonely, bored and admit to feeling like outcasts. Some open up about their mental health problems and thank their "brothers" for supporting them through difficult times.
Fiset says the support these users get from Montreal Storm members might be contributing to their radicalization.
"These guys all consider themselves victims," he said. "So for them to band together in some unsupervised space, it's not going to create some support movement like Alcoholics Anonymous.
"It's the complete opposite. It's like putting a bunch of alcoholics together in a bar. They're not going to get better."

Opinion: It's essential to stop hate in its tracks( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-its-essential-to-stop-hate-in-its-tracks )
Ryan Scrivens is a researcher at Concordia University who specializes in right-wing extremism. He says groups like Montreal Storm present a dilemma.
"The vast majority are keyboard warriors, they're saying terrible things, but they're just venting," said Scrivens, a post-doctoral fellow. "I'd much rather they have these spaces online than in the real world.
"However there is that percentage that one of them could be the next (Alexandre) Bissonnette."
Bissonnette, the Quebec City mosque shooter( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/alexandre-bissonnette-inside-the-life-of-a-mass-murderer ), frequented far-right websites and forums( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-bissonnette-hearing-shows-fake-news-travels-fast ) in the months before he murdered six people in their place of worship last year.
"We know (Bissonnette) was trolling, we know he was shit-posting. I've spoken to people who know him who confirmed this to me," Fiset said.
"Shit-posting" refers to the practice of flooding social media with offensive, racist content in an ironic fashion.
One of the challenges of determining the significance of the chat room messages is the alt-right( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/alt-right )'s use of irony. The alt-right - an umbrella term used to describe the new generation of online white nationalists - is known to use humour to soften the edges of extremist ideology.
"They don't want us to know when they're serious," Fiset said. "But who cares if they're joking about violence? Maybe they're joking about joking. This whole thing is so ironic that the levels of irony can't be dismantled."
The humour, Fiset says, gives these young men cover to propagate dangerous ideas.
Zeiger appears to admit as much early in the chat logs. He describes an elaborate prank wherein he contacted newspapers across the United States and lied about an effort by the alt-right to radicalize children using Pokémon cartoon characters.
In a banner he posted online in September 2016, Zeiger depicted Pokémon characters alongside an animated Hitler. Zeiger said it was a ploy to lure the media into writing about the Daily Stormer for free outrageous publicity.
At one point, he claimed he contacted a journalist and posed as an angry mother whose child brought home Nazi Pokémon propaganda.
"The Pokemon banner is part of the campaign to troll the media," he wrote. "There's different reasons (I did this). Make the media look like fools is one. Make the alt-right look funny and genius-tier master minds is another.
"Create a vast wave of publicity, is third, by using 'child panic'. Then revealing it was all a hoax, for (laughs) ... If this succeeds, every 10-25 year old will instantly think 'the alt-right is where the fun stuff is happening.'"
Based on his research, Scrivens says there's little evidence to suggest the young men who are active on these hate forums are the same ones going out to commit violent crimes in the real world.
"People in real organized hate groups are careful about their online activity," he said. "The vast majority of the keyboard warriors are just mouthpieces. But it's a tough call, especially for law enforcement, because you never know what people are capable of."

Full text: One of North America's most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal and is organizing a white supremacist network on the island.
"Zeiger" is the pseudonym for the second-most prolific writer on the Daily Stormer, an extreme right-wing news website that attracts upwards of 80,000 unique visitors a month.
The site traffics in conspiracy theories, refers to African-Americans as "nogs," to gay men as "f-ots" and devotes coverage to what it calls the "Race War" and the "Jewish Problem." Along with the Daily Stormer's other authors, Zeiger has helped spread this ideology to a new generation of young white men across North America.
Since emerging as a key figure in the movement four years ago, Zeiger's identity has been a closely guarded secret. But an investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to a local IT consultant in his early 30s.
Gabriel Sohier Chaput lives in an apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. That same apartment was listed by Zeiger as his home and as a rendezvous point for a local neo-Nazi group, according to documents obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
The group also met at downtown bars, apartments and a hotel between August 2016 and January 2018. At various points, members self-identified as alt-right, altreich, Nazis, fascists and white supremacists.
They acted on the instructions of a man referring to himself as Zeiger from the Daily Stormer. Zeiger co-ordinated the time and place of most meetings.
"Zeiger is probably second to only Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's founder and chief propagandist," said Keegan Hankis, the Southern Poverty Law Centre's senior analyst. "(Zeiger) has been very influential in the strategies behind it."
The SPLC monitors the online presence of hate groups throughout North America.
Zeiger used his infamy as a recruiting tool, sharing a manifesto he authored as well as hyperlinks to his Daily Stormer articles and podcast appearances with the local group.
They first met at an Irish pub on Prince Arthur St. in August 2016. Shortly afterward, he introduced them to another Montreal-based fascist group.
Over a one-and-a-half-year period, a core of between 10 and 15 members gathered in bars and apartments around the city. Only men were allowed to attend their official meetings, but they opened up some events to women and "normies" - a term they use to describe people outside the movement.
The information that links Zeiger to Sohier Chaput comes from anti-fascist activists who monitor neo-Nazi and other farright groups online.
The anti-fascists cross-referenced Zeiger's profiles on white supremacist websites like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer with information Zeiger provided to a closed Montreal-based chat room.

"But it may become something much more dark when the person eventually arrives to more violent answers. That could be as common as hate speech or as dire as terrorism."
For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early. In a white supremacist podcast, he describes his process of radicalization.
"I think I was about 14 when I was reading about the Holocaust and realized that it was a hoax," he said. Later, he was exposed to a blog post that was "anti-Semitic from a liberal perspective," in that it described Jewish people as racist.
"This resonated with me, because my sister she had dated a Jew for a while, but his family forbade him from marrying her."
From there, Zeiger fell deeper into the online rabbit hole of anti-Semitic propaganda, bingeconsuming hundreds of hours of white nationalist radio shows and YouTube videos.
"I saw a video ... and I wasn't that right-wing at that point so I thought, 'Oh my God, this is so extreme, this is racist.'But I thought it was interesting," he said on a December 2016 podcast. "So after that I listened to (hours of these) radio shows, one after the other.
"It took like a few weeks but I listened to all like 300 of them. After that I was like, 'Gas the k--, race war now.'" Fiset says he doesn't believe that radicalized youth are irredeemable. He is living proof that a person can be drawn away from the extremist fringe.
But he worries that, left unchecked, the spaces that Zeiger inhabits can move beyond internet hate speech and into real-world violence.
"We need to address this because they're living in very dark corners of the web, without any boundaries, without any limits, without any structure or counter narrative," Fiset said.
"These guys are just alone, evolving together, in what becomes more and more violent ideologies, and it's not getting any better. We're just starting to realize that we have a ticking time bomb on our hands."

Full text: One of North America's most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal and is organizing a white supremacist network on the island.
"Zeiger" is the pseudonym for the second-most prolific writer on the Daily Stormer, an extreme right-wing news website that attracts upwards of 80,000 unique visitors a month.
The site traffics in conspiracy theories, refers to African-Americans as "nogs," to gay men as "f---ots" and devotes coverage to what it calls the "Race War" and the "Jewish Problem." Along with the Daily Stormer's other authors, Zeiger has helped spread this ideology to a new generation of young white men across North America.
Since emerging as a key figure in the movement four years ago, Zeiger's identity has been a closely guarded secret. But an investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to a local IT consultant in his early 30s.
Gabriel Sohier Chaput lives in an apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. That same apartment was listed by Zeiger as his home and as a rendezvous point for a local neo-Nazi group, according to documents obtained by the Gazette.
The group also met at downtown bars, apartments and a hotel between August 2016 and January 2018. At various points, members self-identified as altright, alt-reich, Nazis, fascists and white supremacists.
They acted on the instructions of a man referring to himself as Zeiger from the Daily Stormer. Zeiger co-ordinated the time and place of most meetings. "Zeiger is probably second to only Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's founder and chief propagandist," said Keegan Hankes, the Southern Poverty Law Center's senior analyst.
"(Zeiger) has been very influential in the strategies behind it." The SPLC monitors the online presence of hate groups throughout North America. Zeiger used his infamy as a recruiting tool, sharing a manifesto he authored as well as hyperlinks to his Daily Stormer articles and podcast appearances with the local group.
They first met at an Irish pub on Prince Arthur Street in August 2016. Shortly afterward, he introduced them to another Montrealbased fascist group.
Over a one-and-a-half-year period, a core of between 10 and 15 members gathered in bars and apartments around the city. Only men were allowed to attend their official meetings, but they opened up some events to women and "normies" - a term they use to describe people outside the movement.
The information that links Zeiger to Sohier Chaput comes from anti-fascist activists who monitor neo-Nazi and other far-right groups online.
The anti-fascists cross-referenced Zeiger's profiles on white supremacist websites like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer with information Zeiger provided to a closed Montrealbased chat room.
A home address Zeiger shared with the chat group matches the corporate listing for GSC Gestion, a consulting firm whose owner and sole employee is Sohier Chaput.
Ironically, two key pieces of information linking both men came from Zeiger himself, who, during a March 11 appearance on a white supremacist podcast, revealed that he attended high school in Outremont. Although Zeiger did not name the school, it narrowed the activists'search down.
They also believed his real first name was Gabriel after digging into Zeiger's profile on the neo-Nazi website Iron March. The profile was connected to a Skype account registered under the name "gabriel_zeiger."
The anti-fascists then found and combed through a small library of yearbooks from Outremont high schools. They were searching for someone whose first name, age and appearance matched Zeiger's.
They found a 2002 yearbook from Paul-Gérin-Lajoie-d'Outremont, which Sohier Chaput attended in Grade 10. They saw a resemblance between the 2002 photo of Sohier Chaput and Zeiger's online profiles.
Compared to Zeiger's enormous digital footprint, there are only traces of Sohier Chaput online.
He was an IT manager at a UPS store before branching out as an independent contractor in 2016, according to his profile on a job networking site.
A Google search for his name yields a SoundCloud account and an entry noting his second-place finish in the 2012 St. Lawrence Toastmasters public-speaking competition.
He does not appear to have public profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkdin or other social media.
Instead, the anti-fascists claim, he exists under a Nazi alter ego: Zeiger.
Neither Sohier Chaput nor Zeiger responded to the Montreal Gazette's request for comment.
Sohier Chaput's brother hung up the phone twice when called by the Montreal Gazette. His father did not respond to email and telephone requests to pass along contact information to Sohier Chaput.
The Montreal Gazette also sent a letter to Sohier Chaput's apartment by courier and rang his doorbell twice to no avail. His landlord agreed to pass along a message, but as of Wednesday, he has not replied.
On white nationalist forums, Zeiger and other Montreal users brag about beating anti-fascist protesters and pasting Nazi stickers on the métro, and co-ordinate their attendance at farright rallies.
They also refer to a 2016 meeting with a representative from Students for Western Civilization, which led a campaign in 2015 for the creation of white student unions on Toronto university campuses.
One of the Montreal group members claims to have hosted a lecture by Ricardo Duchesne, a University of New Brunswick professor who believes mass immigration is causing the ethnocide of European Canadians, in the summer of 2017.
Duchesne denies any association with the group.
"I spoke at a meeting in Montreal last summer but it was for another group that does not identify as 'alt right,'" he wrote in an email to the Montreal Gazette. "I don't identify myself as 'alt right', and less so would I ever speak at a meeting organized by Daily Stormer.
"I am aware that someone by the name 'Charles Zeiger'posted one of my talks, but this was done without my knowledge, and I have no idea who he is."
Zeiger's reach extends beyond the North American movement. When the British government disbanded the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, the group's final communiqué personally thanked Zeiger and Andrew Anglin for their work in spreading propaganda.
Anglin and Zeiger have repeatedly claimed their goal is to use internet culture as a way of making extremist ideas more palatable to a mainstream audience.
"(Young men) can go onto these forums and ... they'll be immersed in fascist culture, Nazi jokes, meme culture and (it) gradually breaks down their inhibitions toward the most despicable forms of violence," says Alexander Reid Ross, a lecturer at Portland State University. "Forum culture in general has helped to draw people into this fever swamp of fascist ideas."
Reid Ross is the author of Against the Fascist Creep, a sweeping history of post-Second World War fascist ideology.
Before founding the Montreal group, Zeiger claimed responsibility for the resurgence of Siege, a 1980s manifesto that calls for individual acts of terrorism as a means to create a white ethno-state. Posting on the forum the Right Stuff, Zeiger wrote that he digitized the book to help it reach a wider audience.
Siege's resurgence within white supremacist circles is mostly "self-marginalizing," Reid Ross said, adding that the book is "a thing 14-yearold boys read when they're angry at their moms."
"However, for those few people who do pick it up ... it is definitely extremely dangerous. It points to a movement of leaderless resistance that's been growing since Charlottesville."
Zeiger attended the whitesupremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer with a small group of Quebecers. At the end of the march, a right-wing extremist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
The rally in Charlottesville marked a turning point for the neo-Nazi movement in the United States. Before Heyer's death, white supremacist ideology had been creeping its way into mainstream politics.
But the violence from that day triggered a backlash that forced the movement back underground, according to Reid Ross.
"It showed that you can't get a (large) group of Nazis together in one place without there being some kind of murder, attempted murder, assault or things like that."
After Charlottesville, the Daily Stormer published an article titled, "Heather Heyer: Woman Killed in Road Rage Incident Was a Fat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut."
They were subsequently removed from web hosting by GoDaddy, Google and a series of international domains.
The site was hosted on the dark web for a brief period, but has re-emerged on the open internet through Eranet International Limited, a web hosting service based in China.
Hankes says there's a link between the ideology espoused on sites like the Daily Stormer and acts of mass violence in the United States.
After murdering nine people at a predominantly African-American church in South Carolina, Dylann Roof released a manifesto outlining his racist views.
Verbatim sections of the manifesto appeared in the Daily Stormer's message boards in the months leading up to the 2015 massacre.
James Harris Jackson, who was charged with murdering a black man in New York City with a sword last year, told reporters he was an avid reader of the Daily Stormer.
Andrew Anglin and Zeiger did not respond to the Montreal Gazette's email request for comment.
However, a disclaimer on the website says it opposes violence and seeks "revolution through the education of the masses." Further, it adds, "anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned."
One expert cautions that while Quebec's extremist movement is still relatively small, it is attracting a growing number of angry, disillusioned young men.
Maxime Fiset is a reformed neo-Nazi who now does outreach work for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence. He estimates that active support for "alt-right" groups in Quebec numbers in the hundreds or thousands.
While the rise of far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance have made waves in local media, Fiset says Zeiger's movement targets a much different demographic.
"La Meute is an older crowd, between 40 and 65 years old," he said. "With the alt-right, it's more like between 15 and 35. They're not as structured and organized, but they're becoming more and more visible."
Fiset's job is to try to understand how young men are indoctrinated with hateful ideology in hopes that they can be rehabilitated.
He said that the process of radicalization often begins with a feeling of injustice and sense of isolation. This leads to the person questioning why they are unhappy, and then either coming to terms with their situation, or seeking retribution for their distress.
"The person usually begins a path of questioning, which is legitimate, because injustices are corrected by some of those who challenge them at first," Fiset said.

Full text: One of North America's most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal and is organizing a white supremacist network on the island.
"Zeiger" is the pseudonym for the second-most prolific writer on the Daily Stormer, an extreme right-wing news website that attracts upwards of 80,000 unique visitors a month.
The site traffics in conspiracy theories, refers to African-Americans as "nogs," to gay men as "f-ots" and devotes coverage to what it calls the "Race War" and the "Jewish Problem." Along with the Daily Stormer's other authors, Zeiger has helped spread this ideology to a new generation of young white men across North America.
Since emerging as a key figure in the movement four years ago, Zeiger's identity has been a closely guarded secret. But an investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to a local IT consultant in his early 30s.
Gabriel Sohier Chaput lives in an apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. That same apartment was listed by Zeiger as his home and as a rendezvous point for a local neo-Nazi group, according to documents obtained by the Montreal Gazette.
The group also met at downtown bars, apartments and a hotel between August 2016 and January 2018. At various points, members self-identified as alt-right, altreich, Nazis, fascists and white supremacists.
They acted on the instructions of a man referring to himself as Zeiger from the Daily Stormer. Zeiger co-ordinated the time and place of most meetings.
"Zeiger is probably second to only Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's founder and chief propagandist," said Keegan Hankis, the Southern Poverty Law Centre's senior analyst. "(Zeiger) has been very influential in the strategies behind it."
The SPLC monitors the online presence of hate groups throughout North America.
Zeiger used his infamy as a recruiting tool, sharing a manifesto he authored as well as hyperlinks to his Daily Stormer articles and podcast appearances with the local group.
They first met at an Irish pub on Prince Arthur St. in August 2016. Shortly afterward, he introduced them to another Montreal-based fascist group.
Over a one-and-a-half-year period, a core of between 10 and 15 members gathered in bars and apartments around the city. Only men were allowed to attend their official meetings, but they opened up some events to women and "normies" - a term they use to describe people outside the movement.
The information that links Zeiger to Sohier Chaput comes from anti-fascist activists who monitor neo-Nazi and other far-right groups online.
The anti-fascists cross-referenced Zeiger's profiles on white supremacist websites like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer with information Zeiger provided to a closed Montreal-based chat room.
A home address Zeiger shared with the chat group matches the corporate listing for GSC Gestion, a consulting firm whose owner and sole employee is Sohier Chaput.
Ironically, two key pieces of information linking both men came from Zeiger himself, who, during a March 11 appearance on a white supremacist podcast, revealed that he attended high school in Outremont. Although Zeiger did not name the school, it narrowed the activists'search down.
They also believed his real first name was Gabriel after digging into Zeiger's profile on the neo-Nazi website Iron March. The profile was connected to a Skype account registered under the name "gabriel_zeiger."
The anti-fascists then found and combed through a small library of yearbooks from Outremont high schools. They were searching for someone whose first name, age and appearance matched Zeiger's.
They found a 2002 yearbook from Paul-Gérin-Lajoied'Outremont, which Sohier Chaput attended in Grade 10. They saw a resemblance between the 2002 photo of Sohier Chaput and Zeiger's online profiles.
Compared to Zeiger's enormous digital footprint, there are only traces of Sohier Chaput online.
He was an IT manager at a UPS store before branching out as an independent contractor in 2016, according to his profile on a job networking site.
A Google search for his name yields a SoundCloud account and an entry noting his second-place finish in the 2012 St. Lawrence Toastmasters public-speaking competition.
He does not appear to have public profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn or other social media.
Instead, the anti-fascists claim, he exists under a Nazi alter ego: Zeiger.
Neither Sohier Chaput nor Zeiger responded to the Montreal Gazette's request for comment.
Sohier Chaput's brother hung up the phone twice when called by the Montreal Gazette. His father did not respond to email and telephone requests to pass along contact information to Sohier Chaput.
The Montreal Gazette also sent a letter to Sohier Chaput's apartment by courier and rang his doorbell twice to no avail. His landlord agreed to pass along a message, but as of Wednesday, he has not replied.
On white nationalist forums, Zeiger and other Montreal users brag about beating anti-fascist protesters and pasting Nazi stickers on the métro and co-ordinate their attendance at far-right rallies.
They also refer to a 2016 meeting with a representative from Students for Western Civilization, which led a campaign in 2015 for the creation of white student unions on Toronto university campuses.
One of the Montreal group members claims to have hosted a lecture by Ricardo Duschene, a University of New Brunswick professor who believes mass immigration is causing the ethnocide of European Canadians, in the summer of 2017.
Duschene denies any association with the group.
"I spoke at a meeting in Montreal last summer but it was for another group that does not identify as 'alt right,'" he wrote in an email to the Montreal Gazette. "I don't identify myself as 'alt right', and less so would I ever speak at a meeting organized by Daily Stormer.
"I am aware that someone by the name 'Charles Zeiger'posted one of my talks, but this was done without my knowledge, and I have no idea who he is."
Zeiger's reach extends beyond the North American movement. When the British government disbanded the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, the group's final communiqué personally thanked Zeiger and Andrew Anglin for their work in spreading propaganda.
Anglin and Zeiger have repeatedly claimed their goal is to use internet culture as a way of making extremist ideas more palatable to a mainstream audience.
"(Young men) can go onto these forums and ... they'll be immersed in fascist culture, Nazi jokes, meme culture and (it) gradually breaks down their inhibitions toward the most despicable forms of violence," says Alexander Reid Ross, a lecturer at Portland State University. "Forum culture in general has helped to draw people into this fever swamp of fascist ideas."
Reid Ross is the author of Against the Fascist Creep, a sweeping history of post-Second World War fascist ideology.
Before founding the Montreal group, Zeiger claimed responsibility for the resurgence of Siege, a 1980s manifesto that calls for individual acts of terrorism as a means to create a white ethnostate. Posting on the forum the Right Stuff, Zeiger wrote that he digitized the book to help it reach a wider audience.
Siege's resurgence within white supremacist circles is mostly "selfmarginalizing," Reid Ross said, adding that the book is "a thing 14-year-old boys read when they're angry at their moms."
"However, for those few people who do pick it up ... it is definitely extremely dangerous. It points to a movement of leaderless resistance that's been growing since Charlottesville."
Zeiger attended the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last summer with a small group of Quebecers. At the end of the march, a right-wing extremist drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
The rally in Charlottesville marked a turning point for the neo-Nazi movement in the United States. Before Heyer's death, white supremacist ideology had been creeping its way into mainstream politics.
But the violence from that day triggered a backlash that forced the movement back underground, according to Reid Ross.
"It showed that you can't get a (large) group of Nazis together in one place without there being some kind of murder, attempted murder, assault or things like that."
After Charlottesville, the Daily Stormer published an article titled, "Heather Heyer: A Woman Killed in Road Rage Incident Was a Fat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut." They were subsequently removed from web hosting by GoDaddy, Google and a series of international domains.
The site was hosted on the dark web for a brief period, but has re-emerged on the open internet through Eranet International Limited, a web hosting service based in China.
Hankis says there's a link between the ideology espoused on sites like the Daily Stormer and acts of mass violence in the United States.
After murdering nine people at a predominantly African-American church in South Carolina, Dylann Roof released a manifesto outlining his racist views. Verbatim sections of the manifesto appeared in the Daily Stormer's message boards in the months leading up to the 2015 massacre.
James Harris Jackson, who was charged with murdering a black man in New York City with a sword last year, told reporters he was an avid reader of the Daily Stormer.
Andrew Anglin and Zeiger did not respond to the Montreal Gazette's email request for comment.
However, a disclaimer on the website says it opposes violence and seeks "revolution through the education of the masses." Further, it adds, "anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned."
One expert cautions that while Quebec's extremist movement is still relatively small, it is attracting a growing number of angry, disillusioned young men.
Maxime Fiset is a reformed neo-Nazi who now does outreach work for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence. He estimates that active support for "alt-right" groups in Quebec number in the hundreds or thousands.
While the rise of far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance have made waves in local media, Fiset says Zeiger's movement targets a much different demographic.
"La Meute is an older crowd, between 40 and 65 years old," he said. "With the alt-right, it's more like between 15 and 35. They're not as structured and organized, but they're becoming more and more visible."
Fiset's job is to try to understand how young men are indoctrinated with hateful ideology in hopes that they can be rehabilitated.
He said that the process of radicalization often begins with a feeling of injustice and sense of isolation. This leads to the person questioning why they are unhappy, and then either coming to terms with their situation, or seeking retribution for their distress.
"The person usually begins a path of questioning, which is legitimate, because injustices are corrected by some of those who challenge them at first," Fiset said. "But it may become something much more dark when the person eventually arrives to more violent answers. That could be as common as hate speech or as dire as terrorism."
For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early. In a white supremacist podcast, he describes his process of radicalization.
"I think I was about 14 when I was reading about the Holocaust and realized that it was a hoax," he said. Later, he was exposed to a blog post that was "anti-Semitic from a liberal perspective," in that it described Jewish people as racist.
"This resonated with me, because my sister she had dated a Jew for a while, but his family forbade him from marrying her."
From there, Zeiger fell deeper into the online rabbit hole of anti-Semitic propaganda, bingeconsuming hundreds of hours of white nationalist radio shows and YouTube videos.
"I saw a video ... and I wasn't that right-wing at that point so I thought, 'Oh my God, this is so extreme, this is racist.'But I thought it was interesting," he said on a December 2016 podcast. "So after that I listened to (hours of these) radio shows, one after the other.
"It took like a few weeks but I listened to all like 300 of them. After that I was like, 'Gas the k--, race war now.'" Fiset says he doesn't believe that radicalized youth are irredeemable. He is living proof that a person can be drawn away from the extremist fringe.
But he worries that, left unchecked, the spaces that Zeiger inhabits can move beyond internet hate speech and into real-world violence.
"We need to address this because they're living in very dark corners of the web, without any boundaries, without any limits, without any structure or counter narrative," Fiset said. "These guys are just alone, evolving together, in what becomes more and more violent ideologies, and it's not getting any better. We're just starting to realize that we have a ticking time bomb on our hands."

Full text: The rise of the far-right has left a mark on Quebec politics in recent years. From demonstrations by groups like La Meute or Storm Alliance, to the participation of Quebecers in the Unite the Right rally( http://montrealgazette.com/news/suspended-la-meute-member-spotted-at-quebec-city-protest ) in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, the far-right is more active than it has been in a generation.
It's important to clarify some nuances between strains of far-right theory and strategy in order to understand this phenomenon. According to Maxime Fiset, who works at the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence, it can be divided into three main categories.
The first, and most common, is far-right populism. Members of these groups tend to be older, and their public messaging tends to minimize or deny their racism. Instead, these groups usually focus on appealing to the dominant values like secularism. In Quebec, groups such as La Meute and Storm Alliance would fall into this category.

The second type is traditional neo-fascist groups. Groups in this category often look like punks and skinheads - although it's important to remember that not all skinheads are neo-Nazis, many are anti-fascist. Locally, groups such as Atalante Québec and the Soldiers of Odin fall into this category.
The newest category is the alt-right. These groups tend to congregate online, and are generally not organized into formal groups in Quebec. They tend to use humour, memes, and internet culture to attack Jewish people, immigrants, Muslims, people of colour, leftists, and so on, in order to normalize values of white supremacy. Several of these online groups are beginning to organize parties, lectures, and real-world events in and around Montreal. For Fiset, the alt-right represents the "most worrying" threat of terrorism in the province - worse than other categories such as radical Islamism.
Alexander Reid Ross, author of Against the Fascist Creep, clarifies that while these differences are important to remember in theory, the divisions are less clear in the real world. In other words, some people will be active both in La Meute, for example, and in the alt-right, and work to bring the most extreme ideas to the larger groups.

"It took like a few weeks but I listened to all like 300 of them. After that I was like, 'Gas the k--, race war now.'" Fiset says he doesn't believe that radicalized youth are irredeemable. He is living proof that a person can be drawn away from the extremist fringe.
But he worries that, left unchecked, the spaces that Zeiger inhabits can move beyond internet hate speech and into real-world violence.
"We need to address this because they're living in very dark corners of the web, without any boundaries, without any limits, without any structure or counter-narrative," Fiset said.
"These guys are just alone, evolving together, in what becomes more and more violent ideologies, and it's not getting any better. We're just starting to realize that we have a ticking time bomb on our hands."

Full text: One of North America's most influential neo-Nazis lives in Montreal and is organizing a white supremacist network on the island.
"Zeiger" is the pseudonym for the second-most prolific writer on the Daily Stormer, an extreme right-wing news website that attracts upwards of 80,000 unique visitors a month.
The site traffics in conspiracy theories, refers to African Americans as "nogs," to gay men as "f---ots" and devotes coverage to what it calls the "Race War" and the "Jewish Problem." Along with the Daily Stormer's other authors, Zeiger has helped spread this ideology to a new generation of young white men across North America.
Since emerging as a key figure in the movement four years ago, Zeiger's identity has been a closely guarded secret. But an investigation by the Montreal Gazette has linked Zeiger to a local IT consultant in his early 30s.
Gabriel Sohier Chaput lives in an apartment in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. That same apartment was listed by Zeiger as his home and as a rendezvous point for a local neo-Nazi group, according to documents obtained by the Gazette.
The group also met at downtown bars, apartments and a hotel between August 2016 and January 2018. At various points, members self-identified as altright, alt-reich, Nazis, fascists and white supremacists.
They acted on the instructions of a man referring to himself as Zeiger from the Daily Stormer. Zeiger co-ordinated the time and place of most meetings.
"Zeiger is probably second to only Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's founder and chief propagandist," said Keegan Hankes, the Southern Poverty Law Center's senior analyst. "(Zeiger) has been very influential in the strategies behind it." The SPLC monitors the online presence of hate groups throughout North America. Zeiger used his infamy as a recruiting tool, sharing a manifesto he authored as well as hyperlinks to his Daily Stormer articles and podcast appearances with the local group.
They first met at an Irish pub on Prince Arthur Street in August 2016. Shortly afterward, he introduced them to another Montrealbased fascist group.
Over a two-and-a-half-year period, a core of between 10 and 15 members gathered in bars and apartments around the city. Only men were allowed to attend their official meetings, but they opened up some events to women and "normies" - a term they use to describe people outside the movement.
The information that links Zeiger to Sohier Chaput comes from anti-fascist activists who monitor neo-Nazi and other far-right groups online.
The anti-fascists cross-referenced Zeiger's profiles on white supremacist websites like Iron March, the Right Stuff and the Daily Stormer with information Zeiger provided to a closed Montrealbased chat room.
A home address Zeiger shared with the chat group matches the corporate listing for GSC Gestion, a consulting firm whose owner and sole employee is Sohier Chaput.
Ironically, two key pieces of information linking both men came from Zeiger himself, who, during a March 11 appearance on a white supremacist podcast, revealed that he attended high school in Outremont. Although Zeiger did not name the school, it narrowed the activists'search down.
They also believed his real first name was Gabriel after digging into Zeiger's profile on the neo-Nazi website Iron March. The profile was connected to a Skype account registered under the name "gabriel_zeiger."
The anti-fascists then found and combed through a small library of yearbooks from Outremont high schools. They were searching for someone whose first name, age and appearance matched Zeiger's.
They found a 2002 yearbook from Paul-Gérin-Lajoie-d'Outremont, which Sohier Chaput attended in Grade 10. They saw a resemblance between the 2002 photo of Sohier Chaput and Zeiger's online profiles.
Compared to Zeiger's enormous digital footprint, there are only traces of Sohier Chaput online.
He was an IT manager at a UPS store before branching out as an independent contractor in 2016, according to his profile on a job networking site.
A Google search for his name yields a SoundCloud account and an entry noting his second-place finish in the 2012 St. Lawrence Toastmasters public-speaking competition.
He does not appear to have public profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkdin or other social media.
Instead, the anti-fascists claim, he exists under a Nazi alter ego: Zeiger.
Neither Sohier Chaput nor Zeiger responded to the Montreal Gazette's request for comment.
Sohier Chaput's brother hung up the phone twice when called by the Montreal Gazette. His father did not respond to email and telephone requests to pass along contact information to Sohier Chaput.
The Montreal Gazette also sent a letter to Sohier Chaput's apartment by courier and rang his doorbell twice to no avail. His landlord agreed to pass along a message, but as of Wednesday, he has not replied.
On white nationalist forums, Zeiger and other Montreal users brag about beating anti-fascist protesters and pasting Nazi stickers on the métro, and co-ordinate their attendance at farright rallies.
They also refer to a 2016 meeting with a representative from Students for Western Civilization, which led a campaign in 2015 for the creation of white student unions on Toronto university campuses.
One of the Montreal group members claims to have hosted a lecture by Ricardo Duchesne, a University of New Brunswick professor who believes mass immigration is causing the ethnocide of European Canadians, in the summer of 2017.
Duchesne denies any association with the group.
"I spoke at a meeting in Montreal last summer but it was for another group that does not identify as 'alt right,'" he wrote in an email to the Montreal Gazette. "I don't identify myself as 'alt right', and less so would I ever speak at a meeting organized by Daily Stormer.
"I am aware that someone by the name 'Charles Zeiger'posted one of my talks, but this was done without my knowledge, and I have no idea who he is."
Zeiger's reach extends beyond the North American movement. When the British government disbanded the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, the group's final communiqué personally thanked Zeiger and Andrew Anglin for their work in spreading propaganda.
Anglin and Zeiger have repeatedly claimed their goal is to use internet culture as a way of making extremist ideas more palatable to a mainstream audience.
"(Young men) can go onto these forums and ... they'll be immersed in fascist culture, Nazi jokes, meme culture and (it) gradually breaks down their inhibitions toward the most despicable forms of violence," says Alexander Reid Ross, a lecturer at Portland State University. "Forum culture in general has helped to draw people into this fever swamp of fascist ideas."
Reid Ross is the author of Against the Fascist Creep, a sweeping history of post-Second World War fascist ideology.
Before founding the Montreal group, Zeiger claimed responsibility for the resurgence of Siege, a 1980s manifesto that calls for individual acts of terrorism as a means to create a white ethno-state. Posting on the forum the Right Stuff, Zeiger wrote that he digitized the book to help it reach a wider audience.
Siege's resurgence within white supremacist circles is mostly "self-marginalizing," Reid Ross said, adding that the book is "a thing 14-yearold boys read when they're angry at their moms."
"However, for those few people who do pick it up ... it is definitely extremely dangerous. It points to a movement of leaderless resistance that's been growing since Charlottesville."
Zeiger attended the whitesupremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer with a small group of Quebecers. At the end of the march, a right-wing extremist drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
The rally in Charlottesville marked a turning point for the neo-Nazi movement in the United States. Before Heyer's death, white supremacist ideology had been creeping its way into mainstream politics.
But the violence from that day triggered a backlash that forced the movement back underground, according to Reid Ross.
"It showed that you can't get a (large) group of Nazis together in one place without there being some kind of murder, attempted murder, assault or things like that."
After Charlottesville, the Daily Stormer published an article titled, "Heather Heyer: Woman Killed in Road Rage Incident Was a Fat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut."
They were subsequently removed from web hosting by GoDaddy, Google and a series of international domains.
The site was hosted on the dark web for a brief period, but has re-emerged on the open internet through Eranet International Limited, a web hosting service based in China.
Hankes says there's a link between the ideology espoused on sites like the Daily Stormer and acts of mass violence in the United States.
After murdering nine people at a predominantly African-American church in South Carolina, Dylann Roof released a manifesto outlining his racist views.
Verbatim sections of the manifesto appeared in the Daily Stormer's message boards in the months leading up to the 2015 massacre.
James Harris Jackson, who was charged with murdering a black man in New York City with a sword last year, told reporters he was an avid reader of the Daily Stormer.
Andrew Anglin and Zeiger did not respond to the Montreal Gazette's email request for comment.
However, a disclaimer on the website says it opposes violence and seeks "revolution through the education of the masses." Further, it adds, "anyone suggesting or promoting violence in the comments section will be immediately banned."
One expert cautions that while Quebec's extremist movement is still relatively small, it is attracting a growing number of angry, disillusioned young men.
Maxime Fiset is a reformed neo-Nazi who now does outreach work for the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence. He estimates that active support for "alt-right" groups in Quebec numbers in the hundreds or thousands.
While the rise of far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance have made waves in local media, Fiset says Zeiger's movement targets a much different demographic.
"La Meute is an older crowd, between 40 and 65 years old," he said. "With the alt-right, it's more like between 15 and 35. They're not as structured and organized, but they're becoming more and more visible."
Fiset's job is to try to understand how young men are indoctrinated with hateful ideology in hopes that they can be rehabilitated.
He said that the process of radicalization often begins with a feeling of injustice and sense of isolation. This leads to the person questioning why they are unhappy, and then either coming to terms with their situation, or seeking retribution for their distress.
"The person usually begins a path of questioning, which is legitimate, because injustices are corrected by some of those who challenge them at first," Fiset said. "But it may become something much more dark when the person eventually arrives to more violent answers. That could be as common as hate speech or as dire as terrorism."
For Zeiger, the "path of questioning" began early. In a white supremacist podcast, he describes his process of radicalization.
"I think I was about 14 when I was reading about the Holocaust and realized that it was a hoax," he said. Later, he was exposed to a blog post that was "anti-Semitic from a liberal perspective," in that it described Jewish people as racist.
"This resonated with me, because my sister she had dated a Jew for a while, but his family forbade him from marrying her."
From there, Zeiger fell deeper into the online rabbit hole of anti-Semitic propaganda, binge-consuming hundreds of hours of white nationalist radio shows and YouTube videos.
"I saw a video ... and I wasn't that right-wing at that point so I thought, 'Oh my God, this is so extreme, this is racist.'But I thought it was interesting," he said on a December 2016 podcast. "So after that I listened to (hours of these) radio shows, one after the other.

Full text: Although Montreal experienced a mostly watered-down version of a promised ice storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-montreal-weather-warnings-are-watered-down-for-now ), the overnight double-whammy of precipitation and below-freezing temperatures left many streets a slick mess.
St-François-Xavier St. in Old Montreal can be a bit of a hassle at the best of times, but it was slippery enough Monday morning to inspire Joshua Walsh to pause for a 15-second video.
In it, pedestrians trying to make it from St-Antoine St. to St-Jacques St. have to cling to a centuries-old building or wait for the aid of a Good Samaritan who apparently hadn't changed their winter boots yet.

Full text: What began as a morning of school cancellations, windshield maintenance and fears for the worst was by midday Monday officially designated as another grey, blustery, rainy day in April.
Six hours after issuing a freezing rain warning for the Montreal area, Environment Canada lifted that warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1614327341268895851201804140504ww1070cwulEnd ) after it became apparent that the cause of concern had quite literally melted away.
Which isn't to say Monday morning didn't start with a glaze of ice-driven dread as Montrealers woke up to a sheen of ice on sidewalks and side streets. And a better-safe-than-sorry consensus was quickly reached among Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.
But in the end, major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, and the weather warning of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec" seems to have melted away only slightly less quickly than the ice that formed overnight Monday.
There were several reports of traffic accidents early Monday morning linked to the overnight barrage of rain and freezing rain, including a hydroplaning incident involving three cars on Highway 40 near Sources Blvd. However, Urgences Santé otherwise reported no increase in calls due to ice related injuries or accidents.
Meanwhile the ice-related damage to Hydro-Québec's power grid in the Outaouais region saw the number of customers without power swell from nearly 30,000 early Monday morning to more than 42,000 by noon.
Also, the aftershocks of Sunday's storm in Toronto( https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2018/04/15/second-wave-of-ice-storm-pummels-gta.html ) were continuing at midday to make themselves making themselves felt at Montreal-Trudeau airport, as many departing flights to that city and to several destinations in the United States were delayed or cancelled.
The forecast for Monday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius, with periods of rain accompanied by wind gusts of up to 60 to 70 km./hr. continuing into Monday evening.

Montrealers woke up to a glaze of ice on sidewalks and side streets that seemed well on its way to melting Monday morning.
But while major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, a freezing rain warning remained in effect( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, one that warned of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec."
And that threat was enough for all Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.

There were several reports of traffic accidents Monday morning linked to the overnight barrage of rain and freezing rain, including a hydroplaning incident involving three cars on Highway 40 near Sources Blvd. Meanwhile, nearly 30,000 Hydro-Québec customers in the Outaouais region were without power, although their outages represented 48 of the 78 power failures reported across all of Quebec.
The aftershocks of Sunday's storm in Toronto( https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2018/04/15/second-wave-of-ice-storm-pummels-gta.html ) were making themselves felt early Monday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport, as many departing flights to that city were delayed or cancelled.
The forecast for Monday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius, with periods of freezing rain changing to rain this afternoon and more rain continuing into the evening.

Full text: A nasty spring storm that will bring ice pellets, freezing rain and strong winds to the greater Montreal region could lead to treacherous conditions on highways, roads and sidewalks on Monday, Environment Canada says.
Between 10 and 20 millimetres of precipitation is predicted to fall by Monday evening, with several hours of freezing rain expected, Environment Canada says in a weather warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1614327341268895851201804140504ww1070cwul ) it issued for island of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Varennes, La Prairie and Châteauguay areas.
The freezing rain could cause roads and walkways to "become icy, slippery and hazardous," the agency says, making for a tricky morning and evening commute.
Power outages and falling tree branches may also occur during the slow-moving storm.
The English Montreal School Board sent out a tweet on Sunday night saying officials "will be monitoring the road conditions as the safety of our students and staff remains our priority."
The city of Montreal will spread salt and other abrasives on streets and sidewalks and Transport Québec has asked its contractors to spread abrasives on the highways.
Motorists who have had their winter tires removed need to be vigilant when driving on slick highways on Monday, said Mila Roy, a spokesperson for Transport Quebec.
Roy suggested that using public transit would be a better option than driving, if possible.
The storm may cause flight delays or cancellations at Trudeau Airport. Check with your airline( https://www.admtl.com/en/flights/departures )before heading to the airport.
The storm wreaked havoc as it crossed Ontario, causing hundreds of traffic accidents and power outages.
There is rain in the forecast for Montreal for the rest of the week, according to Environment Canada.

Full text: When the village gathers to celebrate, Michael Cameron tends to stay home.
It's not that Cameron is some sort of grinch. In fact, his default facial expression suggests he's constantly struggling not to grin.
Cameron says he doesn't like being in large crowds because of the things he has seen as a paramedic in Salluit. Of the 12 locals who took the community's first medical technician course in 2003, only Cameron remains on duty.
And in that time, he has seen things that make him appreciate the quiet moments with his wife and kids.
"I'm starting to come out of it, but it's been like this for about 10 or 15 years," Cameron said. "I've had a child die in my arms. I've seen gunshot victims, suicides, murders. At times, you're trying to be the one that's ... you're still working on the victim, but you know it's too late.
"To be the one to tell a father his two-month-old died in an accident. To be the one who they hug - whether it's a good call or a tragic one - when it's all over. It can be a lot to carry in such a small community."
In remote Salluit, the relationship between life and death is at the core of even the most banal day, Cameron says.
If you want to live here, you have to hunt. If you're going to hunt, you need to stay alive in the elements. And no one, not even the most experienced navigator, is immune to nasty weather.
Beyond his duties as the town's game warden and its chief paramedic, Cameron is the co-ordinator of Salluit's search-and-rescue team. Two years ago, he led an expedition to find a man who had wandered to the edge of town during a whiteout.
"He'd gone for a walk to get spring water and the weather turned on him," Cameron said. "He tried to brave the storm but got tired, lay down, fell asleep and never woke up again. We found him near the gravel pit at the end of the road over there."
Another young man, Steven Yuliusi, took off on his snowmobile on New Year's Eve and never returned. Cameron says he lost control of the vehicle and drove over the edge of a 30-metre gorge.
The fall destroyed his snowmobile, but somehow Yuliusi survived it.
"He was just 10 kilometres outside of town. He knows the area so he started limping home," Cameron said. "We tell our kids to never leave their machine if something goes wrong. Well, sure enough, we found his snowmobile in the ravine after just one day of searching, but it took us four days to find the body. He was three kilometres from the crash site."
In the remote Nunavik region, deaths caused by accidents are more than three times the provincial average, according to a 2015 study by the Université Laval. On average, there are 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with three per 10,000 throughout Quebec.
In Salluit, assistant town manager Barbara Papigatuk says the inherent danger of living in such an unforgiving environment binds people together.
When someone ventures onto the territory and doesn't return, the village shuts down. Businesses close, government offices are put on hold and every able-bodied adult assists in the search-andrescue operation.
That's what happened when Papigatuk's brother Frankie Ikey went missing in June 2011.
Nothing about that day suggested things would take a bad turn. It was sunny and mild, but there was still enough slush on the ground for Frankie to tow his boat to Deception Bay with a snowmobile.
He had taken his son Stas and friend Adamie Alaku seal hunting, something all of them had done dozens of times before.
"There were other boats out on the water, but they came back. Not my brother," Papigatuk said. "My brother, his son and Adamie, my brother-in-law. I lost three family members in one day."
Papigatuk was 1,800 kilometres south, studying at Concordia University, when she heard the news.
"Frankie was my best friend.
People used to think we were twins," she said. "When I found out he was missing, I had to get home."
The search parties were still scouring the northern coast when Papigatuk's flight landed in Salluit. The Canadian Rangers and locals navigated the waters in fishing trollers, calling out their names onto the Hudson Strait.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Forces flew aircraft low over the shoreline, scanning for any sign of life. Air Inuit also joined the operation, sending a plane to loop around the Labrador coast in case the boat had drifted into the Atlantic Ocean.
There had been a glimmer of hope, a few days in, when a camper said he heard one of the missing men on his CB radio. But in the end the military called off its search on June 15, one week after Frankie set out on the water. They never recovered any of the missing men's remains.
"I couldn't breathe for the longest time," Papigatuk said. "The fear of not knowing where he was or if he was dead or alive, it stayed for years. I'm calming down about it these days.
"I know he won't come home.
I'm not an idiot, I know he's gone. But I do miss him. We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
Cameron lost a cousin to the sea about seven years ago. He went out in a canoe on a spring morning and never came back. In the end, the canoe washed up on shore, but Cameron never saw his cousin again.
"I always said before, to his wife and my wife, 'When he dies, I'm going to be there with him,'" Cameron said. "'We're gonna die together,'I'd say. We always did search and rescue together, we always hunted together. It was sort of a saying for me. 'If one of us goes, we're both going.'But that didn't happen.
"It's like that in the North." Two years ago, Cameron and his son were the first responders during a hunting accident that took the life of a teenage boy. He was with his cousin and they were playing with a rifle, unaware that a bullet was in the chamber when it discharged.
In the end, there was little Cameron or anyone could do to mend the child's wound.
Cameron doesn't talk about how the accident affected him. Instead, he says he worries about the child's parents and about the sweet kid who'll grow up with a sense of guilt no child should ever have to know.
"No matter who you are, whether you're a child or an elder, seeing these sorts of things, you can't just lock those memories away," he said.
There are, of course, stories of resilience and survival on the land. For every person lost to the wilderness, there are many more who were found or made their way home on foot.
A relative of Cameron's got stuck in a blizzard on his way back from Deception Bay one afternoon. To wait out the storm, he dug a shelter under his sled and kept warm.
By the time the sun came back out, he tunnelled his way out of a 10-foot snowdrift and used the reflection of his metal harpoon to signal for help.
"When you combine a person's instinct for survival with some of the knowledge that comes with living here, those are two very powerful things," Cameron said. "Like most people, I try not to go out alone. And even for a small trip, I always bring extra rations, a thermal blanket and candles in case I get stuck out there."
"To live here is to be a survivor.
That's just how it is." ccurtis@postmedia.com Twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text: Montrealers should brace themselves for the possibility of being force fed another weather cocktail this weekend.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday morning, warning that several regions - including Montreal - could face "winterly precipitation" beginning Sunday thanks to a low pressure system headed our way from the United States.
"Snow changing to freezing rain is possible for the Greater Montreal, the Outaouais and the Eastern Townships. Regions farther north may receive significant snowfall amounts," reads the statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#32047390255769761201804120504ws1070cwul ), which was issued at 5:42 a.m.
The weather monitoring agency expects the storm to continue on Monday "as the band of heavy snow and freezing rain will spread toward Quebec City."
The statement notes that the weather system's track remained uncertain as of Thursday, as did the amount and type of precipitation that can be expected.

Full text: Last winter, reporter Christopher Curtis travelled to the small community of Salluit in northern Quebec. This is Part 5 of his seven-part series This Is Salluit.
SALLUIT - When the village gathers to celebrate, Michael Cameron tends to stay home.
It's not that Cameron is some sort of grinch. In fact, his default facial expression suggests he's constantly struggling not to grin.
Cameron says he doesn't like being in large crowds because of the things he has seen as a paramedic in Salluit. Of the 12 locals who took the community's first medical technician course in 2003, only Cameron remains on duty.
And in that time, he has seen things that make him appreciate the quiet moments with his wife and kids.
"I'm starting to come out of it, but it's been like this for about 10 or 15 years," Cameron said. "I've had a child die in my arms. I've seen gunshot victims, suicides, murders. At times, you're trying to be the one that's ... you're still working on the victim, but you know it's too late.
"To be the one to tell a father his two-month-old died in an accident. To be the one who they hug - whether it's a good call or a tragic one - when it's all over. It can be a lot to carry in such a small community."
In remote Salluit, the relationship between life and death is at the core of even the most banal day, Cameron says.
If you want to live here, you have to hunt. If you're going to hunt, you need to stay alive in the elements. And no one, not even the most experienced navigator, is immune to nasty weather.
Beyond his duties as the town's game warden and its chief paramedic, Cameron is the coordinator of Salluit's search-and-rescue team. Two years ago, he led an expedition to find a man who had wandered to the edge of town during a whiteout.
"He'd gone for a walk to get spring water and the weather turned on him," Cameron said. "He tried to brave the storm but got tired, lay down, fell asleep and never woke up again. We found him near the gravel pit at the end of the road over there."
Another young man, Steven Yuliusi, took off on his snowmobile on New Year's Eve and never returned. Cameron says he lost control of the vehicle and drove over the edge of a 30-metre gorge.
The fall destroyed his snowmobile, but somehow Yuliusi survived it.
"He was just 10 kilometres outside of town. He knows the area so he started limping home," Cameron said. "We tell our kids to never leave their machine if something goes wrong. Well, sure enough, we found his snowmobile in the ravine after just one day of searching, but it took us four days to find the body. He was three kilometres from the crash site."
A boat lies on the shore of the Hudson Strait in Salluit, the second-northernmost Inuit community in Quebec.
In the remote Nunavik region, deaths caused by accidents are more than three times the provincial average, according to a 2015 study by the Université Laval. On average, there are 11.5 deaths per 10,000 residents compared with 3.0 per 10,000 throughout Quebec.
In Salluit, assistant town manager Barbara Papigatuk says the inherent danger of living in such an unforgiving environment binds people together.
When someone ventures onto the territory and doesn't return, the village shuts down. Businesses close, government offices are put on hold and every able-bodied adult assists in the search-and-rescue operation.
That's what happened when Papigatuk's brother Frankie Ikey went missing in June 2011.
Nothing about that day suggested things would take a bad turn. It was sunny and mild, but there was still enough slush on the ground for Frankie to tow his boat to Deception Bay with a snowmobile.
He had taken his son Stas and friend Adamie Alaku seal hunting, something all of them had done dozens of times before.
Barbara Papigatuk, the assistant city manager in Salluit, lost a brother, his son and a brother-in-law to the sea: "We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
"There were other boats out on the water, but they came back. Not my brother," Papigatuk said. "My brother, his son and Adamie, my brother-in-law. I lost three family members in one day."
Papigatuk was 1,800 kilometres south, studying at Concordia University, when she heard the news.
"Frankie was my best friend. People used to think we were twins," she said. "When I found out he was missing, I had to get home."
The search parties were still scouring the northern coast when Papigatuk's flight landed in Salluit. The Canadian Rangers and locals navigated the waters in fishing trollers, calling out their names onto the Hudson Strait.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Forces flew aircraft low over the shoreline, scanning for any sign of life. Air Inuit also joined the operation, sending a plane to loop around the Labrador coast in case the boat had drifted into the Atlantic Ocean.
There had been a glimmer of hope, a few days in, when a camper said he heard one of the missing men on his CB radio. But in the end the military called off its search on June 15, one week after Frankie set out on the water. They never recovered any of the missing men's remains.
"I couldn't breathe for the longest time," Papigatuk said. "The fear of not knowing where he was or if he was dead or alive, it stayed for years. I'm calming down about it these days.
"I know he won't come home. I'm not an idiot, I know he's gone. But I do miss him. We didn't have closure, but I'm not the only one in town who suffered like that."
Cameron lost a cousin to the sea about seven years ago. He went out in a canoe on a spring morning and never came back. In the end, the canoe washed up on shore, but Cameron never saw his cousin again.
"I always said before, to his wife and my wife, 'When he dies, I'm going to be there with him,' " Cameron said. " 'We're gonna die together,' I'd say. We always did search and rescue together, we always hunted together. It was sort of a saying for me. 'If one of us goes, we're both going.' But that didn't happen.
"It's like that in the North."
Two years ago, Cameron and his son were the first responders during a hunting accident that took the life of a teenage boy. He was with his cousin and they were playing with a rifle, unaware that a bullet was in the chamber when it discharged.
In the end, there was little Cameron or anyone could do to mend the child's wound.
Cameron doesn't talk about how the accident affected him. Instead, he says he worries about the child's parents and about the sweet kid who'll grow up with a sense of guilt no child should ever have to know.
"No matter who you are, whether you're a child or an elder, seeing these sorts of things, you can't just lock those memories away," he said.
There are, of course, stories of resilience and survival on the land. For every person lost to the wilderness, there are many more who were found or made their way home on foot.
A relative of Cameron's got stuck in a blizzard on his way back from Deception Bay one afternoon. To wait out the storm, he dug a shelter under his sled and kept warm.
By the time the sun came back out, he tunnelled his way out of a 10-foot snowdrift and used the reflection of his metal harpoon to signal for help.
"When you combine a person's instinct for survival with some of the knowledge that comes with living here, those are two very powerful things," Cameron said. "Like most people, I try not to go out alone. And even for a small trip, I always bring extra rations, a thermal blanket and candles in case I get stuck out there."
"To live here is to be a survivor. That's just how it is."

Social Notes: Batshaw Centres Foundation's canapés for the cause

Abstract: The sheer volume of events that take our party city by storm each social season renders it virtually impossible to cover them all in a calendar year, leading to the sad eventuality that some amazing, inspiring fundraisers get lost in the mix - until, of course, the next year, when we can turn the Social Notes spotlight in their direction, phew! First-place honours eventually went to the Sumac team, who dazzled diners with their succulent lamb kibbeh nayyeh. Established in the late '70s, the volunteer-driven non-profit seeks "to help break the cycle of neglect, abuse and failure experienced by many children aged 0-18 years and their families," via its support of the Centres' invaluable programs for Montreal youth facing challenging situations who reside either with their own families, in foster care, in residential placement, or are moving toward independent living.

Full text: Noties, we might not have the same population as NYC, but I'd bet major accessory dollars that on a per capita basis, we're pretty competitive when it comes to the number of events per year. The sheer volume of events that take our party city by storm each social season renders it virtually impossible to cover them all in a calendar year, leading to the sad eventuality that some amazing, inspiring fundraisers get lost in the mix - until, of course, the next year, when we can turn the Social Notes spotlight in their direction, phew!
Foundation vice-president Janet Faith and Westmount Mayor Christina Smith catch up at the Défi Canapé fundraiser.
Which brings us to today's event, the Batshaw Centres Foundation's third annual Défi Canapé fundraiser. While we didn't have the pleasure of this soul-replenishing event experience in 2017, I'm truly thrilled to be sharing the highlights of this year's edition today, along with some significant background about the Batshaw centres and the extraordinary work they do on a routine basis that makes such a course-changing difference in the lives of so many young Montrealers.
TIME TO GET "APPY": Is good food and drink your thing? (Rhetorical question!) Then the Batshaw event at Entrepôts Dominion was the place to be on a still-chilly late March night. The savvy organizing crew behind the Défi assembled an incredibly well-curated array of offerings from some of the most noteworthy eateries in the city, including Bishop and Bagg/Burgundy Lion, Loïc, Mouton Noir, Sumac and Tuck Shop - all well washed down thanks to generous cocktails courtesy of Tavern on the Square and Bierbrier beer.
EVEN COOLER: Each eatery's station featured special "competitive canapés" for guests to enjoy before casting a vote for their fave of the night. And lemme tell you, Noties, the competition was steep. First-place honours eventually went to the Sumac team, who dazzled diners with their succulent lamb kibbeh nayyeh.
Foundation directors and event committee members Liana Thibodeau, Elizabeth Caddick and Janet Faith join event co-chairs Laura Lavy and Tina Khan for a group photo hug at the Batshaw Centres Foundation's third annual Défi Canapé fundraiser.
MORE FÊTE FAB: In addition to the wildly impressive tastebud stimulation, the evening famous for good schmooze and auction bidding didn't disappoint there either. Lots of good laughs were had, and bids and buys were made for a variety of luxury items and experiences (think Air Canada biz-class tickets to anywhere in North America).
Batshaw Centres Foundation directors Laura Lavy, Andrew Clark and Erin O'Brien sport sizable smiles at the Défi Canapé fundraiser.
AS FOR THE CROWD ... well, it was downright fabulous, peppered with the influential and wittily conversational likes of Westmount Mayor Christina Smith; CN vice-president human resources Kimberly Madigan; former Batshaw foundation president Karma Hallward and husband John Hallward; CN's Marc Lemoyne and wife Linda, of Nova Montreal; CIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l'Île-de-Montréal's Assunta (Sue) Gallo, and Katherine Moxness; media relations master Mark Lowe; the sublime Christopher (Kippy) Wiegand, a power partner at Deloitte; Westmount city councillor Mary Gallery; CIUSSS-ODIM board member/foundation president Judy Martin with husband Michael Martin; 3Macs/Raymond James finance wizard Tim Price; foundation vice-president Janet Faith; event committee co-chairs Tina Khan and Laura Lavy; winners of the 2018 Défi Canapé, Sumac's David Bloom and Raquel Zagury; stylish supporters Stephanie and Dan Lavy; personal trainer to the stars Shana Rotstein with husband, GMP Securities' David Perlman; the simply amazing Hana Kim; foundation directors and event committee members Andrew Clark, Erin O'Brien, Liana Thibodeau and Elizabeth Caddick; and proud Batshaw top brass, foundation exec director Michael Udy and Centres director Dave Brown.
TOPPEST TAKE-AWAY: Thanks to generous patrons and event partners like lead sponsor Jarislowsky, Fraser, an impressive and difference-making $75,000 was raised for the foundation. Established in the late '70s, the volunteer-driven non-profit seeks "to help break the cycle of neglect, abuse and failure experienced by many children aged 0-18 years and their families," via its support of the Centres' invaluable programs for Montreal youth facing challenging situations who reside either with their own families, in foster care, in residential placement, or are moving toward independent living.
Bravo, Batshaw!

Abstract: Starting Tuesday, parts of this province could see spots of snow, flurries and freezing rain( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ).

Full text: This is an April Fool's joke, right?
Over the weekend, Environment Canada announced that a spring storm was making its way up from the central United States, over the Great Lakes and into Quebec. Starting Tuesday, parts of this province could see spots of snow, flurries and freezing rain( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ).
The good news is that Montreal will likely be spared the worst of it. The latest forecasts predict rain for our city, not more of the dreaded white stuff. OK, fine. But it's still just a little too close for comfort as far as I'm concerned.
Listen up, Mother Nature. Allow me to speak on behalf of all Montrealers: I'm done. We're all done.
We've put in our time. A full 88 days, 23 hours and 47 minutes of winter, to be precise. Dec. 21 marked the solstice and the first day of winter. March 20 was officially the first day of spring( http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/equinoxes-and-solstices ). That's quite enough, thank you. Let's get on with it.
Skiing, sledding and ice-skating all hold a certain allure in December. I love cozy nights in front of a fire after a day of snowshoeing in January. Bring on the snowman building in February. Getting friends together to visit a favourite cabane à sucre for maple syrup and pancakes in March? Pure magic. But let's be clear about one thing. There is nothing romantic about freezing rain in April - although at least the sidewalks won't stay icy long.
It's been a particularly long, cold, difficult winter. And, no, it's not just your imagination: We really did get more snow than usual this year. A typical winter snowfall in this city runs around 190 centimetres. This year, we were walloped with 235 centimetres( http://www.iheartradio.ca/cjad/news/montreal-busting-budget-over-snow-removal-1.3692497 ). There were days in December where Montreal was quite literally colder than Antarctica, the North Pole or the planet Mars( http://dailyhive.com/montreal/canada-weather-colder-north-pole-mars ). Because it was so cold, the snow didn't thaw. This made matters worse for everyone involved. Over at our place, we broke a couple of shovels trying to break through the layers of ice covering the stairs and walkway, and I'm pretty sure we're not alone. We know that the conditions made for a very cumbersome season for snow and ice removal all around the island. Not to mention expensive: The city spent $180 million in snow clearing operations and had to open two emergency dump sites. It was a politically challenging experience for the newly minted Projet Montréal administration,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ) which was criticized for its slow, ineffective response in dealing with slippery sidewalks and mountains of snow.
In my family, our supplies - much like our zest for winter - have been fully exhausted. There is not a single matching pair of mittens or gloves to be found anywhere in my house. Ditto for woolly socks. My kids have grown out of their snow pants and jackets. In an act of faith, I've gone so far as to send my heavy-duty parka - streaked with salt, sand and dirty snow - to the dry cleaners. I've swapped my winter boots for rain boots. The summer tires are out of storage and ready to be put on the car. I've got boxes of stuff in my basement all ready for a Sunday afternoon garage sale. We live in a drafty old house in the Plateau and I've spent too much time over the past few months cocooned in blankets, armed with mugs of tea. Bring on the warmer weather. I am ready for terrasse season.
To all my fellow winter weary Montrealers, fear not. Look around. Kids are out on skateboards and scooters. Cafés are cracking open their windows. The days are getting longer and the sunshine feels stronger. It won't be long before Bixis will be back in operation.
Despite the burst of cold weather on the way this week, the harbingers of spring are everywhere. Hang in there.

Full text: Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area in anticipation of what it describes as a "spring storm" expected to roll into Quebec on Tuesday evening and continue on Wednesday.
The service says a weather system developing in the central United States is expected to move across the Great Lakes region and "bring significant amounts of snow starting Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday evening for regions north of the St. Lawrence Valley."
Across southern Quebec the precipitation is expected to take the form of freezing rain in areas close to the St. Lawrence River and rain elsewhere, although Environment Canada acknowledges "uncertainty" over where exactly the system will head once it reaches Quebec.

Abstract: Caire rose in the house during question period to express his indignation over the naming of the deputy-minister of the energy and natural resources, Dominique Savoie, to the board of directors of Hydro-Québec. "What is indecent is to see the MNA for La Peltrie (Caire) rise each time to discredit the public sector," Moreau fired across the floor in response, reminding the house that the CAQ has spoken in the past about the need to purge the civil service of people who don't think like it does. A series of nasty unprintable words followed from at least two CAQ MNAs, leading Moreau to accuse Caire of swearing at the deputy-speaker of the house, Maryse Gaudreault, who was acting as house referee Thursday.

Full text: QUEBEC - One day after accusing Premier Philippe Couillard of lying in his attacks against them, the Coalition Avenir Québec has again come under fire from the Liberals - this time for its attitude toward women.
But an indignant CAQ returned the volley saying they are victims of a Liberal smear campaign of "organized lies," and they aren't going to take it anymore.
"Yesterday we were against immigrants. Today we're against women," CAQ MNA Nathalie Roy said at a hastily called news conference. "What's next? We're against seniors?
"These kind of accusations are completely ridiculous, unworthy of his function."
The he in question is Natural Resources Minister Pierre Moreau, who ignited a storm in the legislature Thursday in answering a question from CAQ MNA Éric Caire, the party's point person on public administration.
Caire rose in the house during question period to express his indignation over the naming of the deputy-minister of the energy and natural resources, Dominique Savoie, to the board of directors of Hydro-Québec.
Savoie was booted out of her job as a deputy-minister in the transport department two years ago by Couillard following allegations of mismanagement by Quebec's auditor-general.
A furious Caire said the fact that the government named this "bad administrator" to such a prestigious position smacked of indecency.
"What is indecent is to see the MNA for La Peltrie (Caire) rise each time to discredit the public sector," Moreau fired across the floor in response, reminding the house that the CAQ has spoken in the past about the need to purge the civil service of people who don't think like it does.
Moreau then described Savoie as a person of great integrity, cleared of all accusations against her. He accused Caire of showing a lack of respect.
A series of nasty unprintable words followed from at least two CAQ MNAs, leading Moreau to accuse Caire of swearing at the deputy-speaker of the house, Maryse Gaudreault, who was acting as house referee Thursday.
"This mirrors perfectly the attitude of the CAQ towards women, towards minorities, towards the civil service," Moreau said.
Later, meeting reporters, Moreau went further, saying the CAQ sometimes "displays misogynistic tendencies."
But the CAQ took it in the teeth from the Parti Québécois as well on Thursday with leader Jean-François Lisée calling on the party to make public its values test for immigrants.
Lisée read a copy of an email sent by the CAQ to a researcher on the identity issue, Micheline Labelle, in which the CAQ says it will only make the test public if it wins the October general election and forms a government.
"In the case of the values test, either you propose it or you shut up," Lisée told reporters.
A CAQ aide later confirmed the email reflects party policy. And if the CAQ formed a government, the values test would be drafted by bureaucrats in the Immigration Ministry, not by CAQ politicians.
"Did the PQ make public its charter of values before the election?" the aide asked. "No."

Full text: Transit users in Montreal do not need to fear a reduction in transit choices with the coming of the REM light-rail train line, West Island mayors and the mayor of Montreal said Thursday.
"Everybody needs to calm down and understand what a great opportunity this is for Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue," Mayor Paolo Hawa said. "I have no concerns for Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue or any other routes because the (regional transit planning authority) will be co-ordinating with the STM (Société de Transport de Montréal)."
City officials have been assured that service will be continued on the Vaudreuil-Hudson commuter train line that cuts through the southern sector of the West Island, while the Réseau express métropolitain line will travel further north, near Highway 40.
Mayors were responding to reports( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/proposed-deal-for-rem-would-kill-some-existing-transit-services ) that the REM, the Montreal-area electric commuter train project overseen by the Caisse de dépôt, intends to obtain exclusive rights to serve certain sectors of its planned route that would eliminate some existing transit services and redirect their clientele to its stations. Among the services that could be eliminated are those travelling across the Champlain Bridge and linking Montreal-Trudeau airport with downtown.
The monopoly rights are detailed in a confidential work document obtained by Presse Canadienne and prepared by the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain (ARTM) - the regional transit authority for the Montreal area - and the corporation overseeing the REM.
The proposed agreement comes to light as the REM project has come under fire, most specifically by the Parti Québécois opposition, which this week announced that if it forms the next government it will scrap the project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pq-would-pull-the-plug-on-rem-in-favour-of-trams-express-buses ) in favour of extending the existing transit network.
'Feeder clauses'
The proposed agreement would see the REM take over large territories covered by non-compete clauses to ensure the train's profitability. There would also be "feeder clauses" that would guarantee the ARTM would direct public transit users toward REM stations.
One of the maps detailing the plan depicts a monopoly zone that extends west from Highway 13 to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue and another in Laval that extends west from Highway 13 to the lower Laurentians.
On the South Shore, the monopoly zone extends south from Highway 116 between Saint-Basile-le Grand and Candiac.
In Montreal, to non-compete zone is contained by St-Laurent Blvd., Jean-Talon St. and Côte-des-Neiges Rd. and extends to the Mont-Saint-Hilaire commuter line and the Bonaventure Expressway.
The working document says the ARTM agrees that "no public transit services (except for handicapped transport) will be offered" within the monopoly zones, between Montreal Island and the South Shore via the Champlain Bridge or between Montreal-Trudeau airport and downtown or the Lionel-Groulx métro station.
Meanwhile, the ARTM also undertakes to direct bus commuters toward REM stations. Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle noted, however, that it makes sense to recalibrate the bus routes in light of the new rail system coming into place, just as bus routes are reworked when new métro stations are created. Bourelle and Hawa said the ARTM has been in regular contact with affected municipalities to ensure their needs are met.
'I don't see an issue'
"I think we're making a storm in a teapot, I don't see any problems," he said. "Certainly from the West Island perspective, I don't see an issue." Certain bus routes may be eliminated if they are made redundant by the train line, he noted, including the 747 bus route connecting downtown to the airport. "I did not hear in any of our discussions that services will lessened. On the contrary, it will be value added."
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante told reporters Thursday the question of monopoly zones and feeder routes is not set in stone and is worked out with all the parties involved. She invited the corporation managing the REM project to explain the concepts to the public.
The REM is a $6.3-billion Montreal-area commuter train project overseen by the Caisse de dépôt but also financed by the provincial and federal governments as well as Hydro-Québec.
Once completed by 2021 it is expected to extend from Deux-Montagnes to Brossard, serve the West Island, the airport and central Montreal, and possess 26 stations.

Restaurant review: Heirloom Pizzeria adds value to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve

Abstract: There's also a cocktail selection, and a wine list that's quite elaborate but not all that pizza-friendly, with more Spanish reds available by the glass and just one Italian. The pizzas are generous in size and baked in a wood-burning oven in the open kitchen at the back of the room. For dessert, we were a bit too stuffed for the hazelnut and chocolate pizza - I've had Nutella pizza a few times and consider it a dish designed for ravenous children and marathon runners - but the kids jumped at the idea of the milkshake desserts.

I was in New York City over spring break, walking the streets of the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, Times Square and even past Trump Tower - booing- with my kids. When we got to SoHo, I felt a lecture brewing.
"You know, kids," I said, walking among the hordes of tourists, "when you're in school and the subject of gentrification comes up, remember this neighbourhood, which was once filled with sweatshops and later populated by starving artists and impoverished rock stars, but now has a Prada shop, a Chanel shop, an Apple store, Balthazar bistro and some of the most expensive real estate in the city. They actually call that transformation of a neighbourhood the SoHo Effect.
"See there," I said, pointing to a brick building on Crosby St., "that was a paper factory 100 years ago, before they turned it into loft condominiums in the '90s. It's where Courtney Love used to live. It sold for $7 million."
They looked at me, eyes rolling, and said: "Who's Courtney Love?"
Back in Montreal, we headed out for dinner at a new restaurant on Ontario St. in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve called Heirloom. Owned by Dominic Laflamme and Vincent Châtelais - the partners behind the bring-your-own-wine establishments État-Major (right next door) and Quartier Général (located in the Plateau) - Heirloom opened in December. Unlike their other restaurants, this one is Italian, with an emphasis on pizza, and there's a wine list to boot.
Heirloom Pizzeria is the latest offering from the team behind Etat-Major and Quartier General.
Entering on a Tuesday night, we took a seat in this stylish and rather crowded room. I explained to the kids that there's a bit of a SoHo Effect going on in this neighbourhood as well, with hundreds of condos and several swish new restaurants and shops causing a storm with locals who are worried that an influx of primarily young residents will cause the embourgeoisement of their quartier, thus driving up rents.
As pricey downtown and Plateau spaces sit languishing with "à louer" signs in their windows, low-rent locales in areas like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve are attracting young restaurateurs. And considering how difficult it is to make a buck in the restaurant business these days, can we blame them? More affluent areas of the city are deserted at night, but neighbourhoods like this one, Verdun and the once-sleepy Griffintown are hopping. Granted, it's not an ideal situation for long-time residents fearing rent hikes, but was inevitable here as much as in New York, London, Paris and beyond.
I carried on for a bit longer, but the kids were more interested in the pizzas whizzing past, and understandably so.
Heirloom Pizzeria's spaghetti carbonara was filled with chunks of smoky pancetta.
As is the case with many of Montreal's new pizzerias, Heirloom offers a rather predictable menu, with the usual trattoria suspects including Caesar salad, arancini, fried calamari, arugula/Parmesan salad and meatballs. As for mains, there are three pastas and a good selection of pizza, ranging from the inevitable Margherita to a few white-sauce pies. There's also a cocktail selection, and a wine list that's quite elaborate but not all that pizza-friendly, with more Spanish reds available by the glass and just one Italian.
The piping hot and tender calamari is served with spicy mayonnaise at Heirloom Pizzeria.
We began with the Caesar, calamari and a half portion of spaghetti carbonara. All were excellent, especially the piping hot and tender calamari served with spicy mayonnaise. The Caesar had a great garlicky dressing, and the carbonara was filled with chunks of smoky pancetta. Sure, it was a little rich, but boy, was it good.
Heirloom's sausage pizza with rapini and red peppers was typically generous in size.
As for the pizza, we opted for the "garnie" (all dressed) and the "saucisses italiennes," a sausage pizza with rapini and red peppers. The pizzas are generous in size and baked in a wood-burning oven in the open kitchen at the back of the room. Both pizzas were heavy on the toppings, which meant you couldn't lift up a slice without a lot of fixin's sliding off onto your plate. As for the taste, the crust lacked that nan-bread-like puffiness you get with the best Neapolitan-style pies, but had a pleasant wheaty flavour. The tomato sauce could use zuzzing up to serve as a better flavour enhancer for the toppings. There was also an excess of red peppers on both pizzas, and the rapini on the sausage pizza was undercooked. All taken, the pizza was good, but not on a par with the best in Montreal. There's room for improvement, but these are small fixes that could be made in a day.
We also tried the pappardelle with mushroom/rabbit ragout. Like the carbonara, the pasta was rich and delicious, but cloying after a few bites, with a sauce that seemed overly buttered or oiled. We couldn't finish it. Again, I see potential, but they aren't quite there yet.
The subtle flavour was exactly right in Heirloom Pizzeria's dulce de leche milkshake.
For dessert, we were a bit too stuffed for the hazelnut and chocolate pizza - I've had Nutella pizza a few times and consider it a dish designed for ravenous children and marathon runners - but the kids jumped at the idea of the milkshake desserts. One was a chocolate shake with chunks of brownie stirred throughout, and received a big thumbs-up. The second was a dulce de leche milkshake garnished with a single sugary churro. Sucked up in seconds, that shake actually tasted like dulce de leche; considering that's quite a subtle flavour, bravo!
One of the high points of our evening was the service, which was efficient and incredibly friendly. Everyone from the man taking the phone reservations to the last fellow who said goodbye was an absolute peach.
It's still early days for this ambitious pizzeria. With fair prices and a beautiful, lively space, Heirloom is a great addition to the neighbourhood. And for residents in search of a lower-cost option, there's a takeout counter as well.

Flood victims voice their frustrations

Full text: Some victims of last year's floods say they are still in bureaucratic hell, waiting for public agencies to provide promised compensation.
Several of those residents took to the microphone at a public meeting in Pierrefonds-Roxboro Tuesday night to voice frustration with what they say has been terrible communication and poor co-ordination between public agencies.
About 150 people attended the meeting of the city's public security committee, held in ground zero of last year's flooding, the Pierrefonds Cultural Centre. Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux said this month that roughly 80 per cent of the people affected by last spring's floods have received some compensation, worth $135 million.
However that was little solace to some who came out to the public meeting.
"We are real people and we're suffering, going through mental torture and nightmares," said Taussef Bhatti, an Île-Bizard resident who has been living in a hotel with his wife and children since last May. Bhatti is still waiting for a permit to rebuild his house and has received no cash advances from the province to do so. "What is a reasonable time period that we should be allowed to suffer?" Alex Norris, the chairperson of the public security committee, said while he can't address specific questions, he pointed out that it is difficult for different public bodies to co-ordinate when someone's house has been flooded and must be rebuilt.
While communication seems to be a problem for flood victims trying to get back on their feet, communication was also problematic during the response to the disaster, the city's public security commission heard at the meeting Tuesday.
Roughly 1,100 citizens were affected when 430 homes were flooded last year in Pierrefonds- Roxboro, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Île-Bizard during the historic floods. The city declared a state of emergency on May 7, and the army was called in to respond to a disaster on the island for the first time since the ice storm of 1998. A total of 36 families remain lodged in hotels while their homes are being repaired.
"The rapidity of the phenomenon made it seem that our plan and our capacity to respond was not sufficient to face this emergency; that's when we declared a state of emergency," Louise Bradette said at the meeting.
Bradette, the city's chief resilience officer, presented a report with 46 recommendations on how the city can improve its response to disasters, based on what went wrong last May.
Among the problems she identified were different agencies, like the police department, the fire department and the city, all working on their own emergency response plans without proper co-ordination between the departments.
She also said there was confusion among the city and the boroughs on whose job it was to acquire sandbags and the city's 311 telephone line was not equipped to handle a high volume of calls from citizens needing help.
To help attenuate future disasters, Bradette said the city has to redo its mapping of flooding risk areas, identify problems caused by building in flood zones and come up with a better way to forecast risks in the future.
At the meeting, several citizens also voiced concerns about the borough permitting development in the flood zones, saying it could contribute to future flooding risks.
Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough Mayor Jim Beis told the Montreal Gazette prior to the meeting the borough is conscious of the risks and will not be developing anywhere that could lead to further risks.
"No one is building on wetlands," Beis said. "If there ever is an eventual project on any part of Pierrefonds West, for example, all that is for debate. By no means will we build at any cost."
Beis said he believed a 5,500-unit housing development proposed by former Montreal mayor Denis Coderre's administration for the area near wetlands in the western sector of Pierrefonds could be developed responsibly. However the project seems to have fallen out of favour with Mayor Valérie Plante.
Beis added the borough has shored up dikes in the area, and has been making preparations over the last 10 months to ensure it can prevent future disasters and respond better in the event of a repeat occurrence. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder

Abstract: Among the problems she identified, were different agencies, like the police department, the fire department and the city all working on their own emergency response plans without proper co-ordination between the departments. To help attenuate future disasters, Bradette said the city has to redo its mapping of flooding risk areas, identify problems caused by building in flood zones, and come up with a better way to forecast risks in the future. At the meeting, several citizens also voiced concerns about the borough permitting development in the flood zones, saying it could contribute to future flooding risks.

Full text: Some victims of last year's floods say they are still in bureaucratic hell, waiting for public agencies to provide promised compensation.
Several of those residents took to the microphone at a public meeting in Pierrefonds-Roxboro Tuesday night to voice frustration with what they say has been terrible communication and poor co-ordination between public agencies.
About 150 people attended the meeting of the city's public security committee, held in ground zero of last year's flooding, the Pierrefonds Cultural Centre.
Quebec Public Security Ministry Martin Coiteux said this month( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-unveils-24-point-plan-to-improve-disaster-relief-preparedness ) that roughly 80 per cent of the people affected by last spring's floods have received some compensation, worth $135 million. However that was little solace to some who came out to the public meeting.
"We are real people and we're suffering, going through mental torture and nightmares," said Taussef Bhatti, an Île-Bizard resident who has been living in a hotel with his wife and children since last May. Bhatti is still waiting for a permit to rebuild his house and has received no cash advances from the province to do so. "What is a reasonable time period that we should be allowed to suffer?"
Alex Norris, the chairperson of the public security committee said while he can't address specific questions, he pointed out that it is difficult for different public bodies to co-ordinate when someone's house has been flooded and must be rebuilt.
While communication seems to be a problem for flood victims trying to get back on their feet, communication was also problematic during the response to the disaster, the city's public security commission heard at the meeting Tuesday.
Roughly 1,100 citizens were affected when 430 homes were flooded last year in Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Île-Bizard during the historic floods. The city declared a state of emergency on May 7, and the army was called in to respond to a disaster on the island for the first time since the ice storm of 1998. A total of 36 families remain lodged in hotels while their homes are being repaired.
"The rapidity of the phenomenon made it seem that our plan and our capacity to respond was not sufficient to face this emergency; that's when we declared a state of emergency," Louise Bradette said at the meeting.
Bradette, the city's chief resilience officer, presented a report with 46 recommendations on how the city can improve its response to disasters, based on what went wrong last May.
Among the problems she identified, were different agencies, like the police department, the fire department and the city all working on their own emergency response plans without proper co-ordination between the departments. She also said there was confusion among the city and the boroughs on whose job it was to acquire sandbags and the city's 311 telephone line was not equipped to handle a high volume of calls from citizens needing help.
To help attenuate future disasters, Bradette said the city has to redo its mapping of flooding risk areas, identify problems caused by building in flood zones, and come up with a better way to forecast risks in the future.
At the meeting, several citizens also voiced concerns about the borough permitting development in the flood zones, saying it could contribute to future flooding risks.
Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis told the Montreal Gazette prior to the meeting the borough is conscious of the risks and will not be developing anywhere that could lead to further risks.
"No one is building on wetlands," Beis said. "If there ever is an eventual project on any part of Pierrefonds West, for example, all that is for debate. By no means will we build at any cost."
Beis said he believed a 5,500-unit housing development proposed by former Montreal mayor Denis Coderre's administration for the area near wetlands in the western sector of Pierrefonds could be developed responsibly. However the project seems to have fallen out of favour with Mayor Valérie Plante.
Beis added the borough has shored up dikes in the area, and has been making preparations over the last 10 months to ensure it can prevent future disasters and respond better in the event of a repeat occurrence.

Full text: As a winter storm roared across the province last March, Pierre Thibault and Michaël Fiset ignored the advice of colleagues who urged them to ride out the dangerous blizzard at their office in Montmagny and not attempt to drive home.
Their decision would prove to be a fatal mistake.
About 10 hours after leaving the transportation company where they worked, police found the two men dead after the truck they were travelling in had become trapped in a high snowdrift northeast of Quebec City.
Both men died of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to a coroner's report released on Tuesday.
The two friends didn't take the blizzard warnings seriously enough, even though major highways in the area were closed and a gas station attendant had urged them not to travel, coroner Luc Malouin says in his report.
A Sûreté du Québec rescue operation was delayed for two hours because officers trained to drive the two snowmobiles at the Montmagny detachment weren't in the station when the men called for help. If the police officers had been deployed two hours earlier, they may have arrived on the scene while the two men were still alive, Malouin said.
"It's impossible to say if the police officers could have located the two men in time to save their lives, but it would have increased their chances," he wrote.
On the same evening, hundreds of motorists were trapped( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-snow-stories-hundreds-stranded-on-highway-13-during-storm ) in deep snow on Highway 13 in Montreal.
The tragic incident began on the evening of March 14, 2017 as a bad storm made its way across the region northeast of Quebec City. Locals said it was one of the worst storms in years.
Fiset, 33, who drove a Ford-150 with all-wheel drive, was confident that he could navigate the difficult conditions, despite heavy snow and high winds.
When they left the office of Transport Gilmyr around 9:24 p.m., Fiset planned to drop his friend off at his home in Berthier-sur-Mer, about 13 kilometres away, before heading home to St-François-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud.
A few hours earlier, the SQ had closed Highways 20 and 132 because of whiteout conditions on the roads.
The only other route home was Coteau Rd. in Montmagny, but that road had also been closed because of the storm.
Fiset decided to drive around the barrier and continued on his journey. At 10:43 p.m., he became stuck in a 1.5-metre-high snowdrift on Principale St.
Both men contacted locals they knew seeking help, but no one could venture out because there was zero visibility and they couldn't see across the street.
Thibault, 42, then made calls to the SQ and 911 at 11:18 p.m., saying they were stuck in the snow and needed assistance.
But before Thibault phoned police, Fiset walked to a residence about 34 metres away and borrowed two shovels to try to dig out.
Back at the SQ detachment in Montmagny, police were making plans to send out two snowmobilers to rescue the trapped men. But the departure was delayed because an officer qualified to drive the snowmobile was on patrol elsewhere and had trouble getting back to the office.
While police were trying to mobilize the rescue team, conditions in the truck were deteriorating.
Fiset made a second call to 911 at 12:05 a.m. and a third call at 12:51 a.m., saying Thibault was having an asthma attack and was having trouble breathing.
At 12:58 a.m., police informed Thibault the rescue team would be leaving shortly.
By 1:16 a.m., Fiset called police to say he was also having trouble breathing and that Thibault was now unconscious. It was the last call Fiset would make.
The SQ snowmobile team finally left Montmagny at 1:20 a.m. as the storm continued to intensify with howling winds and whiteout conditions.
About 30 minutes into the journey, the snowmobile drivers also became stuck in a snowdrift. The police officers continued their journey on foot and arrived on Principle St. at 2:15 a.m., but they could not find Fiset's truck because it was buried in the snow.
The officers then sought shelter in a home because they were so cold. They eventually found the truck in three metres of snow at 7:50 a.m. and needed a backhoe to reach it.
It was then that they made the grim discovery. Fiset was found dead outside the truck and his friend was dead in the driver's seat.
In his report, Malouin said every citizen is responsible for their own safety, adding that motorists can't always rely on emergency services to respond quickly in bad winter weather. He said Quebecers need to take severe weather alerts more seriously.
He also recommended that the SQ change its practices to ensure that officers who are qualified to drive snowmobiles are in the detachment during severe winter storms so they can be deployed quickly.
"Having snowmobiles to respond to emergencies is excellent, but if no one is available to drive them, they become useless," he wrote.

Impact coach tinkers to good effect against Toronto with reinforcements in offing

Full text: Rémi Garde, the Impact's first-year head coach, has complained about a lack of depth on his roster. But if Montreal can weather the storm of its early-season schedule, top-heavy with road games, some interesting scenarios could play out.
Saturday afternoon at Olympic Stadium, seeking its first victory following two defeats, Garde tinkered with his roster against Toronto FC, dressing centre-back Rod Fanni, signed barely two weeks ago, for the first time. He moved Michael Petrasso to midfield and, more important, used Jeisson Vargas at striker along with star and captain Ignacio Piatti.
Meanwhile, striker Matteo Mancosu, who missed a practice during the week for what the team described as a therapy day, wasn't dressed.
Vargas, the 20-year-old Chilean, scored in the 41st minute - the first time this season Montreal has opened the scoring - and the goal stood up, the Impact off the schneid following this 1-0 victory before 26,005 spectators.
"That result was big for us, considering we had two away games, which is tough. We needed the three points today," Petrasso said. "This was a big result for us. We scored early and fought our way through it.
"I thought (Garde's personnel decisions) was good. He obviously watched clips on Toronto and saw a way we could keep them from creating opportunities and keeping their key players in places where they weren't dangerous. I think that helped a lot. They didn't have many chances in the first half. Piatti and Vargas were dangerous today."
Garde should have more reinforcements at his disposal in the coming days. Numerous reports have suggested both Uruguay's Alejandro Silva, a right-back/midfielder, and Rudy Camacho, a French defender, are about to be signed. And now Garde must also determine whether his squad is more dangerous without Mancosu?
Piatti and Vargas combined for eight of the Impact's 14 shots - two on target - while creating six chances. Montreal could have easily scored more goals against Toronto had the talented Piatti, who set up Vargas on the goal, relied more frequently on his playmaking abilities on this day.
"They (Piatti and Vargas) were spectacular today," Petrasso said. "I think it helped, obviously scoring the goal was good. Them two playing together, they kept the ball, which helped us - especially when your wingers are fullbacks going up and down. You get tired. Knowing you can play it up to Piatti or Vargas and they keep it for you, which allows you time to get up. That helped a lot."
Suddenly, it's Toronto, the defending Major League Soccer Cup champions, who are winless in two games, although that statistic comes with a caveat.
The Reds were playing their second game in four days after capturing the Champions League quarter-final in Mexico against Tigres UANL, losing the second leg of the two-game aggregate, but advancing on the away-goal tiebreaker. Nonetheless, Greg Vanney's squad proved remarkably resilient, showing few signs of the emotional and physical toll it must have felt. And Vanney dressed all his stars - Michael Bradley, Sebastian Giovinco and Jozy Altidore - against Montreal.
"The situation is difficult to cope with for big teams ... regarding the travel is difficult," Garde said. "It was probably difficult for them, but if they want to exchange their place in (the Champions League) ... I'll accept it.
"It's a problem for big teams, but they have a deep squad. They had a good game today as well. I'm only the Montreal coach."
Impact's Mike Petrasso (24) challenges Toronto FC midfielder Nicolas Hasler in Montreal on Saturday, March 17, 2018.
Utilizing a 3-5-2 formation from back to front, the Impact proved to be compact defensively. Fanni, the 36-year-old French veteran, certainly showed he deserves to continue remaining in the starting formation.
"I'm pleased but not really surprised," Garde said. "I asked a lot of questions to a lot of people in France. When you see a player still playing at 36, not having so much big injuries in his career, you can guess he's a pretty good professional. He loves the game and is very passionate.
"I needed him today."
The game was spirited and chippy, the work of referee Robert Sibiga dubious at best. Garde was particularly animated on numerous occasions as he attempts to understand North American officiating, but was loath to complain too profusely to the media.
"When you live the game live, there's passion on the field, especially on my bench. I know that," he admitted. "But I don't want to speak too much about the refereeing today."
There certainly were some anxious moments for both Garde and his players late in the game, the visitors pressing for the tying goal.
Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush got a piece of an Altidore shot in the 84th minute, but had to rely on Petrasso clearing the ball away as it rolled toward the empty net. Three minutes later Bradley, from distance, was just wide.
Montreal, of course, was guilty of surrendering late leads a year ago.
"There wasn't really concern. There was a sense of calmness in a lot of those moments," Bush said. "That's what you need to close out those types of games. Last year we kind of fell flat at the end of games because of our fitness levels. That's not the case this year.
"To be fair, we were creating chances until the end, too."

Full text: Here are five things you should know about the Canadiens-Maple Leafs game at Air Canada Centre on Saturday (7 p.m., CBC, SN, TVA Sports, TSN 690 Radio):
The matchup: The oldest rivalry in the NHL has lost some of its lustre this season because the Leafs are good and the Canadiens are very bad. This is the third of four meetings between these teams and Toronto won the first two games at the Bell Centre. The Leafs needed overtime to win 4-3 on Oct. 14 and romped to a 6-0 win on Nov. 18. The Canadiens will return to Toronto to close the season on April 7.
Price getting closer: Goaltender Carey Price, who has been out since he suffered a concussion on Feb. 20, accompanied the team to Toronto, but hasn't been cleared to play. The start will go to Charlie Lindgren, who has lost his last three starts after shutting out the Philadelphia Flyers( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/charlie-lindgren-shines-but-habs-offence-nowhere-to-be-found-vs-flyers ) on Feb. 26. Lindgren gave up 16 goals in the three losses and that left the rookie with a 4-7-2 record, a 2.95 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage.
Lehkonen finding the range: Artturi Lehkonen( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/in-the-habs-room-artturi-lehkonens-goals-could-be-a-good-omen )'s second NHL season has been marked by bad luck and injuries, but the Finn has regained his scoring touch, which produced 18 goals in 73 games last season. Lehkonen has four goals in the past four games for a total of nine goals in 55 games. He has been playing on the second line with Alex Galchenyuk and Jacob De La Rose.
Maple Leafs' James Van Riemsdyk falls as he chases a rebound in front of San Jose Sharks goalie Martin Jones in Toronto on Dec. 13, 2016.
Leafs weathering storm: Toronto star Auston Matthews( http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/montreal-canadiens/habs-in-toronto ) has missed the last eight games with a shoulder injury, but the Maple Leafs haven't missed a beat. They have won three in a row and are 6-2-2 in their last 10 games. Starting goaltender Frederick Andersen is day-to-day with an upper-body injury, which opened the door for Curtis McElhinney, who has been a winner in each of the past two games to boost his record to 9-4-1.
The trade you don't make: There was pressure on Leafs GM Lou Lamoriello to trade James Van Riemsdyk at the deadline because he is in a position to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Lamoriello elected to keep him because he didn't see a player who represented an upgrade. It has been a good decision because Van Riemsdyk has five goals in the last two games for a career-high 31.

Negotiations stall in Highway 13 blizzard class-action suit

Author: Fidelman, Charlie

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/negotiations-stall-highway-13-blizzard-class/docview/2014523235/se-2?accountid=12339

Full text: A year since hundreds of people got stranded in their cars overnight on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-fiasco-we-were-all-alone-working-with-no-help-tow-truck-operator-says ) because of a blizzard, lawyers hoping for a quick out-of-court class-action settlement say negotiations have stalled, until the next round.
The provincial government is willing, but the city of Montreal said no, lawyer Marc-Antoine Cloutier said Wednesday.
In November, a Quebec Superior Court judge gave the green light to a class-action lawsuit against the city and province. Quebec's Transport Ministry, the Sûreté du Québec and the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) are also named as defendants.
Two thousand claimants are seeking $2,500 apiece in damages for a total of $5 million. Many were trapped in the cold without food or water for up to 14 hours, and some needed access to regular medication. Those who ran out of gas also ran out of heat. They needed washroom facilities. Some families with children attempted to walk along the highway in search of help.
The government apologized, Cloutier said, but victims so far have received no financial compensation.
"One year later, it's time to put words to action and compensate victims who suffered harm," Cloutier said of people deprived of their freedom, dignity and safety.
Jacques Laramée, 65, said he is still traumatized by the events of the night of March 14. There was no indication that anything was wrong when he left his daughter's home in St-Jérôme at 4 p.m. for St-Constant to have supper with his wife.
Traffic slowed and finally ground to a halt along the storm-swept road, about four kilometres from the exit to Highway 20.
As diabetic who needs to take his medication, Laramée said he was concerned about his health, but there was no news about what caused the bottleneck on Highway 13 - nor how long he and hundreds of others would be stuck there.
He had no food and no water. He needed his medication. And he had to turn the car off to conserve gas.
The worst part was feeling powerless, he said. His stress mounted with each minute that passed, he said, choking with emotion.
A retired banker, Laramée said he has faced 14 holdups during his career, but getting trapped on the highway was worse.
"A hold-up lasts 30 seconds, but this lasted 10 hours," he said. "That's 10 hours of not knowing what to do."
He now packs his car with a survival kit, including food and water, blankets and other essential items.
Troubles on Highway 13 began as traffic grew in the snowstorm and cars began to break down, some running out of gas. Then two trucks reportedly got stuck and blocked the highway completely. Hundreds of 911 calls were reported. Hours passed and the provincial transport department didn't send in plows. Some tow trucks couldn't get through, and most were already busy elsewhere on the roads. Finally, the fire department was called in.
A report by government investigator Florent Gagné largely blamed Quebec Transport and the Sûreté du Québec for a series of gaps in communication about what was going on, followed by poor management of the situation that night; it also said that a Roxboro company had failed to clear snow and spread abrasives.

Full text: A powerful storm hitting the northeastern United States had ripple effects in Montreal Wednesday, causing several delays and cancellations at Montreal's Trudeau International Airport.
According to Anne-Sophie Hamel, a spokesperson for the airport, the storm caused a total of 60 departures and arrivals to be cancelled Wednesday.
Most cancellations were for flights either leaving for or arriving from Philadelphia, Boston and New York.
"It should be pretty stable from now on," Hamel said Wednesday evening. "But in the winter, we always ask travellers to doublecheck the state of their flights before leaving for the airport."
Environment Canada is calling for roughly five centimetres( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) of snow to fall in Montreal on Thursday.
A special weather statement is in effect for other parts of the province, including the Québec City area, where up to 15 centimetres of snow could fall before the weekend.

Researchers say spring flooding is a reality of climate change

Author: Greenaway, Kathryn

Abstract: According to climate-change experts Ursule Boyer-Villemaire and Philippe Gagnon, it isn't a question of whether it will flood again in the spring, it's a question of how bad the flooding will be. During a recent interview with the West Island Gazette, the two were measured with their optimism, but agreed that there are positive steps being taken in parts of Europe to cope with the realities of climate change and that this part of the world might well take a closer look to see what could be applied here. [...]the ground was frozen solid, so the run-off from the combination of rain and melting snow flowed into rivers or pooled on land.

Full text: According to climate-change experts Ursule Boyer-Villemaire and Philippe Gagnon, it isn't a question of whether it will flood again in the spring, it's a question of how bad the flooding will be.
Boyer-Villemaire and Gagnon are both working at Université du Québec à Montréal - he as a professor and she as a research associate - and both have PhDs in environmental science.
During a recent interview with the West Island Gazette, the two were measured with their optimism, but agreed that there are positive steps being taken in parts of Europe to cope with the realities of climate change and that this part of the world might well take a closer look to see what could be applied here.
Historic flooding affected thousands throughout the province last spring. Hard hit West Island and Off-Island communities included Hudson, Rigaud, Île-Mercier in Île-Bizard, Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue. Some people have yet to return to their homes because repairs are not complete. At least four residents of Pierrefonds-Roxboro were told their homes will have to be destroyed.
Gagnon said last spring's disaster was due to a perfect storm of weather incidents which, piled one on top of the other, resulted in a "high-intensity" weather event.
In March, there was snow. Then came heavy rain and a rapid melt. But the ground was frozen solid, so the run-off from the combination of rain and melting snow flowed into rivers or pooled on land.
"There is no doubt that with climate change, with warming conditions - there is more humidity in the atmosphere which can result in high-intensity events during the winter and the spring," Gagnon said. "Our capacity to manage the water cycle is strongly affected by the warming trend."
Water levels in Lake Ontario are high and the thaw has yet to begin. Ice jams and slush can also cause banks to be breached. The Moses-Saunders Power Dam near Cornwall and the Carillon Dam near Rigaud will be called upon to walk the delicate water-management tightrope.
Boyer-Villemaire said planting vegetation on the shoreline helps slow run-off. Combining vegetation with modest rock barriers installed by professionals is the next step. A more substantial, man-made barrier is also an option, but she said the bigger the barrier, the greater the chance that holding the water back on one property could result in water problems on neighbouring properties.
"Whatever is built has to be proven to be for the common good," she said.
Last week, the Quebec government released a 24-point action plan to improve the response to disasters. Better communication between the province and municipalities is part of the plan.
"That's good, but we also need easier access to crucial information for citizens," Boyer-Villemaire said.
She said real estate agents in France are compelled by law to inform potential buyers of any risk attached to a piece of land or a property before a deal is signed. Also in France, a percentage of each real estate deal is added to a fund which can be used to deal with the impact of climate change.
Boyer-Villemaire also spoke of a long-term evacuation plan in the United Kingdom. People who are living in what are now deemed flood plains are given up to 20 years to come to terms with the reality, take the time to grieve, and then look for a place to set down new roots.
The network of dikes in the Netherlands is considered to be the best in the world, built to last by experts in flood defence.
Boyer-Villemaire said drawing on expertise from a variety of sources is necessary as the province fine-tunes its response to disasters.
"And academics should be involved in the planning," she said. "We have knowledge to offer."

Abstract: A 19-year-old student suspected of killing his parents at a Central Michigan University dormitory before running from campus was apprehended early Saturday following an intensive daylong search that included more than 100 police officers, some heavily armed in camouflage uniforms, authorities said. A Malaysian official says the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 by a U.S. company will likely end in June, as families of passengers marked the fourth anniversary of the plane's disappearance with renewed hope that the world's biggest aviation mystery will be solved. The annual awards bestowed on the worst the movie business has to offer were announced Saturday in their traditional spot, the day before the Academy Awards.

Full text: A 19-year-old student suspected of killing his parents at a Central Michigan University dormitory before running from campus was apprehended early Saturday following an intensive daylong search that included more than 100 police officers, some heavily armed in camouflage uniforms, authorities said.
James Eric Davis Jr. was arrested without incident after an individual spotted him on a train passing through the north end of campus shortly after midnight, according to a release posted on Central Michigan's Emergency Communication website.
The university identified the two dead as Davis' mother Diva Davis and father James Davis Sr., a part-time police officer in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. The shooting occurred around 8:30 a.m. at a residence hall at Central Michigan, which is about 70 miles (112.6 kilometres) north of Lansing.
A fierce nor'easter that flooded streets, snapped trees in pieces and knocked out power to more than 1.8 million homes and businesses continued to lash the Atlantic coast, but the winds were expected to slowly let up as the storm moved offshore. Forecasters said rain and snow was expected to slowly come to an end early Saturday, hanging on across southern New England the longest.
The five killed during Friday's storm included two children. A man and a 6-year-old boy were killed in different parts of Virginia, while an 11-year-old boy in New York state and a man in Newport, Rhode Island, both were killed. A 77-year-old woman died after being struck by a branch outside her home near Baltimore.
A Malaysian official says the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 by a U.S. company will likely end in June, as families of passengers marked the fourth anniversary of the plane's disappearance with renewed hope that the world's biggest aviation mystery will be solved.
Malaysia in January inked a "no cure, no fee" deal with Houston, Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane, a year after the official search by Malaysia, Australia and China in the southern Indian Ocean was called off.
The plane vanished March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.
Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said Saturday that the search is going smoothly and is expected to end by mid-June.
Maybe it was destiny for a movie with a pile of poop as a central character. The Emoji Movie has received Hollywood's most famous frown, the Razzie Award , for worst picture of 2017, making it the first animated feature in 38 years to earn the top dishonour. In a statement, the Razzies said the film came in a year when "Hollywood's recycled trash heap attained an all-time high" and saw a "toxic-level lack of originality."
The annual awards bestowed on the worst the movie business has to offer were announced Saturday in their traditional spot, the day before the Academy Awards. The Emoji Movie landed four of the 10 Razzies given out this year, also taking worst screenplay, worst director and worst screen combo, which was given to "any two obnoxious emojis" from the movie.

$285-million ozonation plant facing delays, questions; Once call for tenders is completed, construction will speed up, official says

Full text: Montreal's future ozonation waste water treatment plant that was promised to be up and running this year and cost $285 million is now at least two years behind schedule, and city officials cannot confirm if the initial price estimate will be met.
The ozonation complex being built to remove bacteria, viruses and pharmacological toxins from the city's waste water before it's flushed into the St. Lawrence River will be the largest in the world.
When that will start happening, however, and how much it will actually cost is still very much up in the air. City officials are now saying they plan to put out calls for tender in the coming months, looking for companies to bid on the construction of the plant.
Sylvain Ouellet, the city's executive committee member responsible for water and water infrastructure who inherited the project after the November municipal elections, said Thursday the plant will not be operational until at least 2020 or 2021, which would put it three years behind schedule. He could not comment on whether price estimates remain the same, he said, for fear of tainting the bidding process.
"Once the call for tenders is completed, the construction phase will speed up considerably," he said.
He noted, however, that calls for tender sometimes fail because of a lack of bids that conform to standards and price expectations, causing further delays.
Experts have created detailed three-dimensional models to ensure there will be no surprises, Ouellet said, and to ensure they get the best price. As part of the contract, the city is also calling for bidders to operate the plant for the first few years, when defects are most likely to present themselves, and to assume unforeseen costs, he said.
"The project is following its course," city spokesperson Gabrielle Fontaine-Giroux wrote in an email in response to queries from the Montreal Gazette. "A contract was given for the supply of equipment in 2016 and for an electric plant in 2017. The call for tenders for construction will be launched in 2018," she said. ESTIMATE OF COSTS "Because the estimate of costs of construction will be used in that process, it cannot be communicated before the public launch of the call for tenders, (nor can we) announce the opening date of the new factory, or the total cost of the project."
The administration of former mayor Denis Coderre announced in early 2015 it would build the ozonation centre at the J.R.-Marcotte sewage treatment plant on the eastern edge of the island by 2018. The cost was estimated at $285 million, with 85 per cent of the bill being covered by the provincial and federal governments.
That year, the city awarded a $99-million contract to build an ozonation plant to create ozone gas to French firm Dégremont Ltée. That firm gave the only bid deemed suitable out of two submitted, after a tendering process that took four years. Dégremont's bid was also 40 per cent higher than the city's estimates. City officials said the variation arose because it had no projects of a similar scale on which it could base cost projections. Several elements of the Dégremont contract have yet to be fulfilled.
The city said it planned to launch a call for tenders in 2016 for the construction of buildings needed for ozonation, and another for the production of oxygen necessary in the process, Le Devoir reported at the time. The call for tenders for the construction of buildings is only being done this year. Montreal's waste water treatment plant, one of the largest in the world, handles the water from the city's homes, storm drains and snow-collection dumps. It filters out solids, which are incinerated, but it does little to extricate the bacteria that comes mainly from human excrement, as well as the pharmacological toxins harmful to aquatic life. Swimming is not recommended for kilometres downstream of Montreal.
Ozonation, in which ozone gas is injected into the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and pharmacological toxins, has been found to kill 95 per cent of bacteria, the majority of viruses and 75 per cent of pharmacological and cosmeticbased pathogens, city officials say.
Proponents argue the technology was chosen in 2008 after years of study by independent experts. They say the ozonation centre represents the best environmental news in the waste-water sphere in 30 years, which was when the J.R.-Marcotte treatment plant was inaugurated and Montreal stopped dumping its raw sewage into the St. Lawrence.
Critics counter that ozonation has not been used on this vast a scale for a reason - because it has been shown not to work in large urban settings - and that Montreal is being foolhardy by risking so much money on an untested technology. The time delays prove their point, they say.

Abstract: Montreal's future ozonation waste water treatment plant that was promised to be up and running this year and cost $285 million is now at least two years behind schedule, and city officials cannot confirm if the initial price estimate will be met. The call for tenders for construction will be launched in 2018," she said. "Because the estimate of costs of construction will be used in that process, it cannot be communicated before the public launch of the call for tenders, (nor can we) announce the opening date of the new factory, or the total cost of the project." The administration of former mayor Denis Coderre announced in early 2015 it would build the ozonation centre( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-waste-water-to-be-cleaned-using-ozone-starting-in-2018 ) at the J.R.-Marcotte sewage treatment plant on the eastern edge of the island by 2018.

Full text: Montreal's future ozonation waste water treatment plant that was promised to be up and running this year and cost $285 million is now at least two years behind schedule, and city officials cannot confirm if the initial price estimate will be met.
The ozonation complex being built to remove bacteria, viruses and pharmacological toxins from the city's waste water before it's flushed into the St. Lawrence River will be the largest in the world.
When that will start happening, however, and how much it will actually cost is still very much up in the air. City officials are now saying they plan to put out calls for tender in the coming months, looking for companies to bid on the construction of the plant.
Sylvain Ouellet, the city's executive committee member responsible for water and water infrastructure who inherited the project after the November municipal elections, said Thursday the plant will not be operational until at least 2020 or 2021, which would put it three years behind schedule. He could not comment on whether price estimates remain the same, he said, for fear of tainting the bidding process.
"Once the call for tenders is completed, the construction phase will speed up considerably," he said.
He noted, however, that calls for tender sometimes fail because of a lack of bids that conform to standards and price expectations, causing further delays.
Experts have created detailed three-dimensional models to ensure there will be no surprises, Ouellet said, and to ensure they get the best price. As part of the contract, the city is also calling for bidders to operate the plant for the first few years, when defects are most likely to present themselves, and to assume unforeseen costs, he said.
"The project is following its course," city spokesperson Gabrielle Fontaine-Giroux wrote in an email in response to queries from the Montreal Gazette. "A contract was given for the supply of equipment in 2016 and for an electric plant in 2017. The call for tenders for construction will be launched in 2018," she said.
"Because the estimate of costs of construction will be used in that process, it cannot be communicated before the public launch of the call for tenders, (nor can we) announce the opening date of the new factory, or the total cost of the project."
The administration of former mayor Denis Coderre announced in early 2015 it would build the ozonation centre( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-waste-water-to-be-cleaned-using-ozone-starting-in-2018 ) at the J.R.-Marcotte sewage treatment plant on the eastern edge of the island by 2018. The cost was estimated at $285 million, with 85 per cent of the bill being covered by the provincial and federal governments.
That year, the city awarded a $99-million contract to build an ozonation plant to create ozone gas to French firm Dégremont Ltée. That firm gave the only bid deemed suitable out of two submitted, after a tendering process that took four years. Dégremont's bid was also 40 per cent higher than the city's estimates. City officials said the variation arose because it had no projects of a similar scale on which it could base cost projections. Several elements of the Dégremont contract have yet to be fulfilled.
The city said it planned to launch a call for tenders in 2016 for the construction of buildings needed for ozonation, and another for the production of oxygen necessary in the process, Le Devoir reported( http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/environnement/467438/important-projet-d-ozonation-des-eaux-usees-de-montreal )at the time. The call for tenders for the construction of buildings is only being done this year.
Montreal's waste water treatment plant, one of the largest in the world, handles the water from the city's homes, storm drains and snow-collection dumps. It filters out solids, which are incinerated, but it does little to extricate the bacteria that comes mainly from human excrement, as well as the pharmacological toxins harmful to aquatic life. Swimming is not recommended for kilometres downstream of Montreal.
Ozonation,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/how-ozonation-works ) in which ozone gas is injected into the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and pharmacological toxins, has been found to kill 95 per cent of bacteria, the majority of viruses and 75 per cent of pharmacological and cosmetic-based pathogens, city officials say.
Proponents argue the technology was chosen in 2008 after years of study by independent experts. They say the ozonation centre represents the best environmental news in the waste-water sphere in 30 years, which was when the J.R.-Marcotte treatment plant was inaugurated and Montreal stopped dumping its raw sewage into the St. Lawrence.
Critics counter that ozonation has not been used on this vast a scale for a reason - because it has been shown not to work in large urban settings - and that Montreal is being foolhardy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/is-ozonation-the-right-solution-to-clean-montreals-waste-water ) by risking so much money on an untested technology. The time delays prove their point, they say.
"It's taxpayers' money, and this has been going on forever," said Ronald Gehr, an assistant professor at McGill University with 25 years of experience in waste water treatment who has been cautioning against the ozone factory since 2008.
He was barred from doing research at the J.R.-Marcotte plant over his public statements after years of collaboration there, he said. Initial cost estimates for the ozonation plant given in 2005 were $200 million, he noted, and subsequently rose by 40 per cent.

Full text: With an estimated price tag of more than a quarter of a billion dollars, Montreal's future ozonation plant, being built to disinfect the city's waste water before it's flushed into the St. Lawrence River, will be the largest in the world.
When that will start happening, however, and how much it will actually cost, is still up in the air. Originally forecast to be running this year, built at a total cost of $285 million, city officials are now saying they are in the process of putting out calls for tender, looking for companies to bid on the construction of the plant. Given the time delays inherent in that process, it appears the city will not be hitting its 2018 deadline. City officials would not respond to questions this week about whether or not the $285-million estimate still stands, and why deadlines will not be met.
"The project is following its course," city spokesperson Gabrielle Fontaine-Giroux wrote in an email. "A contract was given for the supply of equipment in 2016 and for an electric plant in 2017. The call for tenders for construction will be launched in 2018.
"Because the estimate of costs of construction will be used in that process, it cannot be communicated before the public launch of the call for tenders, (nor can we) announce the opening date of the new factory, or the total cost of the project."
The administration of former mayor Denis Coderre announced in early 2015 it would build the ozonation centre( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-waste-water-to-be-cleaned-using-ozone-starting-in-2018 ) at the J.R.-Marcotte water and sewage treatment plant situated on the eastern edge of the island by 2018. The cost was estimated at $285 million, with 85 per cent of the bill being covered by the provincial and federal governments.
The ozonation plant would be the world's biggest, officials said, able to purify the equivalent of two Olympic Stadiums full of water being flushed into the Saint Lawrence River every 24 hours.
In 2015, the city said it had awarded a $99-million contract to build an ozonation plant to create ozone gas to French firm Dégremont Ltée. That firm gave the only bid deemed suitable out of a total of two submitted, after a tendering process that took four years. Dégremont's bid was also 40 per cent higher than the city's estimates. City officials said the variation arose because it had no projects of a similar scale on which it could base cost projections.
The city said it planned to launch a call for tenders in 2016 for the construction of buildings needed for ozonation, and another for the production of oxygen necessary in the process, Le Devoir reported( http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/environnement/467438/important-projet-d-ozonation-des-eaux-usees-de-montreal )at the time. Asked whether those elements had been carried out, city officials did not respond this week.
Montreal's waste water treatment plant, one of the largest in the world, handles the water from the city's homes, storm drains and snow-collection dump. It filters out solids, which are incinerated, and treats the water with chemicals before it's sent into the river, removing 70 per cent of the phosphorous, which promotes algae growth that clogs rivers and lakes. But it does little to extricate the bacteria that comes mainly from human excrement, as well as the pharmacological toxins like antidepressants, hormones and anti-inflammatories harmful to aquatic life. Swimming is not recommended for kilometres downstream of Montreal's outflow pipes.
Ozonation,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/how-ozonation-works ) in which ozone gas is injected into the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and pharmacological toxins, has been found to kill 95 per cent of bacteria, the majority of viruses and 75 per cent of pharmacological and cosmetic-based pathogens, city officials say.

The ozonation centre represents the best environmental news in the waste-water sphere in 30 years, which was when the J.R.-Marcotte treatment plant was inaugurated and Montreal stopped dumping its raw sewage into the St. Lawrence. It will set the example for other municipalities to follow, officials said.
Critics counter that ozonation has not been used on this vast a scale for a reason - because it has been shown not to work in large urban setting - and that Montreal is being foolhardy( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/is-ozonation-the-right-solution-to-clean-montreals-waste-water ) risking more than a quarter of a billion dollars on an untested technology.

Full text: An excellent new documentary by Quebec filmmaker Martin Frigon about Montreal's changing skyline draws on a book by award-winning journalist Henry Aubin, a book the filmmaker says is as relevant today as when it was published more than four decades ago.
Frigon calls Cities Held Hostage - set to screen over the next few months in venues including the Rendez-vous du cinéma québécois, the Cinéma du Parc and CBC's Absolutely Canadian - "an essay" on Aubin's 1977 book City for Sale, "a return to it - and a film on the city today."
Aubin, who retired from the Montreal Gazette in 2013 after 40 years with the paper, has a clear memory of Montreal in the 1970s: It was a time when gracious greystone neighbourhoods were being bulldozed and supplanted by impersonal highrise buildings, as he recalled in an interview, a period during which the city lost its distinctive architectural character as "these shlock high-rises that could be anywhere" were erected alongside such classic structures as the Sun Life and Dominion Square buildings.
He had just won a National Newspaper Award for investigative reporting when then city editor Jim Peters asked what he wished to investigate next: Aubin replied that he wanted to find out who was behind all the downtown development - in effect, who owned Montreal. Even as the skyline was being transformed, he recalled, it seemed that nobody knew who was behind most of the projects; not even the architects necessarily knew the names of the ultimate owners of the buildings they were designing.
At the time, "Canada was often called a branch plant of the United States," Aubin said. He figured he'd find it was American money behind the buildings.
To his "complete surprise," he learned that it wasn't American but European investment - and that, in addition to land holdings, European-backed companies controlled nearly all Quebec's cement production along with construction of roads and bridges.
An 18-month investigation took him to seven countries as he uncovered "a complex skein" of relationships between foreign development companies, public works contractors, building supply manufacturers and moneylending institutions.
The biggest builders, Aubin discovered, were British or Italian "and the Germans didn't build. They bought."
Italians built Montreal's Tour de la Bourse, for instance, "and the company that built Place Ville Marie was an insurance company in London that was developing similar projects in South Africa and all over the world.
"That explains the uniformity," he said. "These investors wanted to build large buildings in which you could cram as many tenants as possible and make as much money as possible."
He took no issue with people wanting to make money but, in the case of those buildings, money was "almost the only concern," he said.
Published in the Gazette in 1976 in a series titled Who Owns Montreal?, Aubin's articles earned him another National Newspaper Award. The 1977 book expanding on the series, City for Sale: International Financiers Take a Major North American City by Storm (James Lorimer & Co.), and a French version, Les vrais propriétaires de Montréal (Éditions l'Étincelle), received international acclaim.
Aubin moved from investigative reporting to writing editorials and, later, columns focusing on issues affecting Montreal. He's written three more books: two more non-fiction works and one work of fiction aimed at younger readers. He retired after a 48-year career in newspapers and is currently at work on a follow-up to his 2002 book, The Rescue of Jerusalem: The Alliance Between Hebrews and Africans in 701 BC.
Although City for Sale remains on reading lists for urban studies courses, Aubin assumed the book was largely "just forgotten" - until he got a call from Frigon telling him he wanted to make a film based on it. Frigon had made a 2012 film about the impact of real estate development on Quebec's Laurentians, La grande invasion, and he was on Radio-Canada's Médium Large talking about it when another guest, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi professor Marc-Urbain Proulx, suggested he read Aubin's book. He did - and was inspired.
"It read like a detective novel - all 400 pages of it," Frigon recalled. To him, City for Sale is as relevant today as in 1977. "It could have been written today."
As Aubin said: "The names of the owners of the companies that transformed Montreal back then are different - but the same principles remain."
The owners remain unaccountable, he said.
"Look what they did to Griffintown: They built absolute shlock - the same impersonal architecture and urban design that we have seen ever since the '70s."
Cities Held Hostage, a production of Films de l'Oeil, features interviews with Aubin, City for Sale publisher James Lorimer, architect and retired urban studies professor David Hanna, Quebec anthropologist and writer Serge Bouchard, and Guy Garand, director of the Conseil régional de l'environnement de Laval. It is disturbing and, in places, bleak - but it is a film that anyone who cares about Montreal should watch.
The 45-minute film features interviews in both English and French and inspired use of animation; a French version, Main basse sur la ville, is a few minutes longer. Both film and book use Montreal as a case study, but look beyond it at global investment forces that drive the continuing homogenization, as Aubin calls it, of major cities and promote suburban sprawl.
"You look at the individual buildings that compose Montreal's skyline today - and they are no different from the buildings in Seattle or Tampa or Brussels or Nairobi or Johannesburg," he said. What makes the skylines of these cities interchangeable is that the buildings in question were often erected by the same companies.
"It is this international homogenized architecture."
Said Frigon: "The behaviours that Henry Aubin denounced are still happening."
As Aubin observed in the conclusion to City for Sale: "Power in shaping Montreal is held by people, whether foreign or domestic, who are faceless. Being unknown, they exercise power without accountability. They are powerful largely by default, by the abnegation of power by the community itself." sschwartz@postmedia.com Twitter.com/susanschwartz
AT A GLANCE Cities Held Hostage, which has been televised a few times since last August, will air nationally on Saturday, May 26 (1 p.m.) on CBC-TV's Absolutely Canadian. The French-language version, Main basse sur la ville, will be screened March 1 at 9 p.m. at the Quartier Latin as part of the Rendez-vous du cinéma québécois festival, with two other films. There will be a Q&A session with director Martin Frigon, producer Catherine Drolet, architect David Hanna and retired journalist Henry Aubin, whose book City for Sale inspired the film. Starting March 30, the film will have a weeklong screening at the Cinéma du Parc. Both English and French versions will be shown and followed by roundtable discussions with panellists on such themes as city planning in Montreal, architecture and land development.

Full text: An excellent new documentary by Quebec filmmaker Martin Frigon about Montreal's changing skyline draws on a book by award-winning journalist Henry Aubin,( http://www.henryaubin.com ) a book the filmmaker says is as relevant today as when it was published more than four decades ago.
Frigon calls Cities Held Hostage - set to screen over the next few months in venues including the Rendez-vous du cinéma québécois( http://rendez-vous.quebeccinema.ca/ ), the Cinéma du Parc and CBC's Absolutely Canadian - "an essay" on Aubin's 1977 book City for Sale, "a return to it - and a film on the city today."
Aubin, who retired from the Montreal Gazette( http://montrealgazette.com ) in 2013 after 40 years with the paper, has a clear memory of Montreal in the 1970s: It was a time when gracious greystone neighbourhoods were being bulldozed and supplanted by impersonal highrise buildings, as he recalled in an interview, a period during which the city lost its distinctive architectural character as "these shlock highrises that could be anywhere" were erected alongside such classic structures as the Sun Life and Dominion Square buildings.
He had just won a National Newspaper Award for investigative reporting when then-city editor Jim Peters asked what he wished to investigate next: Aubin replied that he wanted to find out who was behind all the downtown development - in effect, who owned Montreal. Even as the skyline was being transformed, he recalled, it seemed that nobody knew who was behind most of the projects: Not even the architects necessarily knew the names of the ultimate owners of the buildings they were designing.
At the time, "Canada was often called a branch plant of the United States," Aubin said; he figured he'd find it was American money behind the buildings.
Maximum tenancy was an unsurprising driving force in downtown development, Henry Aubin found, but in many cases, money was "almost the only concern."
To his "complete surprise," he learned that it was not American but European investment - and that, in addition to land holdings, European-backed companies controlled nearly all Quebec's cement production along with construction of roads and bridges.
An 18-month investigation took him to seven countries as he uncovered "a complex skein" of relationships between foreign-development companies, public-works contractors, building-supply manufacturers and moneylending institutions.
The biggest builders, Aubin discovered, were British or Italian "and the Germans didn't build; they bought." Italians built Montreal's Tour de la Bourse, for instance, "and the company that built Place Ville Marie was an insurance company in London that was developing similar projects in South Africa and all over the world.
Martin Frigon describes his film, Cities Held Hostage, as "an essay" on Henry Aubin's 1977 book City for Sale, "a return to it - and a film on the city today."
"That explains the uniformity," he said. "These investors wanted to build large buildings in which you could cram as many tenants as possible and make as much money as possible." He took no issue with people wanting to make money but, in the case of those buildings, money was "almost the only concern," he said.

Published in the Montreal Gazette in late 1976 in a series titled Who Owns Montreal?, Aubin's articles earned him another National Newspaper Award.

He did - and was inspired.

Dorval public works poised for action while monitoring water levels

Author: Greenaway, Kathryn

Abstract: Lawrence River Board spokesman Jacob Bruxer said Lac St. Louis is 35 cm higher than usual for this time of year, but that there remains 40 additional centimetres of wiggle room before there is any danger of flooding and that regulating the outflow at the Moses-Saunders Dam near Cornwall, Ont. would prevent the lake water from reaching that danger point. Overflowing sewage and storm-water pipes also wreaked havoc last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/ile-bizard-family-still-reeling-after-spring-flood-damages-home ).

Full text: Dorval Mayor Edgar Rouleau knows people are nervous. Around 20 mm of rain was forecast to fall Tuesday through Wednesday. The ground is frozen solid. Ice and snow abound. Temperatures are above normal. And memories of record-breaking spring flooding in 2017 are still fresh.
"The trucks are loaded with bags and public works is monitoring the (lake) water levels closely," Rouleau said. "We want people to know we are ready for action."
Dorval uses crushed stone instead of the conventional sand. The stone is crushed finely enough to pack well and prevent water seepage.
Rouleau said the city has more than 800 bags at the ready. Last year, at the peak of the flooding, the city had distributed between 500 and 550 bags. The mayor said some citizens opted to keep the bags they used last spring.
"We only had a handful of homes affected by flooding last year and most of them had slanted driveways," Rouleau said. "Those homes are a priority because they are the most vulnerable."
International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board spokesman Jacob Bruxer said Lac St. Louis is 35 cm higher than usual for this time of year, but that there remains 40 additional centimetres of wiggle room before there is any danger of flooding and that regulating the outflow at the Moses-Saunders Dam near Cornwall, Ont. would prevent the lake water from reaching that danger point.
Bruxer said the heavy rains in March and April of last year were the tipping point that unleashed the massive spring flooding. He said that a spate of heavy rain like the region experienced last year is impossible to predict so far in advance, but that the situation is well under control at this stage.
Pierrefonds-Roxboro Mayor Jim Beis( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pierrefonds-roxboro-monitoring-riviere-des-prairies-water-levels ) told the West Island Gazette last month that a series of measures were already being put in place in at points in the borough most vulnerable to flooding. Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Mayor Paola Hawa said water levels are being rigorously monitored and that an information session for citizens concerning flood preparedness will be held in March. Date to be determined.
Lakes are not the only source of flooding. Overflowing sewage and storm-water pipes also wreaked havoc last spring( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/ile-bizard-family-still-reeling-after-spring-flood-damages-home ).
"Public works has been out clearing ice away from manholes and out of pipes," Rouleau said. "(On Monday) we received between 45 and 50 calls from residents. Some just needed reassurance that we were doing something to prepare for flooding. Others reported water accumulating in the streets."
Rouleau said the preparations( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows ) in Dorval are not only for this week's thaw and rain, but for the spring thaw on the way.
"People are anxious," he said. "They can call us. We are ready to help."

Heavy rain probably won't cause major flooding, meteorologist says

Author: Mennie, James

Abstract: While localized flooding could occur near small rivers, it won't lead to major flooding of homes on larger rivers such as Rivière des Prairies and the Ottawa River, said Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist from Environment Canada "Last spring, we had several weeks of rainfall and warm temperatures that created the flooding (of homes)," he said. Following last spring's widespread flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), officials who monitor river levels are paying close attention to the height of the rivers and the upcoming forecasts, Parent said.

Full text: Environment Canada issued a weather warning for the Montreal area on Monday, calling for "significant rainfall," significantly higher temperatures in the region until Wednesday and the possibility of localized flooding.
The "special weather statement" for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay-La-Prairie area noted that southern Quebec will see "a significant warming trend," along with between 20 and 30 millimetres of rain between Montreal evening and Wednesday.
A warm front from the central United States that is tracking across the province will see temperatures gradually rise above 10 degrees on Wednesday, the warning said.
The rain combined with the run-off from the snowmelt could cause localized flooding, it said.
Visibility may be reduced at times in fog, especially on Tuesday night, the warning added.
While localized flooding could occur near small rivers, it won't lead to major flooding of homes on larger rivers such as Rivière des Prairies and the Ottawa River, said Alexandre Parent, a meteorologist from Environment Canada
"Last spring, we had several weeks of rainfall and warm temperatures that created the flooding (of homes)," he said.
"An event like this one (where we have) two or three days of warm temperatures could have some impacts near small rivers."
Following last spring's widespread flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), officials who monitor river levels are paying close attention to the height of the rivers and the upcoming forecasts, Parent said.
In the West Island, the city of Dorval announced it was taking precautionary measures in preparation for the heavy rainfall, with city employees closely monitoring storm sewers in critical areas to ensure water drains properly.
The municipality also said gravel bags will be available, free of charge, to citizens in the critical areas. Dorval is providing a phone number on its website( https://www.ville.dorval.qc.ca/en/news/article/flooding-important-rainfall-expected-on-february-20-and-21 ) for residents to request sandbags, adding that each case will be analyzed to assess the level of importance and need.
In the town of Rigaud, where more than 300 homeowners were flooded last spring, a spokesperson said officials are not expecting the rainfall to cause flooding.
"The rain will remove the snow that's on the ice, but the ice on the river is still thick and the rain won't melt the ice," said Marie-Andrée Gagnon, a town spokesperson.
Officials will patrol the area near the Ottawa River, just in case. As it does every year, the town has ordered 15,000 sandbags in case the river bursts its banks. Gagnon said some basements in homes close to the river flood every spring and residents are used to the inconvenience.
Montreal experiences temperatures above 10 C in February about once every four years, Parent said. The record high for Feb. 21 is 14 C, which was recorded in 1981.

Abstract: In the dining room, the heavy and bulky 1900s Victorian style walnut table and chairs occupy most of the space. Since those days, new housing developments have mushroomed all around them, yet the house has retained a certain pastoral character because of its exceptional location. The impressive wood-burning fireplace, with its fieldstone mantel, was a real lifesaver during the 1998 Ice Storm, and is now the gathering place during the cold winter months. In the hallway facing the master bedroom hangs a small light fixture made of four frosted white glass panels decorated with hand-painted figurines, among them an amorous couple in brightly coloured 18th-century costumes.

Full text: Forty-eight years ago, when Joel and Yvette Gerber were touring the West Island with dreams of leaving the hustle and bustle of the city for more peaceful surroundings, some parts of the area were still considered the country.
But even as motivated as they were, when they spotted what would become their new home in a then-rural section of Pierrefonds, it required a second visit.
"It wasn't love at first sight," Yvette admitted.
But when this house captures a heart, it's for keeps. Now, nearing 50 years in the old farm home, the couple is one of only four owners since its construction almost 180 years ago.
What they bought was actually a remarkable property. Though the house was already 130 years old, it had been thoroughly renovated and, most importantly, with good taste. Regular maintenance was all it needed from then on.
Dating from 1839, La Maison Toussaint-Legault dit Deslauriers is named for the man who had it built and is listed as an exceptional heritage building( http://patrimoine.ville.montreal.qc.ca/inventaire/fiche_bat.php?id_bat=7335-78-4319-01 ) by the municipality. It is situated not far from the Rivière des Prairies.
The wood-burning fireplace in the living room came in handy during the 1998 Ice Storm. The seal skin under the coffee table comes from the Magdalen Islands.
The transition from the city was hard, Yvette concedes.
"There were no buses or even sidewalks to walk on. I had a small child and I couldn't go anywhere."
With her husband away at work all day, she felt lonely at the beginning, but it also brought them much joy along with some well-deserved peace and quiet.
In the dining room, the heavy and bulky 1900s Victorian style walnut table and chairs occupy most of the space. It was made by a Quebec craftsman.
Since those days, new housing developments have mushroomed all around them, yet the house has retained a certain pastoral character because of its exceptional location. There are no nearby neighbours on either side, and in the back, a wide expanse of wood and grassland extends all the way to the river on a lot that measures 33.5 metres x 33.5 metres or 1,122 square metres.
Built of fieldstones, the house is in the French colonial architectural style, featuring a raised basement and dormers set in a steep roof that extends over the full-length veranda. Blue and grey asphalt shingles cover the roof. The walls are approximately one metre thick. The original, square house, which is 9 x 9 metres, was extended by a double-car garage, the flat roof of which serves as a deck.
Above the double bed with its intricate forged aluminum headboard and footboard, hangs a landscape scene painted by Joel Gerber's uncle.
Inside, the renovations made by previous owners respected the overall architecture and style of the house, while adding comfort, including insulation and double-glazed windows. Luxury touches were also introduced, like oak floors, and certain elegant details, as illustrated in the living-room, where wood casings cover the horizontal beams supporting the upper floor. Though the ceiling is rather low at just 2.1 metres (seven feet), the room is spacious enough. Occupying half of the ground floor, it is well lit by five windows.
The impressive wood-burning fireplace, with its fieldstone mantel, was a real lifesaver during the 1998 Ice Storm, and is now the gathering place during the cold winter months. In front of it, under an ornate antique wooden coffee table, lies a seal skin from the Magdalen Islands.
The only renovation the couple needed to undertake in almost five decades was the kitchen floor, where the vinyl covering was replaced by ceramic tiles. The space is small with its quirky old-fashioned look, but very bright, thanks to windows on two walls.
Furniture and objects from around the world, including a 3/4 cast-iron sleigh bed made some 250 years ago in France, are in the guest bedroom on the second floor.
In the dining-room, the table takes up most of the area. It was made by a Quebec craftsman in the Victorian style of the early 1900s. The walnut table is so heavy and bulky that it couldn't fit through the doorway and had to be hoisted through the window. The corner china cabinet is by the same craftsman. The chairs were originally covered with leather, but were reupholstered in a chic classic fabric.
Two doors between the two windows permit access to a cupboard built right into the thick stone wall. The inside stays naturally cool year round, and the couple uses it to store sodas and other beverages. The staircase leading to the second floor is made of oak, as are all the wooden floors in the house. The white walls are a showcase of paintings dear to the couple, produced by artist friends.

The master bedroom might not be stylish by today's trends, but it is certainly cosy. Above the double bed with its intricate forged aluminum headboard and footboard, hangs a landscape scene painted by Joel's uncle. Next to the window stands a very heavy dresser made of solid ash. It is another piece of furniture that gave the movers a headache and backaches. Like the painting, it was brought back from Jura, France, where Joel is from, along with the beautiful tall armoire opposite the foot of the bed. It is a reproduction of the Louis XV style, and just like the delicate chair beside it, built by a craftsman from Jura.
The tall armoire opposite the bed in the master bedroom is a Louis XV reproduction, and just like the delicate chair beside it, was skilfully made by a craftsman from Jura, France.
Down the hall, the guest bedroom has a totally different atmosphere, with furniture and objects showing influences from around the world. The black wooden mask next to the window could be guessed to have an African origin, but it was bought in Charlevoix. The magnificently sculpted dresser could have come from India, but it, too, was bought in Quebec. As for the ¾ cast-iron sleigh bed, it was made some 250 years ago in France. The Gerbers bought it in Sherbrooke from a man who refused to sell it to a museum, because, in his own words, he wanted it to keep living. A fairy with butterfly wings overlooks this eclectic combination of furnishings that make for a remarkable decor. In the hallway facing the master bedroom hangs a small light fixture made of four frosted white glass panels decorated with hand-painted figurines, among them an amorous couple in brightly coloured 18th-century costumes.

Defence at Contrecoeur trial blames 'media storm' for UPAC probe

Abstract: Zampino's lawyer, Isabel Schurman, and Pierre L'Écuyer, who is defending co-accused businessman Paolo Catania and who also presented final arguments, maintained that the investigation by Quebec's anti-corruption squad into the 2007 Contrecoeur land deal was prompted by a "media storm" over the sale price that began with news articles in 2008. Among other things, the prosecution has tried to show at the trial that Construction Frank Catania et Associés was included in private discussions with the SHDM's consultants to prepare studies and estimates for developing the Contrecoeur site, which gave it information that its competitors didn't have when a call for proposals was launched. In their final arguments, Schurman and L'Écuyer argued the prosecution's case rests on circumstantial evidence that doesn't prove criminal acts were committed.

Full text: There may have been an "accumulation of irregularities," but there was no fraud in the sale of the city-owned Faubourg Contrecoeur, a lawyer representing Frank Zampino, the former no. 2 politician at Montreal city hall, said in closing arguments at his trial on Friday.
Zampino's lawyer, Isabel Schurman, and Pierre L'Écuyer, who is defending co-accused businessman Paolo Catania and who also presented final arguments, maintained that the investigation by Quebec's anti-corruption squad into the 2007 Contrecoeur land deal was prompted by a "media storm" over the sale price that began with news articles in 2008.
"A journalist wrote a story about Mr. Zampino and UPAC took that story and tried to prove it true," Schurman said in describing the defence's theory to the court. "However, it isn't true, she said.
There is also no evidence of personal gain on the part of Zampino, Schurman added.
Zampino, Catania and four former executives of Catania's construction firm, Construction Frank Catania et Associés Inc., were arrested in 2012 in connection with the sale of the city-owned land known as Faubourg Contrecoeur( http://montrealgazette.com/?s=Contrecoeur ) to the firm at a discounted price.
The trial before Court of Quebec Judge Yvan Poulin began in February 2016 and is hearing final arguments this week and next week.
The city's real-estate agency, Société d'habitation et de développement de Montréal (SHDM), discounted $14.7 million for decontamination and other costs from the $19.1-million winning bid submitted by Construction Frank Catania et Associés. The firm wound up paying $4.4 million to purchase the land in the east end of Montreal to build a housing project valued at $300 million.
Among other things, the prosecution has tried to show at the trial that Construction Frank Catania et Associés was included in private discussions with the SHDM's consultants to prepare studies and estimates for developing the Contrecoeur site, which gave it information that its competitors didn't have when a call for proposals was launched.
In their final arguments, Schurman and L'Écuyer argued the prosecution's case rests on circumstantial evidence that doesn't prove criminal acts were committed. The defence refuted that evidence and called into question the credibility of some key prosecution witnesses.
Schurman downplayed the significance of trips taken by Zampino and Catania and their spouses around the time of the Contrecoeur land deal. The defence maintains the trips weren't connected to the Contrecoeur sale. Schurman argued that Zampino paid his way and that Catania merely reserved hotel rooms for the two couples on his credit card for one of the trips.
At the time of the Contrecoeur sale, and before the Charbonneau commission hearings, politicians didn't see a problem with accepting tickets to events and bottles of wine from entrepreneurs doing business with the city because the norms at the time didn't forbid it, Schurman said.
Zampino testified in his defence during the trial that he was faithful to his own moral compass in the absence of an ethics code for elected officials at the time, she added.
"Socializing is not criminal and even taking trips isn't criminal," Schurman said.
Poulin at one point acknowledged that the key issue in the case is whether the accused showed poor judgment or whether any criminal acts were committed.
The prosecution is expected to begin its final arguments on Friday afternoon after the lawyers for the remaining defendants.

Carbon monoxide killed three men in snowbound cars: coroner

Abstract: After three Montreal men were found dead in their cars in separate but remarkably similar circumstances after a heavy snowstorm one day last March, a Quebec coroner is urging public health authorities to do more to raise public awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Public health authorities warn that a snowbound car's engine should never be turned on before the exhaust pipe and the sides of the car are completely cleared of snow. When the exhaust pipe or the sides of the car are blocked by snow, lethal levels of carbon monoxide can seep into the car's interior from underneath the vehicle.

Full text: After three Montreal men were found dead in their cars in separate but remarkably similar circumstances after a heavy snowstorm one day last March, a Quebec coroner is urging public health authorities to do more to raise public awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.
The three men - aged 59, 75 and 88 - were discovered in different parts of the city dead or unconscious in their cars on March 16, 2017. In each case, the men had been shovelling snow to access their cars, and had apparently taken a break from shovelling by sitting in their still snowbound vehicles with engines running and windows closed.
Carbon monoxide poisoning was the culprit in each case, coroner Paul G. Dionne ruled in reports made public recently by the Quebec Coroner's office.
Public health authorities warn that a snowbound car's engine should never be turned on before the exhaust pipe and the sides of the car are completely cleared of snow. When the exhaust pipe or the sides of the car are blocked by snow, lethal levels of carbon monoxide can seep into the car's interior from underneath the vehicle.
On the morning of March 15, after a storm dumped about 35 centimetres of snow on Montreal, neighbours noticed 88-year-old John Malachy Toal shovelling a path to his 1999 Toyota Corolla, parked in front of his residence on 16th Ave. in Lachine.
Later that afternoon, a neighbour noticed a shovel near Toal's still snowbound car and placed it near the door of his apartment. Toal's body was not discovered in the car until the following morning, March 16, by a passerby. He was pronounced dead at the scene by Urgences-Santé paramedics.
Although the motor was not running when Toal's body was discovered, the ignition key was in the "on" position. Police did not verify the state of the battery or the gas tank, but the coroner concluded the motor was likely running at the time of death.
"Toxicology results showed carbon monoxide poisoning," writes Dionne in his report. "It is likely that Mr. Toal was resting for a few minutes in his old car, with the motor running, during his efforts to shovel his car out on the morning of March 15, 2017. The carbon monoxide emissions probably passed through the floor, since the car was buried in snow."
Hansen Howard-Thomas, 75, was found unconscious in his idling vehicle, a 2008 Hyundai Elantra, at about 11:24 a.m. on March 16. He was brought to the Royal Victoria Hospital where efforts to resuscitate him failed and he was pronounced dead. An autopsy showed Howard-Thomas had an existing heart condition. The coroner concluded Howard-Thomas probably had a heart issue while shovelling and took a rest in his car, which was idling and still covered in snow. Again, carbon monoxide poisoning was deemed the cause of death.
And that same afternoon, police were called to St. Michel Blvd. in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, where a man, later identified as 59-year-old Joël Nicolas, was found dead in his 1992 Plymouth Voyager. The car was covered in snow and a shovel was found nearby. The engine was not running when Nicolas was found, but rescuers noticed a strong gasoline odour when the car was opened and leaked fluid under the vehicle. An autopsy indicated Nicolas had died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
In each of these three cases, the coroner noted that the cars were older models (1992-2008). Older cars tend to produce more carbon monoxide emissions than newer models. Experts advise motorists to have their vehicles regularly serviced, including checking for leaks in the exhaust system or holes in the undercarriage.
The Montreal Children's Hospital Children issued a warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/how-to-avoid-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-a-heavy-snowfall ) last month never to leave children in idling cars while snow shovelling.

Outdoor hockey: one of Canada's great pleasures. Enjoy it while you can

That's far from certain, a depressing thought for countless Canadians who love to play hockey on outdoor rinks across the country.
In Montreal, this winter's wacky weather has played havoc with the state of our ice rinks, while the effects of global warming are making for shorter outdoor hockey seasons, according to researchers.
But it's not just the weather. Kids today seem to have less time for free-form, spontaneous play like shinny, whether because they are spending more time in organized sports or sitting in front of their screens at home.
"It's really sad," said Michael Pasternak, a technical writer and enthusiastic amateur hockey player who lives in Pointe-Claire. "I live right behind a rink and I look out and so often the rink is empty. There are no kids on it.
"When I was a kid growing up on the South Shore, on a weekend day, the rink was full of kids. The big kids going length-wise and the little kids having their game going on cross-wise. Whereas nowadays, it's not like that at all.
"The weather in the last couple of years hasn't helped. The weather's been really crappy. But the other thing is organized sports. Kids are in (hockey) and they're practicing multiple times a week indoors. They're guaranteed good ice. They don't have to shovel it. ... So it's not like when I was a kid."
Shinny at N.D.G. Park. The effects of global warming are making for shorter outdoor hockey seasons, according to researchers.
Two Montreal professors -Damon Matthews from Concordia and Lawrence Mysak from McGill - have studied the impact of climate change on outdoor hockey in Canada. Their 2012 research, which looked at weather data from 1951 to 2006, concluded that if the skating season continues to shrink, outdoor shinny in southern Canada may disappear within a few decades.
"Everything depends on how quickly we are able to turn things around on the mitigation side of things," said Matthews, who teaches in Concordia's department of geography, planning and environment. "There is still a window to avoid things like skating being a thing of the past. But it's a rapidly closing window.
"Given the direction we're going now, yes, I'd say I'd give it a few decades. ... The skating season is going to shrink and eventually disappear, and that will happen within my lifetime. I'd bet on it."
That would be a sad day for those who live for lacing up, grabbing their stick and doing their best imitation of Sidney Crosby on an al fresco rink.

Kids today seem to have less time for free-form, spontaneous play, whether because they are spending more time in organized sports or sitting in front of their screens at home.
Craig Klinkhoff, who works at the Sherbrooke St. W. Alan Klinkhoff Gallery founded by his father, says he quit playing competitive indoor hockey when he was 12 because he was sick of the regimented approach of city hockey teams. But he kept right on playing outdoors.
"It's the informal nature of it," Klinkhoff said. "It doesn't matter who's there, whether it's close friends or strangers. You show up at a random rink where there are people you may or may not recognize and you can join in the game.
"Without spoken rules or written rules, everyone conforms to this amazing game. Everyone is just having a great time. People of all ages and abilities all facing the same challenges, of navigating an unpredictable ice surface.
"People come and go throughout the game. You make friends. It allows friends and strangers to get together over this wonderful game. It doesn't matter how old or how experienced you are. Everyone just shows up and has fun on their own terms for as long as they want."
Daniel Sanger, a Projet Montréal staffer who spends some serious time on outdoor rinks throughout the Plateau, also walked away from organized hockey as a teenager because he felt coaches, parents and players were taking the game way too seriously.
"That's why I like it for kids," Sanger said. "It's something people don't really understand the importance of. The dynamic is you throw the sticks in the middle. Then they organize it themselves rather than having an adult tell them what to do.
"So often with kids, whether it's school or organized sports activities, it's always about the adult telling them what to do. This is a case where it's the kids who are responsible for themselves."
But it's not just for kids. It's also a way for adults to take a breather from the daily grind.
"I put my skates on in my mud room and I clomp through my backyard snow, because I have a gate to the park, and I just hop the boards and I'm at centre ice," Pasternak of Pointe-Claire said. "I can see whoever is there from my living room. My wife switches on The Bachelor and I say, 'I'm going for a skate.'
"I love the fact that it's a freewheeling outdoor game and you're free to try all kinds of little moves that you wouldn't necessarily try in (an indoor) game because you're trying to win the game. Whereas in outdoor hockey, you're just trying to have fun and move the puck and try that little trick that you never seem to get - like the toe-drag or the shoulder fake or whatever it is. You wouldn't do it in a game because you're supposed to make the pass to the guy who's open. Whereas in shinny, it's a lot more forgiving."
That is one of the keys to understanding the appeal of outdoor hockey. There are no refs and no written rules, and yet it is more civilized than indoor beer-league hockey where there can sometimes be a little too much competition and some nastiness.
There are no refs or written rules in outdoor hockey, and yet it is more civilized than indoor beer leagues that can get overly competitive and even nasty.
"Somehow, despite how unorganized it is and how unfamiliar everyone can be with one and other, it still works," Klinkhoff said.
"The civility also extends to how different players react to other players of different calibres. When the young boy or girl gets the puck, and they haven't touched it very much, then you let them skate with it, and there's a sense of joy and fun that comes with that. Everyone understands that everyone has a different role."
In fact, in part because typically there are no goalies, goals often come fast and furious, and people usually lose track of who's winning.
"It's an absolute thing of beauty playing pick-up hockey because it's so creative," Sanger said. "It's almost like a jam session in music. ...
"Do you know people who keep track of the score in pick-up hockey? Often enough, if you're one of the better players, you're not going to score the easy goals. You'll always try to make it more interesting. ...
"It's a sublime experience, to be outside on a rink on a winter night. Think of the sounds. Of the puck on the boards. The skate blade in the ice. Combined with the evening quiet."
Magic. But for how much longer?

Following Wednesday's storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ), which led to a number of afternoon highway accidents resulting in one death and several injuries, Friday's weather warning was followed by a few centimetres of snow and up to 4 cm more to come Saturday. Temperatures on Saturday are expected to hover around -5 C.
For Sunday, the updated freezing-rain warning is calling for 2-5 mm to fall, with a possibility of 10 mm more north of the St. Lawrence. Temperatures in the Montreal area are expected to range from -3 C during the day to an evening low of -10 C.
"Freezing rain will begin near the United States border around midday Sunday and spread toward the Montreal, the north shore and the Centre-du-Québec regions later in the afternoon," the updated freezing-rain warning stated.
Sun is expected on Monday with a high of -5 C and a low of -14 C and clear skies through the evening. After much the same on Tuesday, temperatures are expected to jump slightly above freezing, with highs of 3 C and 4 C on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
The snow and freezing rain will make walking and driving more challenging around southern Quebec throughout the weekend.

Full text: Pamela Hart remembers the first time she set foot in Le Cagibi, about 10 years ago. The Canadian-born New-Zealander, freshly arrived in Montreal, was lost, wandering up St-Laurent Blvd., looking for this place with the strange name to meet her "kindof" date.
"There was nothing around, every (storefront) was empty. I was stressed because I had gone the wrong way - I hadn't ridden a subway before," Hart said. "Then I pop into this sanctuary of queer, comfortable, alternative space."
That space is soon to become the latest victim of gentrification in Mile End. Le Cagibi is a vegetarian café-restaurant-indie showbar being edged out of its location at the corner of St-Laurent and St-Viateur St. (right across from Ubisoft), which it has occupied for the past decade - two decades if you count Café Esperanza, from which Le Cagibi sprung.
Since the fall, Le Cagibi has been in negotiations with its new landlords, who are seeking to more than double the current rent of $3,417. The landlords proposed a new rent of $7,500 per month, or $5,000 for half the space. (Le Cagibi occupies two connected addresses: the main café, on the corner, and a concert/eating area, next door on St-Viateur.)
"That's a huge increase," Hart said. "We proposed $5,000 (for the whole space), but he said that was absolutely not enough."
In April, Le Cagibi will move to another location, four blocks up, in Little Italy. The new digs are just below St-Zotique St., across from artisanal pub Vices & Versa.
"It's so bittersweet," Hart said, of leaving Mile End. "It feels really sad, to be honest. In the past decade, I've left town a lot of times to work, and when I come back (Le Cagibi) is one of the first places I go to. There's a little wood stool perched by the counter, which doesn't really make sense; but it's the spot we all sit in to come visit our friends working, and order a chai latte or a coffee or a chili. It's the end of an era."
And a sign of the times. "There are lots of comments going around that Lululemon opening (on St-Viateur Ave. and Parc Ave.) was really a marker in Mile End," Hart said. "It's the same with our building now. People know what's coming."
The building in which Le Cagibi is located is co-owned by Jeremy Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller, who previously owned the building now rented out to Lululemon on St-Viateur, before the building was sold to real estate magnates Danny Lavy and Stephen Shiller (Brandon's father) in 2015; Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller are also owners of a building at Jean-Talon Market where a controversial Starbucks was located from 2015 to 2017 (a petition against the outpost garnered more than 9,000 signatures).
Since 2014, Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller along with Lavy and Stephen Shiller (co-owners of Shiller Lavy Realties) have bought up no less than seven commercial properties, between them, along the small yet iconic strip of St. Viateur St. that is the heart and soul of Mile End. Along the way, they have been involved in the changeover of other businesses along the street, including the former Pâtisserie & Boulangerie Clarke Inc. (which closed in 2015 after 35 years and is now a sushi restaurant); Bishop & Bagg Pub (formerly a longstanding neighbourhood dive, located in a building owned by Shiller Lavy Realties); and were instrumental in attracting Gordon Ramsay to town for his ill-fated stint at Laurier BBQ.
Shiller Lavy Realties own other properties on Laurier, including one at the corner of Jeanne-Mance, until recently the home of Pâtisserie De Gascogne, which closed in late December after 60 years; and one at the corner of Esplanade, which was torn down in a storm of controversy last February due to the roof caving in after years of neglect (during which Shiller Lavy reportedly filed several requests to convert and/or replace the building, all of which contravened city heritage laws).
At the time, Projet Montréal's Marie Plourde, councillor for Mile End, had spoken out about the city's inaction regarding precious buildings being abandoned into disrepair. Cagibi's current predicament raises another question for Mayor Valérie Plante's newly elected Projet Montréal: what can the city do to help small business owners who, unlike residential tenants, are not protected by rent control? "It's a difficult situation, where someone can buy a building and say, 'You know what? It doesn't matter that this has been a cultural, community space for 10 years-plus. We're just going to jack that rent, so it's not going to work anymore,'" Hart said. "There's no legislation around commercial leases."
Plourde's schedule didn't permit her to speak with the Montreal Gazette, Friday afternoon, according to Projet Montréal's press attaché. The Gazette's attempts to reach Kornbluth, Brandon Shiller and Shiller Lavy Realties for comment were also unsuccessful.
"We know what's going to happen on (this) corner," Hart said. "It's sad - aside from the fact that we won't be there anymore, it won't be a space that fits the essence of the neighbourhood."
Le Cagibi was one of the last holdouts of Mile End of old. Previous occupant Pharmacie Esperanza (which was renamed Café Esperanza) made a point of maintaining the history of the space it took over, previously home to an actual pharmacy, by keeping and using the business's vintage wood drawers and shelving system - which Le Cagibi continues to use. There is no guarantee the next tenants will be so conscientious.
Le Cagibi was also home to some very under-the-radar music acts, making it - along with the soon-to-close Divan Orange - an example of the challenges of reconciling Montreal's identity as an indie-music mecca with its booming real estate market. Le Cagibi's artsy essence is summed up in the fact that the privatelyowned (by two former Esperanza employees) business is in the midst of transforming into a coop, comprising several of its staff.
"It's so much work," said Hart, who is co-op president. "But it's empowering and exciting in a lot of ways. Being part of a workers'co-op means more agency and more benefits. We're creating something for ourselves, an employment situation that is more secure for us in the long run. It's unusual for people in these kinds of environments to have that kind of empowerment."
While its lease in its current location is good for one more year, Le Cagibi will move to its new location this spring. The new space has only one room, and so will not feature a permanent live music component for the moment; but there are hopes of finding a "sister space" to accommodate live acts in the future.
Hart and her partners'next challenge is raising money for the move and the renovation of the new location, which will cost an estimated $65,000. A GoFund-Me campaign with a goal of $35,000 has pulled in $6,800 in its first two weeks, which makes Hart hopeful.
And they have already taken action to avoid ending up in their current situation again: Le Cagibi has signed a 10-year lease at the new locale, with first right to buy should the building be put up for sale. tdunlevy@postmedia.com twitter.com/TChaDunlevy

Abstract: Le Cagibi is a vegetarian café-restaurant-indie showbar being edged out of its location at the corner of St-Laurent and St-Viateur St. (right across from Ubisoft), which it has occupied for the past decade - two decades if you count Café Esperanza, from which Le Cagibi sprung. Since the fall, Le Cagibi has been in negotiations with its new landlords, who are seeking to more than double the current rent of $3,417. The building in which Le Cagibi is located is co-owned by Jeremy Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller, who previously owned the building now rented out to Lululemon on St-Viateur, before the building was sold to real estate magnates Danny Lavy and Stephen Shiller (Brandon's father) in 2015; Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller are also owners of a building at Jean-Talon Market where a controversial Starbucks was located from 2015 to 2017 (a petition against the outpost garnered more than 9,000 signatures).

Full text: Pamela Hart remembers the first time she set foot in Le Cagibi, about 10 years ago. The Canadian-born New-Zealander, freshly arrived in Montreal, was lost, wandering up St-Laurent Blvd., looking for this place with the strange name to meet her "kind-of" date.
"There was nothing around, every (storefront) was empty. I was stressed because I had gone the wrong way - I hadn't ridden a subway before," Hart said. "Then I pop into this sanctuary of queer, comfortable, alternative space."
That space is soon to become the latest victim of gentrification in Mile End. Le Cagibi is a vegetarian café-restaurant-indie showbar being edged out of its location at the corner of St-Laurent and St-Viateur St. (right across from Ubisoft), which it has occupied for the past decade - two decades if you count Café Esperanza, from which Le Cagibi sprung.
Since the fall, Le Cagibi has been in negotiations with its new landlords, who are seeking to more than double the current rent of $3,417. The landlords proposed a new rent of $7,500 per month, or $5,000 for half the space. (Le Cagibi occupies two connected addresses: the main café, on the corner, and a concert/eating area, next door on St-Viateur.)
"That's a huge increase," Hart said. "We proposed $5,000 (for the whole space), but he said that was absolutely not enough."
Le Cagibi occupies two connected addresses: the main café and a concert/eating area.
In April, Le Cagibi will move to another location, four blocks up, in Little Italy. The new digs are just below St-Zotique St., across from artisanal pub Vices & Versa.
"It's so bittersweet," Hart said, of leaving Mile End. "It feels really sad, to be honest. In the past decade, I've left town a lot of times to work, and when I come back (Le Cagibi) is one of the first places I go to. There's a little wood stool perched by the counter, which doesn't really make sense; but it's the spot we all sit in to come visit our friends working, and order a chai latte or a coffee or a chili. It's the end of an era."
And a sign of the times.
"There are lots of comments going around that Lululemon opening (on St-Viateur Ave. and Parc Ave.) was really a marker in Mile End," Hart said. "It's the same with our building now. People know what's coming."
The building in which Le Cagibi is located is co-owned by Jeremy Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller, who previously owned the building now rented out to Lululemon on St-Viateur, before the building was sold to real estate magnates Danny Lavy and Stephen Shiller (Brandon's father) in 2015; Kornbluth and Brandon Shiller are also owners of a building at Jean-Talon Market where a controversial Starbucks was located from 2015 to 2017 (a petition against the outpost garnered more than 9,000 signatures).

Shiller Lavy Realties own other properties on Laurier, including one at the corner of Jeanne-Mance, until recently the home of Pâtisserie De Gascogne, which closed in late December after 60 years( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/patisserie-de-gascogne-suddenly-closes-all-seven-outlets-175-jobs-lost ); and one at the corner of Esplanade, which was torn down( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-laden-roof-collapses-in-montreals-mile-end ) in a storm of controversy last February due to the roof caving in after years of neglect (during which Shiller Lavy reportedly filed several requests to convert and/or replace the building, all of which contravened city heritage laws).

Le Cagibi's artsy essence is summed up in the fact that the privately-owned (by two former Esperanza employees) business is in the midst of transforming into a co-op, comprising several of its staff.
"It's so much work," said Hart, who is co-op president. "But it's empowering and exciting in a lot of ways. Being part of a workers' co-op means more agency and more benefits.

Abstract: The storm, expected to leave 10 centimetres of snow, also caused traffic slowdowns in the city and at the airport on Wednesday evening. The Société de transport de Montréal had advised people to allow for extra time for their commute, and warned that providing service to wheelchair users at accessible bus stops might be difficult because of the storm.

Full text: A man has died after a road accident during Wednesday's snow storm.
The man in his 70s succumbed to injuries incurred during a multi-vehicle collision that left more than 50 vehicles stranded on Highway 20 West near Mont-Saint-Hilaire.
The pileup sent 15 other people to the hospital with minor injuries. The highway was closed for several hours, Wednesday afternoon. "We have to clear the highway, then tow all the vehicles," said the SQ's Montérégie spokesperson Joyce Kemp, adding that minibuses had been dispatched to the scene to take people who are not injured away from the area.
The storm, expected to leave 10 centimetres of snow, also caused traffic slowdowns in the city and at the airport on Wednesday evening.
Highway 30 closed in both directions between St-Constant and Candiac because of another accident involving several vehicles and at least two jackknifed trucks.
As well, Highway 10 west was closed due to a multi-car collision near Chemin du Ruisseau-Barré, in Marieville; and due to another multi-car collision near Magog.
Aside from those major accidents, a lot of cars have gone off the road, Kemp said, encouraging drivers to slow down, keep a safe distance and prepare for a variety of challenging conditions.
Several flights in and out of Trudeau Airport were delayed or cancelled Wednesday. To keep up with the latest flight schedules, visit admtl.com/en/flights( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights ).
The Société de transport de Montréal had advised people to allow for extra time for their commute, and warned that providing service to wheelchair users at accessible bus stops might be difficult because of the storm.
The forecast for Montreal calls for a steady snowfall - a rate of about one centimetre per hour - through to 10 p.m.
Wind gusts of up to 26 km/h further complicated travel for rush-hour commuters.
Wednesday's snowfall occurs as the city of Montreal reports 63 per cent of its streets have been cleared since the last substantial snowfall, on Sunday. You can check on your borough at the city's snow-clearing tracker: ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ).

Nearly full snow dump sites could hamper clearing operations

Author: Magder, Jason

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/nearly-full-snow-dump-sites-could-hamper-clearing/docview/1999333840/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Because of those delays, the city's most populous borough was dead last in clearing snow( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) from several early January snowfalls. To relieve overcapacity at dumps, the city requested permission from the province's environment ministry last week to use the parking lot at the abandoned Hippodrome horse-racing track at the western end of Jean-Talon St. The city is already preparing the site, but as of Wednesday had not yet received permission to dump snow.

Full text: A little over halfway through the winter, and most of the city's snow dumps are already nearly full.
With a snow-clearing operation nearly completed( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ), and another 10-15 centimetres predicted for Wednesday, that could mean extra delays.
City spokesperson Marilyne Laroche Corbeil confirmed that on Wednesday seven of the city's 11 snow dumps were already at least 80 per cent full and the Highway 13 site was closed because it had reached capacity. The city of Montreal, which manages all snow disposal sites, has already temporarily closed two dumps last week( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ), and in January it barred the borough of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce from dumping snow at the Angrignon Blvd.( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-snow-clearing-delays-as-c-d-n-n-d-g-barred-from-dump-site ) dump in LaSalle. That meant a slowdown in the borough's snow-clearing operations because trucks got stuck in traffic en route to the Miron Quarry dump in St-Michel. Because of those delays, the city's most populous borough was dead last in clearing snow( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) from several early January snowfalls.
Laroche Corbeil acknowledged Wednesday that this overcapacity could delay upcoming snow-clearing operations. However, she pointed out that the city's snow dumps handle only half of the snow picked up from streets. About 25 per cent goes the quarry, and another 25 per cent to 16 snow chutes, which direct snow into the city's sewer system. She said the snow chutes have a continuous capacity and can't really fill up. The Miron Quarry also has a much greater capacity than the snow dumps.
To relieve overcapacity at dumps, the city requested permission from the province's environment ministry last week to use the parking lot at the abandoned Hippodrome horse-racing track at the western end of Jean-Talon St. The city is already preparing the site, but as of Wednesday had not yet received permission to dump snow.
The city has acknowledged that the use of the Hippodrome is not a cure-all, as it has limited capacity.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante conveyed frustration at having to wait for the province's permission.
"We'll be taking measures to make sure we don't contaminate the site," Plante said. "But we shouldn't have to ask Quebec every time we want to open a new site."

Abstract: A storm that is expected to leave 10 centimetres of snow in the Montreal area was causing traffic slowdowns in the city and at the airport on Wednesday afternoon. The Société de transport de Montréal advised people to allow for extra time for the afternoon commute, and warned that providing service to wheelchair users at accessible bus stops might be difficult because of the storm.

Full text: A storm that is expected to leave 10 centimetres of snow in the Montreal area was causing traffic slowdowns in the city and at the airport on Wednesday afternoon.
Two highways on the South Shore were closed after multiple-vehicle accidents. Westbound Highway 20 west was completely closed near Mont St-Hilaire due to an accident involving several vehicles, including two jackknifed transport trucks, that has left at least 50 vehicles stopped on the road. Several people are reportedly injured, two of them in critical condition. The highway has been closed indefinitely.
"We have to clear the highway, then tow all the vehicles," said the SQ's Montérégie spokesperson Joyce Kemp, adding that minibuses have been dispatched to the scene to take people who are not injured away from the area. In the meantime drivers are advised to take the 116 toward Montreal.
Highway 30 was closed in both directions between St-Constant and Candiac because of another accident involving several vehicles and at least two jackknifed trucks. One westbound lane was reopened just before 4 p.m.
As well, Highway 10 west was closed due to a multi-car collision near Chemin du Ruisseau-Barré, in Marieville.
Aside from those major accidents, a lot of cars have gone off the road, Kemp said, encouraging drivers to slow down, keep a safe distance and prepare for a variety of challenging road conditions.
Several flights in and out of Trudeau Airport were delayed or cancelled Wednesday. To keep up with the latest flight schedules, visit admtl.com/en/flights( http://www.admtl.com/en/flights ).
The Société de transport de Montréal advised people to allow for extra time for the afternoon commute, and warned that providing service to wheelchair users at accessible bus stops might be difficult because of the storm.
The forecast for Montreal calls for a steady snowfall - a rate of about one centimetre per hour - through to 10 p.m.
With motorists already expecting a difficult rush hour, wind gusts of up to 26 km/h are expected to further complicate their commute.
Wednesday's snowfall occurs as the city of Montreal reports 60 per cent of its streets have been cleared since the last substantial snowfall, on Sunday.

Simple solution for icy sidewalks: Just add salt when clearing snow?

Author: Brownstein, Bill

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/simple-solution-icy-sidewalks-just-add-salt-when/docview/1994785256/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Concerned citizen Émile Fattal feels he has the perfect solution to help fellow Montrealers avoid taking unintended triple Salchows - before crumbling down on city sidewalks. "Why can't our sidewalks be as ice-free as our bike paths?" As is the case with Urgences Santé and local hospital emergency rooms, Fattal also provides alarming statistics about the number of serious outdoor falls reported to authorities. When presented with Fattal's solution, Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's point man for snow-clearing operations, said city crews were using the same salt and stones on the sidewalks as on the streets.

Full text: It seems so utterly elementary. Concerned citizen Émile Fattal feels he has the perfect solution to help fellow Montrealers avoid taking unintended triple Salchows - before crumbling down on city sidewalks.
"It all comes down to de-icing our sidewalks by applying the same standards as those relating to de-icing our streets: salt them while you are clearing the snow," Fattal says. "When you walk on a sidewalk, it should be as clear as the street."
Makes sense.
Fattal, entrepreneur and lawyer, notes that after every snowfall, the black asphalt on our roads becomes quickly visible while the sidewalks, even if worked on, remain covered.
"The sidewalks may have been cleared of snow, but a film remains. This layer then evolves into slush and eventually icy, uneven surfaces. And that transforms into the treacherous terrain we seem to have to deal with all the time.
"Everyone assumes this is something which is insoluble and part of living in a northern climate. But this is a false story. There is a wilful blindness here."
It's not like Fattal hasn't proposed this plan to municipal politicians and functionaries, either. He has sent letters and had meetings, but to little avail.
"They tell me they are putting abrasives and salt on sidewalks," he says. "But I tell them: 'Whatever you're doing with the sidewalks, if you think it's so fantastic, then why don't you reverse the role. Do what you do to the sidewalks to the streets, and vice versa.' "
Fattal claims a former city borough mayor told him that such a scenario would result in too many accidents.
"That is precisely my point," Fattal says.
Short of installing heated sidewalks - which is now out of the question because of cost constraints - it couldn't possibly hurt to try this approach.
Fattal notes that some politicians have been seemingly amenable to the idea, but have still failed to act.
"Many of them think that abrasives are a good substitute for salting. It is no substitute," Fattal insists. "Why can't our sidewalks be as ice-free as our bike paths?"
As is the case with Urgences Santé and local hospital emergency rooms, Fattal also provides alarming statistics about the number of serious outdoor falls reported to authorities.
"But that's only the tip of the iceberg. How many additional injuries go unreported?"
Fattal believes the issue may all boil down to economics.
"When salt was introduced on our roads, it was considered a luxury, and so this perceived extravagance was not going to be wasted on pedestrians," he asserts. "Regardless, I'm not aware of anybody having done a cost analysis."
So Fattal provides his own analysis. He figures that most streets are about 65 feet wide and that sidewalks are about four feet wide on each side.
"So, salting eight feet of sidewalks against 65 feet of streets works out to about 12 per cent, which is not a huge additional cost compared to the overall health costs.
"The thinking seems to be that as long as traffic moves on our streets, pedestrians have to fend for themselves. Some will injure themselves, and those who are more able will not. That seems to have been the standard for the last 50 years, and few have questioned it."
Having endured more than his fair share of tumbles over the years, Fattal acknowledges that his obsession with icy sidewalks began with concerns for his own well-being.
"I started asking myself why I was always walking on the street and not the sidewalks during winter," says Fattal, 72. "It occurred to me that I was taking less of a chance getting hit by a car by walking on the street than avoiding the certainty of slipping and falling on the sidewalks.
"I know if I do fall now and break a hip, it will be a life-changing experience. I'm still very active, and I would like it to remain that way. That's why I can't believe that something so simple isn't being done."
When presented with Fattal's solution, Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's point man for snow-clearing operations, said city crews were using the same salt and stones on the sidewalks as on the streets.
"But the difference is that when we use the salt trucks on the roads, we can put more pressure on the ground than we can with the (sidewalk equipment)," Parenteau said. "If we put too much pressure, there's a danger of them hitting the cars parked on the side of the streets."
Parenteau conceded that more work has to be done on the sidewalks to clear them of ice. He pointed out that in future snow-clearing operations with no cars on the streets, sidewalk crews would put more pressure on their machines to help rectify the problem.
"People will then start noticing the difference on the sidewalks," said Parenteau, who is in his first year as the city snow's czar and is not oblivious to the discontent of citizens. "I like a challenge, and this is a huge one."
For his part, Fattal is not impressed with Parenteau's reasoning.
"Nonsense," Fattal said. "That's an irrational argument to me. It has nothing to do with pressure of the machines on sidewalks. It has everything to do with salt."
Here's hoping for some rationality - and soon. The city is slated to be hit with another storm on Wednesday. This could make for dicey times since snow-clearing operations from this past weekend's 14-centimetre dump only started at 7 p.m. on Monday.

Abstract: Located at the base of the Shell gas station sign, near a bush on Somerled Ave. at the corner of Cavendish Blvd., the mound of snow is home to all sorts of wildlife, including pigeons and squirrels, feeding off bread and seeds that passersby leave for them. During an hour on Friday afternoon, rats with brown and black fur, looking like oversized gerbils, could be seen popping out of different holes, running to feed on seeds and crumbs of food left on the snow, and then running back quickly to their holes. "Within a few hours, we determined it's on private property, so we'll be sending someone from the permits and inspection team to make sure the gas station takes care of cleaning it up as soon as possible," Arseneault said.

Full text: A large mound of snow is serving as a makeshift hotel for a family of rats at one of the busiest intersections of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
Located at the base of the Shell gas station sign, near a bush on Somerled Ave. at the corner of Cavendish Blvd., the mound of snow is home to all sorts of wildlife, including pigeons and squirrels, feeding off bread and seeds that passersby leave for them.
The mound became the talk of the city after someone posted a video on Facebook of the rats going in and out to feed on the pile of food left for them during a snowy winter's evening.
"I think it's dangerous because you have the food bank here, and it seems like there is a colony here," said area resident Dave Furlotte, who was walking by on Friday afternoon. "These things have to be eradicated. We don't know what these things are carrying. I have no idea how big the colony is but you have entrances and exits. There are at least four holes here."
During an hour on Friday afternoon, rats with brown and black fur, looking like oversized gerbils, could be seen popping out of different holes, running to feed on seeds and crumbs of food left on the snow, and then running back quickly to their holes. There were often two or even three rats running out of the mound at the same time.
Furlotte said he has seen the rats in that spot for several months and is disgusted that some people seem to be feeding them.
"A woman said to me, 'the rats need a place to live,'" he said.
Some concerned citizens phoned the city at 311 on Thursday when they saw the video on the Parents NDG Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/groups/ParentsNDG/ ).
Christian Arseneault, the city councillor for the Loyola district where the rat hotel is located, said the city will be working quickly to get rid of the rats.
"Within a few hours, we determined it's on private property, so we'll be sending someone from the permits and inspection team to make sure the gas station takes care of cleaning it up as soon as possible," Arseneault said.
Rats dash in and out of a den on Somerled Ave. to snatch food in Montreal on Friday, Feb. 2, 2018.
Aladdin Gouadr, the retailer who runs the Shell station said Friday, he had not received any communication from the city, but he won't wait to call an exterminator.
"We will call a company to check this out, but we can assure people that there are no rats or even mice inside the station," he said after seeing the rats for the first time on Friday.
He added rats generally live in the sewer system and there are two storm sewer grates on either side of the snow mound, so perhaps the city has to make repairs to its sewer as well.
Frank Pulcini, the owner of Central Extermination in Montreal, said he is surprised to see rats in an outdoor structure.
"I haven't seen this before; it's not something you commonly see, but I guess it is possible," Pulcini said.
He said as long as people don't get too close, they are not a threat because rats are often skittish around humans, and won't attack unless they feel threatened.
"Generally, they're more afraid of humans than we are of them," he said.
He added rats live in the sewer, and they'll only live outside the sewer when there is a break in a pipe.
Arseneault said if there is a problem with the storm sewers in the area, the city will address it.
"Even if it is on someone's private property, there is a chance they came through public infrastructure," he said. "We have to figure out what happened so we can make sure it doesn't happen again."

During an hour on Friday afternoon, rats with brown and black fur, looking like oversized gerbils, could be seen popping out of different holes, running to feed on seeds and crumbs of food left on the snow, and then running back quickly to their holes. There were often two or even three rats running out of the mound at the same time.
Furlotte said he has seen the rats in that spot for several months and is disgusted that some people seem to be feeding them.
"A woman said to me, 'the rats need a place to live,'" he said.
Some concerned citizens phoned the city at 311 on Thursday when they saw the video on the Parents NDG Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/groups/ParentsNDG/ ).
Christian Arseneault, the city councillor for the Loyola district where the rat hotel is located, said the city will be working quickly to get rid of the rats.
"Within a few hours, we determined it's on private property, so we'll be sending someone from the permits and inspection team to make sure the gas station takes care of cleaning it up as soon as possible," Arseneault said.
Rats dash in and out of a den on Somerled Ave. to snatch food in Montreal on Friday, Feb. 2, 2018.
Aladdin Gouadr, the retailer who runs the Shell station said Friday, he had not received any communication from the city, but he won't wait to call an exterminator.
"We will call a company to check this out, but we can assure people that there are no rats or even mice inside the station," he said after seeing the rats for the first time on Friday.
He added rats generally live in the sewer system and there are two storm sewer grates on either side of the snow mound, so perhaps the city has to make repairs to its sewer as well.
Frank Pulcini, the owner of Central Extermination in Montreal, said he is surprised to see rats in an outdoor structure.
"I haven't seen this before; it's not something you commonly see, but I guess it is possible," Pulcini said.
He said as long as people don't get too close, they are not a threat because rats are often skittish around humans, and won't attack unless they feel threatened.
"Generally, they're more afraid of humans than we are of them," he said.
He added rats live in the sewer, and they'll only live outside the sewer when there is a break in a pipe.
Arseneault said if there is a problem with the storm sewers in the area, the city will address it.
"Even if it is on someone's private property, there is a chance they came through public infrastructure," he said. "We have to figure out what happened so we can make sure it doesn't happen again."

Full text: A large mound of snow is serving as a makeshift hotel for a family of rats at one of the busiest intersections of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
Located at the base of the Shell gas station sign, near a bush on Somerled Ave. at the corner of Cavendish Blvd., the mound of snow is home to all sorts of wildlife, including pigeons and squirrels, feeding off bread and seeds that passersby leave for them.
The mound became the talk of the city after someone posted a video on Facebook of the rats going in and out to feed on the pile of food left for them during a snowy winter's evening.
"I think it's dangerous because you have the food bank here, and it seems like there is a colony here," said area resident Dave Furlotte, who was walking by on Friday afternoon. "These things have to be eradicated. We don't know what these things are carrying. I have no idea how big the colony is but you have entrances and exits. There are at least four holes here."

Full text: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, are blaming trouble with city snow-clearing operations this winter on extraordinary circumstances.
But the events of the last few days seem more like the result of extraordinary incompetence.
There has been more snow this winter, Parenteau claimed (incorrectly) on Wednesday. The snow dumps are almost full, he warned. Climate change is resulting in more freezing rain, Plante noted (correctly). We're in the midst of a snow crisis, the mayor insisted.
More like a snow fiasco.
After a particularly miserable storm dumped snow and freezing rain on Montreal, shuttered schools and made getting around dangerous without crampons, the city did its usual plowing and spreading of abrasives. Cleaning up such a mess is a complicated task - of that there is no doubt.
But Parenteau's decision not to clear snow over the weekend, relying instead on a day of thawing and the possibility of fresh snow, was the first misstep in a comedy of errors that is far from amusing. By Monday, Parenteau had offered a mea culpa and reversed his decision( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-to-start-snow-removal-sunday-night ). He ordered a full snow-clearing operation to commence.
Meanwhile, he picked a fight with Luis Miranda,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ) the borough mayor of Anjou for having already cleared the snow, ignoring a central city order to stand down. The central city is supposed to make the call on snow-clearing operations to ensure equity between different parts of the city and maintain a uniform standard. You'd think the purpose of such a policy would be to elevate the level of service for all, not create a race to the bottom.
And as Miranda noted, if you're going to raise taxes, you'd better make sure you're taking care of basic services. But the real absurdity is that Anjou may now face financial penalties for Miranda doing what Parenteau now admits he should have done in the first place.
Even as the city-wide effort got underway, questions began to swirl about its utility. Or rather futility, depending on where you live.
I watched as a backhoe attacked ice the consistency of concrete on the curbs in my neighbourhood so the heavy machinery idling behind could chew it up, spit it in the back of trucks and cart it away. The noisy endeavour, which looked like it removed as much street as snow, made little to no difference for pedestrians; in Ville-Marie and parts of the Plateau-Mont-Royal, the sidewalks were mostly bare.
In others parts of Montreal, however, the exercise was desperately needed. Sidewalks were treacherous and people had been slipping and sliding or having to walk on the road. Urgences Santé has reported a spike in the number of calls due to falls.
Couldn't the snow-clearing have been targeted to where it was most needed? Plante talked Wednesday about reducing disparities between boroughs. So tackling streets still covered in ice rather than raking ones where the pavement was showing seems like a place to start.
Plante and Parenteau deserve some credit for acknowledging that the city botched the latest snow-clearing job and offering some solutions to fix things. But it's disconcerting nonetheless to hear the person in charge of this crucial service say he resorted to wishful thinking to inform his decision.
Of course, all Montrealers who haven't flocked south hope for mild temperatures and a light dusting of fluffy white stuff after a particularly frigid and snowy January, but we know better than to count on it. Parenteau needs to face up to the sometimes grim reality that we live in Montreal and it's the middle of winter.
But worse is his false assertion that we've already got more snow so far this winter than we did in all of the last. It's easy enough to calculate that we got 141 centimetres of snow in December and January (plus the freezing rain). But between December 2016 and March 2017, we got about 220 centimetres. So it doesn't seem like Montreal is really overwhelmed by snowfall as much as Parenteau is in over his head.
Now Montreal is going to buy a few more special "croque-glace" - special tractors that crunch up ice on sidewalks that have been piloted in Ville-Marie borough - to deal with more frequent freezing-rain storms. Smart. The city is going to ask the province if it can use the Blue Bonnets site as a temporary snow dump. And we're going to have a snow-clearing summit to discuss best practices. What we need is less talk and more plowing.
Montreal has existed for 375 years and counting. We can be reasonably sure it has snowed in each and every one of those years. So at this point, we should be experts when it comes to clearing roads and sidewalks. The only thing different about this winter is the people in charge at city hall.
Montreal is not in a snow crisis. But the Plante administration sure is.

Full text: Re: "Plante administration takes heat over icy sidewalks" (Montreal Gazette, Jan. 30) I tip my hat to Anjou borough Mayor Luis Miranda for proceeding with snow-clearing and de-icing operations against city directives after the recent storm that turned the city into a death trap.
Miranda put people's safety first, while my borough mayor (Valérie Plante) and her lieutenant (François Paranteau) seemed content to cross their fingers and hope for the best, leaving the weather forecasters'prognostications to determine Montrealers' fate.
I've been watching plows on my street struggling to break down ice mountains - a time-consuming process that will cost a great deal more than it would have had the city not waited.
Plante needs to reconsider her priorities. How dare she raise taxes when we can't even count on her to deliver basic services.
People should be outraged, as indeed, by all accounts, they are.

Full text: With most Montrealers receiving their tax bills( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-city-council-poised-to-vote-on-budget-controversial-tax-hike ) in the mail this week, the city's mayor said citizens should expect better services than they've seen so far this winter.
"We want to improve. We want to make sure citizens are satisfied with the services they are paying for," Valérie Plante said. "We're really good at removing snow, but one of the things we need to improve is everything related to ice."
Plante said she's concerned about uneven service in the boroughs when it comes to de-icing sidewalks and spreading abrasives. In a news conference on Wednesday, the city revealed that some boroughs spread salt and stones on their sidewalks six times during the last week when some others only spread it twice.
Plante did not say which boroughs were not faring as well, but she unveiled a new, small sidewalk-sized truck with a metal rotor that has spikes on it she dubbed the "ice crusher." The vehicle has been getting a trial run in the Ville-Marie borough for the last two years, and Plante said any borough that wants to purchase one can get one - by next fall.

- Valérie Plante (@Val_Plante) January 31, 2018( https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/958779848826040320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )
As for immediate plans to improve snow clearing and de-icing in the city, Plante was short on details. She said she would meet with the mayors of the other boroughs to get a better idea about best practices. She will also meet professionals in the field like the Association des entrepreneurs de déneigement du Québec, which sent a letter to the city in November asking for a meeting. Although the association said it has not received an answer to its request, Plante told reporters she intends to meet the group in the near future.
Meanwhile, the city was still taking flak Wednesday for its decision to delay clearing snow from the last downfall, which resulted in crusty ice on sidewalks, roads and parking lots. The ice has lingered on many surfaces despite a snow-removal operation that got underway on Sunday.
Jonathan Trudeau, the president of the Association des entrepreneurs de déneigement du Québec, said the city erred when it failed to clear the snow last week. The city had expected the snow to melt( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-counting-on-warm-weather-to-clear-icy-streets-and-sidewalks ) during a one-day thaw.
"If that decision were taken at the end of February or the beginning of March or even in October, it would have been a good one," Trudeau said. "Except in January, the temperature fluctuations are dramatic, and in this case, everything froze and turned into (concrete)."
Trudeau recognized it's difficult for the city to make informed decisions on snow clearing, and that's why he's offering his association's expertise.
"We have been doing this in some cases for three generations, so we have the experience," he said.
Luis Miranda, the borough mayor of Anjou, said if the city had just removed the snow at the beginning of last week as his borough did, there wouldn't be any ice now.
"I took away the snow before it turned into ice; that's what you had to do," Miranda said. "The city decided to let it melt; it melted a bit and it stayed on the street, but water turns into ice, and they're stuck with it."
Miranda said he warned Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow clearing, that the city should be clearing snow rather than waiting for it to melt.
Miranda took heat for acting( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-administration-takes-heat-over-icy-sidewalks ) before the central city declared a city-wide snow-clearing operation. He said he has no regrets, but it's possible the city will penalize him by reducing his overall operating budget.
On Wednesday, Parenteau defended the decision to delay snow clearing, saying it was not made to save money but rather to alleviate the city's overflowing snow dumps. Two of the city's dumps, one in Sud-Ouest and one in Lachine, have reached capacity, and one used by both LaSalle and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce near the Angrignon shopping mall is at 90 per cent capacity and won't be able to handle the volume from another major storm, Parenteau said.
As such, the city is asking the Quebec Environment minister to approve the temporary use of a site near the abandoned Blue Bonnets/Hippodrome site in Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
Parenteau said the city has received about the same amount of snow already this year as it usually receives in a normal winter.
However, Miranda, who once served as the city's snow czar in 2009 under the administration of former mayor Gérald Tremblay, said that's simply not true. He said he doesn't understand how some of the city's dumps are full when his still has plenty of capacity.
"In 2007, we received 400 centimetres of snow," Miranda said. "A normal winter is 200, and we're not even there yet. How can they be full? I really don't know."
His borough shares its dump with neighbouring boroughs of Montréal-Nord, St-Léonard and Rivière-des-Prairies.
According to Environment Canada, the city received 147 centimetres of snow so far this season, compared with 230 centimetres for all of last season.

Abstract: Last June, the town announced that the centre would get an overhaul and the focus of the work would be to make the Art Deco, heritage building more energy-efficient and to reduce the heat-island effect in the area. During an interview the day after the public meeting, Mayor Paola Hawa said that council was open to taking a closer look at the heating plan, but that the choice to heat with natural gas had not been taken lightly and that it hadn't been based solely on cost efficiency.

Full text: How best to heat Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue's community centre has become a matter for debate.
The Harpell Centre is located at the intersection of St. Pierre St. and Highway 20. It was built in 1948 and has long been considered the heart of the community. The building has been expanded three times and now houses the town's recreational services, a community hall, the library and a swimming pool and wading pool.
Last June, the town announced that the centre would get an overhaul and the focus of the work would be to make the Art Deco, heritage building more energy-efficient and to reduce the heat-island effect in the area.
A $232,058 federal grant connected to the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program was added to town funds for a budget of around $500,000. In the plans: change the asphalt roof for a white roof which better reflects the heat, correct grade on terrace to improve water run-off and replace 25 per cent of terrace paving with greenery, upgrade plumbing and replace all doors and windows with energy-efficient units. It was also decided that the electric heating would be converted to natural gas.
Resident Bruno Haas questioned the wisdom of the heating decision during a presentation of the town's 2018 budget last week after he learned that $85,000 was earmarked for the conversion in the town's three-year capital investment plan.
He said the decision to heat with fossil fuel contradicted the spirit of the town's application for a federal grant - mentioned earlier in the evening - which would pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of putting in place a long-term plan to deal with the effects of climate change.
Director general Martin Bonhomme said their research showed that heating with natural gas was less costly. He said heating the pool with electricity cost $28,000. Heating with natural gas cost $15,800.
"It costs less, so that justifies harming the planet by worsening climate change?" Haas asked. His comments were applauded.
During an interview the day after the public meeting, Mayor Paola Hawa said that council was open to taking a closer look at the heating plan, but that the choice to heat with natural gas had not been taken lightly and that it hadn't been based solely on cost efficiency.
"In the case of a (town-wide) emergency such as a complete blackout like the one we experienced in the 1998 ice storm, the Harpell Centre is the gathering point - the emergency headquarters," Hawa said. "If there is no electricity for heating, can we still use it as an emergency centre?"
She said that one citizen had suggested installing a geothermal heating system which relies on silos buried underground but that kind of heating system was problematic because it required more land than was available.
"The No. 1 priority for me, is safety for the citizens," Hawa said.

Just for Laughs lands planet's hottest comedy star: Kevin Hart

Author: Brownstein, Bill

Abstract: The rumblings about the future of JFL relate to its founder Gilbert Rozon( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gilbert-rozon-will-challenge-sexual-assault-class-action-suit-lawyers-say ), who is facing allegations of sexual assault and misconduct and has stepped away from the festival. Rozon's ownership shares have been for sale for a few months, and although there has been no buyer so far, it is rumoured that three American conglomerates - Viacom, 3 Arts Entertainment and ICM - are in the running to purchase them( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecor-claims-it-has-right-of-first-refusal-in-any-just-for-laughs-sale ). The Hart announcement comes two weeks after JFL revealed several free outdoor events, including the Beach Boys( http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/just-for-laughs-books-the-beach-boys ), who will be bringing their surf rock to the Place des Festivals in July.

Full text: The 36th Just for Laughs may still be half a year away and its ownership still up in the air, but it hasn't stopped the festival from announcing its first major concert, and it's a significant one: Kevin Hart.
The fireball comic will be bringing his latest spectacle, the Kevin Hart Irresponsible Tour, to the Bell Centre July 27 for one show only. Tickets go on sale Wednesday at noon.
Hart is, without question, the hottest comedy star on the planet and one of the very few who can play the biggest rooms around. In 2015, Hart drew the largest paying crowd ever at a JFL event when he brought his What Now tour to the Bell Centre.
Hart went on to sell out eight arenas in the New York area alone and became the first comic to sell out an NFL stadium - 50,000 seats in Philadelphia - before taking Europe and Australia by storm. The tour ended up grossing more than $100 million.
The announcement of the Hart show should allay rumblings about the future of Just for Laughs. Clearly, landing Hart indicates that it is business as usual at the festival.
One would have to surmise that a star of Hart's stature wouldn't be heading here if there were any doubts about the fest's future and/or feasibility. Hart would have certainly been given strong financial guarantees before signing. Nor would any quality agent allow its most prized client to hop aboard a sinking ship.
The rumblings about the future of JFL relate to its founder Gilbert Rozon( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gilbert-rozon-will-challenge-sexual-assault-class-action-suit-lawyers-say ), who is facing allegations of sexual assault and misconduct and has stepped away from the festival. Rozon's ownership shares have been for sale for a few months, and although there has been no buyer so far, it is rumoured that three American conglomerates - Viacom, 3 Arts Entertainment and ICM - are in the running to purchase them( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecor-claims-it-has-right-of-first-refusal-in-any-just-for-laughs-sale ).
All of which is not to say that L'Affaire Rozon hasn't had repercussions for the world's biggest comedy festival. It has, but on the French side.
As previously written, following word of the Rozon allegations, TVA quickly announced it was pulling Les Galas Juste pour rire( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/bill-brownstein-just-for-laughs-will-survive-without-gilbert-rozon-insiders-say ) from its schedule. France's M6 television network suspended broadcast of the 12th season of La France a un incroyable talent, a show in which Rozon was on the jury, and Radio-Canada announced that Rozon wouldn't be featured in new episodes of Dans l'oeil du dragon.
But the hardest hit of all for Juste pour rire was the creation of the Festival du rire de Montréal( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-comedians-plan-ethically-sound-festival-to-rival-just-for-laughs ), which has since been renamed Le Grand Montréal comédie fest. Founded by 50 of Quebec's best and brightest, including Mike Ward, Lise Dion, and Anthony Kavanagh, the upstart fest could also give a much-needed boost to francophone comedy in Montreal. Unlike the situation on the anglo side of the festival, there has been little evolution on the franco side, where Rozon had played a pivotal role in programming.
However, Rozon's imprint on the anglo side was almost negligible, and few in the industry believe he will have a negative impact now.
The Hart announcement comes two weeks after JFL revealed several free outdoor events, including the Beach Boys( http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/just-for-laughs-books-the-beach-boys ), who will be bringing their surf rock to the Place des Festivals in July.
Although the hosts have yet to be named, such JFL staples as the Ethnic Show and Nasty Show series have already been confirmed. The Ethnic Show will take place July 11-22 at Club Soda, while the Nasty Show will run July 18-21 at MTelus (formerly the Metropolis). Tickets are now on sale for both series.
In addition to the programming here, the festival team is primed for the 4th edition of JFL NorthWest in Vancouver, March 1-10. Heading up that lineup are some of the most acclaimed wits on the continent: Bill Burr, Trevor Noah, Mike Birbiglia, Maria Bamford and Jo Koy.
Hart is more than just a one-trick standup. He has also become a major force on screen, with his latest film, 700 Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle - also starring Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black - having become his highest-grossing yet with worldwide revenues of more than $700 million. Soon to come to the screen is Hart in the comedy romp Night School.
Plus, Hart's book memoir I Can't Make This Up: Life debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 2017 and spent almost three months on the list.
Just to ensure he never sleeps, Hart is also at the helm of the LOL Network, his new digital platform that is developing comedy programming.
Hart also has history at JFL. He was a raw rookie and unknown entity when he first performed at the 2001 fest in the New Faces of Comedy series. He hasn't looked back since. In 2015, he was named Comedy Person of the Year at the JFL Awards Show. This will mark his eighth festival visit.
The Kevin Hart Irresponsible Tour comes to the Bell Centre, Friday, July 27 at 8 p.m. Tickets will go on sale Wednesday at noon, are priced from $49.50 to $125, and will be available online at hahaha.com or by calling 1-855-310-2525.

Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.

Full text: Freezing rain marked the beginning and the end of the day in Montreal on Tuesday.
Montreal woke up to a city covered in a coat of ice, with all island school boards canceling classes and many pedestrians having a hard time getting around.
Just as the city was getting back on its feet, a late-day band of freezing rain caused power outages that left more than 45,000 homes in Montreal and the Montérégie region without power on Tuesday night.
As of 9 p.m., blackouts were affecting 36,490 Hydro-Québec customers in the Montérégie, south of Montreal, as well as 8,800 on Montreal Island. In Montreal, the outages were concentrated in Verdun (3,767 customers), Pierrefonds (2,215) and Beaconsfield (1,855 homes were without electricity).
Hydro-Québec said it expected to restore power on Tuesday night.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said. "We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 10,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday evening, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.

Abstract: Montreal schools shut down All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said. "We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Highways and hydro
Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 10,500 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday evening, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.

Full text: Montreal woke up Tuesday to a city covered in a coat of ice and a weather forecast that includes a freezing rain warning and calls for more of the same over the course of the day.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urgences Santé had responded to about 25 calls in Montreal and Laval after pedestrians had fallen on icy sidewalks.
In some cases, people were transported to a hospital for fractures, said spokesperson Valérie Tremblay.
Tremblay asked the public to make sure their stairs are clear of ice because Urgences Santé employees who are responding to emergencies have had to remove ice from the stairs before entering homes.
She also suggested that people take the time to remove ice from the stairs of elderly neighbours to help prevent falls.
Anyone venturing out Tuesday should consider using crampons, she suggested.

Montreal schools shut down
All Montreal area school boards - the English Montreal School Board, Lester B. Pearson School Board, Commission scolaire de Laval, Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, Riverside School Board, Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, and Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Île - closed their schools and offices. That decision was made after the director generals held a conference call at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But the English Montreal School Board had decided independently to close its schools and adult centres after listening to the forecast Monday night and Tuesday morning.
At 5 a.m. Tuesday, board spokesperson Michael Cohen sent out a recorded telephone message to more than 30,000 students and employees notifying them of the school closures. He also sent out a mass email, posted the news on Facebook and Twitter and called radio stations and television networks with morning shows.
"It took 15 minutes and everyone had received a phone call," he said. "It was the first time we did a call out to every single home to tell them that school has been closed."
On Monday night, parents were posting on the board's Facebook page, asking whether schools would be shut, and in some cases requesting closures because they were worried about the freezing rain.
"We had a lot of feedback on our social media channels and our Facebook page," Cohen said.
"We posted a message (Monday night) saying we were watching the situation closely and to stay tuned. Within an hour, 10,000 people had viewed that post and dozens and dozens were commenting. It's a new way to get the pulse of our community."

Despite the poor condition of some sidewalks in residential areas, Montreal police said they haven't received any calls to help injured pedestrians.
"Sometimes we get called first because Urgences Santé is busy," said Constable Benoit Boiselle.
City spokesperson Philippe Sabourin acknowledged that many sidewalks on secondary streets remained covered in snow and ice early Tuesday, but added their condition was part of plan the city had to deal with the cocktail of weather conditions that prevailed between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
"We adopted a 'Scott towel,' approach," he said. "Rather than plow away the snow that fell on Monday night, we left it there to absorb the freezing rain we knew was going to fall afterward."
Sabourin said sidewalk plows equipped with abrasive spreaders were deployed Tuesday morning to remove the snow and its shell of ice and scatter a mix of salt and grit onto the cleared sidewalks.
"If we had cleared the snow immediately, the ice would have been far more difficult to remove once the temperature dropped (on Tuesday night)," he said.

Across Quebec, about 7,230 Hydro-Québec customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, mostly because the freezing rain caused tree branches to fall on power lines. However, there are far fewer outages than the utility expected because there was little wind when the freezing rain fell overnight on Monday, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Françis Labbé.
About 3,500 customers in the Outaouais are in the dark along with 2,350 in the Montérégie. Nearly 650 customers on Montreal Island were without power.
The roads were less busy than usual as commuters heeded warnings to restrict travel. School closings throughout much of southern Quebec has also resulted in fewer are cars on the roads, said Sgt. Ingrid Asselin of the Sûreté du Québec.
Some motorists have ended up in the ditch while driving on slippery highways outside Montreal, but there have been no major accidents, she said.
In regions outside Montreal, SQ officers are driving on highways with their lights flashing instructing motorists to slow down.
While main thoroughfares in Montreal had been plowed overnight, the ensuing freezing rendered road surfaces treacherous. Side streets were more problematic and many sidewalks were either unplowed over a heavy layer of ice.
Late Monday night, Transports Québec reported that road conditions in southwestern Quebec were a mix of snow and ice on Highways 10, 15, 20, 30, 35 and 40. Highways 112, 116 and 132 in the Montérégie were reported as being quite icy.

NDP caucus called off
Federal New Democrats have cancelled a three-day caucus meeting that was to be begin Tuesday in Saguenay because of poor weather descending on the region.
Several flights to the area about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City have been cancelled, leaving many NDP MPs unable to get to Saguenay in time for the meetings.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning for the Saguenay area Monday night, which said 25 to 40 centimetres of snow and blowing snow were expected over parts of central and eastern Quebec through Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for the NDP said the party would try to hold its caucus later this week in Ottawa.
"Unfortunately, the storm has had an impressive impact on the movement of our MPs in the rest of Canada," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
"I am extremely disappointed that we have been forced to postpone our visit to Saguenay. I was really looking forward to coming back to the area, especially after being so well received in the fall." he added.
Presse Canadienne and the Canadian Press contributed to this report.

Winter biking in Montreal? No sweat

Author: Jordan Zivitz

Abstract: According to Komorowski, the rock salt used on roadways isn't ideal for bike paths because it requires the weight of car tires to activate its melting properties and spread it around. A few days after a storm, conditions improve, but the know-how in terms of methods for fast, centralized snow removal on bike paths just isn't there. The most common product used to melt snow and ice is rock salt, which often contains additives made from beet or corn sugar, or sometimes cheese byproducts, to extend the temperature range over which they work and to help them stick to road surfaces. According to Komorowski, liquid melters like salt brines that form a non-stick surface against the pavement are good for pedestrians, infrastructure and the environment, because they release up to one-third less salt onto the roads than rock salt.

Full text: People who cycle all winter in Montreal have a name for themselves: "hurlus," short for "hurluberlus." French for "weirdo."
Winter biking may have been a weirdos-only pursuit a decade ago, but from the look of our streets, either the weirdos are proliferating or winter biking is going mainstream. With the Plante administration's prioritization of "active transportation," the trend is likely to continue.
The popularity of Bixi might explain part of the increased popularity of year-round cycling. "Bixi has really changed the perception about who can ride a bike to work," said Zvi Leve, a cycling activist with the organization RuePublique( http://www.ruepublique.org/ ). "By using Bixi, more people realize how practical cycling is - it's almost always the fastest way to get around."
Many winter cyclists didn't set out to become hurlus; it just happened. This is how François Démontagne began winter cycling a decade ago.
"I just extended my season day by day, and once it was spring I had been biking all winter," he said. "Winter biking was a revelation."
Démontagne's commute takes him from the Plateau to Longueuil every day. It takes 50 minutes by public transit, but only 30 by bike - and that includes crossing the Jacques Cartier Bridge. "Biking all winter, it makes a huge difference physically. Doing physical activity for half an hour twice a day - it's hard to beat that."

There's also the matter of seeing a bit of that fleeting winter daylight. Démontagne's previous office was at Victoria Square, and his métro commute enabled him to get to and from work with barely any contact with fresh air.
"I just never really saw it as different from summer cycling," said Gabrielle Anctil, a spokesperson for Ghost Bike Montreal, an advocacy organization that memorializes cyclists killed in traffic with sculptural installations of white bikes. Her only must-have for winter cycling is ski goggles to prevent her eyes from tearing up in the cold.
As far as outerwear goes, Anctil and Démontagne both insist there's no need to overdo it. "You get really warm really quickly. It's better to dress down. You don't need to wear as much as you would if you were waiting for the bus," said Anctil.
Swapping in studded snow tires - even on just one of your wheels - can help with traction. Like many winter cyclists, Anctil has a bike specifically for winter. "It's a single-speed, and I've really set it up to be a comfortable bike. I'm sitting up rather than leaning forward. It has a coffee holder. It's very much like, 'OK, it's the winter, it's a little harsher.' I know I'm not going to go as fast, so I've set it to be a chill commute bike. I have studded tires, and fenders."

Winter bikers might be blasé when it comes to the nerve required to suit up and get pedalling when it's -15 C, but they aren't when it comes to snow removal. In 2011, McGill civil engineering researchers Luis Miranda-Moreno and Christopher Kho conducted a study on the factors that most determined whether or not people cycle during cold weather. Was it precipitation? Humidity? Temperature? Wind? They found it was surface conditions that made the most difference.
"You can't change the weather, but you can change the surface conditions," said Bartek Komorowski, a researcher at Vélo Québec( http://www.velo.qc.ca/en/Home ). The maintenance of cyclable surface conditions involves a complex web of factors: what kinds of bike paths are built, how snow is removed, what kinds of de-icers are used.
There's also the question of bike parking. On-street bike racks are removed in November, and most sidewalk bike-lock posts are buried in snow by sidewalk plows. Cyclists often have no choice but to shove their bike into a snowbank in order to access a locking post - and risk having their bike destroyed by passing plows.
"The expense of installing and removing those on-street racks is probably more than the racks themselves. Bicycles don't disappear in the winter. We're going to need to think about on-street bike parking if we want to improve conditions," said Leve.
A good grip may be necessary for cyclists, but that 10th layer of outerwear isn't. "You don't need to wear as much as you would if you were waiting for the bus," says Gabrielle Anctil. (Photo: Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette)
Meanwhile, not all bike lanes are created equal. The Coderre administration expanded the city's on-street bike lane network, consisting of painted lanes at the sides of streets, but advocates say this is of little use once winter comes. Snow plowed from the main roadway ends up covering the bike paths at the streets' margins. The painted paths are only accessible once the full snow removal operation has wrapped up - meaning only a handful of days per winter, depending on the snowfall.
Marianne Giguère is a Projet Montréal city councillor from Plateau-Mont-Royal and the associated councillor for active transportation and sustainable development on the city's executive committee. She says the Plante administration is hoping to build separated or protected bike lanes, such as the one on de Maisonneuve Blvd., which can be maintained separately.
"If we add bike lanes on the street, we want to make sure that there will be a space between the lane and the cars so that the snow can be moved and the bike lane can remain safe and accessible," said Giguère.
Then there's the question of de-icing. According to Komorowski, the rock salt used on roadways isn't ideal for bike paths because it requires the weight of car tires to activate its melting properties and spread it around.
"The newest thing is liquid melters - brines," he said. "They're usually salt diluted in water, and they're sprayed on rather than spread. When you spray it, it immediately becomes active. And then when the snow falls, it prevents the snow from binding to the surface. So it acts as a protective layer."
This enables the snow to be removed with a giant brush instead of a plow, which is less damaging to curbs and street surfaces. Last winter, Villeray-St-Michel-Parc-Extension experimented with brines and brushes, and neighbouring Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie was so impressed they began using them, too. Komorowski believes wider adoption of the brine-and-brush method could mean major improvements for cyclists.

On the Vélo d'hiver - Montréal Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/groups/velodhiver/about/ ), which has more than 8,000 members and an entertaining feed all winter long, members were unimpressed with the Plante administration's first three cycles of snow removal. In the days following each major snowfall, frustrated members posted photos of unplowed paths on several major arteries.
Démontagne, who is an active member of the group, is taking the long view.
"I'm not among those decrying the Plante administration's track record so far this winter," he said. "Bike path plowing is done borough by borough, and it's only centralized for the paths on major arteries. This doesn't really allow for a rapid response to snowfall. A few days after a storm, conditions improve, but the know-how in terms of methods for fast, centralized snow removal on bike paths just isn't there.
"I think Marianne Giguère is on board with the vision of a four-season biking network, but I'm not going to expect impeccable results this winter. There's infrastructure that needs to be updated."
Leve concurs. "I'm obviously not satisfied with the results at this point, but I know enough about the challenges involved to appreciate the complexity of this task. But we need to make continuous, sustained effort on this. We need followup about what works and what doesn't.
Giguère is hopeful. "If we have to buy better machinery so that the work is done more easily, and with a more secure result for cyclists, we're going to have to figure it out, and help the boroughs, since they are responsible for their own winter maintenance. Perhaps boroughs can share those machines. We have to work hand in hand with the boroughs, because they need to be part of the movement. We don't want to feel that we're rushing them or imposing our view - we need to convince them."
The hurlus will be out regardless.
"We are a Nordic city," said Leve. "We have a very active outdoor life year round. We need to start recognizing that as normal."

Abrasives aren't the only thing keeping us grounded
Anyone who knows the signature discomfort of a Montreal thaw - Bit of Gravel Inside Boot (and its advanced stage, Bit of Gravel Inside Sock) - has knowledge of our city's abrasives program.
Vélo Québec's Bartek Komorowski reminds us not to confuse abrasives with melters. Salt is a melter, but gravel is an abrasive.
"We used to use sand on the sidewalks, but it gummed up the métro escalators," said Komorowski. "So we use a stone that is crushed to a size that will not penetrate the escalator stairs."
The most common product used to melt snow and ice is rock salt, which often contains additives made from beet or corn sugar, or sometimes cheese byproducts, to extend the temperature range over which they work and to help them stick to road surfaces.
According to Komorowski, liquid melters like salt brines that form a non-stick surface against the pavement are good for pedestrians, infrastructure and the environment, because they release up to one-third less salt onto the roads than rock salt.
"All that salt corrodes our infrastructure, it destroys vegetation and trees in the city, and it ends up in the St. Lawrence. It also destroys our underground infrastructure," he said.
That's not all: salt is hard on bikes, cars, shoes and clothing. "Reducing salt use isn't really on the radar as far as municipal politics goes, but it should be, and it would have major benefits," Komorowski said.

Full text: With much of the snow already cleared, the city's most-populous borough was beginning to focus on how it will improve its snow-removal operation for the next major storm.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce trucks were barred this week from using( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-snow-clearing-delays-as-c-d-n-n-d-g-barred-from-dump-site ) one of the borough's three snow dumps, which it shares with LaSalle. The dump, located on Angrignon Blvd. near the Angrignon shopping mall, was apparently reaching its limit for snow. As a result, the city decreed it would only accept trucks from LaSalle, forcing C.D.N.-N.D.G. trucks to drive farther away to the St-Michel environmental complex, and they often get caught in traffic.
"Every minute that a truck is in transit is a minute that it can't pick up snow," said Snowdon city councillor Marvin Rotrand.
On Thursday afternoon, Marilyne Laroche Corbeil, a spokesperson for the central city, said the borough was once again permitted to dump snow at the Angrignon site. However, she said the situation changes day by day, so the trucks could be barred again on Friday or after future snow storms. She said that half of the borough's snow already cleared after the latest storm was sent to the Angrignon dump.
As of Thursday afternoon, the borough had cleared 70 per cent of its streets, but was still the slowest of the 18 boroughs reporting on the city's snow-removal website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). The city-wide average was 88 per cent.
On Thursday, borough mayor Sue Montgomery said they are trying to find another place where snow can be dumped for future snowfalls, if the Angrignon dump is once again off limits.
However, Rotrand said the borough had an option to build a fourth snow dump on the borough's outskirts about four years ago, but it was nixed by then-mayor Denis Coderre.
"In the early 2000s, we used a site at the end of Royalmount Ave., but it was too small," Rotrand said.
The borough stopped using the site because the run-off from the snow was apparently contaminating an adjacent plot of land owned by CP Rail, according to Montgomery, a former journalist at the Montreal Gazette..
Rotrand contends, however, that the Tremblay administration had come up with a deal to purchase the adjacent lot from CP. The agreement had to be negotiated with the railway and the city of Côte-St-Luc, where the lot is located.
"The railway was OK with it, and Côte-St-Luc did not object, but Coderre decided not to buy the land," Rotrand said. "We have to look into this again. Provided CP still wants to sell the land, and provided that Côte-St-Luc is also game, it could be a good solution."
Montgomery said she would not comment about the plan by the previous administration.
Rotrand blames a centralization of city services for many of the borough's woes. Because all decisions have to go through the city's large bureaucracy, Rotrand said, there is little ability to make quick decisions that could improve the operation.
"While I am relatively confident central will come up with something, they are slow," Rotrand said. "We have a problem right now. We need a solution right now, not in three weeks."
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce district city councillor Peter McQueen also blamed the centralized system of snow clearing, and warned it could get worse before it gets better.
"Snow clearing is also a service that Coderre had started centralizing, so the borough will no longer launch its own contracts," McQueen wrote in a Facebook post( https://www.facebook.com/peter.mcqueen.14/posts/10156013633734603 ). "All will go through center city with uniform service requirements. This might be OK if service was levelled upwards and we started getting cleared as fast as the fastest current boroughs, but ... I have my doubts."
Some additional measures could be in place for the next snow storm, Montgomery said, including asking the private contractors doing snow removal in three-quarters of the borough to add dayshifts to their workload - they usually only clear snow at night.

Montreal loses a hockey legend as Red Fisher dies at age 91

Abstract: [...]after filing on deadline he would call The Gazette sports desk to check on his story, greeting the editor who answered the phone with, "Habs in?" Once, when winger Mark Recchi failed to deliver after a post-game playoff victory over the New York Rangers, Fisher spun on his heels and headed toward the dressing room, theatrically muttering, "Clichés, clichés, clichés."

Almost two decades later, Bill Hay, then chairman of the Hall of Fame, essentially downgraded the writer and broadcaster categories; the winners of the Elmer Ferguson and Foster Hewitt Memorial Awards were to be considered "media honourees" and not members. Sather invited journalists and team officials to his hotel suite, gave a laudatory speech about his newspaper friend and then removed the black crepe from the picture on the easel in the room.

Full text: Red Fisher, the chronicler and the conscience of Montreal hockey whose career touched seven decades, died on Friday at age 91.
Fisher started on the Canadiens beat in 1955 in the era of train travel and finished it in 2012 when reporters tweeted the lines at morning skates. The man knew how to make an entrance: the first game he covered was the Richard Riot, that singular marriage of hockey, sociology and, ultimately, mythology that has marked Quebec for generations. Fisher was the link to the most glorious of the Canadiens teams - he never would refer to them in print as the Habs, one of several unwritten Red Rules - and covered 17 of their record 24 Stanley Cups. Along the way, the journalist who was believed to be the longest-serving beat man covering the major North American leagues collected three National Newspaper Awards and thousands of tales, entertaining readers and often ennobling hockey.
Fisher received one of Canada's highest civilian honours on Dec. 29, 2017, when he was named a member of the Order of Canada "for his contributions to sports journalism, notably for his iconic coverage of the Montreal Canadiens hockey franchise."
"He was the best of his time," Canadiens Hall of Fame goaltender Ken Dryden wrote in an email, "and his time lasted a very long time."
Canadiens' Jean Beliveau and Gazette reporter Red Fisher during the early 1960s.
Although he was prominent on Hockey Night in Canada with The Fisher Report and worked as a colour analyst on Canadiens broadcasts, Fisher was better known for the written than the spoken word. He was a distinctive writer, often bypassing the who-what-where-why journalism conventions for something as informative but more stylish, punctuated with tics and flourishes that hardened into an inimitable style. Among his catchphrases: "My great and good friend." "Nobody died." "Take a deep breath and hold it." His deadline game stories were not newspaper-y, but 800-word novellas, replete with heroes, villains and plot. The gift for narrative and analysis made him the definitive voice on hockey's heritage franchise at the Montreal Star and for 33 years, at the Gazette.
"There were a lot of intelligent people in the (media) business, but he was one of the most astute," New York Rangers president Glen Sather said. "He was intelligent, analytical."
"When things would go wrong for the team or for me, I would search for answers," Dryden wrote. "If I couldn't find them, I would say to myself: 'I wonder what Red thinks' and wait for the next day's paper. I never did that with anyone else."
Former Canadiens great and Hockey Hall of Famer Dickie Moore congratulates the Montreal Gazette's Red Fisher on his induction into the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame on Nov. 24, 2010.
Fisher could be finicky. He preferred corner hotel rooms on the road. He liked his soup scalding, his toast burnt, his Chivas with a few rocks and his quotes meaty. He steadfastly refused to refer to the Canadiens in print as the "Habs." But after filing on deadline he would call The Gazette sports desk to check on his story, greeting the editor who answered the phone with, "Habs in?" Once, when winger Mark Recchi failed to deliver after a post-game playoff victory over the New York Rangers, Fisher spun on his heels and headed toward the dressing room, theatrically muttering, "Clichés, clichés, clichés." Hockey pants around his ankles, Recchi hobbled after him, asking: "But Red, what did you want me to say?"
Fisher wanted a good tale, a nugget that might illuminate a play or a game. Even as reporting became more breathless in the Internet age, Fisher remained circumspect. "He liked the story but hated the rumour," Sather said. In his 1994 memoirs, Hockey, Heroes and Me, Fisher wrote his favourite four-letter word was "fair." He would leave cheap shots and bons mots to others, not that he avoided the clever and cutting when the situation demanded. During the 1970s when Scotty Bowman was stonewalling an injury to Montreal's first-line centre, Fisher wrote: "Jacques Lemaire is doubtful for tonight's game with what Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman describes as an upset stomach. The pain, however, has gone all the way up to his slightly separated shoulder."
Red Fisher in 1957.
"Red covered several thousand games in his career," Dryden wrote. "How many ways are there to say that the Rocket is 'fiery,' Béliveau 'regal,' Plante 'eccentric and brilliant'? What can you write day after day about Lafleur, Robinson, Gainey and Roy? About Blake and Bowman? Red had every right to have been a been there-done that person, but he wasn't. He watched every game with open eyes, because he knew that what he was doing wasn't about him. He knew that if a game was being played, it mattered. If players were playing it, they mattered. If fans were watching it, they mattered. If readers were reading his story, they mattered. And if he was writing it, he mattered. Red took the game, the Canadiens, his readers and himself very seriously."
While game stories and columns were his staples, Fisher wrote some memorable features that were fuelled by empathy and a firm grasp of the human condition. His tender stories about Laura Gainey, swept out to sea on her tall ship off the coast of Nova Scotia in 2006, a frail Toe Blake and the death of Hall of Fame winger and close friend Dickie Moore in 2015 belied his painstakingly cultivated image as a curmudgeon. At times he could be - to appropriate one of his literary locutions - cranky with gusts to crotchety. But for Fisher respect and friendship were precious commodities, slowly earned and not freely bestowed.
Former Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy has a word with Red Fisher following a news conference on Sept. 11, 2008, called to announce the retirement of Roy's sweater.
"I met Red first in Stockholm at the World Hockey Championships in 1969," Dryden wrote. "I was twenty-one; he was forty-two. I thought he was sixty. He was imperious. He was Red Fisher. He observed; he reported; he pronounced. He loved being the best because he could act like the best. He could be cantankerous and crusty. He could be intimidating. He could avoid suffering the fools he had no time for. But if you didn't fall for his act, Red was funny, smart and endlessly great company."
"The players liked Red because he was from the old era," said Steve Shutt, the star left winger on the dynastic Canadiens of the 1970s who later worked with Fisher on CJAD broadcasts. "He came from a time when the players and reporters were attached, riding the trains together. He was viewed almost as part of the team."
Fisher, raised near The Main where his father, Sam, who had emigrated from Russia (via several years in Scotland), repaired and sold second-hand shoes, started on the Canadiens beat at a time when reporters were practically embedded with their teams. Indeed, Fisher might have been the last working journalist to be initiated by the Canadiens in the old-time hockey way. Now, NHL rookies are merely stuck with outrageous tabs after dinners, but Fisher, like the players of decades ago, received rougher treatment. He was stripped naked, bound to a massage table and shaved by Maurice Richard, dressed in a surgeon's cap and a white lab coat, who, Fisher would later write, growled: "Welcome to the family."
Red Fisher at the Bell Centre on Sept. 24, 2005.
Fisher earned his place in the family not because the Canadiens initially paid for transportation, hotels and $10 in meal money - a practice The Star discontinued in 1963 when Fisher and Blake, the coach, had a confrontation over the policy - but through his work. Although he became synonymous with the Canadiens in the minds of readers across the country, he bristled when he was perceived as being too closely aligned to the team. Fisher had a policy of not speaking to rookies, probably the most famous Red Rule. When the 36-year-old Alain Vigneault was hired to coach the Canadiens in May 1997, he telephoned Fisher and said: "Mr. Fisher, I know you don't talk to rookies, but I'd like to have lunch this summer to discuss our team." The choice of the word "our" was the solecism. "No, thanks," Fisher told Vigneault. "See you in training camp."
"Red had our trust," Shutt said. "We would tell him stuff that would help fill out the story because he knew what to write and what not to. Red would always interview players by himself" - this was another of the Red Rules; Fisher despised pack journalism - "because if another reporter was around, the players would go all corporate. If the Journal de Montréal heard some of the stuff we trusted Red with, it would be front page every day.
"Red never was out for the big scoop, although that didn't mean he didn't get them."
Perhaps the most sensational came in 1970. Fisher obtained a financial report presented by NHL president Clarence Campbell to the Board of Governors that stated: "Even though our return to the players last season was at an all-time low, our profits were at an all-time high." Fisher wrote a five-part series about player salaries and benefits, a sensation that netted him the first of his National Newspaper Awards. The series, which embarrassed the NHL, also cost Fisher a regular slot on Hockey Night in Canada intermissions.
Fourteen years later, Fisher broke another story, one - indirectly at least - that might have had an even more significant effect on his career.
Red Fisher and Canadiens coach Jacques Demers in 1995.
In 1984, a senior Gazette executive was mulling removing Fisher from the Canadiens beat and replacing him with a writer who specialized in Olympic sports. "I think Red's losing his fastball," the executive confided to a newspaper staffer.
The idea was utter folly. Fisher knew where the hockey bodies were buried; most other reporters were unaware anyone was missing. Fisher infrequently attended the actual Canadiens practices because there was no need. He would go to the Forum before the skates, troll the changing area behind the dressing room for stories and quietly depart before other journalists arrived. A few weeks after the Gazette executive mused about shaking up the beat, Fisher shook up Montreal and the NHL by reporting Guy Lafleur would announce his retirement, the resounding Montreal sports scoop of the decade.
The story killed any talk of Fisher's fastball. Fisher, who vowed to keep working "until I get it right," had plenty of zip for another 28 years, during which he would win two more National Newspaper Awards and a career achievement award from Sports Media Canada. He was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.

Fisher worked until he was 85. He did not let go of anything lightly, whether it was his career or a feud with the Hockey Hall of Fame.
In 1985, he won the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for distinguished hockey writing given by the Hall, receiving a blazer that designated him as an Honoured Member. Almost two decades later, Bill Hay, then chairman of the Hall of Fame, essentially downgraded the writer and broadcaster categories; the winners of the Elmer Ferguson and Foster Hewitt Memorial Awards were to be considered "media honourees" and not members. Fisher, who had served on the Hall of Fame selection committee from 1985 through 2003, severed ties with the Hall. He requested his photograph in the media lounge at the Bell Centre, where it hung with other Hall-recognized media members, be removed. Fisher never made his peace with the Hall of Fame nor did he bother to camouflage his bitterness at the perceived slight.
"A travesty what Hay did to Red," Sather said.
Sather was one of Fisher's closest friends in hockey, perhaps the only man who could put anything over on him. His most famous prank involved research Fisher had done at the Canadian Pacific Railway museum in Montreal for Sather, who, with partners, had purchased Storm Mountain Lodge, built by the railway in 1922, near Banff. The amount of work and the recompense for the time always remained in dispute - in jest, Sather wondered what Fisher wanted for his efforts and Fisher, who collected western art, asked in all seriousness for an Indian painting - but the punch line was not. After various cheque-is-in-the-mail burlesques - Sather said the painting had been returned because of an incorrect address - the Edmonton Oilers general manager told Fisher he would present the painting at the draft in Montreal. Sather invited journalists and team officials to his hotel suite, gave a laudatory speech about his newspaper friend and then removed the black crepe from the picture on the easel in the room. There in a full headdress was an enlarged photograph of former NHL defenceman and Oilers scout Jim Neilson, who is half Cree, pretending to paint the side of house.
Voilà. An Indian, painting.
No one laughed louder and longer than Fisher.
Red Fisher leaves the press box at the Montreal Forum on Oct. 1, 1994. The game that was to be played that day was cancelled because of a lockout of NHL players.
In February 2016, the Professional Hockey Writers Association, of which Fisher was a founder, asked permission to name an annual award for beat writing in his honour. Fisher demurred. (He was at odds with the PHWA after it did not back him vigorously enough in his feud with the Hall of Fame.) After several minutes of arm-twisting from an intermediary, Fisher relented. "But," he said, "make sure you tell them I don't give a damn" - that's paraphrasing slightly - "one way or another."
Tillie, Fisher's wife of 69 years died on Jan. 9, 2018, at age 90.
Fisher is survived by children Ian and Cheryl, and grandson Ryan.
Funeral arrangements have yet to be confirmed.

Full text: SHERBROOKE - One of the most closely watched Canadian trials in recent years ended Friday with the acquittal of three former railway employees who were charged with criminal negligence causing the death of 47 people in the Lac-( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/lac-megantic ).
The jurors reached the verdict on their ninth day of deliberations.
Tom Harding, Richard Labrie and Jean Demaître were charged with criminal negligence in the 2013 tragedy that killed 47 people when a runaway train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded.
"Mr. Harding is too moved by the situation to give a coherent expression of what he feels inside," Thomas Walsh, one of his lawyers, told reporters after the verdicts were handed down.
"But I know he feels terribly relieved and terribly thankful to the system, the jury system, and this jury in particular."
Crown prosecutor Veronique Beauchamp said it is too early to say whether there will be an appeal.
"You'll understand it is not necessarily the decision we were expecting but we respect the verdicts that were handed down and, especially, the work the jurors put in," Beauchamp said.
Rail traffic controller Richard Labrie hugs Jean Clusiault, left, father of victim Kathy Clusiault, after being found not guilty on the ninth day of deliberations on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018, in Sherbrooke. The three former railway employees had been charged with criminal negligence causing the death of 47 people in the Lac-Mégantic tragedy.
"Criminal negligence causing death is one of the Criminal Code provisions that is difficult to prove."
Harding was the train's engineer, Labrie the traffic controller and Demaître the manager of train operations.
All three accused could have been found guilty of criminal negligence causing death, while jurors had the option of convicting Harding on one of two other charges: dangerous operation of railway equipment or dangerous operation of railway equipment causing death.
Walsh said the verdict was proof the institution of trial before jury is an important one in a democratic system.
He said he still believes the trial should never have taken place.
"I think it was more proper that there be some kind of a public inquiry to find out and determine all of the circumstances that led to this tragedy - and not just the role one or two people might have played," Walsh added.
He said Harding is still facing other accusations, which are coming up later this month.
"Those are the ones we always felt were more appropriate for the sitauation and those are the accusations of non-conformity with the rules, something we have always admitted."
The three men all pleaded not guilty to criminal negligence.
None of the three accused presented a defence at the trial, but lawyers for each told the jury in turn the Crown had failed to meet its burden of proof.
The prosecution mounted a case that the three were each criminally negligent in their own way for failing to ensure the train was safe before the wee hours of July 6, 2013.
Train engineer Thomas Harding leaves the courtroom after hearing the verdict on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018, in Sherbrooke.
That's when the locomotive and its cargo of crude oil from the United States rolled away and derailed in Lac-Mégantic, exploding and then killing 47 people as well as destroying part of the downtown core.
The Crown argued Harding's role was a significant one because he didn't apply a sufficient number of brakes after parking the oil-laden convoy for the night in nearby Nantes.
That left the locomotive, which weighed more than 10,000 tonnes, resting precariously on a slope 10 kilometres away from downtown Lac-Mégantic.
Harding applied only half the required level of brakes and didn't test them to ensure they worked properly before leaving for the night.
One of Harding's lawyers countered the rail disaster was an accident resulting from a perfect storm of unforeseeable events.
"We can't hold people criminally responsible for not being perfect," Charles Shearson told the court.
Shearson said Harding admitted to not conducting a proper brake test and failing to apply a sufficient number of handbrakes, which would have prevented the train from moving after its engine was shut off.
He suggested that evidence presented during the trial demonstrated MMA didn't require its employees to perform brake tests perfectly in line with the federal regulations.
And Harding could not have foreseen the locomotive would catch fire after he left for the night, the lawyer added. Firefighters extinguished a blaze at the lead locomotive shortly before the tragedy and cut the engine, which meant the air brakes were not functioning.
The prosecution also blamed Labrie and Demaître, arguing their responsibilities included taking the necessary steps to avoid injuries and loss of life the night before the derailment.
The prosecution claimed neither man deemed it necessary to check with Harding to see how many handbrakes had been applied and whether tests had been conducted.
Demaître's lawyer, Gaetan Bourassa, argued his client had no say in safety-related decisions made in the United States by the parent company of Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway.
Rail traffic controller Richard Labrie, right, manager of train operations Jean Demaître, left, and his wife, Danielle Champagne, return to the courtroom to hear the verdict on the ninth day of deliberations on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018, in Sherbrooke.
Labrie's lawyer, Guy Poupart, argued his client had a limited role in the tragedy. He also played up the testimony of several witnesses who described him as competent and reliable and someone they trusted.
As well, he noted a good portion of the Crown's case did not involve Labrie.
Earlier Friday, they had asked the judge for clarification( http://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/lac-megantic-jury-to-deliberate-today-for-ninth-consecutive-day/wcm/056de20a-e10a-4420-8cae-ca685c771f3b ) on the concept of "marked difference" - the comparison between the actions of the three accused and the actions of colleagues if they had faced the same circumstances.

Full text: With much of the snow already cleared, the city's most-populous borough was beginning to focus on how it will improve its snow-removal operation for the next major storm.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce trucks were barred this week from using( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-snow-clearing-delays-as-c-d-n-n-d-g-barred-from-dump-site ) one of the borough's three snow dumps, which it shares with LaSalle. The dump, located on Angrignon Blvd. near the Angrignon shopping mall, was apparently reaching its limit for snow. As a result, the city decreed it would only accept trucks from LaSalle, forcing C.D.N.-N.D.G. trucks to drive farther away to the St-Michel environmental complex, and they often get caught in traffic.
"Every minute that a truck is in transit is a minute that it can't pick up snow," said Snowdon city councillor Marvin Rotrand.
On Thursday afternoon, Marilyne Laroche Corbeil, a spokesperson for the central city, said the borough was once again permitted to dump snow at the Angrignon site. However, she said the situation changes day by day, so the trucks could be barred again on Friday or after future snow storms. She said that half of the borough's snow already cleared after the latest storm was sent to the Angrignon dump.
As of Thursday afternoon, the borough had cleared 70 per cent of its streets, but was still the slowest of the 18 boroughs reporting on the city's snow-removal website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ). The city-wide average was 88 per cent.
On Thursday, borough mayor Sue Montgomery said they are trying to find another place where snow can be dumped for future snowfalls, if the Angrignon dump is once again off limits.
However, Rotrand said the borough had an option to build a fourth snow dump on the borough's outskirts about four years ago, but it was nixed by then-mayor Denis Coderre.
"In the early 2000s, we used a site at the end of Royalmount Ave., but it was too small," Rotrand said.
The borough stopped using the site because the run-off from the snow was apparently contaminating an adjacent plot of land owned by CP Rail, according to Montgomery, a former journalist at the Montreal Gazette..
Rotrand contends, however, that the Tremblay administration had come up with a deal to purchase the adjacent lot from CP. The agreement had to be negotiated with the railway and the city of Côte-St-Luc, where the lot is located.
"The railway was OK with it, and Côte-St-Luc did not object, but Coderre decided not to buy the land," Rotrand said. "We have to look into this again. Provided CP still wants to sell the land, and provided that Côte-St-Luc is also game, it could be a good solution."
Montgomery said she would not comment about the plan by the previous administration.
Rotrand blames a centralization of city services for many of the borough's woes. Because all decisions have to go through the city's large bureaucracy, Rotrand said, there is little ability to make quick decisions that could improve the operation.
"While I am relatively confident central will come up with something, they are slow," Rotrand said. "We have a problem right now. We need a solution right now, not in three weeks."
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce district city councillor Peter McQueen also blamed the centralized system of snow clearing, and warned it could get worse before it gets better.
"Snow clearing is also a service that Coderre had started centralizing, so the borough will no longer launch its own contracts," McQueen wrote in a Facebook post( https://www.facebook.com/peter.mcqueen.14/posts/10156013633734603 ). "All will go through center city with uniform service requirements. This might be OK if service was levelled upwards and we started getting cleared as fast as the fastest current boroughs, but ... I have my doubts."
Some additional measures could be in place for the next snow storm, Montgomery said, including asking the private contractors doing snow removal in three-quarters of the borough to add dayshifts to their workload - they usually only clear snow at night.

Abstract: Normally, trucks in the western portion of the city collect snow during the day and night (because that's the only part of the borough where the city's own blue-collar workers clear the snow), and snow removal in the rest of the borough is done by private contractors who only work overnight.

Full text: Things are going from bad to worse for snow clearing in the city's most populous borough.
By Wednesday afternoon, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce had cleared the least amount of snow in the city after Saturday's snowfall of 36 centimetres( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ). Only 52 per cent of the snow was removed in the borough, compared with the city-wide average of 69 per cent, according to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ).
While broken-down trucks were to blame for last week's slow-removal operation, this week's delays are being blamed, in part, on a snow dump that has too much snow.
One of three sites used by the borough to deposit snow taken from its streets was closed to the borough.
Borough mayor Sue Montgomery said she was told Wednesday their trucks are no longer permitted to dump snow at the site near the Angrignon Mall in LaSalle because it is nearing its capacity for the season.
"We can't dump any snow there until it melts," said Montgomery, a former journalist at the Montreal Gazette.
She explained that the dump remains open to the borough of LaSalle because that is its only snow dump. The central city ordered C.D.N.-N.D.G. to avoid the Angrignon dump, Montgomery said.
The borough's trucks filled with snow have had to detour to the dump located in St-Michel, adding significant time to the trip. After leaving the St-Michel site on Tuesday night, the trucks got stuck in traffic because of a snow-removal operation on the Metropolitan Expressway, Montgomery said.
She said the detour and the traffic problems have significantly slowed down the borough's snow-clearing operations.
Some adjustments have been made.
Normally, trucks in the western portion of the city collect snow during the day and night (because that's the only part of the borough where the city's own blue-collar workers clear the snow), and snow removal in the rest of the borough is done by private contractors who only work overnight.
"From now until Saturday, (the private contractors) are going to be working during the day (as well), so hopefully they'll be all done by Saturday," Montgomery said.
She added that the amount of snow that has fallen in such a short period of time is unprecedented, so it is posing many challenges to the borough's crews.
According to Environment Canada's data, 69 centimetres of snow has already fallen( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-wild-winter-heightens-urge-to-hibernate ) this month, added to 61 centimetres that fell during the month of December for a total of 130 centimetres since the season began.
Montgomery is appealing to citizens to have patience with the process and to help each other out. She has reached out on Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/sue.montgomery.750/posts/10159540537740467 ) asking anyone with mobility issues who needs help shovelling their driveways or walkways to post on that site. She has also offered her own driveway to anyone with mobility issues who needs to get to the MUHC superhospital or the Queen Elizabeth Health Clinic near her home.
"I've offered to go out and shovel for people, and some others have, too," she said. "I'd like to start a neighbourhood brigade of volunteers for people who would step up and do that."
Residents of the city's most-populous borough complained last week( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) that Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was one of the slowest to clear snow after about 27 centimetres fell during the first 11 days of the year. The borough had not yet completed snow clearing when a storm overnight Friday into Saturday dumped 36 centimetres. Among the complaints were that snow clearing in front of schools seemed to lag behind some more minor streets, making it more difficult to drop off children at some schools.
Montgomery said she's working with the borough's team to figure out how to improve the snow- clearing operation after future storms.

Full text: As of Tuesday evening, Montreal had cleared nearly half the snow that's accumulated in the city since Saturday.
The city launched the season's fourth citywide snow removal operation on Sunday evening. As of 9 p.m. Tuesday, 49 per cent of Montreal streets had been cleared.
But some of the city's 19 boroughs remained well below the city-wide average.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the city's largest borough, had cleared only 32 per cent of its streets. Ahuntsic-Cartierville also fell below the average, at 39 per cent.
St-Léonard led all boroughs with 69 per cent of its streets cleared, with Anjou trailing closely behind with 66 per cent.
The city has said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because crews had not finished removing snow from the previous storm in some boroughs.
A smog warning issued by Environment Canada early Tuesday remained in effect come the end of the day, saying air quality would be low until at least midday Wednesday. It urged people to leave their cars at home, or at least to drive more slowly and not idle unnecessarily.
It's also important to limit the use of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces - in Montreal, it's illegal to use your fireplace during a smog warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/oct-1-wood-burning-deadline-turns-up-the-heat-on-montreals-fireplace-owners ).

Abstract: On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common? "According to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe model, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in the Charlevoix seismic zone near Quebec City could cause private residential property losses of up to $10.6 billion," noted the institute, which does research for the insurance industry. The terrifying 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), which examined the devastating scenarios for the Pacific Northwest if the precarious Cascadia Subduction Zone gives way, helped raise awareness among ordinary citizens about their own readiness levels( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes ).

Full text: Thirty-eight minutes of panic( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/01/13/being-a-mother-in-hawaii-during-38-minutes-of-nuclear-threat-terror/?utm_term=.c342edf3cbd9 ) gripped the tropical paradise of Hawaii Saturday morning when emergency management authorities accidentally triggered an erroneous alert that ballistic missiles were racing toward the archipelago.
Terror has since turned to outrage over the false alarm among residents who legitimately feared their lives were ending. It has cast serious doubt on the credibility of the state's emergency systems. Authorities certainly owe Hawaiians some explanations - and perhaps an apology.
But one thing this fiasco should do, no matter where we live, is cause us to ask: Am I ready if disaster strikes?
The nuclear threat level hasn't been this high since the Cold War era, thanks to the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un. However the fallout from a nuke attack is only one kind of emergency we ought to be prepared for. From earthquakes to ice storms, floods to blizzards, major blackouts to toxic spills, too few of us have the necessary supplies, let alone the knowledge, to react in the case of even a minor crisis.
I include myself in this category. I arrived home with my children on Friday evening to a run-of-the-mill power outage. This incident was more inconvenient than urgent, but we were still bumbling around in the dark using my iPhone to locate candles, matches and a real flashlight.
On the 20th anniversary of the Ice Storm, which at its height plunged half of Quebec into cold and darkness for days, how many of us have survival kits handy to weather a similar power failure in the middle of winter, even though climatologists warn freezing rain( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ) is becoming more common?
How many of us have emergency provisions in our car should a vicious storm leave us stranded, like the one last March that trapped hundreds of motorists on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-happened-on-highway-13-during-the-montreal-snowstorm ) for hours overnight?
How quickly our memories fade. How swiftly cautionary tales are forgotten. We are predisposed to think the next major hurricane, tsunami, mudslide or wildfire will happen to others, never to ourselves.
But potential apocalypse lurks high and low. Garnering many fewer headlines than the Hawaii mayhem - but deserving no less of our attention here in Montreal - is a report issued last week by the Swiss Re Institute on the earthquake threat in Quebec.
The report, Earthquake Risk in Eastern Canada: Mind the Shakes,( http://institute.swissre.com/research/overview/expertise_publication/earthquake_risk_in_eastern_canada_mind_the_shakes.html ) found that though the fault line in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec City corridor is one of the most seismically sensitive in the country, we are woefully unaware - and unprepared. Only a tiny fraction - just 3.4 per cent - are properly insured for a tremor despite the fact 70 per cent of Quebec's population resides in this zone.
"According to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe model, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in the Charlevoix seismic zone near Quebec City could cause private residential property losses of up to $10.6 billion," noted the institute, which does research for the insurance industry. "And a repeat today of the magnitude 5.8 earthquake in the city of Montreal in 1732 would lead to even higher losses, estimated at $45 billion."
These findings echo an earlier, equally alarming, study by the Insurance Bureau of Canada( http://www.ibc.ca/ns/resources/studies/air-study ) in 2013 that estimated the total losses from a 7.1 magnitude quake in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec area at a staggering $61 billion. The IBC report pegged the probability of a major convulsion along the eastern Canadian fault line at 5 to 15 per cent in the next 50 years.( http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/EQ_brochure_EN-at-a-glance.pdf )
If so few of us are insured, it stands to reason nowhere near enough of us have taken precautions to increase our chances of surviving the big one.
Do you know the safest place to take cover if the ground starts shaking? How many days' worth of water and food do you have stockpiled? Do you have a manual can-opener or flashlight close at hand? Do you have a prearranged rendezvous point to meet up with your loved ones if you are apart when the earth rattles?
The Quebec public security department( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters.html ) provides tips on what to do in the event of all sorts of situations, including earthquakes.( https://www.securitepublique.gouv.qc.ca/en/civil-protection/preparing-for-disasters/disasters/earthquake.html ) While it's not the role of authorities to stoke unnecessary alarm about impending disaster, surely civil security could do more to urge Quebecers to take stock of their advice ahead of time.
The terrifying 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one ), which examined the devastating scenarios for the Pacific Northwest if the precarious Cascadia Subduction Zone gives way, helped raise awareness among ordinary citizens about their own readiness levels( https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes ).
Perhaps a scare like the one inflicted on Hawaiians, heart-stopping and inexcusable though it was, will have a silver lining. Though the state has been testing air raid sirens recently, many people realized in the throes of the chaos they had no clue what steps to take( https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/selfdecon_wash.asp ) in the event of a missile strike.
Let this be a wake-up call to all of us: expect the unexpected and prepare for the worst - now, before it's too late.

Abstract: After launching the season's fourth citywide snow removal operation on Sunday evening, Montreal officials reported Monday night that 25 per cent of the 36 centimetres of snow that fell on the city since Saturday had been cleared. City officials are reminding motorists and pedestrians to keep a safe distance between themselves and the fleet of snow-removal trucks and other vehicles used in the clearing of 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.

Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the largest borough in the city, stood at 16 per cent at 9:30 p.m., and in downtown Ville-Marie, 20 per cent of streets were cleared. However some other boroughs - because of a larger residential population or less traffic - were appearing to more than outstrip( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ) the citywide average.
St-Laurent reported it had completed 42 per cent of streets, while St-Léonard had a 37-per-cent completion rate.
Some of the city's 19 boroughs reported below average results, with Ahuntsic-Cartierville at 18 per cent and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at only seven per cent.
The city has said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because crews had not finished removing snow from the previous storm in some boroughs.
City officials are reminding motorists and pedestrians to keep a safe distance between themselves and the fleet of snow-removal trucks and other vehicles used in the clearing of 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.

Full text: Several hours after launching the season's fourth citywide snow removal operation on Sunday evening, Montreal officials reported Monday that 17 per cent of the 36 centimetres of snow that fell on the city since Saturday had been cleared.
Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the largest borough in the city, stood at 13 per cent just after noon, and in downtown Ville-Marie, 15 per cent of streets were cleared. However some other boroughs - because of a larger residential population or less traffic - were appearing to more than outstrip( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ) the the citywide average.
Saint-Laurent reported they had completed 33 per cent of streets, while Outremont had a 30-per-cent completion rate.
However, seven of the city's 19 boroughs reported below average results thus far, with Lachine and LaSalle (11 per cent) and Montreal North and Pierrefonds-Roxboro (6 per cent) at the bottom of the standings.
The city has said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because in some boroughs, crews had not finished removing snow from the previous storm.
And city officials are reminding motorists and pedestrians to keep a safe distance between themselves and the fleet of snow-removal trucks and other vehicles used in the clearing of 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.
N.D.G. resident Alison Neill pushes the stroller carrying hers seven-month old daughter, Violet, over the uncleared snowbanks on Regent Ave. near Sherbrooke St., on Thursday.
Meanwhile, as Montrealers start their workweek with a morning rush hour temperature of minus 23 Celsius coupled with a windchill factor of minus 34, they had to contend with a smog warning till just after noon.
Environment Canada issued to the warning for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and Châteauguay at 4:30 a.m. Monday, warning that the "levels of air pollutants will be high this morning."

Allison Hanes: Winter has declared open season on city dwellers

Abstract: By Thursday,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ) however, winter at its best had morphed into winter at its most wicked, with freezing rain turning sidewalks treacherously slick before the ice melted into yucky brown sludge. Friday night into Saturday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) night, winter returned with a vengeance. If I lug the little one to daycare on a sled because the sidewalks are impassable for a stroller in the morning, will there be enough snow left to drag her home again later?

Full text: Don't get me wrong: I love winter. I really do.
I love swishing down the slopes, skating on frozen lakes and tobogganing on Mount Royal. I love catching snowflakes on my tongue and making snow angels, then curling up next to a roaring fire with hot chocolate while a storm rages outside.
I love winter so much my wedding was held in the dead of February. By choice.
But the grimmer parts of winter also get me down sometimes, no matter how hard I try to grin and bear it: waking and returning home in the dark; digging cars out of snowbanks; having to dress small children in multiple layers several times every day.
The last few weeks of wild weather( http://montrealgazette.com/gallery/gallery-wild-weather-grips-montreal ) have made this winter especially difficult to enjoy. From bomb cyclones to polar vortexes, Mother Nature has been throwing everything in her arsenal at us - and the hyperbolic names the meteorologists give to these phenomena only feed our anxieties. Then the headlines stoke our memories of natural disasters past. Has it really been 20 years since the Ice Storm?( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-storm-98-relived )
The last week alone has been enough to induce whiplash.
A week ago we woke up to freshly falling snow, turning Montreal into a winter wonderland.
By Thursday,( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-beware-of-things-falling-from-the-sky-including-rain ) however, winter at its best had morphed into winter at its most wicked, with freezing rain turning sidewalks treacherously slick before the ice melted into yucky brown sludge. Corner snowbanks receded into glacial puddles that flooded intersections.
Julian Gammom, front, and Nicholas Hurtubise have a long way to go to free their car from the snowbank on de Maisonneuve Blvd. near Girouard Ave. on Sunday.
By Friday, it was 8 C and raining, as if a mercurial artist decided to erase an unsatisfactory canvas. Montreal was at its ugliest and greyest, a lunar landscape of dirty, shrunken icebergs.
Friday night into Saturday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ) night, winter returned with a vengeance. Rain turned to freezing rain then to snow. We woke up to a blizzard that dumped a total of 36 cms on the city( http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=51157 ) while the thermometer plummeted to sub-zero.
A bit of déjà vu, perhaps? Or a Bill Murray-esque Groundhog Day?
Feel sorry for the snowplow drivers. No sooner had they wrapped up one operation from last week's precipitation, than they had to start all over again. The tractor that finally arrived Friday morning to scrape the last bits of crust off my street was like a study in futility knowing what was coming.
Urgences Santé practically begged Montrealers to stay home over the weekend. You could almost hear the pleading tone of the statement the paramedics issued on the eve of this latest storm.
Personally, I was only too happy to oblige. At least the timing of this lashing allowed many of us to hunker down and watch the nastiness from indoors.
It offered a delicious moment of hygge, the difficult-to-translate Danish concept of "cozy and comfortable conviviality."( https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy )Known as one of the world's happiest societies, the Danes somehow manage to ward off seasonal affective disorder, a.k.a. the winter blues, with saunas and glogg. Denmark, a Nordic country much like our own, seems to accomplish this by embracing winter's small pleasures head-on.
But I've recently come to the conclusion that there are two preconditions for enjoying winter: being in the country and/or on the weekend.
In the country, you can get outside in the crisp fresh air without having to worry about whether your sidewalk is plowed or where your car is buried or whether the bus will slide down a hill.
Of course, Montreal affords many opportunities for winter fun: I applaud those Verdun parents who built their kids an ice rink in their front yard. I love to see cross-country skiers gliding through parks. Tobogganing on Mount Royal is a blast. But all of that's easier to do on a Saturday.
During the week, winter in the city is hell.
On a Monday morning like this one, I feel exhausted before even leaving the house. Am I going to need an umbrella today or snowshoes? If I lug the little one to daycare on a sled because the sidewalks are impassable for a stroller in the morning, will there be enough snow left to drag her home again later? Will I have to shovel the front stairs again when I get home?
It's only the middle of January and already I'm worn down.
Perhaps the solution is to find ways to bring the fun of winter weekends into workaday life. Why not an urban snow trail, so the hardiest among us can ski or snowshoe to work? Why not turn a street into an ice rink so we can skate around town? It's sometimes slippery enough, anyway. How about building a snowmobile highway leading to the heart of the city?
It's either make winter fun on a day-to-day basis or take our cues from the bears and simply curl up in a ball until spring.

Full text: A little over 12 hours after launching the season's fourth citywide snow removal operation on Sunday evening, Montreal officials reported Monday morning that 16 per cent of the 36 centimetres of snow that fell on the city since Saturday had been cleared.
That citywide average was echoed in borough level reports from Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (the largest borough in the city) at 13 per cent, and in downtown Ville-Marie, at 14 per cent. However some other boroughs - because of a larger residential population or less traffic - were appearing to more than outstrip the the citywide average.
Outremont reported a 30-per-cent completion rate while Saint-Léonard claimed 27 per cent by midmorning.
However, seven of the city's 19 boroughs reported below average results thus far, with Lachine (9 per cent), Verdun (7 per cent) and Montreal North (3 per cent) at the bottom of the standings.
The city has said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because in some boroughs, crews had not finished removing snow from the previous storm.
And city officials are reminding motorists and pedestrians to keep a safe distance between themselves and the fleet of snow-removal trucks and other vehicles used in the clearing of 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.

Abstract: Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after heavy snowfalls, which can block exhaust pipes and pull the odourless gas back into a car. After a large snowfall, the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death.

Full text: Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after heavy snowfalls, which can block exhaust pipes and pull the odourless gas back into a car.
That warning was issued by the Montreal Children's Hospital this weekend in the wake of another heavy snowstorm in Quebec( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ).
Hospital officials noted that no children have died of carbon monoxide this season. Nonetheless, administrators want parents to be aware of their list of safety tips.
First, never leave a child alone in an idling car, hospital officials said.
Lorraine Brooke tries to clear the snow away from her car on St-Antoine St. W. near Laporte Ave. in Montreal on Saturday, January 13, 2018.
Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked. After a large snowfall, the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death.
The hospital also cautions never leave your car running inside the garage even if the garage door is open.
Signs to watch for include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
More serious exposure can result in fainting, convulsions, coma and even death.

Abstract: After a nasty winter storm dumped 36 centimetres of snow on the Montreal region, snow removal crews were to be back at work on Sunday night cleaning up the mess. "In order for the snow removal operation to be done safely, we are asking people to be careful around snow removal vehicles," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal. With the heavy snow fall across Quebec, the Montreal Children's Hospital put out a warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/how-to-avoid-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-a-heavy-snowfall ) reminding motorists to make sure their exhaust pipes are not blocked while they are clearing snow from their vehicles.

Full text: After a nasty winter storm dumped 36 centimetres of snow on the Montreal region, snow removal crews were to be back at work on Sunday night cleaning up the mess.
The city said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because in some boroughs, crews had not yet finished removing snow from the previous storm. It is the fourth snow removal operation this winter.
City officials reminded citizens to stay far away from snow removal trucks and other vehicles used in the operation, which will see snow removed from 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.
"In order for the snow removal operation to be done safely, we are asking people to be careful around snow removal vehicles," said Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of snow removal.
He also asked motorists to respect the No Parking signs, so fewer cars have to be towed away, which slows down snow removal operations.
You can keep track of snow removal operations on the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ) or mobile application.
The Montreal region received even more snow than expected on Saturday - 36 centimetres of snow at Trudeau airport - and travel was difficult over the weekend because of snowy and slippery roads. Visibility was reduced throughout Saturday morning, when snow fell at a rate of four to six centimetres an hour, according to meteorologist Julie Deshaies.

Four-year-old Naima Biunno makes it safely across Queen Mary Rd., behind her mother, Maro Adjemian, as they undertake some cross-country skiing around their neighbourhood on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018. While Montreal-area residents were digging out cars and shovelling driveways over the weekend, residents in some parts of the province were forced from their homes after rivers began overflowing following heavy rain and a thaw at the end of last week. In Beauport, near Quebec City, about 42 millimetres of rain had fallen, causing the Montmorency River to overflow.
People near Sherbrooke, Quebec City and in Bécancour reported flooding in their basements and several people had to be rescued by firefighters using boats.
With the heavy snow fall across Quebec, the Montreal Children's Hospital put out a warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/how-to-avoid-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-a-heavy-snowfall ) reminding motorists to make sure their exhaust pipes are not blocked while they are clearing snow from their vehicles.
Blocked exhaust pipes can pull carbon monoxide back into the car, causing poisoning in children who might be in the car while it's idling.
Hospital officials noted that no children have died of carbon monoxide this season. Nonetheless, administrators want parents to be aware of their list of safety tips. First, never leave a child alone in an idling car. Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked.
Cars should not be left running inside the garage even if the garage door is open. Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. More serious exposure can result in fainting, convulsions, coma and even death.

Abstract: Greater Montreal received even more snow than expected - 36 centimetres of snow at Pierre Trudeau Airport - by the time Environment Canada ended its winter storm warning for the Montreal region at 1 p.m. Travel was difficult because of snowy, slippery roads and reduced visibility throughout the morning, when snow fell at a rate of four to six centimeters an hour, according to meteorologist Julie Deshaies. The Sûreté du Quebec and Urgences Santé are urging people to stay home and off the roads during bad weather that is expected to freeze up after rain and 30 centimetres of snow. In a tweet( https://twitter.com/MTL_Ville/status/952249829450768384 ), the city of Montreal said it was temporarily suspending snow removal to focus on clearing streets.

Full text: After the storm, the cold.
Following the snowstorm that blanketed the Montreal region Saturday morning, temperatures will dive during the afternoon, falling to minus-14 - with a wind chill of minus-23 - by 5 p.m.
By Sunday at 7 a.m., the thermometer will drop to minus-23 - with a wind chill of minus-31 . Expect sunny skies with a high of minus-18 tomorrow.
Greater Montreal received even more snow than expected - 36 centimetres of snow at Pierre Trudeau Airport - by the time Environment Canada ended its winter storm warning for the Montreal region at 1 p.m.
Travel was difficult because of snowy, slippery roads and reduced visibility throughout the morning, when snow fell at a rate of four to six centimeters an hour, according to meteorologist Julie Deshaies.
Greater Montreal bore the brunt of the storm until about 1 p.m. The snow is expected to continue to fall until late afternoon in the Mauricie, Centre-du-Québec and Quebec City regions. In the Lower St. Lawrence and Côte-Nord regions, it will end around supper time, according to Environment Canada.
Once the snowstorm has passed, you will need to dress warmly. Environment Canada is preparing to issue an extreme cold warning for several regions, including the Laurentians. Cold warnings are issued when the temperature drops below minus-38 degrees including the wind chill.
People try to get car stuck out of snowbank on the service road alongside eastbound Highway 40 near Highway 13 on Saturday morning, Jan. 13, 2018. The Sûreté du Quebec and Urgences Santé are urging people to stay home and off the roads during bad weather that is expected to freeze up after rain and 30 centimetres of snow.
Urgences-Santé is "strongly recommending" that residents of Montreal and Laval stay home this weekend.
Despite that recommendation, paramedics have been very busy since Friday night: more than 200 calls were made to 911 between midnight and 6am Saturday morning - double the normal amount.
Urgences-Santé reminded the public to contact Info-Santé at 811 regarding non-urgent health problems rather than calling 911.
And if you do call an ambulance, you should spread abrasives on slippery surfaces like steps and paths leading to your home, if possible.
In a tweet( https://twitter.com/MTL_Ville/status/952249829450768384 ), the city of Montreal said it was temporarily suspending snow removal to focus on clearing streets.
City buses were way behind schedule in many cases on Saturday morning.
At Trudeau Airport, dozens of arrivals and departures were delayed. Check the Aéroport de Montréal website( http://www.admtl.com/ ) for flight status.
Blowing snow reduced visibility on several sections of Highways 20, 40 and 10. In the Montmagny section of Highway 20 east of Quebec City, visibility was nil.
A number of cars have slid off roads since Friday night, according to the Sûreté du Québec. No serious injuries have been reported.
The SQ called on drivers to exercise caution and has extra officers on hand during the storm.
N.D.G. was still not 100 per cent cleared of snowfall from Monday, Jan. 8, 2018 when this weekend snow began. Here, resident Treena Dickson navigates Wilson St. near Côte-St-Antoine on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018.

Abstract: The notice informed students of a meeting held Friday afternoon by members of the administration - including Kate Sterns, coordinator of the Creative Writing program, Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy and Dean of Students Andrew Woodall - to inform students in the Creative Writing program "of remedial actions the university has decided to take, as well as to respond to questions." The notice also warned students that faculty members have a potential conflict of interest and recommended students not treat the meeting as a forum to share experiences, but rather as an opportunity to demand change.

It seems winter is testing us. And maybe even testing our emergency preparedness, with warnings from the SQ, Urgences Santé and others advising us to just stay home. After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days. Environment Canada updated a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 30 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday. "Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions," the statement continued, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Concordia students 'appalled' sexual misconduct allowed to go on so long( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/concordia-student-association-appalled-that-sexual-misconduct-was-allowed )
Concordia University has reassigned courses that were to be taught this term by professors who have been the subjects of recent high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct while those allegations are being investigated, according to a notice sent to students in the English department by their student association. "We are deeply upset and appalled that this university has allowed sexual misconduct to harm students for so long in what should have been a safe and professional environment," says the notice, signed by the executive of the Concordia Association for Students in English (CASE). The notice informed students of a meeting held Friday afternoon by members of the administration - including Kate Sterns, coordinator of the Creative Writing program, Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy and Dean of Students Andrew Woodall - to inform students in the Creative Writing program "of remedial actions the university has decided to take, as well as to respond to questions." The notice also warned students that faculty members have a potential conflict of interest and recommended students not treat the meeting as a forum to share experiences, but rather as an opportunity to demand change.

Montreal was ill-prepared for spring flooding, city report shows( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-was-ill-prepared-for-spring-flooding-city-report-shows )
Outdated flood maps. Emergency vehicles sidelined because they had low floors. No inventory of city equipment and materials. Not enough inspectors to check flooded homes. A 911 system inundated with calls because the city help line went down for four hours. A city report shows Montreal was ill-prepared for disaster in the spring of 2017, when the island suffered its worst flooding in 40 years. The document, obtained by the Montreal Gazette, is to be made public next week. The 55-page report, by the Montreal fire department's civil-security unit, reviewed the city's response and includes recommendations on how to improve emergency readiness. The flooding began in early May when the previous winter's heavier-than-usual snowfall started melting due to warm weather and heavy rain, raising water levels around Montreal and other parts of Quebec. Then-Mayor Denis Coderre declared a state of emergency on May 7, the same day 300 members of the Canadian Armed Forces arrived to help with flood relief. Over several days, more than 430 homes were evacuated in boroughs and suburbs on Montreal Island's north shore, along the Rivière des Prairies.
Quebec gangster can leave halfway house, return home to Trois-Rivières( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-gangster-can-leave-halfway-house-return-home-to-trois-rivieres )
One of Quebec's most notorious gangsters has succeeded in his efforts( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/timeline-raymond-desfosses-long-road-to-conditional-release-he-violated ) to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months. "I am chained like a dog to a halfway house. So if someone wanted to kill me it is very easy for them to find me," Raymond Desfossés, 67, said during a hearing Friday morning at a federal penitentiary in Laval. Desfossés was addressing a question put to him by Michel Lafrenière, the parole board member who presided over his hearing, as to how he would handle the possibility of someone seeking revenge for the crimes that led to his 18-year prison term. Lafrenière said it is the kind of stressful situation that could prompt a career criminal, like Desfossés, to use violence to protect himself. Such a situation could put public safety in jeopardy, Lafrenière said. He has good reason to be concerned because part of his sentence involves how he hired Gerald Gallant, 67, a hit man, to kill six of his rivals( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/former-hit-man-tied-to-west- end -gang-prepares-for-parole ) between 1980 and 2001. While he was initially charged with six counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder, he was able to plead guilty to taking part in a general conspiracy to commit murder. On Feb. 20, 2014, his sentence for the conspiracy was combined to one he was already serving and turned into an 18-year prison term.
Raymond Desfossés was successful on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018, in his bid to have the Parole Board of Canada lift a condition that required him to reside at a halfway house for the past six months.

Abstract: The places, mostly in the private sector, will allow emergency rooms to clear short-term beds for patients who have already been seen by a doctor but are still there because of a lack of room elsewhere at the hospital. The African group of ambassadors to the United Nations has issued an extraordinary statement condemning the "outrageous, racist and xenophobic remarks" by President Donald Trump and demanding a retraction and apology.

To get through flu season, Quebec is spending $23.25 million to open 350 additional beds in Montreal and on the North and South Shores( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/barrette-pays-premium-to-add-more-beds-for-quebecs-flu-season ). Health Minister Gaétan Barrette announced the measure on Friday. The places, mostly in the private sector, will allow emergency rooms to clear short-term beds for patients who have already been seen by a doctor but are still there because of a lack of room elsewhere at the hospital. The new spots will accept patients who need care that's less intensive than that offered in a hospital.
Montreal has been blanketed by yet another winter storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ). It snowed overnight and with snowfall expected to continue into the afternoon the accumulation could end up in the range of 20 to 30 centimetres. Urgences-Santé is "strongly recommending" that residents of Montreal and Laval stay home this weekend. Reduced visibility has been reported on several sections of highways 20, 40 and 10. The SQ reports that a number of cars slipped off roads overnight, but no serious injuries were reported.
The African group of ambassadors to the United Nations has issued an extraordinary statement condemning the "outrageous, racist and xenophobic remarks" by President Donald Trump and demanding a retraction and apology. The African ambassadors issued the statement late Friday following an emergency meeting after Trump used vulgar language to reject an immigration bill, asking why the U.S. would take in more people from Haiti and "shithole countries" in Africa. Trump has denied using that language but others present say he did. The new statement expresses concern over the Trump administration's apparent increasing denigration of Africa "and people of colour."
Whoa. I've never seen a statement like this by African countries directed at the United States. After an emergency mtng today @UN( https://twitter.com/UN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ), Africa group says it "is extremely appalled at...outrageous & xenophobic remarks" attributed to Trump & "demands a retraction and an apology." pic.twitter.com/5KkdwppUzL( https://t.co/5KkdwppUzL )

Here's an unusual way to fight off the cold. A British butcher who got locked in a freezer says he was saved by a frozen sausage that he used as a battering ram. Chris McCabe says he became trapped in the walk-in freezer at his shop in Totnes, southwest England, when wind blew the door shut. The safety button to open the door had frozen in the -20 chill. McCabe said he tried unsuccessfully to kick the button free before picking up a 1.5 kilogram (3.3 pound) black pudding, a form of blood sausage. He whacked the button with the sausage until it came unstuck. The grateful butcher told the Daily Mirror: "Black pudding saved my life, without a doubt."

Abstract: Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation. The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.

After a respite from winter on Thursday and Friday, the national forecaster is warning weather conditions will get worse in the Montreal area over the next few days.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Urgences-santé is urging( https://twitter.com/Urgences_sante/status/951902526273712130 ) people in the Montreal area to stay at home.
"With the fluctuation in temperature, and the winter storm alert that was issued by Environment Canada, Urgences-santé is asking people in Laval and Montreal to not leave their homes, if possible," the agency said Friday. "For those who must go outside, we ask you to be very careful, because the meteorological conditions that have been forecast usually lead to numerous accidents and calls to 911."
The Sûreté du Québec is also on the case( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/951907738854084608 ): "If you must be on the roads this weekend, redouble your vigilance," the SQ tweeted.
While the temperature in Montreal was 10 Celsius at 3 p.m., temperatures will take a steep downturn later Friday afternoon. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-17, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-16. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures around minus-10.
Meanwhile, Montreal streets were 87 per cent cleared of last week's snowstorm as of 3 p.m.( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/elimination-neige ) Friday. The Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough still lagged, with a 67-per-cent completion rate. Thursday's champion( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/n-d-g-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-snow-clearing-heap-st-leonard-on-top ) Saint-Léonard had completely cleared its streets and several other boroughs were either finished or nearly finished by 3 p.m. Friday was an off day for workers, so there were fewer plows and snow-removal trucks on the streets.

City asks for patience as we brace for more cold, freezing rain

Abstract: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rush-hour-slightly-less-arduous-as-snow-clearing-operations-continue ) who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow. According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The warmer temperatures were expected to cause river levels to rise with a buildup of frazil ice (crystals) causing flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laval-monitoring-river-levels-as-frazil-ice-forms-on-waterways ) for some residents along the Rivière des Prairies in Laval and Terrebonne.

We've gone from deep freeze, to seasonal norms, to unseasonably warm weather and are now bracing for freezing rain, rain, a snowstorm, and then back to the deep freeze. The coming weather even led to Air Canada issuing a travel warning and to waive the usual fees for anyone wishing to change their travel plans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 14.

If the winter were a children's toy, it would be a yo-yo, as Montrealers have dealt with extremes during the first three weeks of winter.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rush-hour-slightly-less-arduous-as-snow-clearing-operations-continue ) who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow.
"We're improving our services and it shows," Plante said at the webcast of the executive committee meeting Monday morning, after saying that the city received 1,600 fewer complaints than it did at this point of the season last year.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the city reported it had completed 42 per cent of the snow removal operation. According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The boroughs with the least amount of snow cleared were Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at 30 per cent.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sue Montgomery, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough mayor, acknowledged the slow pace of snow clearing in her borough. In a Facebook post she said she understands residents' frustration and asks for their patience.
"What I'm told is that the equipment was set to pick up the piles of snow on Monday but then had to be dispatched to plow snow because of the snowfall that day. And I'm told it's bad everywhere in Montreal," she wrote. "Believe me, I'm watching and asking so we can get it right."
The snowbanks will become crustier and heavier in the coming days, as freezing rain is expected to start falling around dinnertime.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )at 11 a.m.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay and La Prairie areas, saying roads and sidewalks could become slippery as temperatures warm up to 6 C on Thursday and Friday. Temperatures will dip back down near the freezing mark on Saturday and the rain will change to snow. About 15 centimetres of snow is expected before temperatures plummet to a high of -14 C on Sunday.
The warmer temperatures were expected to cause river levels to rise with a buildup of frazil ice (crystals) causing flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laval-monitoring-river-levels-as-frazil-ice-forms-on-waterways ) for some residents along the Rivière des Prairies in Laval and Terrebonne.

According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The boroughs with the least amount of snow cleared were Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at 30 per cent.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sue Montgomery, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough mayor, acknowledged the slow pace of snow clearing in her borough. In a Facebook post she said she understands residents' frustration and asks for their patience.
"What I'm told is that the equipment was set to pick up the piles of snow on Monday but then had to be dispatched to plow snow because of the snowfall that day. And I'm told it's bad everywhere in Montreal," she wrote. "Believe me, I'm watching and asking so we can get it right."
The snowbanks will become crustier and heavier in the coming days, as freezing rain is expected to start falling around dinnertime.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )at 11 a.m.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay and La Prairie areas, saying roads and sidewalks could become slippery as temperatures warm up to 6 C on Thursday and Friday. Temperatures will dip back down near the freezing mark on Saturday and the rain will change to snow. About 15 centimetres of snow is expected before temperatures plummet to a high of -14 C on Sunday.
The warmer temperatures were expected to cause river levels to rise with a buildup of frazil ice (crystals) causing flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laval-monitoring-river-levels-as-frazil-ice-forms-on-waterways ) for some residents along the Rivière des Prairies in Laval and Terrebonne.

Abstract: Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rush-hour-slightly-less-arduous-as-snow-clearing-operations-continue ) who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow. According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was St-Léonard where more than half the roads had been cleared.

Full text: If the persistent snow banks didn't make getting around hard enough, freezing rain will be added to the mix on Wednesday and Thursday.
We've gone from deep freeze, to seasonal norms, and then unseasonably warm weather.
Next up is freezing rain, rain, a snowstorm, and then back to the deep freeze.
If the winter were a children's toy, it would be a yo-yo, as Montrealers have dealt with extremes during the first three weeks of winter.

Abstract: Michael Del Zotto #4 of the Vancouver Canucks scores a third period goal on goaltender Carey Price #31 of the Montreal Canadiens during the NHL game at the Bell Centre on January 7, 2018 in Montreal. Mete is home in Ontario after helping Canada win the gold medal at the world junior championship. Montreal will be at home to the Islanders, hit the road for games in Boson and Washington and return to the Bell Centre for another game against the Bruins on Jan. 20. phickey@postmedia.com( mailto:phickey@postmedia.com ) twitter.com/zababes1( http://twitter.com/zababes1 ) CREDIT:

Full text: The bottom line: Brendan Gallagher's 16th goal of the season snapped a 2-2 tie and propelled the Canadiens to a 5-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday night at the Bell Centre. Gallagher cashed in on the rebound of Karl Alzner's shot from the point at 8:44 of the third period. It was the second point of the night for Alzner, who opened the scoring with his first goal as a Canadien. Gallagher also assisted as Paul Byron added an insurance goal with 1:15 to play and Max Pacioretty added an empty-netter with 58.1 seconds remaining. The win left the Canadiens six points out of the final wild-card spot, but there are five teams ahead of them in the battle for that berth.
Canadiens' Karl Alzner, right, celebrates with teammate Brendan Gallagher after scoring against the Canucks in Montreal on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018.
Alzner breaks the ice: Alzner scored an unassisted goal to give the Canadiens a 1-0 lead at 9:38 of the second period. Alzner picked up a loose puck in the Montreal zone and unloaded with a shot from the point. Canucks goaltender Anders Nilsson may have been distracted by Gallagher, who was crashing the net looking for a rebound that never materialized. The Canadiens failed to capitalize on two breakaways in the first period. On the first, Pacioretty was unable to control a rolling puck and had to settle for a weak shot. Byron had a shorthanded breakaway later in the period, but his shot was high and wide.
Canadiens' Alex Galchenyuk battles for position against Canucks' Erik Gudbranson near goaltender Anders Nilsson at the Bell Centre on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018.
Galchenyuk supplies power: Alex Galchenyuk gave Montreal a 2-0 lead when he scored a power-play goal at 2:12 of the second period. Jeff Petry set up Galchenyuk for a one-timer from the right wall. It was Galchenyuk's 10th goal of the season and his fifth on the power play. Jonathan Drouin was awarded the second assist on the goal and has two assists in his last 12 games. The Canucks cut the Montreal lead to 2-1 when Daniel Sedin deflected Alexander Edler's shot from the point at 13:04 of the second period. It was Sedin's ninth goal of the season and his twin brother, Henrik, had the other assist on the goal.
Michael Del Zotto #4 of the Vancouver Canucks scores a third period goal on goaltender Carey Price #31 of the Montreal Canadiens during the NHL game at the Bell Centre on January 7, 2018 in Montreal.
Canucks come back: Vancouver completed the comeback to tie the score at 2-2 when Michael Del Zotto took a pass from rookie scoring leader Brock Boeser and beat Carey Price at 2:43 of the third period. The Canucks were presented with an odd-man rush when Drouin lost the puck deep in the Vancouver zone.
Carr scratched again: On a points-per-game basis, Daniel Carr is the Canadiens' leading scorer with 10 points in 14 games, but he was a healthy scratch for the second consecutive game. Byron Froese and Victor Mete were also scratched. Mete is home in Ontario after helping Canada win the gold medal at the world junior championship. General manager Marc Bergevin said Sunday that Mete would probably finish the season with the Canadiens. Defenceman Alex Biega, a Harvard grad from the West Island, was among the Vancouver scratches.
Canucks goaltender Anders Nilsson holds off Canadiens' Andrew Shaw in Montrea on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018.
Calm before the storm: The Canadiens are heading into their so-called bye week, which means they'll be off the ice until 4 p.m. Friday when they will gather for a practice in Brossard. The rest will be welcome because the Canadiens will play the Boston Bruins on Saturday in the first of five games over eight nights. Montreal will be at home to the Islanders, hit the road for games in Boson and Washington and return to the Bell Centre for another game against the Bruins on Jan. 20.

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 until Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over its residents.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow were expected to continue through the night with a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesperson Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.
The Sûreté du Québec is urging Quebec drivers to stay off the roads while snow and blowing snow make driving hazardous. Here, a vehicle went off the road near Hudson on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
At Montreal's Trudeau airport Friday, more than two dozen flights scheduled to leave or arrive were cancelled.
The majority of those flights are to, or from, East Coast destinations like Halifax, Fredericton, New York and Boston.
Flight status can also be checked on the Aéroports de Montréal website, admtl.com( http://www.admtl.com/ ).
Pedestrians get blasted with blowing snow while walking on Rene-Levesque Blvd. in downtown Montreal on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018.
Meanwhile in the Maritimes, tens of thousands of people woke up in the dark Friday morning after a ferocious storm blasted through Atlantic Canada, flooding coastal roads, battering sailboats and downing trees with hurricane-force winds.
Nova Scotia Power says 125,000 customers were without electricity in an area that stretched from one end of the province to the other after winds gusting to 140 kilometres an hour whipped through the region late Thursday and into Friday.
In New Brunswick, more than 130 outages were affecting 11,000 customers throughout the province that was also hit with heavy snowfall, while P.E.I. was also largely in the dark.

Full text: After a nearly two-day reprieve, Montreal is again enveloped in an extreme cold warning, courtesy of Environment Canada.
The city had been under an extreme cold warning from Dec. 27 until Jan. 3 - one of the longest cold snaps recorded here. During part of the reprieve, a smog warning had hung over its residents.
In addition to the deep freeze - minus-20 Celsius (but 15 degrees below that with the wind chill) - blowing snow pummelled Montrealers like little ice bullets. Light and blowing snow are expected to last until at least 5 p.m. And that's when the temperature starts slipping, to a low of minus-23 C overnight, then hopefully crawling up to minus-19 C on Saturday.
The Sûreté du Québec encouraged people to stay off highways, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," SQ spokesman Louis-Philippe Bibeau said Friday morning. He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Reduced visibility caused by snow and blowing snow on eastbound Highway 20 through the Turcot Yards in Jan. 5, 2018.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
Montreal police are also warning drivers to be cautious, due to the slippery roads and reduced visibility.
Temperatures are expected to let up by Monday, with a forecast high of minus-4 C, and even moreso on Tuesday, at minus-2 C. The snow is likely to continue in the Montreal area until Tuesday.
The Sûreté du Québec is urging Quebec drivers to stay off the roads while snow and blowing snow make driving hazardous. Here, a vehicle went off the road near Hudson, Quebec, on Jan. 5, 2018. (Allen McInnis / MONTREAL GAZETTE)
At Montreal's Trudeau airport Friday, a dozen flights scheduled to leave and 18 flights that were scheduled to arrive have been cancelled.
The majority of those flights are to, or from, East Coast destinations like Halifax, Fredericton, New York and Boston.
Thousands of flights were cancelled on Thursday as a "bomb cyclone" hit the northeastern United States and Canada. In New York, airports closed completely on Thursday afternoon.
While flights had resumed on Friday morning, there were still numerous cancellations.
Air Canada is warning customers that high winds may affect flights in and out of Montreal, a condition that's forecast to last until Saturday.
WestJet is advising travellers to check the status of flights to East Coast destinations before they leave for the airport.
Flight status can also be checked on the Aéroports de Montréal website, admtl.com( http://www.admtl.com/ ).

Full text: A look at the day's events in and around Montreal:
"Bomb cyclone" causes flight cancellations at Trudeau International Airport( http://montrealgazette.com/news/bomb-cyclone-causes-flight-cancellations-at-montreals-trudeau-airport )
The "bomb cyclone" sweeping its way up the eastern seaboard Thursday has largely spared Montreal but it caused 101 flight cancellations at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. The storm - which battered the coast with freezing rain and snow - led to 70 cancellations to and from the United States as well as postponing 31 flights to and from Atlantic Canada.
Montrealers rally in support of Iran protests( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rally-supports-popular-uprising-in-iran-they-are-killing-people-in-the-streets )
About 100 people gathered on a street corner in downtown Montreal Thursday afternoon in solidarity with recent widespread anti-government protests that began last month in Iran. The popular uprising has grown to include demands for free elections, a secular state, and a free press. More than 20 protesters are reported to have died in the unrest and hundreds have been imprisoned in the last six days. In Montreal, protesters gathered peacefully on the corner of Guy St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd. Thursday afternoon and chanted slogans such as "Down with dictatorship" and "Down with the Islamic Republic of Iran."
Lac-Mégantic trial: defence warns jury against vindictive spirit in closing arguments( http://montrealgazette.com/news/lac-megantic-trial-defence-warns-jury-against-vindictive-spirit-in-closing-arguments )
In his last chance to address the jury, defence lawyer Gaétan Bourassa downplayed his client's role within Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway, casting doubt on what his actual responsibilities were the night of the 2013 Lac-Mégantic train derailment. Jean Demaître, the company's train operations manager, was the third and last link in the "chain of security" that could have prevented the derailment, Bourassa said in his closing arguments Thursday. "But the breaking, the cracking, of that chain of security" happened before Demaître, he said. Demaître, 53, locomotive engineer Thomas Harding, 56, and traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, are on trial for criminal negligence causing the death of 47 people.
Two Montreal law firms seek to file class-action lawsuit against Apple( http://montrealgazette.com/news/two-montreal-law-firms-seek-to-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-apple-over-battery-life )
Two Quebec law firms are seeking authorization from Quebec Superior Court to file a class action lawsuit against Apple, claiming that its warranty policies violate Quebec's Consumer Protection Act. The application, filed on Dec. 29, comes after Apple admitted that it slows the performance( https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/ ) of some iPhone models in certain situations. The company said that's done to prevent unexpected shutdowns that result from aging, which makes batteries less effective. That acknowledgment, along with the price of Apple products, is evidence that the company is violating Quebec's Consumer Protection Act, said Joey Zukran, a lawyer at LPC Avocats.

Wood-burning deadline turns up the heat on Montreal's fireplace owners

Abstract: Some of the bylaw's restrictions have been in effect since it was passed over two years ago, but so far, not a single fine has been issued. Since August 2015, it has been illegal to burn wood during smog alerts in the city of Montreal or to install new wood-burning appliances that do not meet the strict new emissions standards( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-new-bylaw-on-wood-burning-stoves-and-fireplaces ). According to some local stove and fireplace retailers, business is gradually picking up as the deadline approaches, but so far there is no sign of a mad rush to convert. Enforcement of the "no wood burning during smog alerts" rule has been weak so far. Since the bylaw came into force, there have been at least two dozen smog days in the Montreal area and the city's environment department received about a dozen complaints about wood smoke during a recent smog alert.

Full text: The main thrust of Montreal's wood-burning bylaw is set to kick in later this year, and the question is: will it work to reduce air pollution or was it just a public relations exercise?
The city seems to be counting on awareness campaigns to try to gently persuade tens of thousands of Montreal households to either stop burning wood or invest in new, low-emission wood stoves or fireplace inserts. Some of the bylaw's restrictions have been in effect since it was passed over two years ago, but so far, not a single fine has been issued.
Since August 2015, it has been illegal to burn wood during smog alerts in the city of Montreal or to install new wood-burning appliances that do not meet the strict new emissions standards( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-new-bylaw-on-wood-burning-stoves-and-fireplaces ). But the most important restriction kicks in on Oct. 1, 2018. After that date, if you burn wood in Montreal in any appliance that emits more than 2.5 grams of fine particles per hour - and any stove or fireplace purchased before 2009 almost certainly does - you will be liable to a fine of $100 to $500 on first offence, $500 to $1,000 on second offence, and $1,000 to $2,000 on any subsequent offence.
The bylaw was designed to crack down on the problem gradually, starting with the smog-day ban, but giving homeowners three years of lead time to comply before the full ban kicked in. According to some local stove and fireplace retailers, business is gradually picking up as the deadline approaches, but so far there is no sign of a mad rush to convert.
"We've already got the first two weeks of January booked for installations and estimates," said Connie Romeo, manager of Foyers Lambert( http://foyerlambert.com/home-3/ ) in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. "We see people are starting now to really wake up and say, 'Okay, now it's crunch time, I don't want to wait until September when it's too close to the deadline.' I would say they are slowly, slowly starting to wake up and say, 'Okay we've got to do this now'."
Converting is not cheap. A cast iron wood-burning stove that meets the new norms costs between $3,000 and $4,000, plus several hundred more for installation. Metal stoves are slightly cheaper - $2,000 to $3,000. An insert that converts an existing fireplace to meet the norms costs between $3,000 and $5,000, plus $1,000 to $1,600 for installation, depending on the height of the chimney.
Romeo said about four out of five of her customers choose to convert from a wood-burning appliance to propane or natural gas, mostly because of the convenience of not having to deal with wood and ash. (Electrical appliances or those that burn propane, natural gas or wood pellets are allowed under the bylaw.)
But among the estimated 50,000 wood-burning appliances across the city are thousands of fireplaces that cannot be easily converted with an insert.
"The problem in Montreal is that a lot of condo builders in the 1980s and '90s put in these pre-fabricated ambient wood fireplaces," said Charles Hamel, co-owner of Poêles et Foyers Rosemont( http://www.poelesetfoyersrosemont.ca ). "They don't give off a lot of heat; they are just for ambiance," but they still pollute, he said.
He sells a prefabricated wood-burning fireplace unit that meets the city's new norms, but it costs about $6,900, he said, plus about $1,000 to remove the old unit and install the new.
Of course, homeowners are free to keep their old, polluting appliances, but as of next fall it will be illegal to use them, except during power outages of more than three hours. That exemption was good news for some Montrealers who cling to their wood-burning appliance just in case something similar to the 1998 ice storm happens again( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/20-years-after-the-ice-storm-with-more-extreme-weather-expected-are-we-ready ).
The bylaw, ushered in by the administration of former mayor Denis Coderre, is among the strictest in the world, but critics wonder whether it can really work to improve air quality without a rigorous enforcement program and a generous rebate offer.
"We agree with the bylaw, and we supported it," said André Bélisle, president of the Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique, "except that we warned the city ... that it is useless to have a bylaw, no matter how strict it is, if we are not able to enforce it."
Poeles et Foyers Rosemont co-owner Charles Hamel checks out a new wood stove that has an emission rate of 2.5 gph.
The city already knows where most wood-burning appliances are because of municipal evaluations, but homeowners are required, according to the new bylaw, to declare their wood-burning appliance( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-slow-to-declare-their-fireplaces-and-wood-burning-stoves ) by filling out an online form( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ENVIRO_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/FORMULAIRE_ANNEXE_EN.PDF ).
Enforcement of the "no wood burning during smog alerts" rule has been weak so far. Since the bylaw came into force, there have been at least two dozen smog days in the Montreal area and the city's environment department received about a dozen complaints about wood smoke during a recent smog alert. But so far, not a single fine has been issued, the Gazette has learned.
The environment department only has eight inspectors on the payroll, and they are responsible for applying all of the city's environmental bylaws, from water issues to air pollution to industrial activities.
"The enforcement strategy is based more on information and public awareness than on coercion," said Gabrielle Fontaine-Giroux, a city spokesperson.
This fall, for example, the city sent out information flyers to 30,000 owners of wood-burning appliances to remind them of the bylaw and why it's important to respect it. Information was also sent out by the 19 boroughs via newsletters, the city's website and the métro's info screens.
Many think of wood smoke as natural and harmless, and associate it with outdoorsy, healthy living. But scientists have been sounding the alarm bells for years now about how dangerous wood smoke is to human health.
Wood smoke, like cigarette smoke, contains hundreds of pollutants, including benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fine particles are of greatest concern, as they can remain in the lungs for months, causing changes that can lead to structural damage and diseases.
Smog consists mainly of ground-level ozone and particulate matter and the main sources for these pollutants in Montreal are vehicle usage and wood burning. Environment Canada issues smog alerts( https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/info-smog.html ) on days when air pollutant concentrations are likely to reach levels deemed harmful to human health. The most recent alert for Montreal was Dec. 30. Smog contributes to thousands of premature deaths across Canada, as well as countless emergency hospital visits and lost days of work and school due to asthma attacks and other respiratory ailments.
"We know those fine particles can go deep down into the lungs and into the bloodstream and have negative health effects," said Karine Price, a toxicologist with Montreal's public health department. "The World Health Organization has classified fine particles as cancer-causing."
Children, the elderly, and people with respiratory or cardiac diseases are more sensitive to these fine particles. Conditions like asthma and bronchitis can be caused or exacerbated through exposure to wood smoke.
"Fine particles are deemed to cause cancer," Price said. "There is no safe level. The best thing is to reduce where we can."
Wood smoke contributes 39 per cent of the fine particles in the atmosphere in the Montreal region, while transportation accounts for 45 per cent.
Still, some, including Bélisle, thought Montreal went too far( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/environmental-group-says-montreals-wood-burning-bylaw-too-strict ) when it adopted a norm that was even stricter than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new norm of 4.5 grams per hour.
He said there are more fireplace and stove models on the market that meet the slightly looser U.S. regulations, so prices are better, and the difference between 4.5 and 2.5, in the end, is insignificant when one considers the amount of pollution emitted by older stoves and fireplaces, often 50 grams per hour or more.
He urged the city and province to work quickly together to offer a rebate program to encourage homeowners to convert to cleaner-burning appliances. His organization ran a pilot project in 2012 that managed to get 5,300 polluting appliances replaced in just one year by offering homeowner rebates on cleaner models.

Full text: Montreal appears to be in the clear as the snowstorm affecting eastern North America is expected to merely sideswipe the city.
Between five and 10 centimetres of snow are predicted to fall in Montreal Thursday night into Friday - no where near the major snowfall expected in the east of the province.
The Gaspé Peninsula is expecting as much as 50 centimetres of snow starting Thursday, as the area is affected by a storm that has been called a bomb cyclone, which will also hit the Maritimes.
Areas along the coast of the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and throughout the Maritimes are under a storm surge warning, as heavy winds are expected to kick up intense waves.
While Montreal will be relatively unscathed by major precipitation, driving could be difficult as high winds are forecast throughout the weekend.

Travellers to and from Montreal could experience hardships, as the storm that hit most of the U.S. Northeast - it snowed even in parts of Florida - caused some flight cancellations at Trudeau airport( http://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/arrivees ) on Thursday.
The weekend will see a return of extreme cold temperatures, with a high of -17 Celsius expected on Friday, a high of -22 C on Saturday, and back to -17 C on Sunday.
Temperatures are expected to return to near-seasonal norms on Monday, with a high of -3 C and five to 10 centimetres of snow.

Abstract: The bitter cold has finally loosened its grip, and Montrealers are able to breathe a little easier Wednesday, the first full day without an extreme weather warning from Environment Canada since Dec. 27. The national weather service lifted an extreme cold warning early Tuesday afternoon as about five centimetres of snow started to fall on the Montreal region.

The national weather service lifted an extreme cold warning early Tuesday afternoon as about five centimetres of snow started to fall on the Montreal region.
Flurries and light snow will continue until at least Friday, according to Environment Canada, which says we can expect highs of minus-9 Celsius Wednesday and Thursday. Friday will dip to minus-15 C.
The forecast isn't as rosy for the rest of the province. Much of southeastern Quebec is under a winter storm watch that begins near Rivière-du-Loup and stretches into the Maritimes. The watch warns of heavy snow, high winds and possible flooding.

Oct. 1 wood-burning deadline turns up the heat on Montreal's fireplace owners

Author: Lalonde, Michelle

https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/blogs-podcasts-websites/oct-1-wood-burning-deadline-turns-up-heat-on/docview/1992347269/se-2?accountid=12339

Abstract: Some of the bylaw's restrictions have been in effect since it was passed over two years ago, but so far, not a single fine has been issued. Since August 2015, it has been illegal to burn wood during smog alerts in the city of Montreal or to install new wood-burning appliances that do not meet the strict new emissions standards( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-new-bylaw-on-wood-burning-stoves-and-fireplaces ). According to some local stove and fireplace retailers, business is gradually picking up as the deadline approaches, but so far there is no sign of a mad rush to convert. Enforcement of the "no wood burning during smog alerts" rule has been weak so far. Since the bylaw came into force, there have been at least two dozen smog days in the Montreal area and the city's environment department received about a dozen complaints about wood smoke during a recent smog alert.

Full text: The main thrust of Montreal's wood-burning bylaw is set to kick in later this year, and the question is: will it work to reduce air pollution or was it just a public relations exercise?
The city seems to be counting on awareness campaigns to try to gently persuade tens of thousands of Montreal households to either stop burning wood or invest in new, low-emission wood stoves or fireplace inserts. Some of the bylaw's restrictions have been in effect since it was passed over two years ago, but so far, not a single fine has been issued.
Since August 2015, it has been illegal to burn wood during smog alerts in the city of Montreal or to install new wood-burning appliances that do not meet the strict new emissions standards( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-presents-new-bylaw-on-wood-burning-stoves-and-fireplaces ). But the most important restriction kicks in on Oct. 1, 2018. After that date, if you burn wood in Montreal in any appliance that emits more than 2.5 grams of fine particles per hour - and any stove or fireplace purchased before 2009 almost certainly does - you will be liable to a fine of $100 to $500 on first offence, $500 to $1,000 on second offence, and $1,000 to $2,000 on any subsequent offence.
The bylaw was designed to crack down on the problem gradually, starting with the smog-day ban, but giving homeowners three years of lead time to comply before the full ban kicked in. According to some local stove and fireplace retailers, business is gradually picking up as the deadline approaches, but so far there is no sign of a mad rush to convert.
"We've already got the first two weeks of January booked for installations and estimates," said Connie Romeo, manager of Foyers Lambert( http://foyerlambert.com/home-3/ ) in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. "We see people are starting now to really wake up and say, 'Okay, now it's crunch time, I don't want to wait until September when it's too close to the deadline.' I would say they are slowly, slowly starting to wake up and say, 'Okay we've got to do this now'."
Converting is not cheap. A cast iron wood-burning stove that meets the new norms costs between $3,000 and $4,000, plus several hundred more for installation. Metal stoves are slightly cheaper - $2,000 to $3,000. An insert that converts an existing fireplace to meet the norms costs between $3,000 and $5,000, plus $1,000 to $1,600 for installation, depending on the height of the chimney.
Romeo said about four out of five of her customers choose to convert from a wood-burning appliance to propane or natural gas, mostly because of the convenience of not having to deal with wood and ash. (Electrical appliances or those that burn propane, natural gas or wood pellets are allowed under the bylaw.)
But among the estimated 50,000 wood-burning appliances across the city are thousands of fireplaces that cannot be easily converted with an insert.
"The problem in Montreal is that a lot of condo builders in the 1980s and '90s put in these pre-fabricated ambient wood fireplaces," said Charles Hamel, co-owner of Poêles et Foyers Rosemont( http://www.poelesetfoyersrosemont.ca ). "They don't give off a lot of heat; they are just for ambiance," but they still pollute, he said.
He sells a prefabricated wood-burning fireplace unit that meets the city's new norms, but it costs about $6,900, he said, plus about $1,000 to remove the old unit and install the new.
Of course, homeowners are free to keep their old, polluting appliances, but as of next fall it will be illegal to use them, except during power outages of more than three hours. That exemption was good news for some Montrealers who cling to their wood-burning appliance just in case something similar to the 1998 ice storm happens again.
The bylaw, ushered in by the administration of former mayor Denis Coderre, is among the strictest in the world, but critics wonder whether it can really work to improve air quality without a rigorous enforcement program and a generous rebate offer.
"We agree with the bylaw, and we supported it," said André Bélisle, president of the Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique, "except that we warned the city ... that it is useless to have a bylaw, no matter how strict it is, if we are not able to enforce it."
Poeles et Foyers Rosemont co-owner Charles Hamel checks out a new wood stove that has an emission rate of 2.5 gph.
The city already knows where most wood-burning appliances are because of municipal evaluations, but homeowners are required, according to the new bylaw, to declare their wood-burning appliance( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-slow-to-declare-their-fireplaces-and-wood-burning-stoves ) by filling out an online form( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ENVIRO_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/FORMULAIRE_ANNEXE_EN.PDF ).
Enforcement of the "no wood burning during smog alerts" rule has been weak so far. Since the bylaw came into force, there have been at least two dozen smog days in the Montreal area and the city's environment department received about a dozen complaints about wood smoke during a recent smog alert. But so far, not a single fine has been issued, the Gazette has learned.
The environment department only has eight inspectors on the payroll, and they are responsible for applying all of the city's environmental bylaws, from water issues to air pollution to industrial activities.
"The enforcement strategy is based more on information and public awareness than on coercion," said Gabrielle Fontaine-Giroux, a city spokesperson.
This fall, for example, the city sent out information flyers to 30,000 owners of wood-burning appliances to remind them of the bylaw and why it's important to respect it. Information was also sent out by the 19 boroughs via newsletters, the city's website and the métro's info screens.
Many think of wood smoke as natural and harmless, and associate it with outdoorsy, healthy living. But scientists have been sounding the alarm bells for years now about how dangerous wood smoke is to human health.
Wood smoke, like cigarette smoke, contains hundreds of pollutants, including benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fine particles are of greatest concern, as they can remain in the lungs for months, causing changes that can lead to structural damage and diseases.
Smog consists mainly of ground-level ozone and particulate matter and the main sources for these pollutants in Montreal are vehicle usage and wood burning. Environment Canada issues smog alerts( https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/info-smog.html ) on days when air pollutant concentrations are likely to reach levels deemed harmful to human health. The most recent alert for Montreal was Dec. 30. Smog contributes to thousands of premature deaths across Canada, as well as countless emergency hospital visits and lost days of work and school due to asthma attacks and other respiratory ailments.
"We know those fine particles can go deep down into the lungs and into the bloodstream and have negative health effects," said Karine Price, a toxicologist with Montreal's public health department. "The World Health Organization has classified fine particles as cancer-causing."
Children, the elderly, and people with respiratory or cardiac diseases are more sensitive to these fine particles. Conditions like asthma and bronchitis can be caused or exacerbated through exposure to wood smoke.
"Fine particles are deemed to cause cancer," Price said. "There is no safe level. The best thing is to reduce where we can."
Wood smoke contributes 39 per cent of the fine particles in the atmosphere in the Montreal region, while transportation accounts for 45 per cent.
Still, some, including Bélisle, thought Montreal went too far( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/environmental-group-says-montreals-wood-burning-bylaw-too-strict ) when it adopted a norm that was even stricter than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new norm of 4.5 grams per hour.
He said there are more fireplace and stove models on the market that meet the slightly looser U.S. regulations, so prices are better, and the difference between 4.5 and 2.5, in the end, is insignificant when one considers the amount of pollution emitted by older stoves and fireplaces, often 50 grams per hour or more.

His organization ran a pilot project in 2012 that managed to get 5,300 polluting appliances replaced in just one year by offering homeowner rebates on cleaner models.

Logjam broken - that's always when fun starts: Ohtani, Stanton moves get ball rolling

Full text: There is a train of thought that the huge events of the past week - the decision by Shohei Ohtani to accept a bid by the Angels, and Giancarlo Stanton accepting a trade to the Yankees - mean the winter meetings that commence Monday morning at the Dolphin Resort at Disney World will be devoid of movement and drama. Count me out.
I believe in the logjam theory, wherein there needs to be a setting of the bar for trades and free agents. Every team that believed they were in on Ohtani, or thought they could convince Stanton, now needs to look elsewhere - and elsewhere is still very interesting to watch as it unfolds over the next five days.
Most winter meetings, among the 41 that I have now attended, begin slowly with either a major free agent or a pending trade holding up the proceedings. In 2000 in Dallas it was the Alex Rodriguez signing by the hometown Rangers. They held a press conference at the ballpark in the ice storm of the year in Texas.
In 2011, with the meetings also in Dallas, the Angels made the big splash by signing Albert Pujols. In 1992 in Louisville the great Barry Bonds made the decision to go to the Giants, while in 1988 in Atlanta hall of famer Nolan Ryan signed with the Rangers.
I believe the '17 logjam is already broken.
As far as the Blue Jays are concerned, the first substantial trade rumour surrounds second baseman Josh Harrison of the Pirates, with interest also from the Mets. What this means is that despite the acquisition of former all-star Aledmys Diaz from the Cardinals, the Jays remain very concerned about the health of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman Devon Travis.
The odds of Tulo playing on opening day would seem to be less than 50/50, despite optimism from the Jays, considering the sombre self-evaluation by the shortstop in September. As for Travis, just check his time on the disabled list over his Jays tenure and the need for help is obvious.
Now for some personal memories of the winter meetings:
The first ones I attended were also in Orlando, but not at Disney. The first meetings trade for which I wrote a news release while working for the Expos happened on Dec. 7, 1978, with Montreal acquiring left-hander Bill Lee for infielder Stan Papi. The previous night, at 2 a.m. I had been at the hotel pool having a deep conversation about my career with legendary Montreal Gazette sportswriter Ian MacDonald. At 24 years old, as I was spilling my thoughts about a future in baseball, I reached down to feel the water, stepped into the trough and pitched forward into the pool. Then the next day came Spaceman. Memorable.
In 1979, almost three years after the Blue Jays played their first game, the meetings were hosted by Toronto - the only time that has happened because of climate, although other northern cities have hosted since I began attending: Boston twice, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
In 1980, on a snowy night at the winter meetings in Dallas - the night after I asked my wife Debbie, who was there working for a sports communications company, to marry me - we were in a cab with hockey hall of famer Michael Farber and Expos broadcast legend Jacques Doucet when news came on the radio that John Lennon had been shot and killed outside the Dakota apartments in New York.
Favourite war-room session? In the late '80s there was a serious afternoon discussion in the Expos' suite, led by then-GM Dave Dombrowski. The belief, from trolling the lobby, was that the Cubs were ready to deal shortstop Shawon Dunston and the Expos were ready to pounce. The excited chatter included building a trade package around utility infielder Tom Foley. At one point the question was asked of the people in the room: "Who here would not make that deal?" The late, great Whitey Lockman, then in his 70s, had been sitting by quietly. He said simply, "The Cubs."
In 1982 in Hawaii, there was a five-hour time difference so you always had to get up earlier. My PR buddy Ed Wade of the Phillies, who went on to become a major-league GM with the Astros, was an avid runner. I joined him one morning at 5:30 a.m. for a run up to the legendary Diamond Head. By the time we reached the base of the mountain I was exhausted so I went in for a coffee and a doughnut, picking Ed up on the way back. As he passed by upon his return I swung in beside him for the last sprint to the hotel. When we reached the front of the hotel, having worked up a serious sweat, Expos president John McHale and his wife Patty were coming back from breakfast and nodded their approval. I am convinced that moment cemented my PR job status.
The bottom line is that you can never predict what may happen at the winter meetings, but every GM feels that more can be accomplished in face-to-face sessions with other GMs and player agents, and that they owe it to their fan base to get something done before the holidays and the new year.
Let the games begin.

Full text: LAKE BUENA VISTA, FLA.—There is a train of thought that the huge events of the past week — the decision by Shohei Ohtani to accept a bid by the Angels, and Giancarlo Stanton accepting a trade to the Yankees — mean the winter meetings that commence Monday morning at the Dolphin Resort at Disney World will be devoid of movement and drama. Count me out.
I believe in the logjam theory, wherein there needs to be a setting of the bar for trades and free agents. Every team that believed they were in on Ohtani, or thought they could convince Stanton, now needs to look elsewhere — and elsewhere is still very interesting to watch as it unfolds over the next five days.
Most winter meetings, among the 41 that I have now attended, begin slowly with either a major free agent or a pending trade holding up the proceedings. In 2000 in Dallas it was the Alex Rodriguez signing by the hometown Rangers. They held a press conference at the ballpark in the ice storm of the year in Texas.
In 2011, with the meetings also in Dallas, the Angels made the big splash by signing Albert Pujols. In 1992 in Louisville the great Barry Bonds made the decision to go to the Giants, while in 1988 in Atlanta hall of famer Nolan Ryan signed with the Rangers.
I believe the ’17 logjam is already broken.
As far as the Blue Jays are concerned, the first substantial trade rumour surrounds second baseman Josh Harrison of the Pirates, with interest also from the Mets. What this means is that despite the acquisition of former all-star Aledmys Diaz from the Cardinals, the Jays remain very concerned about the health of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman Devon Travis.
The odds of Tulo playing on opening day would seem to be less than 50/50, despite optimism from the Jays, considering the sombre self-evaluation by the shortstop in September. As for Travis, just check his time on the disabled list over his Jays tenure and the need for help is obvious.
Now for some personal memories of the winter meetings:

- The first ones I attended were also in Orlando, but not at Disney. The first meetings trade for which I wrote a news release while working for the Expos happened on Dec. 7, 1978, with Montreal acquiring left-hander Bill Lee for infielder Stan Papi. The previous night, at 2 a.m. I had been at the hotel pool having a deep conversation about my career with legendary Montreal Gazette sportswriter Ian MacDonald. At 24 years old, as I was spilling my thoughts about a future in baseball, I reached down to feel the water, stepped into the trough and pitched forward into the pool. Then the next day came Spaceman. Memorable.



- In 1979, almost three years after the Blue Jays played their first game, the meetings were hosted by Toronto — the only time that has happened because of climate, although other northern cities have hosted since I began attending: Boston twice, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.



- In 1980, on a snowy night at the winter meetings in Dallas — the night after I asked my wife Debbie, who was there working for a sports communications company, to marry me — we were in a cab with hockey hall of famer Michael Farber and Expos broadcast legend Jacques Doucet when news came on the radio that John Lennon had been shot and killed outside the Dakota apartments in New York.



- Favourite war-room session? In the late ’80s there was a serious afternoon discussion in the Expos’ suite, led by then-GM Dave Dombrowski. The belief, from trolling the lobby, was that the Cubs were ready to deal shortstop Shawon Dunston and the Expos were ready to pounce. The excited chatter included building a trade package around utility infielder Tom Foley. At one point the question was asked of the people in the room: “Who here would not make that deal?” The late, great Whitey Lockman, then in his 70s, had been sitting by quietly. He said simply, “The Cubs.”



- In 1982 in Hawaii, there was a five-hour time difference so you always had to get up earlier. My PR buddy Ed Wade of the Phillies, who went on to become a major-league GM with the Astros, was an avid runner. I joined him one morning at 5:30 a.m. for a run up to the legendary Diamond Head.

When we reached the front of the hotel, having worked up a serious sweat, Expos president John McHale and his wife Patty were coming back from breakfast and nodded their approval. I am convinced that moment cemented my PR job status.


The bottom line is that you can never predict what may happen at the winter meetings, but every GM feels that more can be accomplished in face-to-face sessions with other GMs and player agents, and that they owe it to their fan base to get something done before the holidays and the new year.

Abstract: Liberal MNA Geoff Kelley says his West Island constituents shouldn't read too much into his support for a motion in the Quebec National Assembly that calls on merchants to scrap the "Bonjour-Hi" greeting in favour of a simple "Bonjour." Kelley said the "Bonjour-Hi" debate should be seen as a sign the PQ is struggling to gain traction with francophone voters. [...]you're playing into the PQ's hands, provoking some kind of issue.

Full text: Liberal MNA Geoff Kelley says his West Island constituents shouldn't read too much into his support for a motion in the Quebec National Assembly that calls on merchants to scrap the "Bonjour-Hi" greeting in favour of a simple "Bonjour."
The provincial legislature in Quebec City.
The motion, sponsored by the Parti Québécois, was passed unanimously( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/parti-quebecois-motion-would-declare-bonjour-hi-an-irritant ) in the legislature Thursday after haggling over the wording was hammered out between the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard and the opposition.
Kelley, who represents the predominantly anglophone riding of Jacques-Cartier, called the headline-grabbing debate a "tempest in a teapot."
He said it was fuelled by opposition parties trying to score political points over language issues heading into next year's provincial election.
"The PQ would desperately like to revive the language debate and divide Quebecers," Kelley said. "They presented a motion on the welcome customers are given. We voted a motion that said it is a good idea to say "Bonjour." The motion is not binding, and I am sure that common sense will prevail.
"At the end of the day you end up voting on something urging people to say "Bonjour" to people who come into their store. It's very hard to vote against that," he added.
While "Bonjour-Hi" might seem like an innocuous bilingual greeting, Kelley said voting against the motion might've stirred Quebec's language pot even more.
"At the end of the day, I understand where my constituents are coming from, but to vote against inviting people to say 'Bonjour' didn't make much sense, either."
Kelley said the "Bonjour-Hi" debate should be seen as a sign the PQ is struggling to gain traction with francophone voters.
"We know that their sovereignty referendum idea is going nowhere, so let's go back to the old faithful, the language debate, and try to divide Quebecers," he said.
"If the polls are right, the PQ is in third place. So they're trying to get back in the game. They'll try anything. Two weeks ago we had a debate about kirpans. Kirpans, to my way of thinking, are not a problem in Quebec society. We've had long discussions about women in burkas as if there were thousands of women in the streets of Montreal wearing burkas.
"I find this whole effort by the opposition parties to divide Quebecers very unfortunate," Kelley added.
Voting against the "Bonjour" motion would've played into the hands of the opposition parties, he noted.
"As I say, the PQ is trying to provoke a sense of crisis - but if you start dividing your caucus or voting against, then you're in opposition to the people sitting next to you.
Scene in front of Pointe-Claire city hall.
"Is it perfect for the streets of Pointe-Claire? Not necessarily, but why I'm always proud to be a Liberal is we're the only party that at the beginning of an election tries to win all 125 ridings. And we try to come up with messages we can use in every riding in Quebec.
"If I look at the Parti Québécois or the (Coalition Avenir Québec) CAQ, what goes on in Jacques Cartier riding they don't really care. I don't think either of the opposition parties care very much about the non-francophone vote."
Asked if he should have abstained from voting, Kelley said: "Then you're offside as a team player. In a way, you're playing into the PQ's hands, provoking some kind of issue. Then you talk about how people did or didn't vote for another 24 hours. You're just adding into the storm. I just think it's better to let it slip away.
"By standing outside of your caucus, even if it's abstaining, you're just feeding into the frenzy."
As for greeting customers, Kelley said the "best welcome when one walks into a store remains a smile."

Hab or Hab not? Mete move an obsession

Full text: It's the daily habit of many cellphone users in London these days.
Check the weather, FaceBook, stock market and then right to Victor Mete's latest ice time with the Habs.
There probably should be an app for it.
On Wednesday, the Canadiens made him a healthy scratch against Nashville. That, of course, revived the question hanging over the junior ranks.
Will Montreal send him back to the Knights? London, wisely, will not say too much about the topic. The major junior club simply wishes him the best and is happy he's living the NHL dream.
They're busy preparing to play Owen Sound on Friday and Guelph on Sunday.
But everyone in the OHL knows what it would mean if Mete does end up at Budweiser Gardens again. The Knights will have the best defenceman in the league.
It wasn't a legitimate topic a month ago, when Mete was playing more than 20 minutes a game at the Bell Centre.
But it is now that his ice time has been dwindling and he actually had to sit out and watch while an American league callup got the chance to play.
Ten days ago, Mete had just 10 shifts and 7:06 of ice against Columbus. On Tuesday in Dallas, he clocked in at 9:47.
There are starting to be some suggestions from Montreal media to send Mete first to Canada's team for the world junior championship in Buffalo, then back to London for the second half of the season.
But just the other day, the Montreal Gazette ran a Marc Dumont number-crunching column that suggests Shea Weber has been at his best while playing with Mete, the speedy teenager.
So there is that chemistry to consider in this too.
the bottom line is, if coach Claude Julien continues to sit out mete, the only proper course is to return the 19-year-old to london. no matter what happens, mete should be proud of what he has achieved.
Before he departed for training camp, he said his goal was to get into an exhibition game with montreal. He already has played in 22 regular season tilts.
His success has been one of the better stories in the game this fall, right up there with slight 19-yearold Swedish forward Jesper Bratt, who was supposed to be a Knight, becoming one of the Devils'most productive forwards.
goalie crunch When Joseph Raaymakers refused to report to the Soo this year, owen Sound appeared to be a possible landing spot. But the attack had brought in over-ager Zack Bowman, hoping he would provide what another ex-Sudbury stopper troy timpano did in Erie's oHl titlewinning season last year. now Bowman has left the attack, after a 3.75 goals against average and .866 save percentage. Big rookie mack Guzda backstopped owen Sound to a shootout win over the iceDogs Wednesday, but he's still only 16 years old. the Bayshore squad recalled Riley Daniels, who is 18, from the Kitchener Dutchmen junior Bs. looking around, Raaymakers was one of the top remaining goalies available this season. london was compelled to grab him after its poor start, giving the attack even fewer crease options. Quick hits Even without mete, Knights fans can watch the oHl's three topscoring defencemen this weekend. london's Evan Bouchard is third with 25 points, behind the attack's sean Durzi and Guelph Storm rearguard Ryan Merkley... the Knights don't know yet if Max Jones will play Friday against owen Sound. the big Ducks first-rounder, who missed Wednesday's game in Sarnia for personal reasons, shared on twitter that his uncle had passed away... Cole tymkin has been skating and is still day-to-day after being injured in Kitchener. the Knights miss Jones and tymkin's physical play... Ex-Knight overager Adrian Carbonara, now with niagara, was suspended eight games for a head check in mississauga last week. it was just his second game with the iceDogs... Brandon Crawley has a goal and is minus-6 in his first 16 games with the american league's Hartford Wolf Pack, the new York Rangers affiliate. Hartford is right near the bottom of the atlantic Division standings... Max Domi and Zac Rinaldo have the same number of goals (two) for the Coyotes this season. that's unexpected. Here's another: Rinaldo only has one more penalty minute than Domi and three more than the very gentlemanly Christian Dvorak. rpyette@postmedia.com Twitter.com/RyanatLFPress

London, wisely, will not say too much about the topic. The club simply wishes him the best and is happy he's living the NHL dream.
They're busy preparing to play Owen Sound today and Guelph Sunday.
But everyone in the OHL knows what it would mean if Mete does end up at Budweiser Gardens again. The Knights will have the best defenceman in the league.
It wasn't a legitimate topic a month ago, when Mete was playing more than 20 minutes a game at the Bell Centre.
But it is now that his ice time has been dwindling and he actually had to sit out and watch while an American league callup got the chance to play.
Ten days ago, Mete had just 10 shifts and 7:06 of ice against Columbus. On Tuesday in Dallas, he clocked in at 9:47.
There are starting to be some suggestions from Montreal media to send Mete first to Team Canada for the world juniors in Buffalo, then back to London for the second half of the season.
But just the other day, the Montreal Gazette ran a Marc Dumont number-crunching column that suggests Shea Weber has been at his best while playing with Mete, the speedy teenager.
So, there is that chemistry to consider in this, too.
The bottom line is, if coach Claude Julien continues to sit out Mete, the only proper course is to return the 19-year-old to London.
No matter what happens, Mete should be proud of what he has achieved.
Before he departed for training camp, he said his goal was to get into an exhibition game with Montreal. He already has played in 22 regular-season tilts.
His success has been one of the better stories in the game this fall, right up there with slight 19-year-old Swedish forward Jesper Bratt, who was supposed to be a Knight, becoming one of the Devils' most productive forwards.
GOALIE CRUNCH: When Joseph Raaymakers refused to report to the Soo this year, Owen Sound appeared to be a possible landing spot. But the Attack had brought in overager Zack Bowman, hoping he would provide what another ex-Sudbury stopper Troy Timpano did in Erie's OHL title-winning season last year. Now, Bowman has left the Attack, after a 3.75 goals against average and .866 save percentage. Big rookie Mack Guzda backstopped Owen Sound to a shootout win over the IceDogs Wednesday, but he's still only 16 years old. The Bayshore squad recalled Riley Daniels, who is 18, from the Kitchener Dutchmen Junior Bs. Looking around, Raaymakers was one of the top remaining goalies available this season. London was compelled to grab him after its poor start, giving the Attack even fewer crease options.
QUICK HITS: The Knights don't know yet if Max Jones will play Friday. The big Ducks first rounder, who missed Wednesday in Sarnia for personal reasons, shared on Twitter that his uncle had passed away . . . Cole Tymkin has been skating and is still day-to-day after being injured in Kitchener. The Knights miss Jones and Tymkin's physical play. . . Even without Mete, Knights fans can watch the OHL's three top-scoring defencemen this weekend. London's Evan Bouchard is third with 25 points, behind the Attack's Sean Durzi and Storm rearguard Ryan Merkley . . . Cliff Pu's failed penalty shot in Sarnia against Justin Fazio was the 15th attempt in the league this season. Ten of those free chances have been granted in the second period, including the Pu try. There have only been three penalty shot goals so far. The netminders are winning . . . Ex-Knight overager Adrian Carbonara, now with Niagara, was suspended eight games for a head check in Mississauga last week. It was just his second game with the IceDogs . . . Brandon Crawley has a goal and is minus-6 in his first 16 games with the American league's Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers affiliate. Hartford is right near the bottom of the Atlantic Division standings . . . Max Domi and Zac Rinaldo have the same number of goals (two) for the Coyotes this season. That's unexpected. Here's another: Rinaldo only has one more penalty minute than Domi and three more than the very gentlemanly Christian Dvorak . . . Ex knight Dennis Wideman hired as Kitchener asst coach.

Full text: It's no wonder the 7-Minute Workout took the world by storm when it debuted in 2013, promising a full-body workout in just a few minutes a day.
One of the first workouts to demonstrate the power of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to the general public, it consists of 12 body weight exercises (squats, two variations of pushups, jumping jacks, lunges, dips, step-ups, wall sits, crunches, two variations of planks, running on the spot) performed in 30-second bursts with a 10-second rest between each exercise. The only equipment needed is a chair, making it perfect not just for timecrunched exercisers, but for travellers, apartment dwellers and anyone else who doesn't want to invest in a home gym.
Still popular four years later, the workout has spawned several apps that have been downloaded millions of times by people excited by the promise of getting all the exercise they need in a matter of minutes.
But now that the dust has settled and high-intensity interval training has been more rigorously tested, how does the 7-Minute Workout measure up to other HIIT workouts? A research team from California State University San Marcos decided to put the 7-Minute Workout to the test, comparing it to a traditional HIIT session performed on a bike. The idea was to see whether intensity levels recorded for the 7-Minute Workout are high enough to qualify as a HIIT session.
Noting that the results of HIIT workouts are based primarily on research performed in a lab using top-quality equipment, a well-defined workout protocol and staff who make sure the exercisers stay on track, the researchers wanted to see if a home-based program like the 7-Minute Workout, in which intensity is based on the exerciser's own motivation, is worthy of its "scientifically based" promise of improved fitness and weight loss.
The first step was getting height, weight and VO2 max scores from 14 recreational exercisers (seven men and seven women), aged 19 to 45. Once the baseline measurements were taken, each exerciser performed both the 7-Minute Workout and a cycling HIIT, with a two-day break between the physical tests.
The cycling workout mimicked the 7-Minute Workout, demanding a dozen 30-second bouts of highintensity pedalling (at 70 per cent of peak power) followed by 10 seconds of active rest (20 per cent of peak power), for a total of six minutes of active work.
The results showed that the cycling intervals were more physically demanding than the intervals in the 7-Minute Workout, producing a greater demand for oxygen, a higher heart rate and a higher level of perceived exertion.
That doesn't mean the 7-Minute Workout was a walk in the park. Several times during the workout, the intensity matched that of the cycling test. The problem is that not all exercises in the 7-Minute Workout demand the same level of intensity, which lowered the overall effectiveness of the workout.
"Heart rate and VO2 (Oxygen consumption) were highest when dynamic lower-body exercise including high knees, lunges, stepups onto a chair and squats were performed,"stated the researchers, "whereas lower VO2 and heart rate were evident when participants completed small muscle mass exercise (triceps dip), passive exercise (wall sit), or were supine, as in the case of planks and abdominal crunches."
The solution for those who want to make the workout a little tougher is to swap out some of the less-intense exercises in favour of ones that will keep the heart pumping, allowing for a more consistent level of intensity.
The authors suggest "dynamic, multi-joint movements including burpees, deadlifts and/or box jumps" in place of wall sits, planks, crunches and tricep dips.
The changes are worth considering, given that the convenience of the 7-Minute Workout makes it a great option on days when a longer, more traditional workout isn't in the cards. Even better, it doesn't require a lot of equipment, which means you can do it anywhere, any time. And with so many apps that take you through the whole workout, including timing each interval, it couldn't be easier.
Just remember: if you want to get the most out of your seven minutes, choose an app that allows you to build your own bank of exercises.
Or better yet, one that allows you to create your own 7-Minute Workout.
With a little tweaking, it has the potential to be one of the most effective home-based workouts for timeand cash-strapped Canadians of all fitness levels.
Three great 7-Minute Workout apps Perfect for novices and fitness diehards The Johnson & Johnson Official 7-Minute Workout: Not only does this app lead you through the original workout, complete with timer, it allows you to change up the exercises and difficulty level, which makes it great for novices and fitness diehards alike.
And for anyone who isn't sure how to do any of the suggested exercises, there are videos demonstrating proper technique. 7-Minute Workout app by Wahoo: This app is easy to use and features multiple variations on the workout, so you can dial the intensity up or down as needed. You can also add sets if you want to extend the workout. And for Apple lovers, it integrates with your Apple Watch and Apple TV.
Scientific 7-Minute Workout: You'll want to splurge for the $1.99 version of this app to get rid of the ads, but once you do that you'll appreciate the voice commands telling you when to start and when to take a break. You can customize the workout, view videos of exercises you're not familiar with and use the countdown timer to keep you on track.

Noting that the results of HIIT workouts are based primarily on research performed in a lab using top-quality equipment, a well-defined workout protocol and staff who make sure the exercisers stay on track, the researchers wanted to see if a home-based program like the 7-Minute Workout, in which intensity is based on the exerciser's own motivation, is worthy of its "scientifically based" promise of improved fitness and weight loss.
The first step was getting height, weight and VO2 max scores from 14 recreational exercisers (seven men and seven women), aged 19 to 45. Once the baseline measurements were taken, each exerciser performed both the 7-Minute Workout and a cycling HIIT, with a two-day break between the physical tests. The cycling workout mimicked the 7-Minute Workout, demanding a dozen 30-second bouts of highintensity pedalling (at 70 per cent of peak power) followed by 10 seconds of active rest (20 per cent of peak power), for a total of six minutes of active work.
The results showed that the cycling intervals were more physically demanding than the intervals in the 7-Minute Workout, producing a greater demand for oxygen, a higher heart rate and a higher level of perceived exertion.
That doesn't mean the 7-Minute Workout was a walk in the park. Several times during the workout, the intensity matched that of the cycling test. The problem is that not all exercises in the 7-Minute Workout demand the same level of intensity, which lowered the overall effectiveness of the workout.
"Heart rate and VO2 (Oxygen consumption) were highest when dynamic lower-body exercise including high knees, lunges, stepups onto a chair and squats were performed,"stated the researchers, "whereas lower VO2 and heart rate were evident when participants completed small muscle mass exercise (triceps dip), passive exercise (wall sit), or were supine, as in the case of planks and abdominal crunches."
The solution for those who want to make the workout a little tougher is to swap out some of the less-intense exercises in favour of ones that will keep the heart pumping, allowing for a more consistent level of intensity. The authors suggest "dynamic, multi-joint movements including burpees, deadlifts and/or box jumps" in place of wall sits, planks, crunches and tricep dips.
The changes are worth considering, given that the convenience of the 7-Minute Workout makes it a great option on days when a longer, more traditional workout isn't in the cards. Even better, it doesn't require a lot of equipment, which means you can do it anywhere, any time. And with so many apps that take you through the whole workout, including timing each interval, it couldn't be easier.
Just remember: if you want to get the most out of your seven minutes, choose an app that allows you to build your own bank of exercises.
Or better yet, one that allows you to create your own 7-Minute Workout.
With a little tweaking, it has the potential to be one of the most effective home-based workouts for timeand cash-strapped Canadians of all fitness levels.
Three great 7-Minute Workout apps
Perfect for novices and fitness diehards
The Johnson & Johnson Official 7-Minute Workout: Not only does this app lead you through the original workout, complete with timer, it allows you to change up the exercises and difficulty level, which makes it great for novices and fitness diehards alike. And for anyone who isn't sure how to do any of the suggested exercises, there are videos demonstrating proper technique.
7-Minute Workout app by Wahoo: This app is easy to use and features multiple variations on the workout, so you can dial the intensity up or down as needed. You can also add sets if you want to extend the workout. And for Apple lovers, it integrates with your Apple Watch and Apple TV.
Scientific 7-Minute Workout: You'll want to splurge for the $1.99 version of this app to get rid of the ads, but once you do that you'll appreciate the voice commands telling you when to start and when to take a break. You can customize the workout, view videos of exercises you're not familiar with and use the countdown timer to keep you on track.

Senneville project sent back to drawing board amid public opposition

Full text: It's back to the drawing board for the promoter behind the proposed Boise Pearson residential development in Senneville. Public opposition to the plan presented during a consultation earlier this month was strident.
"We listened to what people had to say and council has decided changes need to be made," Mayor Jane Guest said, Monday. "The plan, as it is now, is too big. Council will meet the promoter over the coming weeks to look at the new plans and another public consultation will take place sometime in August."
Resistance to the development of the triangle of land near Highway 40 and west of Blvd. des Anciens-Combattants reaches back almost 25 years.
Guest told the Montreal Gazette that she is hoping this plan will end up being adjusted and approved before the civic elections, Nov. 5. If not, the project could find itself floating in limbo until the next administration takes a look and makes a decision. Guest has announced she will not be running for a second term.
When promoter Jacques Belisle bought the land, he planned to build luxury, single-family homes, but the town wanted 80 per cent of the wetland and forested area conserved. The plan presented earlier this month had four condo buildings with 224 units.
Senneville resident Martin Gauthier is an outspoken critic of the development. His property on Elmwood Ave. backs onto the land in question. How people will access the development from an already busy adjacent thoroughfare, the bump in population of around 500 and efficient drainage in the wake of construction are Gauthier's main issues.
He watched with horror this spring as the wetland near his home became saturated. The flooding came within metres of his property.
"Drainage is a serious issue," Gauthier said. He said that even if the wetland isn't touched by the construction, the introduction of structures and parking facilities will interfere with the flow of groundwater. It has to go somewhere.
Boise Pearson's urban planner Marc Perrault told the Montreal Gazette that the plan includes what are called bioretention basins, which are essentially landscaped depressions that channel storm water run-off to shallow basins where it is released in a controlled fashion.
Perrault said 70 per cent of the trees will remain untouched and 10 per cent will be replanted.
Senneville has a population of around 920, with leafy streets and generous properties. People are drawn to its quiet, village feel. Gauthier said the high-density development does not reflect the village image.
"There will be a 55-metre buffer zone between the homes on Elmwood Avenue and the (nearest) building," Perrault said. "We have aimed to find a good balance between conservation and development."
Perrault said a new intersection with a traffic light would be forged on Blvd. des Anciens-Combattants to allow access to the development. The portion of the boulevard in question is part of Senneville. The rest of the boulevard is in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, which has its own plans to develop a piece of land nearby.
"The boulevard is already very stressed," Gauthier said. "Something like 3,000 cars use the boulevard every day." kgreenaway@postmedia.com

Expo 67, 50 years later: 'It was an amazing period'

Author: Feith, Jesse

Abstract: The next six months were "sheer bliss" and a bit of a blur - "fermented and distilled ambrosia," Beck called it - as he and the other photographers spent days racing around the pavilions and nights rubbing shoulders with celebrities and sports figures at parties. The next memory that stands out is driving a golf cart around the site the day Expo 67 was closing, wondering where the last six months had gone as he...

Full text: Gordon Beck had been travelling across Europe in his Volkswagen and doing freelance work for a newspaper in London when a telegram came from Montreal with an interesting offer: would he like to be one of 13 photographers to document Expo 67? Needing to be in Montreal in two weeks, he found the closest freighter he could - an old Second World War ship steaming from Portsmouth to New York - loaded his Volkswagen aboard, endured a storm at sea that caused a two-day delay and eventually made his way back to the city in time for opening day.
"I got there in one piece and hit the ground running," Beck, a former Montreal Gazette photographer, said on Saturday as he recalled his six-month stint shooting Expo 67.
Around midnight the day before the world exposition was set to open to the public - this Thursday will mark 50 years since then - Beck remembers taking the Expo Express train from the media centre to Ile-Ste-Helene and toward the Canadian pavilion, where workers were still scrambling to lay down grass and put last minute touches on the site.
He had his doubts about it being finished for the next morning, but was impressed to see it was ready to go by sunrise.
The next six months were "sheer bliss" and a bit of a blur - "fermented and distilled ambrosia," Beck called it - as he and the other photographers spent days racing around the pavilions and nights rubbing shoulders with celebrities and sports figures at parties.
The next memory that stands out is driving a golf cart around the site the day Expo 67 was closing, wondering where the last six months had gone as he watched maintenance workers erect large announcement boards thanking people for their visit and asking them to leave.
"It was an amazing period," Beck, now 75, said. "In my life and in the lives of many people."
To mark the 50th anniversary of Expo 67 this week, the city of Montreal is offering a free passport that grants residents and tourists access to 14 continuing or coming events celebrating the exposition throughout the city.
As of Wednesday, the Stewart Museum on Ile-Ste-Helene will be hosting Expo 67 - A World of Dreams, an exhibition looking back at the fair's "big dreams and innovative spirit."
From April 22 to May 6, city hall is hosting an exhibit of photos showing how the city looked in the 1960s - including during Expo 67 - and on Thursday, the Biosphere will launch an exhibit showcasing the environmental legacy of Expo 67.
A dozen other commemorative events are slated to start as of May and last through the fall. The full list of events can be found on the city of Montreal's 375th anniversary website, www.375mtl.com. A commemorative paper edition of the passports will be available in participating businesses as of April 28. An electronic version can be found on the city's 375 MTL app. jfeith@postmedia.com Twitter.com/jessefeith

Full text: It was shoddy journalism, not a debatable take on Quebec society, that cost former Ottawa Citizen editor Andrew Potter his "dream job" as head of McGill University's prestigious Institute for the Study of Canada last week.
He failed to let the facts get in the way of a good rant.
Potter wanted to make the case that Quebec - contrary to its collective belief - suffers from a chronic deficit of solidarity. He had statistics that he believed demonstrated he was on to something.
Maybe he was, maybe he was not: that was not the real point of the exercise.
A public intellectual should stir the occasional hornet's nest, even at the risk of painful stings.
Like all good columnists, Potter looked for a peg for his arguments.
Piggybacking a story that already has a lot of traction is a sure shortcut to a large audience. It pays to pick one's moment.
One will, for instance, write about Finance Minister Bill Morneau's learning curve as a political communicator around the time of the budget and not in the dead of summer.
From Potter's perspective, the episode that saw hundreds of motorists left stranded on the Montreal section of a provincial highway for an entire night at the time of the March 14-15 massive snowstorm fit the bill.
It is not clear why he would have come to that conclusion.
By all accounts, those left stranded by the authorities on southbound Hwy. 13 managed to avoid serious harm by going out of their way to help each other.
As a Montrealer by adoption, I have never found the kindness of strangers to be in shorter supply in Quebec than in my Ontario birthplace. The storm was no exception.
There was no evidence to back up his core contention that the Hwy. 13 saga was a manifestation of widespread societal alienation.
Potter then fell back on sloppy generalizations about routine double-billing on Montreal restaurant bills (for tax-evasion purposes) and ATM machines that spout out $50 bills by default.
Those were demonstrably false. It begged the question of whether Potter was confusing Montreal with Absurdistan.
Contrary to what is becoming popular belief in some media circles, Quebec's political class did not rush to the barricades to denounce the column. The media dragged it there.
The first to voice serious concerns about Potter's arguments were journalists who had cause to know better.
On social media, the Montreal Gazette's veteran restaurant critic, Lesley Chesterman, was among those who led the charge.
McGill University waded in to the fray with a tweet dissociating itself from Potter's column. That should never have happened. But before concluding that political pressure forced the university to intervene, consider that McGill - a Montreal institution that more than most reflects Canada's language duality - was also probably reacting to internal stresses among its staff.
Judging from some of the letters to the editor published last week, some of Potter's academic colleagues were up in arms over his column.
Universities should not be in the business of endorsing or repudiating the views of the academics they employ. But by the same token, nor should McGill have defended an indefensible column.
Potter himself retracted part of it the next day. Any columnist working for a serious media organization would have had to do the same thing or else ended up having a public editor do it in his or her place.
Alternative facts should not be the stuff that acts of journalistic courage or martyrdom are based on.
At the end of a week from hell, Potter is out of his job as director of McGill's Institute for the Study of Canada.
It is not clear whether he resigned of his own free will or under duress from his employer.
But even if the university had gone on bended knees to beg him to stay on, Potter should still have relinquished the position.
McGill's Institute for the Study of Canada is not a run-of-the-mill university department. A significant part of its mission is to contribute to the larger Quebec conversation.
McGill's rather unique position at one of the key junction points on the language map makes that contribution essential.
It would have been hard going forward for someone who is - for now at least - widely perceived as willing to think the worst of Quebec and Quebecers to operate the institute to its full potential.
In closing, I hope Potter stays on in Montreal and at McGill, where he continues to hold his teaching position.
I hope he discovers why so many of us would not live anywhere else - even if we do have to pay the taxes on our restaurant bills. Copyright 2017 Torstar Syndication Services

From Potter’s perspective the episode that saw hundreds of motorists left stranded on the Montreal section of a provincial highway for an entire night at the time of last week’s massive snowstorm fit the bill. It is not clear why he would have come to that conclusion.
By all accounts those left stranded by the authorities on Highway 13 managed to avoid serious harm by going out of their way to help each other.
As a Montrealer by adoption, I have never found the kindness of strangers to be in shorter supply in Quebec than in my Ontario birthplace. Last week’s storm was no exception.
Absent any evidence to back up his core contention that the Highway 13 saga was a manifestation of widespread societal alienation, Potter fell back on sloppy generalizations about routine double-billing in Montreal restaurant bills (for tax evasion purposes) and ATM machines that spout out $50 bills by default.
Those were demonstrably false. It begged the question of whether Potter was confusing Montreal with Absurdistan.
Contrary to what is becoming popular belief in some media circles, Quebec’s political class did not rush to the barricades to denounce the column. The media dragged it there.
The first to voice serious concerns about Potter’s arguments were journalists who had cause to know better. On social media, the Montreal Gazette’s veteran restaurant critic Lesley Chesterman was among those who led the charge.
McGill University waded in to the fray with a tweet dissociating itself from Potter’s column.
That should never have happened.
But before concluding that political pressure forced the university to intervene, consider that McGill — a Montreal institution that more than most reflects Canada’s language duality — was also probably reacting to internal stresses among its staff.
Judging from some of the letters-to-the-editor published this week, some of Potter’s academic colleagues were up in arms over his column.
Universities should not be in the business of endorsing or repudiating the views of the academics they employ. But by the same token, nor should McGill have defended an indefensible column.
Potter himself retracted part of it the next day. Any columnist working for a serious media organization would have had to do the same thing or else ended up having a public editor do it in his or her place.
Alternative facts should not be the stuff that acts of journalistic courage or martyrdom are based on.
At the end of a week from hell Potter is out of his job as director of McGill’s Institute for the Study of Canada. It is not clear that he resigned of his own free will or under duress from his employer.
But even if the university had gone on bended knees to beg him to stay on, Potter should still have relinquished the position.
McGill’s Institute for the Study of Canada is not a run-of-the-mill university department. A significant part of its mission is to contribute to the larger Quebec conversation. McGill’s rather unique position at one of the key junction points on the language map makes that contribution essential.
It would have been hard going forward for someone who is — for now at least — widely perceived as willing to think the worst of Quebec and Quebecers to operate the institute to its full potential.
In closing, I hope Potter stays on in Montreal and at McGill where he continues to hold his teaching position and discovers why so many of us would not live anywhere else, even if we do have to pay the taxes on our restaurant bills.

Full text: MONTREAL - It was shoddy journalism not a debatable take on Quebec society that cost former Ottawa Citizen editor Andrew Potter his 'dream job" as head of McGill University's prestigious Institute for the Study of Canada this week.
He failed to let the facts get in the way of a good rant.
Potter wanted to make the case that Quebec - contrary to its collective belief - suffers from a chronic deficit of solidarity. He had statistics that he believed demonstrated he was on to something.
Maybe he was, maybe he was not: that was not the real point of the exercise.
A public intellectual should stir the occasional hornet's nest, even at the risk of painful stings.
Like all good columnists Potter looked for a peg for his arguments. Piggybacking a story that already has a lot of traction is a sure shortcut to a large audience. It pays to pick one's moment.
One will, for instance, write about Finance Minister Bill Morneau's learning curve as a political communicator around the time of the budget and not in the dead of summer.

'The conditions were perfect'; Flight school at a loss for cause of mid-air plane collision

Full text: MONTREAL -- Cargair, the school that was training two pilots who crashed mid-air over a South Shore mall Friday, does not think mechanical problems, the weather or language barriers were factors in the accident.
The students -- both from China -- were studying to be airline pilots. One of them died, the other was seriously injured. There were no passengers on the planes, both of which had taken off from the nearby St-Hubert Airport.
One of the planes ended up in Promenades Saint-Bruno's parking lot, the other on the mall's roof.
"The cause is not obvious," Daniel Adams, operations manager and director of flight safety at Cargair, said in an interview. He said it's the first such incident in the company's history.
On Friday, "there was no reason to think something like this could happen. The conditions were perfect. It was a storm of good weather: there was no wind, it was magnificent, the visibility was excellent. So what happened?"
Adams, who has spoken with investigators from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said the cause "doesn't seem to be a mechanical problem. Zero risk doesn't exist but we do everything we can every day to attenuate that risk."
He said both pilots spoke English well and the control tower was communicating with them in English.
A recording of the communication between the air-traffic control tower and one of the planes indicates that seconds before the collision, one of the pilots did not respond to four attempts to contact him about his altitude.
The planes crashed after one of the pilots inexplicably changed altitude, said Adams, who has been a pilot for 20 years.
Friday was a sunny day but Adams said he does not think the sun played a role in the collision.
"When you're at the same altitude, yes the sun can be a factor but if a pilot is descending or ascending and not following instructions from the tower, then it's not a question of the weather but of the piloting."
The 21-year-old man piloting the plane that landed in the parking lot died, while the other pilot, a 23-year-old man, was seriously injured. Doctors do not fear for his life. Their identities have not been made public.
The man who died had a student-pilot permit and had 40 hours of flight time after seven months at the Cargair pilot academy, Adams said.
The injured man had a private-pilot license and had 140 hours of flight time after a year at Cargair.
Before they took off, the pilots' instructors would have checked whether conditions and the pilots' planned routes, Adams said.
They were both flying Cesna 152 aircraft, which are "the most used planes for pilot training," he added. "They are very forgiving, very reliable and relatively simple to maintain."
Cargair, which describes itself as Canada's largest private pilot school, instructs about 150 pilots every year for airlines in China, where training facilities can't keep up with demand, Adams said.
The flight training, which Cargair has been providing to Chinese students for more than a decade, takes about 15 months, with pilots graduating with a commercial license that requires a minimum of 200 hours of flight time.
Chinese students are taught in English.
"It's clear that language comprehension was not an issue here, both students spoke English and met the language requirements for the training," said Adams, who heard part of the recording of the communication between the tower and the pilots.
Investigators are to meet with the surviving pilot as well as the pilots' instructors. They will also review the tower-pilot communication, as well as radar data showing the planes' flight paths.
Cargair, which also has facilities in Mirabel, Trois-Rivieres and Saguenay, trains about 250 pilots a year. The company, founded in 1961, has 130 employees and owns 60 planes used for training.
Promenades Saint-Bruno, which closed after the accident occurred early on Friday afternoon, said it will reopen on Sunday morning.

Some trapped drivers spent all night in vehicles

Full text: During Tuesday night's snowstorm in Montreal, 300 vehicles - and their occupants - were stuck on the lanes of southbound Highway 13 for close to 14 hours.
On Wednesday morning, hundreds of cars were still jammed on the highway, which reopened at noon. A massive towing operation could be seen from an overpass of the Cote-de-Liesse expressway overlooking the highway.
One of those trapped overnight was Andre Soulard, a driver for the delivery company ICS Courrier. He said he slept in his car after getting trapped in the exit ramp for the westbound Cote-de-Liesse expressway from the northbound Highway 13. His colleague, Jose DeSousa, was also stuck in his delivery truck.
"I got stuck at 6:30 last night and just got out now," Soulard told the Montreal Gazette at about 9 a.m. while walking on the sidewalk of the expressway's service road. "I'm lucky that my colleagues came to bail me out. The truck is still stuck there."
Relatively speaking, Ed Garcia was one of the lucky ones. He only spent six hours overnight Tuesday to Wednesday marooned on the southbound lanes of Highway 13, rather than the 12 to 14 hours many other motorists had to endure after an accident at the 520 exit shut down the entire stretch of the road between Highways 40 and 20.
The 45-year-old Garcia's ordeal began at about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday when, returning home to N.D.G. from work, he turned off Highway 40 and south onto Highway 13, which was already a parking lot because of the accident.
However, that essential information wasn't spelled out by the roadside signs that Transport Quebec uses to update local traffic conditions.
"You know that digital billboard?" he told the Montreal Gazette Wednesday morning. "It said 'Highway 13 south, incident at Highway 20.' Then it said 'Highway 13 south, exit 520 closed,' when it should have said 'Highway 13 south closed at exit 520.' " Whatever the billboard's problem with details, Garcia realized something was up two kilometres after he exited the 40. "I just stopped.
"I was stuck at the end of the (Montreal-Trudeau) airport runway just about the whole time."
Garcia says he "listened to the radio, listened to the hockey game" to pass the time. "I'm pragmatic. There was nothing else you can do."
However, luck was on Garcia's side in the form of a canteen truck that was stuck right alongside of him.
"He just opened up for business," he said. "At about one in the morning, someone knocked on his window and asked if he took Interac. I was second in line and by the time I turned around there was a line of 20 people at least and others were walking toward him from down the highway."
As it appeared his gas gauge was getting too low, Garcia said he finally cut his engine at 2 a.m., "just in case."
But about 30 minutes later, traffic, at least that section of it Garcia found himself in, started to move.
"Someone decided to uncork the exit for Cote-de-Liesse inside the tunnel," he said. "Within four minutes I was through the exit. Everything moved very orderly, everyone just wanting to get the heck off that highway."
But Garcia noted that when drivers stuck south of the exit realized what was happening, "people were making U-turns and driving in reverse to get back up to the exit. It was horrible."
Garcia said he's disappointed provincial police didn't give drivers the option of backing up onto Highway 40, and said in the six hours he was stuck on the highway he didn't see a single police officer. Once traffic started to move, he added, some drivers had clearly fallen asleep while others hurriedly pulled out their shovels because they'd become stuck in the still falling snow as well as the traffic.
"Only 10 minutes before we started rolling, I saw the first snowplow heading north on Highway 13."
Thirty minutes later, Garcia was walking through the front door of his home. "That's how empty the rest of the streets were."
Those who were towed were surprised to see that they were fined and ticketed for blocking the highway.
That's what happened to Mark Taddeo, co-owner of Chateauguaybased Newfi Transport. One of his truck drivers got stuck on the highway and spent the night in his cab. After being towed off the highway, the towing operator, Burstall Conrad, charged him $900 to get the truck back.
"We had to pay it, to get our truck back," Taddeo said. "We're obviously going to contest that."
Transport Minister Laurent Lessard said people charged for towing will be reimbursed by the province. Burstall Conrad could not be reached for a comment on Wednesday. jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist James Mennie of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this report.

Jan. 6, 1981 Weathering Montreal'S Outdoors

Author: Mosher, Terry

Abstract: In March 1971, a blizzard dumped 43 centimetres of snow on Montreal in a single day, the equivalent of 500,000 truckloads.Because Montreal can be a town of extremes, including temperatures, many of the city's activities are determined by weather cycles.After dealing with the January '98 Ice Storm, Montrealers were absolutely gleeful the following year when Toronto's mayor Mel Lastman called in the army to do battle with a mere metre of snow!

Full text: In March 1971, a blizzard dumped 43 centimetres of snow on Montreal in a single day, the equivalent of 500,000 truckloads. Powerful winds downed power lines; sectors of the island were without electricity for as long as 10 days. A Habs home game was even cancelled, something that hadn't happened since the influenza epidemic of 1918. In Quebec, it was referred to as the Snowstorm of the Century.
Then, shortly after New Year's Day in 1998, we were struck by an even larger meteorological catastrophe. The "North American Ice Storm" claimed 35 lives and caused $5 billion+ of damage.
Weather is one of the most common themes in my Montreal Gazette cartoons, after political subject matter. These cartoons provoke passionate reactions from readers. Because Montreal can be a town of extremes, including temperatures, many of the city's activities are determined by weather cycles.
Nevertheless, Montrealers take some pride in being able to handle these extremes as well as, or even better than, any other city. After dealing with the January '98 Ice Storm, Montrealers were absolutely gleeful the following year when Toronto's mayor Mel Lastman called in the army to do battle with a mere metre of snow! In contrast to the severe temperatures of January and February, June and July are probably Montreal's best months. August is a time to rest up, preferably by some lake or even the ocean. In September, the most industrious of months, we all get busy with a lot more work and less play. In October, we forgive the slight cooling in the air because of the stupendous autumn colours - and the return of hockey. And then, is it any wonder that we hold the aptly named Grey Cup in November, the last major Canadian outdoor sporting event before winter hibernation? Of all the cartoons I've drawn on the subject of weather for The Gazette, this is the one readers seem to recall the most. Let me tell you why I drew it: It was for those mornings - perhaps a dozen between November and March - when I would look out the window and just couldn't deal with the idea of digging out my car again. I thought that I might simply phone my editors and say: "Reprint the battery cartoon, will you?" But they were never there. They were always late, digging out their own damn cars! So, what else to do but get on with it - shovel myself out, go to work, and draw another cartoon ...
On April 5, Terry Mosher's new book will be published. From Trudeau to Trudeau: Fifty Years of Aislin Cartoons has an introduction by Bob Rae. Also, Montreal's McCord Museum will present an Aislin retrospective from April 7 to Aug. 13.

Full text: Everybody wants to be a DJ, as classic rap act De La Soul once said. With his new interactive show, Kid Koala aims to give the people what they want.
The Montreal scratch DJ allows fans to get in the mix by providing attendees with their own turntable consoles and stacks of colourcoded vinyl records. At specific moments throughout the performance, different coloured lights come on, indicating which vinyl to use as concertgoers participate in his 50-turntable orchestra.
Instructions may be required, judging from a test run Kid Koala did at Toronto's Luminato Festival in 2015. Some young 'uns, it turns out, had never used a turntable.
Audience interaction has been a running theme in the DJ's shows for years now. Allowing fans to actually do what he does just seemed like the logical next step.
"For me, it's about that feeling of touching the sound (on the record), controlling it, bending it, playing it backward," said Kid Koala, whose real name is Eric San. "It's a really fun feeling if you've never had a tactile interface with audio.
"For this show, the way I see it, it's like when everyone holds up lighters at a rock concert. When you look at it, it becomes something beyond what you think a bunch of glimmering lighters would look like. It becomes this beautiful, connected, expansive thing, even though everyone is just responsible for their little point of light. This is the audio version: you're responsible for a tiny part of the sound in the room, but together it makes something greater than its parts."
Fittingly, people won't be playing along to what one might typically think of as DJ music - no thumping beats or crowd-rousing MCs. Instead, they're bringing to life songs from Kid Koala's new album, Music To Draw To: Satellite, released recently on Arts & Crafts.
As the title suggests, it's pretty low-key stuff - the kind of breathtakingly pretty, ambient music that lets the mind wander. And is custom-made to draw to. Or write to (which I can confirm, as that's precisely what I'm doing right now). Or doodle to. Or write a screenplay to.
Interestingly, the album found its anchor with ethereal Icelandic vocalist Emilíana Torrini.
A longtime fan of her music, Kid Koala finally reached out to her when he needed a singer for a track he had made for Jason Reitman's 2014 film Men, Women and Children. When that worked out, he got up the nerve to ask her to sing on his new album.
Picking Torrini up at Montreal's Trudeau airport in October 2015, Kid Koala didn't know what they were going to get up to for the next 10 days while he hosted the singer in his loft/recording studio. "Prior to that, we had spoken for 10, 15 minutes," the 42-year-old said.
For the first four days, they didn't enter the studio at all.
"(My wife) Corinne calls it our dating period," Kid Koala said. "(Torrini) was like, 'I want to go buy jeans - they're very expensive in Iceland.' Or 'I want to go see this movie.' We were literally not doing any music at all. We were just getting to know each other. We talked about everyday life, what makes us happy or sad, breakups. Then she told me about this article about this Mars mission."
The story involved a woman who had been accepted to be one of the volunteer astronauts on Dutch company Mars One's flight to the planet in 2022, and would be leaving her partner behind.
"That struck a chord with both of us," Kid Koala said.
A metaphor-laden concept was in place: two lovers, worlds apart. The next morning, Kid Koala awoke at 4 a.m. and penned the song Adrift. When Torrini emerged, he handed her the lyrics and nervously awaited her reaction. Ten minutes later, they were in his studio recording it.
In the end, Kid Koala wrote lyrics to five songs on the album (Torrini wrote two), marking his debut as a lyricist.
"I didn't set out to make a personal record, but there was stuff I had to figure out, and get through," he said. "It was the perfect storm of circumstances."

Former police internal affairs head is no stranger to controversy

Full text: A chief inspector who until recently was the head of the Montreal police internal affairs department appears to be the common thread connecting several recent controversies that have rattled the police force.
Within less than a year, Costa Labos was cleared in one police investigation and became the subject of another alleging he prevented two Montreal police officers from providing evidence that might have cleared a homicide detective of wrongdoing in 2009.
When the police spying scandal erupted last fall, Labos acknowledged that he authorized the surveillance of La Presse journalist Patrick Lagace's cellphone. Labos is also one of the people at the centre of the storm following allegations that surfaced in TVA's investigative report that aired on Tuesday. And, earlier this month, charges produced through an investigation supervised by Labos were stayed by a judge after Crown prosecutors announced they would not prosecute Andre Thibodeau, a former Montreal police sergeant who was charged with illegal bookmaking, because they could not proceed with the evidence gathered by the Montreal police internal affairs department.
When Thibodeau's case was tossed out he alleged, to the Montreal Gazette, that internal affairs investigators "lied to justices of the peace" in order to obtain warrants in the bookmaking investigation. The allegations are similar to what was reported in TVA's story on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Thibodeau declined to comment on TVA's report because there are issues related to his case he is still seeking to have resolved.
The investigation Labos was cleared in, in September, involved allegations he lied to a judge in order to obtain a warrant to search the home of Roger Lariviere, a now-retired Montreal police detective after he was spotted at a restaurant on Mont-Royal Ave., on Oct. 9, 2014, with journalist Stephane Berthomet. The investigation involved whether Labos lied in saying he had information that Lariviere (who was interviewed in TVA's story) leaked sensitive information to the journalist.
Lariviere called the investigation abusive and one that tarnished his reputation in a lawsuit he filed in 2015 seeking compensation for being turned down for a promotion to be named commander of a neighbourhood police station. In December, a Superior Court judge set the limit for what Lariviere can sue for at $700,000. The case is still pending.
In September, Montreal police Chief Philippe Pichet said Labos continued to have his support after he was cleared in the investigation involving Lariviere. But weeks later Labos was transferred to a position leaving him in charge of the department that handles 911 calls.
In an interview with Radio-Canada on Wednesday, Pichet confirmed that Labos is currently being investigated by the Surete du Quebec for something that was alleged in open court, in 2010, during the trial of Mario Lambert, a former Montreal police homicide detective who was charged in 2009 with the improper use of a police database. Lambert was convicted of fraud in 2012 but that was later overturned by the Quebec Court of Appeal.
The SQ is investigating whether Labos prevented the internal affairs investigators assigned to the case from talking to two detectivesergeants who claimed they had information that would clear Lambert, whose career was ruined after he was charged.
Since news of the investigation involving Lariviere surfaced eight months ago, Labos has been the subject of many news articles. But he has generated headlines in the past as well. In 1998, the Quebec police ethics committee suspended Labos for four days for his behaviour while he and five other police officers raided an apartment in Plateau Mont-Royal in 1995.
The officers were looking for a suspect in a series of armed robberies. The man wasn't home but his parents were. During the raid, the suspect's mother informed Labos her son wasn't home. Labos allegedly replied by saying: "Shut up, you bitch" and pointed his service firearm at the suspect's father. The couple also alleged that Labos threatened revenge if they complained about his conduct.
The couple later sued Labos and the Montreal police for nearly $30,000. The case was settled out of court in 2002. pcherry@postmedia.com

Sud-Ouest snow removal is abysmal, residents say

Author: Wilton, Katherine

Abstract: According to the city, 76 per cent of the snow that fell last week has been cleared from the borough's streets. D'Amour also refused to explain why it has taken his workers so long to remove snow from Coursol St. Trevor Williams, a basketball coach at Dawson College, said he often has to carry his daughter two blocks to his car because he can't park in front of his house on Coursol.

Full text: When the city of Montreal announced it would cancel a snowremoval contract in the Sud-Ouest borough, Paul Gott and his neighbours on Coursol St. were not surprised.
While many Montrealers have been grumbling about the slow pace of snow removal after last week's storm, Gott said one side of his street hasn't been cleared since the Christmas holidays.
"It has been kind of crazy; there is nowhere to park," Gott said on Monday. "I pay for a parking permit but have to park around the corner because of the snow."
Gott has lived on the street for 30 years and said the snow removal has never been so slow.
On many parts of Coursol St., the icy sidewalks are still treacherous. Neighbouring streets such as Vinet and Dominion still have snowbanks that are three feet high.
On Sunday, the company contracted to clear the snow put up signs saying they would remove the snow on Coursol St. during the day on Monday. Gott said he wasn't holding his breath.
"They put signs up last week and towed some cars, but they never came and cleared the snow," said Gott, who teaches at Concordia University.
In a followup discussion with the Montreal Gazette Monday evening, Gott said the snow had finally been cleared around 6 p.m.
Gott said it often takes six or seven days for his one-way street to be cleared, but he has never had to wait this long. He said Mother Nature has done a better job of removing some of the snow than the snow-removal company, Pavages D'Amour.
Last week, the city of Montreal announced it would cancel a $16-million, five-year contract with the firm at the end of the season.
Complaints to the borough about insufficient snow clearing were eight times higher than the norm, borough mayor Benoit Dorais said last week.
The city's executive committee chairman, Pierre Desrochers, said the situation in the Sud-Ouest borough "is totally unacceptable."
"There has been a breach of trust between the contractor and borough," he said.
The company has been able to fulfil snow-clearing contracts in Lachine and Ahuntsic-Cartierville and on the West Island, but failed in the congested Sud-Ouest neighbourhoods of St-Henri, Little Burgundy, Pointe-St-Charles and Griffintown because they underestimated the amount of work and resources required for a dense urban setting, Desrochers said last week.
According to the city, 76 per cent of the snow that fell last week has been cleared from the borough's streets.
When contacted by the Montreal Gazette on Monday, company president Stephane D'Amour refused to comment on the city's decision to cancel the contract. D'Amour also refused to explain why it has taken his workers so long to remove snow from Coursol St.
Trevor Williams, a basketball coach at Dawson College, said he often has to carry his daughter two blocks to his car because he can't park in front of his house on Coursol.
"It has been horrible trying to get to daycare," Williams said. "We have been complaining and the neighbours are talking about it on our Facebook page. It's ridiculous." kwilton@postmedia.com

Picking Torrini up at Montreal's Trudeau airport in October 2015, Kid Koala didn't know what they were going to get up to for the next 10 days while he hosted the singer in his loft/recording studio. "Prior to that, we had spoken for 10, 15 minutes," the 42-year-old said.
For the first four days, they didn't enter the studio at all.
"(My wife) Corinne calls it our dating period," Kid Koala said. "(Torrini) was like, 'I want to go buy jeans - they're very expensive in Iceland.' Or 'I want to go see this movie.' We were literally not doing any music at all. We were just getting to know each other. We talked about everyday life, what makes us happy or sad, breakups. Then she told me about this article about this Mars mission."
The story involved a woman who had been accepted to be one of the volunteer astronauts on Dutch company Mars One's flight to the planet in 2022, and would be leaving her partner behind.
"That struck a chord with both of us," Kid Koala said.
A metaphor-laden concept was in place: two lovers, worlds apart. The next morning, Kid Koala awoke at 4 a.m. and penned the song Adrift. When Torrini emerged, he handed her the lyrics and nervously awaited her reaction. Ten minutes later, they were in his studio recording it.
In the end, Kid Koala wrote lyrics to five songs on the album (Torrini wrote two), marking his debut as a lyricist.
"I didn't set out to make a personal record, but there was stuff I had to figure out, and get through," he said. "It was the perfect storm of circumstances."

Full text: Everybody wants to be a DJ, as classic rap act De La Soul once said. With his new interactive show, Kid Koala aims to give the people what they want.
The Montreal scratch DJ allows fans to get in the mix by providing attendees with their own turntable consoles and stacks of colourcoded vinyl records. At specific moments throughout the performance, different coloured lights come on, indicating which vinyl to use as concertgoers participate in his 50-turntable orchestra.
Instructions may be required, judging from a test run Kid Koala did at Toronto's Luminato Festival in 2015. Some young 'uns, it turns out, had never used a turntable.
Audience interaction has been a running theme in the DJ's shows for years now. Allowing fans to actually do what he does just seemed like the logical next step.
"For me, it's about that feeling of touching the sound (on the record), controlling it, bending it, playing it backward," said Kid Koala, whose real name is Eric San. "It's a really fun feeling if you've never had a tactile interface with audio.
"For this show, the way I see it, it's like when everyone holds up lighters at a rock concert. When you look at it, it becomes something beyond what you think a bunch of glimmering lighters would look like. It becomes this beautiful, connected, expansive thing, even though everyone is just responsible for their little point of light. This is the audio version: you're responsible for a tiny part of the sound in the room, but together it makes something greater than its parts."
Fittingly, people won't be playing along to what one might typically think of as DJ music - no thumping beats or crowd-rousing MCs. Instead, they're bringing to life songs from Kid Koala's new album, Music To Draw To: Satellite, released recently on Arts & Crafts.
As the title suggests, it's pretty low-key stuff - the kind of breathtakingly pretty, ambient music that lets the mind wander. And is custom-made to draw to. Or write to (which I can confirm, as that's precisely what I'm doing right now). Or doodle to. Or write a screenplay to.
Interestingly, the album found its anchor with ethereal Icelandic vocalist Emilíana Torrini.
A longtime fan of her music, Kid Koala finally reached out to her when he needed a singer for a track he had made for Jason Reitman's 2014 film Men, Women and Children. When that worked out, he got up the nerve to ask her to sing on his new album.

City cancels Sud-Ouest snow-removal contract; Les Pavages D'Amour Inc.'s work deemed 'totally unacceptable'

Abstract: After a meeting with the owners of the firm, Montreal mayor Denis Coderre and several borough mayors Wednesday evening, the city decided it will pass a motion in city council to end its contract with Pavages D'Amour at the end of this season.

Full text: There was the snow plow that punctured the gas line, forcing residents from their homes.
There was the sidewalk plow that rammed into the bicycle and the parking-sign post to which it was tethered, repeatedly, caught on a video that went viral.
There was the plow that pushed the trash lining the sidewalk out into the street, garbage cans and all, along with the snow to be picked up.
But ultimately, it was the failure of the snow plows and snow blowers of Les Pavages D'Amour Inc. to actually clear the snow that convinced the city of Montreal it was time to cancel its $16-million, five-year contract with the firm in the Sud-Ouest borough.
At 11 a.m. Thursday, only 24 per cent of the snow that fell on Sunday had been cleared from the borough's streets, as compared to a city average of 57 per cent.
"The situation in the Sud-Ouest borough is totally unacceptable," city executive committee chairman Pierre Desrochers said. "There has been a breach of trust between the contractor and the borough."
After a meeting with the owners of the firm, Montreal mayor Denis Coderre and several borough mayors Wednesday evening, the city decided it will pass a motion in city council to end its contract with Pavages D'Amour at the end of this season. The contract began this winter.
Complaints to the borough for insufficient snow-clearing were eight times higher than the norm, borough mayor Benoit Dorais said.
The company has been able to fulfil snow-clearing contracts in Lachine, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and on the West Island, but failed in the congested Sud-Ouest neighbourhoods of St-Henri, Little Burgundy, Pointe-St-Charles and Griffintown because they underestimated the amount of work and resources required for a dense urban setting, Desrochers said.
"They bit off more than they could chew," he said.
St-Henri native Jean-Yves Lecompte said the sidewalks were in the worst condition he had seen in his 64 years, with mothers unable to push strollers down the street and seniors frightened to venture out.
The Journal de Montreal ran a story Thursday about 23-year-old epileptic cancer patient Charles-Eric Brown Laroche who has been unable to leave his apartment in his wheelchair since Sunday and can't get to his medical appointments because buses can't get down his street.
The city is confident Pavages D'Amour will fulfil the end of its contract this winter because it has contracts with other boroughs that it will want to protect, Desrochers said. The 40 per cent of the borough cleared by its own blue-collar workers and equipment were well maintained, the city said.
All boroughs use a mix of private contractors and city staff because it would be too expensive for the city to hire the staff and buy the trucks needed for work that is only required five months of the year.
Pavages D'Amour did not return a call from the Montreal Gazette.
In Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace, which had the second-lowest number of streets among the city's 19 boroughs cleared at 38 per cent, city officials said the density of the neighbourhood, narrowness of some of its streets and high level of street parking make snow clearing more challenging there.
As well, the borough had decided to clear the remnants of the ice storm that fell last week from its streets to be ready for Sunday's storm. Since private contractors must be given a 24-hour break after seven straight days of snowclearing, the borough had to pause much of its operations Wednesday night, borough general manager Stephane Plante said.
They will be working extra time as of Thursday night and into the weekend to catch up, he said.
In suburban areas of the city, less traffic and fewer vehicles parked on the street mean snow plows can clear the roads relatively quickly.
The second step of snow removal is often not required in many suburbs because plows push the snow to the edge of residential properties.
"I must admit though, it is simpler (here) than in Montreal because we have a no-parking law in the winter for overnight," Beaconsfield Mayor Georges Bourelle said. "So when there is a storm we start working around midnight, between midnight and 2 a.m. depending on the storm, and we can rapidly go through our city."
The municipality deploys about eight to 10 trucks to clear snow from approximately 125 kilometres of roads and another 30 kilometres of sidewalks.

Full text: QUEBEC Let's face it, a crisis is what Quebec premiers do best.
There was Pauline Marois in the 2013 Lac-Megantic train tragedy and the fire at a L'Isle-Verte seniors residence. Lucien Bouchard in the 1998 ice storm.
In all cases, Quebec's leaders put their immediate political concerns aside to rise to the occasion and actually lead the province through times of great distress.
And as sad as such events are - and Quebec seems plagued by the most grim - they can actually lead to positive outcomes once the dust settles; a way to break a logjam in public opinion, create change or, in this case, lance the boil that religious minority-majority relations have become.
Two years into his mandate, Premier Philippe Couillard got just such a crisis, this week, in the horrific shooting deaths of six Muslim men, standing in prayer, in a mosque in the sleepy Quebec City suburb of Ste-Foy.
"I immediately felt it was a turning point for our society," Couillard said Friday after a Liberal caucus here when asked by the Montreal Gazette about the week that was.
"You know how affirmative I have been over the years on the issue of inclusion and an open, tolerant society.
"It came to get me very, very deeply. I felt a lot of the pain. I felt the need to rally everyone in Quebec around this concept of equal citizenship and tolerance.
"That's what I'm here for, essentially."
In other words, Couillard was doing his job and, although unpleasant, had a chance to wade in deep on an issue he understands well enough to not underestimate its explosive potential.
He was everywhere, starting Sunday evening when events yanked him from his bed in St-Felicien to rush back to calm the province and especially the rattled and stunned provincial capital in a middle-ofthe night news conference.
The next day, on a few hours' sleep, there he was with Regis Labeaume - Quebec City's shaken mayor - at the first emotional news conference with Muslim leaders at Quebec City hall. The tears were flowing on all sides.
In the evening, he shared the stage with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other political leaders at an evening vigil in Ste-Foy, which drew about 5,000 people.
On Tuesday, the government admitted television cameras to a special cabinet meeting where ministers stood for a moment of silence before discussing government actions in the wake of a brutal wake-up call.
Emerging from cabinet, Couillard made one of a series of pitches for everyone to tone down the rhetoric when it comes to identity politics because, as he said, words can be "knives, slashing at people's conscience."
"Freedom of speech has consequences, good ones and bad ones," he said. "We're all responsible."
But it was the two major speeches he delivered, at the Montreal funeral Thursday and the one in Quebec City Friday, where Couillard the humanist opened his heart in remarks made directly to the beleaguered and hurt community.
"We feel your pain," he told the thousands in Montreal.
"We share your pain. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. When one of you suffers, we all do."
On Friday, Couillard used his speech to translate certain Arabic words, which he said are too often associated with terror and violent acts because they appear helter skelter in movies and the media.
"We see now what these words mean for the Muslim community," he said. "They are spiritual words."
His ease connecting to the community and language had to be a sweet moment for Couillard.
For years his opponents have tried to paint him as ill-equipped to deal with identity issues because in his youth he spent time in Saudi Arabia working as a doctor.
No longer a negative, Couillard ran with it and it was noticed.
Boufeldja Benabdallah, cofounder of the Islamic cultural centre, heaped praise on both Trudeau and Couillard Friday in his remarks at the funeral.
"He (Couillard) gave us compassion," Benabdallah said. "He said words have strength, words have their place, words can wound and words can cause joy. Together, let's put words in the right place."
This was not the Couillard Quebecers are used to seeing. Often accused of being a cold, Cartesian intellectual, Couillard this week was the guy with a hug for the grieving family member and even a shoulder for Labeaume when he became emotional at the Montreal funeral.
It's true in a moment of crisis people naturally gravitate toward a person who incarnates stability, but Couillard earned some kudos from unlikely sources.
Journal de Montreal's columnist Richard Martineau, not a man considered particularly friendly to any politician, recognized that Couillard found the right words to say at the right time.
"He was calm, reassuring, dignified," Martineau wrote.
Couillard's tone was also praised in an editorial in the New York Times, which contrasted his plea for tolerance with U.S. President Donald Trump's confrontational vision of the planet.
There are other spinoffs in the wake of the crisis. Sparked in part by Mayor Labeaume, a kind of grassroots movement in Quebec City is growing to clean the trash radio stations - often identified as part of the problem.
One host, FM93 morning host Sylvain Bouchard, apologized on the air, acknowledging the station does not even have one phone number of a Muslim citizen on file to talk to on air.
Politically, there are signs of a fragile truce with the opposition Parti Quebecois and Coalition Avenir Quebec parties on identity. Both said this week Quebec has to be able to debate identity issues, with the PQ at least conceding there's a right way and a wrong way.
PQ Leader Jean-Francois Lisee was the first to take his lumps, agreeing his leadership campaign statement about the dangers of immigrants hiding AK-47's in burkas was out of line.
PQ leadership candidate Alexandre Cloutier said the legislature has not done enough to fight Islamaphobia.
Couillard went a step further, saying while the current climate does not lend itself to re-starting the identity debate, this might be the time to find common ground on the secularism legislation the Liberals currently have before the house, Bill 62.
The legislature resumes sitting next Tuesday.
"We agree on a great number of subjects (such as no face coverings for government services)," he said.
"Why not adopt together the things we agree on?" As he said earlier this week, he's hoping for a "before and after" in the attacks.
But Quebec has a way to go. After Thursday's vandalism of a mosque in Pointe-St-Charles, Quebec City police Friday arrested a 20-yearold man for allegedly hate-mongering on his Facebook page.
And as one white francophone man in the street in Quebec City remarked Thursday, a day after seeing the thousands who attended the Montreal memorial: "Who knew there were that many Muslims in Quebec?" pauthier@postmedia.com

'We're returning to more classic winter weather'

Full text:   Thanks to La Nina, Montrealers can expect more snow and colder temperatures than last year, experts say. Andy Riga provides your guide to surviving shovelling marathons, icy roads and power failures.
FORECAST After getting off easy last winter, Montrealers should brace themselves for a return to cold, snowy weather, forecasters say.
In case you're out of practice, the Montreal Gazette has put together a shovelling, driving and powerfailure winter survival guide. But first, the forecast. The winter of 2015-16 was milder than usual thanks to the El Nino phenomenon, with less snow, more rain and warmer temperatures.
The one that looms ahead is expected to be marked by La Nina, which normally results in colder weather in Canada.
Between October 2015 and April 2016, 169 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal. If the long-term forecasts are correct and an average amount of snow falls this winter, Montrealers can expect 210 cm - 41 cm more than last year.
"We have the La Nina event going on this year - some coolerthan-normal water down in the equatorial Pacific, off the coast of South America - that's going to be a big driver for us this winter," Weather Network meteorologist Michael Carter said in an interview.
After analyzing historical trends and global weather patterns, he's predicting a return to a traditional chilly, white Montreal winter this year.
"We're returning to more classic winter weather after a very mild winter last year - temperatures that are near normal to perhaps a bit below normal, along with frequent storms and plenty of snow," Carter said.
Environment Canada is also forecasting a whiter, cooler winter for Montreal.
SHOVELLING Shovellers have more to fear than ill-timed city snow plows undoing hours of work.
The combination of physical exertion and cold weather can increase the risk of a heart attack, especially in inactive people and those with heart disease.
"Scooping heavy, wet snow raises your heart rate quickly," the Heart and Stroke Foundation warns. "Add in cold temperatures that raise blood pressure and increase the likelihood of developing blood clots, and it can be deadly."
If you load your shovel with five kilograms of snow every five seconds, you'll have moved almost 1,000 kilograms of snow after 15 minutes. That's hard on the heart and the back.
Here are some shovelling tips from the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety:
Pace yourself. Take frequent breaks and drink warm, nonalcoholic beverages.
Push snow rather than lift it.
If you must throw snow, only pick up as much snow as you can easily lift. Then, rather than twist at the waist, turn your feet toward the direction at which you're aiming.
Avoid overheating; wear thin, breathable layers.
Don't shovel on a full stomach. Digest your meals first; otherwise, shovelling could put an extra strain on your heart.
Stop shovelling if you experience sudden shortness of breath, discomfort in the chest, lightheadedness, nausea, dizziness, or severe headache and immediately seek medical attention.
SHOVELS SHOULD:
Be light (about 1.5 kilograms or three pounds), and sturdy.
Feature a handle that reaches the users's chest to reduce forward bending.
Include a shaft with a bend.
Have the right blade for the job at hand. A large push-style shovel will let you move more snow but may lead you to lift heavy loads. Smaller blades are best for lifting and throwing snow.
MONTREAL SNOW STATISTICS 210 cm Average snowfall (October-April) 169 cm Snowfall (2015-16) 41 cm Additional snow expected this winter compared to last winter (if forecasters are correct) 383.3 cm Most snow in one winter. In 1970-71. That includes 43 cm that fell in one day during the March 1971 "storm of the century" that killed 17 Montrealers.
92.9 cm Least snowfall in one winter (1979-80) Green Christmas: 15 Christmases over the past 60 years have been "green," which Environment Canada defines as having less than 2 cm accumulated snow on the ground on Dec. 25. First snow: The first snowfall (2 cm on the ground) typically happened by Nov. 29 in the years between 1871 and 1910. Between 1971 and 2010, the first snow on the ground was normally recorded on Dec. 12. This year it happened on Nov. 21. Last snow: In the late 1800s, it was normally around April 8 by the time Montreal's last snow had all melted. In the years since 2000, the average snow expiry date had moved up to March 23.
Sources: Environment Canada, The Weather Network, Montreal Gazette Archives DRIVING Before you drive in wintry weather, consider these tips from CAA-Quebec and Transport Canada:
Remove all snow from your vehicle's hood, roof, windows and lights. Clear windows of frost and fog.
Get a tune-up, including an
Slow down on snow and ice. Your tires will have more time to grip the road. Give yourself extra travel time in bad weather.
Avoid using cruise control on slippery roads.
Always turn the steering wheel slowly to retain control.
Front-wheel skids are often you find yourself in a front-wheel skid, gently ease up on the accelerator or brake pedal and steer in the direction of the turn while looking in the direction you want to go.
For rear-wheel skids, turn the front wheels in the direction in which the back end has started swinging, while looking in the direction you want to go.
Be alert for deceptive conditions. Invisible black ice can form when the temperature hovers around zero, especially on bridges, overpasses and underpasses. In rural areas, road conditions can change quickly from dry to snowy or icecovered.
Leave more space than normal time to respond if an emergency arises.
Prepare an emergency kit for your trunk. It should include a shovel, a snow brush, a scraper, traction aids, booster cables, windshield-washer fluid, a reflective vest, a battery-free flashlight, basic tools, a first-aid kit, a warm blanket and some non-perishable snacks.
HOME EMERGENCY KIT Authorities suggest you prepare a home kit with basic supplies that can help you take care of yourself and your family for 72 hours in case of an emergency such as an extended power failure.
Heavy snow and freezing rain can take down power lines, though Hydro-Quebec says power outages are more common in the summer.
WHAT SHOULD YOUR EMERGENCY KIT INCLUDE? Here are some basic supplies suggested by Public Safety Canada, Hydro-Quebec and Quebec's public-security department.
Water (at least two litres of water per person per day).
Food that won't spoil, such as canned and dried food, energy bars.
Manual can opener.
Crank or battery-powered flashlight
Warm blankets.
Battery-powered radio (and extra batteries) to monitor the situation.
First aid kit (bandages, gauze sterile pads, scissors, tweezers, safety pins, antiseptic, pain medication).
Other items such as prescription medication, infant formula and equipment for people with disabilities. ariga@postmedia.com

'Life is too short to be pissed off all the time': Dawson College marks 10th anniversary of shooting

Full text: Kaloyan Gueorguiev prefers not to dwell on the past, particularly that day 10 years ago when he was shot in the face walking up the stairs to the fourth floor of Dawson College.
"The doctor told me I was really lucky in my bad luck," says Gueorguiev, who was 19 at the time and is now a master's student in industrial engineering at McGill. If the bullet, which lodged in his brow, had hit him a little lower or a little higher, he would have lost an eye, or his life.
"But life is too short to be pissed off all the time."
It's when another attack happens, however -- for instance, the one in July in Nice -- that he looks at the scars on his face and forearm, where he was also shot, and is forced to think about it.
To think about Anastasia De Sousa, the bright-eyed first-year student who was shot nine times and died in the school cafeteria -- she would be 28 today; the other 15 people who were cut down, like him, by bullets in the legs, arms or head as students ran and screamed in panic through the atrium; and Kimveer Gill, the black-clad 25-year-old from Fabreville who fired 72 bullets with his semi-automatic rifle before shooting himself, just after 12:45 p.m.
He had hundreds of extra bullets in his bag.
"There's a reason why they are called assault rifles and not protect rifles," Gueorguiev says, borrowing a line from an Australian comedian about the need for gun control. "But in Nice it was a guy with a truck (who barrelled through a crowd). ... What was going through his head? What went through (Gill's) head to do what he did? His rifle was just a tool. I wish people would pay more attention to mental health issues."
Gun control amid more school shootings
In the 10 years since the Dawson shooting, there have been a handful of school shootings in Canada, most recently in La Loche, Sask., where two people were killed and seven injured. (Another two students were killed in their home.)
In the U.S., since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, there have been another 10 incidents at schools in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder.
At the same time, gun control in both countries has faltered.
In Canada, the long-gun registry set up after the Polytechnique massacre in 1989 was abolished by the Harper government -- with all records, including those from Quebec, ordered destroyed by the Supreme Court in March 2015.
In June, a bill was passed in the National Assembly to establish a new Quebec-only registry, to be set up by 2018.
Anastasia De Sousa's mother, Louise, who joined the gun-control lobby group Poly se souvient, was in Quebec City to witness the adoption of Bill 64, alongside mothers of victims in the Polytechnique massacre.
But the gun Kimveer Gill used, a semi-automatic Beretta CX-4 Storm, is still available, and in fact more accessible than ever, The Canadian Press has reported.
At the time of the shooting, it was a restricted weapon, which required a special licence to own and another licence to transport, and could only be used in shooting clubs. A slightly modified version of the gun made for the Canadian market means it's not restricted; only a regular licence is needed to buy it.
"It's crazy! It's ridiculous! C'mon, it's more accessible than ever!" cries Richard Filion, the director general of Dawson College. "Something has gone wrong and no one seems to understand how to fix it. We're not in the U.S. here -- we're in Canada."
Still, Filion and the larger Dawson community have concentrated their efforts over the last decade not on gun control, but on promoting peace -- inner and outer peace -- to prevent another school shooting from taking place.
Peace at Dawson
Filion remembers running toward the sound of gunfire that day. It was a scene of pure chaos, he says. The school was closed to students for five days.
During that time, Filion sat in his office working on a plan.
More surveillance cameras were installed, more security guards were hired and, as has happened at other institutions, Dawson began to conduct regular lockdown drills.
But the school has also hired more psychologists, and paid more attention to students in need, Filion says.
Gill was not a student at Dawson. But from his writings, he appeared to be anti-social and/or depressed -- and full of hate. A McGill study revealed in 2010 that 30 per cent of Dawson students and employees on campus at the time of the shooting suffered from a psychological disorder -- including post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression.
"Right from the beginning, it was clear in my mind that whatever plan we have, we will never be in a position to neutralize an active shooter," Filion says. "We have to prevent (violence) through education."
The CEGEP now offers a Peace Studies certificate, with courses on everything from world religions to social deviance to art history.
Five years ago it planted a peace garden, which has flourished from a staid memorial into a living memorial into an outdoor classroom and place of healing, with one of three interlocking gardens named for Anastasia.
(An almond tree donated for Anastasia by the Montreal police was not doing well on campus, so it went to the De Sousas' home, and is now flourishing.)
At that time, Dawson students also started building a virtual Peace Wall, receiving messages from around the world. To mark the 10th anniversary of the shooting, the project has been revitalized in the hope of reaching 10,000 messages.
So far it has received 1,335 messages from 77 countries.
During this Peace Week, until Sept. 21, the CEGEP is hosting events with two speakers: Samantha Nutt of War Child Canada, who has spent 16 years in war zones treating the wounded as a physician, and Abdennour Bidar, a philosopher and essayist, whose message is one of hope for a society in which everyone shares common values while respecting their differences in culture, beliefs and identity.
(Bidar -- whose Open Letter to the Muslim World, written after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, was read by millions of people -- will also be speaking at other CEGEPs, including Collège de Rosemont and Collège de Maisonneuve, where a number of youths were enrolled before leaving to join extremist groups in the Middle East.)
"For me, whether it's a guy jumping in a truck and driving through a crowd in Nice or those leaving Quebec to join the jihad or someone in the U.S. attacking a school, it's the same situation," Filion says. "It's a desperation in life that pushes them to an evil fate. So how do we make it so that we can equip those people who might be more vulnerable? It's through education."
Peace week begins Tuesday, with a special ceremony at Dawson attended by survivors, police and representatives from three levels of government, and ends Sept. 21 at city hall.

Milos Raonic stunned in second round upset at U.S. Open

Full text: When Milos Raonic was down two sets to none against David Goffin in the fourth round at Wimbledon, John McEnroe had a little chat with him in the locker room during a rain delay.
 
Make that a loud chat.
"Show me you have balls!" McEnroe screamed.
McEnroe was coaching Raonic at the time and with his intensity -- and possibly his manhood -- questioned, Raonic came fighting back to win in five sets en route to becoming the first Canadian male to reach a singles Grand Slam final before losing to Andy Murray. The win over Goffin marked the first time Raonic had ever come back to win a match after losing the first two sets.
He showed big ... you know what.
Raonic shared the McEnroe locker-room story in a recent article for The Players Tribune website.
Coming into the U.S. Open, Raonic and Canadian tennis fans were hoping he could take that next big step and actually win a Grand Slam championship, but it won't happen.
Not even close.
Raonic was eliminated in the second round Wednesday afternoon, dropping a 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1 decision to American Ryan Harrison in 30C heat.
Raonic is ranked No. 6 in the world and was seeded fifth here, while Harrison is ranked No. 120. But it wasn't the most sensitive part of Raonic's male anatomy to blame for this upset. And it wasn't the fact McEnroe decided before the U.S. Open that he no longer wanted to coach Raonic, preferring to focus on his TV duties with ESPN.
Raonic's problems were in his head and other parts of his body. The result was cramps that started midway through the second set and continued to get worse.
"A little bit of stress," Raonic said in the media interview room afterward. "I don't think hydration was an issue. I think I always take that precaution. Probably just nerves and stress, a mental sort of overexuberance rather than -- probably more than it should."
Harrison, who had a 1-1 record in two previous meetings with Raonic, put up a tough fight right from the start while wearing the same fluorescent Nike green colours Montreal's Eugenie Bouchard wore the day before in her first-round loss. Harrison had the matching shirt, socks and wristbands (batteries not included), but played much better than he looked.
The American pushed Raonic to a first-set tiebreaker, but everything looked fine for the Canadian after he won that fairly easily, 7-4. Harrison took a 5-2 lead in the second set before Raonic fought back to make it 5-5 and then lost the next two games and the set. That's when the problems really started. Raonic took a medical timeout to have his arm massaged and later had a trainer rub down his left leg. But the cramps were everywhere.
"The left arm; right forearm there towards the end of the third; both quads; a little bit hip flexor on the left," said Raonic, who couldn't remember ever losing a match before because of cramps.
"The really painful cramps started to pass at some point in the third set, but then I started getting small ones where I couldn't hold the racquet," added Raonic, who made 69 unforced errors. "I couldn't switch grips from one point to the next. There were a few points where I would hold the racquet with my left and trying to stretch out my right hand in between shots, and that's not going to work."
Raonic was asked if he could turn back the clock would he have done anything different before the match.
"I don't know actually, to be honest with you," he said. "Maybe try to be a bit more active at the beginning of the match. But every single thing I do, I do with a very careful sort of, as much of possible, calculation. I count how many glasses of water I drink. I pay specific attention to what I eat, what I consume, what's going to be the best for me. How much before I consume it. All these kind of things. I try to be on top of it as much as I can."
What if McEnroe had been there to yell at him again ... could that have made a difference?
"Well, I don't believe so," Raonic said. "I was my own worst enemy today. I tried the best I could to find my way out of it. My body didn't let me."
THE HEAT IS ON
If you've been watching the U.S. Open on TV, you've probably seen spectators cooling themselves off in the stands with yellow fans shaped like tennis balls.
With the temperature reaching 30C again Wednesday, you couldn't walk -- or sit -- anywhere at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center without seeing someone using one of the fans. They're even popular at evening sessions in the giant and sticky Arthur Ashe Stadium, which seats 23,771.
The yellow cardboard fans could go down as one of the most brilliant marketing ideas in sports. They are being handed out by people promoting a Visit Orlando campaign in Florida. But maybe someone should be handing out Visit New York fans in Orlando, where they were preparing for Tropical Storm Hermine on Wednesday.
During Canadian Vasek Pospisil's match Wednesday on the Grandstand Court, which is like an oven, an elderly woman was taken away in a wheelchair after fainting from the heat. She appeared to be OK when she left, but definitely could have used one of those yellow fans.

Abstract: St. Mary's is that hospital." - the late Georges Gauthier, Archbishop of Montreal The elimination of vascular surgery from St. Mary's Hospital is the latest in a series of administrative decisions to strip the 91-year-old institution of a wide range of clinical, diagnostic and teaching activities that cast doubt on its future as a community hospital.

The elimination of vascular surgery from St. Mary's Hospital is the latest in a series of administrative decisions to strip the 91-year-old institution of a wide range of clinical, diagnostic and teaching activities that cast doubt on its future as a community hospital.
Viewed in isolation, each decision might not appear to threaten St. Mary's. But taken together, they represent an undeniable downsizing of a venerable institution with a long history of medical achievements, say longtime employees. "It's death by a thousand cuts," said Dr. Gerald van Gurp, a St. Mary's physician who has worked in the hospital's ER for four decades.
Unlike most of his professional colleagues, the 65-year-old van Gurp was willing to speak on the record to the Montreal Gazette because he doesn't fear reprisals as he is semi-retired and now works only one day a week in St. Mary's emergency follow-up outpatient clinic. "I'm perplexed. There are a number of studies and surveys of patients that show that St. Mary's comes out on top or near the top on all sorts of parameters, especially patient satisfaction, and in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness," he added.
"Yet it's a paradox that St. Mary's is bearing the brunt of all these cutbacks."
Among the services that have been curtailed at the McGill University-affiliated hospital in Cotedes-Neiges: [broken bar][broken bar]Last February, administrators suspended St. Mary's psychology internship program and the entire psychology department has since been abolished, although no official announcement was made internally to inform hospital staff. The program served more than 150 patients in psychological distress, including those who were suicidal, and was a training ground for PhD students from four universities, including McGill and Concordia. [broken bar][broken bar]Last May, the hospital eliminated its surgical outpatient clinic as part of $8.3-million in budget cuts. The clinic's closing forced patients to see their doctors outside the hospital, impeding timely access to postoperative tests and procedures at St. Mary's.
The hospital's comprehensive automated lab - which has consistently received the highest accreditation by the American College of Pathologists since 1995 - is being ordered under a Montreal-wide reorganization to reduce its volume of specimen analysis, among other tests.
In July, St. Mary's sole vascular surgeon, Carl Emond, had his privileges revoked to perform emergency vascular surgery, which administrators deemed was now "eccentric to the mission" of the hospital. The decision was made without informing the ER staff.
On Nov. 2, an ER patient died after he was denied vascular surgery at St. Mary's that might have saved his life. The ER staffonly became aware that Emond's privileges had been revoked after he informed them in the "crash room" next to the unconscious patient, who was then transferred by ambulance to the superhospital of the McGill University Health Centre. The patient died before he could undergo surgery to repair a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Last fall, the on-call spiritual counselling service to patients was cancelled. The service is no longer available after 4 p.m. on weekdays and weekends.
Staffare concerned about a lack of succession plans to make sure that specialists are hired to replace those who are retiring. St. Mary's has two respirologists who are 65
and 70 years old, respectively, and it's not clear at this point whether there are definite plans to hire and train specialists to replace them when they retire.
"St. Mary's is being dismantled," said a veteran physician at the hospital, who did not want his name published for fear of losing his job.
St. Mary's - which serves one of Canada's most ethnically diverse districts, including immigrants from 100 nations - no longer has its own executive director or board to defend its interests following an administrative reform imposed by Health Minister Gaetan Barrette last April 1. The hospital is now being managed by bureaucrats - some of whom, stafflament, have never set foot in St. Mary's - who work in Pointe-Claire at the newly-created Montreal West Island Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre, known by its French acronym, CIUSSS.
With so many services scaled back or cut, rumours are running rampant among staffand patients that St. Mary's will soon be closed.
Joanne Beauvais, Barrette's press attache, denied in an email last November that the hospital will be shuttered.
"Nobody in the cabinet nor in the MSSS (Ministere de la Sante et des Services sociaux) has heard of this rumour," Beauvais said at the time. "So it is a rumour, and is absolutely not in the minister's or the MSSS's intentions."
Beauvais stood by those comments in an email Tuesday to the Montreal Gazette, saying: "That position is not only still valid, but I could also provide you with a list of pending projects that are underway, such as the enlargement of the building, that would demonstrate the CIUSSS's and our government's intention is absolutely not to change St. Mary's mission as a community first-and second-line care hospital."
Claire Roy, head of public affairs for the West Island CIUSSS, conveyed a similar message on Nov. 26: "St. Mary's will continue to exist as a community hospital. This was never called into question, in fact, the contrary. The current mission of St. Mary's is essential and it represents a pillar in the 'construction' of our CIUSSS. St. Mary's is undeniably a part of our future with its current mission. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for contacting us to allow us to rectify a rumour that is absolutely unfounded." aderfel@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/Aaron_Derfel
FROM J. F.K. TO SHATNER: SOME OF ST. MARY'S MILESTONES
Here are a few milestones in the history of St. Mary's, a 271-bed hospital: 1924: St. Mary's is founded in the Shaughnessy mansion on Rene Levesque Blvd. (Today, the former mansion is part of the Canadian Centre for Architecture.) 1930: Dr. Donald Hingston sets out to raise one million dollars to build a hospital to serve Montreal's Irish-Catholics. In spite of the Depression, the Irish community generously supports Hingston's campaign. In 1934, St. Mary's takes up residency at its current location on Lacombe Ave.
1958: John F. Kennedy, a U.S. senator at the time, and his wife Jackie attend the St. Mary's Ball to help raise funds for the hospital.
1998: During the ice storm, St. Mary's provides shelter to more than 900 people, serving more than 2,000 meals.
2003: St. Mary's becomes the first hospital in Quebec to run a fully automated lab.
2008: St. Mary's wins an environmental award, Making Medicine Mercury Free, by a U.S. organization.
2011: St. Mary's becomes the first hospital on the island of Montreal to obtain the "Baby Friendly Hospital" accreditation. The accreditation is part of an international program that focuses on 10 conditions for successful breastfeeding, formulated in 1991 by UNICEF and the World Health Organization.
2014: Actor William Shatner, a.k.a., Captain Kirk, collaborates with St. Mary's on a video explaining a technology developed by St. Mary's researchers to be used in space exploration missions. Shatner provides the voice-over for the video.

Full text:   The Montreal crowd let out a collective howl for Dale Weise as he skated back onto the ice on Saturday night at the Bell Centre. He'd just scored two goals in a 6-2 win against the New Jersey Devils and one can only imagine the sensation of pure ecstasy taking over in that moment - the tingly, almost weightless feeling that pulsated across Weise's body.
Some chanted his name; others clapped and hollered for the Canadiens forward. It was one of those rare nights he'd be named among the game's three stars, so Weise soaked it in, raised his stick to the crowd and returned to the Montreal dressing room.
For a Canadiens player, to succeed in this city is to be embraced with a kind of love that borders on suffocation. The fans' embrace may have tightened a little the following night, when Weise picked up a goal and an assist in a 3-1 win against the Bruins in Boston.
Just over a year ago, nobody in Quebec seemed to know who Dale Weise was. Now, he's a household name.
Even the Boston newspapers have taken notice. In fact, one Boston Herald writer framed Sunday's game as the latest round in the "budding 'Dale Weise vs. The Boston Bruins' rivalry."
Weise's journey to Montreal is one of those redemptive tales that a hack writer might pitch to a movie studio, except that it's almost too perfect.
It began just over a year ago, when Weise was sitting in his highrise Vancouver apartment watching television.
"I don't remember what game it was, exactly, but I was watching (TSN) and the panel always talks trade rumours," Weise told the Montreal Gazette. "Bob McKenzie was reading his Insider Trading stuffand he said, 'The Vancouver Canucks say Dale Weise is available if anyone is interested.' " It was a surreal moment for Weise, who sat there watching people discuss his future with such matter-of-fact detachment. Still, the rumour made sense.
Weise felt there wasn't really a place for him on the Canucks roster anymore. Most nights he'd play only a handful of minutes on the fourth line. Sometimes the team would scratch him from the lineup entirely, opting to dress a seventh defenceman in his spot.
Last year, in a separate interview with the Montreal Gazette, Weise hinted that he'd fallen out of favour with coach John Tortorella for not instigating more fights.
"It was never something (Tortorella) explicitly said," Weise said in November. "It was more like, 'You played four minutes tonight, but what did you really do out there?' " Weise was a tough guy, sure, but he was ill-suited for the role of designated puncher. He skated faster than most of his teammates and showed some offensive flair during his three years in the farm leagues. It seemed only logical this could translate into success at the National Hockey League level if given the chance.
Whether or not there was ever an implied bargain in which Weise would earn playing time with his fists, he dropped the gloves twice in his final weeks with the Canucks.
The first fight came in late January, during a game against the rival Calgary Flames.
Tortorella sent out Weise's trio to open the match. As the teams lined up opposite each other, footage from the game shows Tortorella yelling and crudely gesturing toward the Calgary bench. Then the referee drops the puck and, as if on cue, a 10-man brawl erupts. Weise was ejected from the match and Tortorella earned a two-week suspension for allegedly trying to storm the Flames' dressing room after the first period. The following week, Weise threw down with Nashville Predators enforcer Rich Clune - a veteran of more than 100 pro hockey fights.
He was clearly overmatched, but Weise hung on to Clune's jersey, absorbing bare-knuckle thumps to the head and scrambling to regain his footing for long enough to deliver a counterpunch. At one point, Clune pulled Weise to the ground and - instead of allowing the referees to step in - he got up and managed to hit his opponent with a few short jabs. It was a small victory in an otherwise onesided affair.
Despite his increasingly combative play, Weise knew he was on the outs in Vancouver. Just after hearing the trade rumour on TSN, he packed his bags for the Canucks' upcoming road trip.
"I'd be playing in my hometown (Winnipeg) for the first time, so my wife was flying home. We had a new baby, so she was going to visit family," Weise said. "So I told her, 'Make sure you pack a lot,' because we were coming up on the Olympic break and there'd be a roster freeze. So there was a good chance I'd be traded before then."
Though things were far from perfect in Vancouver, Weise was excited for his homecoming. He bought "a bunch" of tickets for family and friends in anticipation of the game, but shortly after arriving in his hometown Weise found out he wouldn't be on the roster against the Winnipeg Jets.
"Of all the things that built up in Vancouver - not getting opportunities, the setbacks, the disappointment - that felt like the low point of my career," he said. "It was heartbreaking."
But then, just after skating for an extra 30 minutes following practice, one of Weise's teammates fell ill and suddenly he was back in the lineup.
"It was weird. I wasn't going to play, but then you skate me for a half an hour and I'm exhausted and all of a sudden I'm playing," Weise said. "Then all my family shows up and I'm pumped, I'm excited. It was going to be great. I ended up playing two shifts. I got benched after my second shift. Not one second of ice time for the rest of the night. It was humiliating.
"That night, I sat down with my family and we got to talking. I told them, 'There's a good chance I'll be traded in the next couple of days.'" The Canucks were in Detroit the following day. It was Super Bowl Sunday and Weise got together with his teammates to watch the big game.
"It was like a send offfor me," Weise said. "That was the last time we were all together like that."
The next day would be Weise's final one as Vancouver Canuck.
"John Tortorella had just returned from his two-week suspension," Weise said. "So we sat with him for a 45-minute video session where he carved every single person in the room. The mood wasn't very good. We got dressed for morning skate - John Tortorella doesn't come out for morning skate - so I went out onto the ice, took two full laps, shot a couple of pucks and the trainer gives me this one from the sideline (Weise recreates the beckoning motions with his finger). "He says, 'You gotta go see Torts (Tortorella).'
"At this point, I knew I was traded for sure. That or they were going to put me on waivers. John Tortorella wasn't just going to tell me to pick my game up. I was getting taken offthe ice.
"I wasn't nervous so much as excited for something to happen. Things were miserable in Vancouver, even if it was about going down on waivers, I had enough faith in myself that I knew I could succeed in a new situation.
"I went into the dressing room, Tortorella was just standing there alone. He says, 'There's a trade in the works, I can't tell you where to yet, there could be a few teams bidding right now. Get undressed.'
"Then he just walked out of the room. Didn't say goodbye, didn't say good luck, nothing. That was it."
Since the trade wasn't yet finalized, Weise had no clue where he'd wind up taking his wife and infant son for the remainder of the season. He knew he could adapt to the nomadic life of a journeyman hockey player. During one sixyear span, Weise had taken up residence in five cities - going from prairie towns like Swift Current, Sask. to a brief sojourn in Tilburg, Holland, during the NHL lockout (Tilburg, you should know, has a professional hockey team but is best known as the "wool capital of the Netherlands").
"Throughout all of this, my wife has been great, an absolute trooper," Weise said. "I knew that, no matter where I ended up, even if it was just in a one-bedroom hotel, she'd be there with our son. She keeps this whole thing together."
After Tortorella walked away, Weise took offhis Canucks jersey, but kept the rest of his equipment on as he reached for his cellphone. First he sent a text message to his wife, then his mother. Finally, after delivering the news to his teammates, Weise was told to call Canucks general manager Mike Gillis, who informed him he now played for the Canadiens.
"They were my favourite team growing up," Weise said of the Canadiens. "Of all the teams, what are the chances of being traded to that one? I'd talked to my agent the week before and he knew a few teams were interested. Montreal wasn't on that list."
The next phone call came from Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin.
"(Bergevin) told me, 'You know what, when I was (assistant general manger) in Chicago, we tried to get you,'" Weise said. "That's huge, from going in Vancouver, where you're at the bottom of the barrel, to being told you are wanted. It was validating."
By the time he stepped out of the plane at Trudeau International Airport, Weise was greeted by a TV camera crew.
"In Vancouver, I could have worn my Dale Weise jersey around the block and no one would have recognized me," he said. "Then I get to the airport in Montreal and there's cameras waiting for me. That's when I knew things were about to change, things were a lot bigger now."
A car service took him to the Crystal Hotel on Peel St. It was dark, about 11 p.m., and he sat in his room, looking across the cold, vacant lot on Rene-Levesque Blvd. and onto the Bell Centre lights.
"It was one of those 'pinch me' moments, I was so excited," Weise said. "I sat down and thought, 'Man is this really happening?'" Finally, Weise spoke to his father, Miles - an affable warehouse manager who says he nearly cried tears of joy when he learned his son would play for the Canadiens.
"I remember he said, 'You'll be wearing the same jersey as Guy Lafleur,' " Weise said. "It was a 'pinch me' moment for him, too."
Just a few hours earlier, Weise was an afterthought in the Canucks locker room. He was only 25 and his career had hit a dead end.
Weise prides himself on being able to compartmentalize hockey, to keep it separate from his dayto-day life. But he admits that, on a psychological level, the Vancouver experience began to wear away at him.
"I remember my wife was excited because she saw how miserable I was going to the rink every day," he said. "I wasn't happy and she saw that. I'm a pretty positive guy, I'm pretty happy, I'm always glad to talk to anybody. I love what I do and I leave hockey at the rink. But it had gotten to a point where I couldn't do that in Vancouver. It was just mentally draining, it was seeping into my life."
There's no longer any debate as to whether Weise belongs on an NHL roster. That conversation has shifted to one about whether or not a grinding, physical player like Weise belongs on the Canadiens' first line - a tedious discussion, yes, but certainly one that indicates he's better offhere than he was on the West Coast. Weise no longer has to fight goons to earn playing time - though he still drops the gloves on occasion.
"When I got offthe plane the night I was traded, I had this feeling like things were going to work out," he said. "I knew this would be a good fit for me, for my family." ccurtis@montrealgazette.com twitter.com/titocurtis

Full text:   (From Montreal Gazette, January 29, 2015) Due to a reporting error, a column in Wednesday's Montreal Gazette referred to an electronic road sign in Massachusetts that purportedly read "Wicked Big Storm Coming. Pahk Ya Cah!" That sign, which was widely circulated on social media, turned out to have been Photoshopped. The Gazette regrets the error. *****
Damned if you do, double damned if you don't.
Predicting a storm of "historic" proportions, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio called on residents Monday to go home and batten down the hatches. Broadway theatres cancelled performances, planes were grounded, the subway shut down early and schools and the Metropolitan Museum were closed Tuesday.
Hours before the nor'easter dubbed Snowmageddon was expected to barrel up the East Coast, five states had declared a state of emergency.
What the Big Apple got, as we know now, was bupkus. A storm of Vaudevillian legend, Juno may be best remembered there for snowball fights in a deserted Times Square, overwrought correspondents reporting from CNN's blizzardmobile and Manhattan survivalists jostling for baguettes and batteries at the Whole Foods emporium.
The storm did sock it to Cape Cod and Boston, where Massachusetts used electronic road signs and a sense of humour to caution motorists to travel with care: "Wicked Big Storm Coming. Pahk Ya Cah!" To be honest, it seems like a pretty good day when the news du jour focuses on a snowstorm of anticlimactic proportions.
So were the politicians wrong to be prepared, to heed the warnings of the National Weather Service and scare the populace into submission?
It is instructive to contrast their hyper-readiness with Montreal's dismal handling of snow clearing this winter.
Montreal has a well-worn reputation for knowing its way around a snowstorm. We have the experience, the crews, the equipment. Visitors from distant lands who happen to be here after a storm stare out the windows in wonder as the armada of trucks, plows and blowers performs a late night snow-clearing ballet.
But this season, we have allowed petty politics and contractual squabbles to intrude on what ought to be a simple and obvious task - to ensure that the roads are cleared and the sidewalks are safe for pedestrians.
Despite the fact that Montreal got pretty much exactly the storm Environment Canada had predicted - a dirty cocktail of rain, freezing rain, ice pellets and snow, complicated by a sudden deep freeze - snow clearing and removal was woebegone and belaboured in many districts.
Mayor Denis Coderre huffed and puffed and promised to find out who wasn't doing their job.
Projet Montreal accused the mayor of launching "a witch hunt."
An internal audit detailed a cavalcade of system failures - broken machinery, understaffed work crews, elementary miscalculations on whether to salt, sand or clear snow, and in what order.
Luc Ferrandez, Projet's leader and the mayor of Plateau-Mont-Royal, initially said his district couldn't afford to clear the streets, blaming the central city for cutting $800,000 from its snow budget.
Only on Monday, some three weeks after the rain began to fall on Jan. 3, did the Plateau finally relent, admitting it had erred and announcing it would begin to remove snow from one-third of its streets.
As for the other two-thirds of streets in the city's trendiest district, well, good luck with that, and don't forget to stock up on rock salt. Spring is 53 days away.
Canadians with long memories can still get a cheap laugh out of the time Toronto mayor Mel Lastman summoned the army - 400 troops dispatched from CFB Petawawa, driving armoured vehicles - when the city was pummelled with 118 centimetres of snow in January 1999. The soldiers had help from a brigade of 100 volunteer shovellers from Prince Edward Island, who were rewarded with tickets to a Maple Leafs game. (No, I did not make that up.)
Yet for all his over-the-top outlandishness, Lastman understood what he was there for, what was required of politicians, and expected by taxpayers. "We arranged it so that seniors could go around the corner to get milk," he told the Toronto Star a decade later. "Would I do it again? You're darned right I would."
In the wake of Monday's storm-that-wasn't, New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, was asked whether he felt authorities had over-reacted. "We have had people die in storms," Cuomo told reporters. "I would rather be in a situation where we said, 'We got lucky.'" Of course, it takes more than the dusting of snow that blanketed Central Park to stop Montrealers, who party through the bleak mid-winter, cycling through slush and motoring through potholes the size of groundhogs wearing Canada Goose parkas.
But even hardy winter souls have a right to basic services from their city administration, starting with safe, ice-free, sidewalks and a place to pahk the cah.

The mayor of the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough said six of the 12 drivers for sidewalk tractors in his borough didn't show up for duty during the first few days after the storm.
The number of no-shows in the city's ranks peaks at this time of year because workers tend to take advantage of their remaining sick days before the new year, he said in an interview with the Montreal Gazette.
"What happens is that if you need just eight or 10 employees one Sunday night to put sand on the sidewalk, that's OK because you have a big basin of employees to call," he said.
However, occasions like last Wednesday - when blue-collars were called on simultaneously to spread salt, remove snow, collect recycling and fix water leaks - stretched the city's resources thin.
"That's when it hurts the most," he said. "It was hard to finish all the activities in time last Wednesday. It happens in every borough, and it happens every year."
Ferrandez said the city could save itself some trouble by renegotiating blue-collars' collective agreements so sick days are recalculated in the spring or summer. The city would then be sure to have enough troops for a snow-removal blitz.
Another solution might be prepaid sick days that would only be deducted from a worker's pay in case of absence, Ferrandez said.
He challenged the explanation put forward by Michel Parent, the president of the city's blue-collar workers' union, that the city didn't ask snow crews to work overtime to save money.
"We don't want to alienate employees, we don't want to cut due advantages. But at one point, it's unfair to say that the boroughs are trying to save money, (and) that's why the snow removal wasn't as fast as it should have been," Ferrandez said.
Last week's storm made a mess of roads and sidewalks, especially in the Plateau and Cote-des-Neiges- Notre-Dame-de-Grace.
Harout Chitilian, the vice-president of the city's executive council, said it was possible that blue-collar workers refused to work overtime.
"One hundred per cent of the equipment available to the city of Montreal was being used to address this issue (snow removal)," Chitilian told the media last Tuesday.
In a meeting of the executive committee the next day, he said there would be an audit on the snow removal.
Louis-Pascal Cyr, the mayor's director of communications, said the audit would reveal if there was a high level of absenteeism among snow-removal crews. He couldn't say if the level of absenteeism is a recurring problem for the city at this time of year.
The city's executive committee will release the results of the audit in its next meeting on Wednesday morning.

Full text:   (From Montreal Gazette, November 11, 2014) Due to a reporting error, a story in Monday's paper about a Montreal ceremony commemorating Kristallnacht incorrectly said Liberal Member of Parliament Irwin Cotler has retired. In fact, Cotler has announced he will not seek re-election in the next federal election. *****
Each year, there are fewer and fewer witnesses to the horrors of that night 76 years ago in Germany and Austria, when bands of Nazis and their sympathizers massacred Jews, smashing the windows of Jewish-owned stores and burning down synagogues.
But on Sunday night, two witnesses who survived Kristallnacht - known as the "Night of Broken Glass" - each spoke about their experiences in a sombre ceremony in Montreal attended by more than 600 people.
The first witness was Irene Stengel, a 97-year-old Holocaust survivor, whose home in Zatec, Austria, was vandalized by the Nazis on the night of Nov. 9, 1938. She stood unassisted before the podium at the Gelber Centre, reading from a prepared text, speaking in a clear voice, alternating from English to French.
"It was very bad," Stengel told the audience. "They had smeared (messages on) the houses outside with red paint, 'Dirty Jews.' That was written all over our house. After Kristallnacht, everybody was afraid and tried to get out and leave the country. I could have gone to England with the help of friends, together with my mother, but she refused. She didn't want to leave her father behind."
Ultimately, her parents were picked up by the Gestapo and sent to concentration camps, her mother to Auschwitz and her father to Buchenwald. Both perished.
At the end of her speech, Stengel unwrapped from a handkerchief a toy dog - "my mother's last gift to me."
"But it is there, and I speak to it as if it were my mother, every morning and every night."
The next witness was not Jewish, but he and his family risked their lives in Germany to hide several Jewish families in their building's cellar. Harold Winter, who is 84, recalled that as an eight-year-old boy, he saw a "Brown Shirt," a Nazi storm trooper, toss a Jewish baby out the window of his apartment building.
"In the days leading up to Kristallnacht, there was restlessness among the Nazis and their supporters in our neighbourhood until the night of the 9th of November," Winter recounted. "I saw the SS going around smashing the windows of shops, taking away the merchandise and beating up the Jews who were there."
Organized by the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre, the event drew students from Bialik High School, some of whom sang songs in Yiddish. Among those in attendance were retired MP Irwin Cotler, Russell Copeman, borough mayor for Cote-des-Neiges- Notre-Dame-de-Grace, and Anthony Housefather, mayor of Cote Saint-Luc.

Full text: Things you may or may not see unravel in 2013 Anno Domini.
* Yes, there will be a provincial election shortly after the snow
melts.
It will be goodbye McFibber and hello Gerard Kennedy. Timmy Whodat
will lead the Conservatives back to the promised land, but not with
a majority. The Liberals and New Dems just might want to keep Whodat
and Co. in power to punish them. What's that you say? Hey, take
another look at the huge deficit the guy is going to inherit. This
might be a case of wishing you hadn't won.
In Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry, Gentleman Jim will chalk up an
even bigger margin of victory over his closest rival, the NDP
candidate.
The Liberal sacrificial lamb will place a poor third. However, Fern
Guindon will remain the last provincial cabinet minister from the
riding.
* A kind arbitrator, who doesn't have to pick up the tab, will give
firefighters another raise that exceeds common sense in an economy
the private sector is wrestling with. He will reason that this way
the average firefighter will no longer have to hold down an extra
job to make ends meet.
* Confusion over Cornwall's economic climate will continue. On one
hand, the spin out of city hall will paint a rosy economic picture,
but over at the Agape Centre the message will be anything but
pretty. The centre will cite a huge increase, again, in the number
of Cornwall residents coming through the food bank door. At least
three red alerts will be issued during the year as shelves are
stripped bare.
* The National Hockey League lockout will end in 2013, but the jury
is out on whether a deal will be reached in the next month or
sometime during the summer. At this point, the prevailing attitude
among fans is let them stay out.
But you can bet that when the puck drops, we'll all be back on
board. It will be a different story where they call it ice hockey
and professional bowling has a bigger television audience.
* Sewage and water tax (disguised as rates) hikes will continue to
outpace property tax increases. The gap will narrow and in a few
years the sewage/water tax bills could be within a short reach of
property tax bills.
* The David Suzuki gas-guzzling climate change bus will, for the
third straight year, get bogged down in a snowstorm and record
windchill temperatures. And after ocean-front real estate prices
plunge in the wake of Al Gore's prediction of rising sea levels, Fox
News will report that the former v.p. purchased several such
properties at bargain basement prices.
MNBC will report that Gore is taking swimming lessons.
* A pinhead on city council will demand the RCMP be brought in to
investigate an alleged leak after this scribbler announces that when
CAO Norm Levac retires in 2020, Finance Manager Maureen Adams will
be appointed to the position.
* City council will ask the Ontario Provincial Police for a price
on policing Cornwall. However, the OPP quote will be rejected. The
idea of a regional force will resurface but residents in South
Glengarry and South Stormont will be against the proposal pointing
to that fact that the OPP service must be okay.
Otherwise, why do so many city police officers, city firefighters
and city administrators choose to live outside the city.
* * *
IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR: Aspirins in a small tin container. ...
When the "country kids" ate lunch at school and city kids, who
walked to school, went home for lunch ... Local hockey monikers that
included Pontiacs, Chevies, Calumets, Avonmore Aces, Ironmen, Long
Sault-Ingleside Combines, Petros, Inkerman Rockets, Maxville
Millionaires, Lancaster Dodgers ... The Dingwall estate at Second
and Gloucester streets ... The old YMCA on First Street, next door
to the Salvation Army Citadel, which was built in 1904 and closed in
1962 when the corps moved to its new citadel at Fifth and York
streets. The Y's gym was an old army hut from the Second
World War training centre ... St. Michael's Academy on Eleventh
Street and the skating rink (natural ice) in the old barn ... St.
Louis de Gonzague School ... Smith Transport depot on Second Street
West ... The ramp on the west side of the Capitol Theatre ... The
Women's Temperance Union fountain in Central Park with basins that
were once used to water horses in the early days. One of the great
crimes against local heritage was the fountain's destruction. ...
Meldum's Funeral Home ... A 59 cent banana split ... Boy Scout old
newspaper drives ... Riding car bumpers in the winter, a "sport"
that was discouraged by the police.
* * *
TRIVIA QUESTION: On Dec. 11, 1976, the largest crowd to see a
sports event in Cornwall crammed into the Ed Lumley Arena. What was
the event? Bonus point if you know the paid attendance.
* * *
TRIVIA ANSWER: The McGill Chair Company was founded by Thomas
McGill. The factory was built in 1905 at York and Third streets with
the help of a $20,000 loan from town council. After falling on hard
times, the factory was closed.
It was demolished in 1942. The property remained a vacant lot until
it was purchased by the First Baptist Church congregation.
The cornerstone for the new church was laid by Olive Diefenbaker,
wife of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, in November 1960.
* * *
SOCIAL NOTES: The Cat sends greetings from downtown New Orleans.
He's gearing up The Checkered Parrot for the Super Bowl which will
be played at the SuperDome. This will be followed by the world's
biggest street party, Mardi Gras. Throw in New Year's Eve and the
Big Easy has 2013 off to a roaring start ... Got a call the evening
of Dec. 24 from former S-F sports editor/retired Montreal Gazette
sports writer Dave Shoihet wishing me a Merry Christmas. Dave, by
the way, is Jewish and has no trouble wishing his Christian friends
a Merry Christmas.
* * *
GRANDSTAND LIVES ON: The old Athletic Grounds pre-Second World War
grandstand that was wrecked by a wind storm 70 years ago lives on.
Hubert Miron tells us that his two-storey house on Second Street
and another home were built with lumber salvaged from the
grandstand.
The lumber was purchased from the town by two builders from St.
Isidore-- a Menard and a Laframboise -- and used the wood to build
the homes, then in Cornwall Township.
* * *
SPORTS STUFF: Travis Cook, who grew up in Akwesasne and starred for
Frank Benedict's talented junior Braves boxla team in the early
1970s, is president of the National Lacrosse League. ... Scott
Johnson, son of Ron Johnson of Crazy Amigos (Rangatangs), is no
longer the pro at Kanata Golf and Country Club. He has been promoted
to the club's director of golf. He is a graduate of the Cornwall
Golf and Country Club junior program.

Managers face-off for CEO job

Full text: T he
search for a replacement for retired Chief Administrative Officer
Paul Fitzpatrick is down to two candidates with an announcement on
the successful applicant expected before the end of the month.
For sure, one of the two finalists is Norm Levac, general manager
of infrustructure and municipal works, while the other is said to be
Maureen Adams, the highly regarded general manager of finance.
Stephen Alexander, serving as acting CAO, did not apply for the job.
Levac may have the edge because of his lengthy municipal
experience, both here and in Ottawa, and fluency in both French and
English.
"If he is a candidate, he certainly knows the workings of the
city," said a councillor last week before being briefed this week on
the hiring process. "I would have no trouble giving him my vote."
At least two other councillors expressed a similar feeling when
asked if they could support Levac for the job.
Another said Levac would be a good choice but wanted to know (this
was two weeks ago) the name of the second candidate.
One source, who declined to name the candidates, said regardless of
which one gets the job the city will have a top notch person who
knows the municipality.
The prevailing feeling around the council table is that promoting
from within trumps going outside.
This time around city council saved the usual $30,000-$40,000
headhunter's fee by giving the responsibility to a hiring committee
made up of councillors Denis Thibault, Denis Carr, Glen Grant, Mayor
Bob Kilger and Elaine MacDonald.
There was no shortage of applicants for city hall's top paying job.
The committee had 90 applicants to sort through at its first
meeting.
So, if you are a betting person, put money on Levac to become the
sixth CAO.
My crystal ball says he will be the next CAO.
A word of caution, however: I also said the Blue Jays would win
their AL division, that the Leafs would make the playoffs and that
Willard Romney would be the next president.
TRIVIA
This part of old Cornwall Township was called Smithville. It's
demise in 1958 was not connected to the building of the Seaway.
Where was Smithville?
Answer to last week's trivia - Sept. 5, 1944. The quake centred
just 40 miles from the city struck just after midnight.
It registered as a magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale. It was
followed by several sharp aftershocks and slight tremours were felt
for several days.
Damage was estimated at $1 million. Today, it would be in the
millions. So badly damaged was CCVS, the school was closed for a
week. An estimated 1,000 chimneys were destroyed. Every store window
on Pitt Street was broken. One report said people rushed out of
their homes and, thinking it was the end of the world, were praying
in the streets.
In Massena, hundreds of residents feared that it was a German
attack on the Alcoa plant.
Two years later to the day the city was hit with a less powerful
quake.
THIS TIME, NO COMEBACK
Cornwall Sports Hall of Famer Art Murphy (football) home from
hospital recovering from surgery to repair a broken hip. He's taking
physio and making progress. But says Art, referring to some of his
football injuries, "This time, there won't be a comeback."
BIG SPENDERS
The New Democratic Party solution to the looming financial wind
storm -spend more money.
A good way to turn a category 1 financial hurricane into a category
3 financial storm.
STILL A LOT OF MONEY
A reasonable case can be made that the $100,000 starting point for
the provincial sunshine list is outdated because of inflation and
that the bar should be raised. However, since the Harris government
brought in the list the income level for hardworking folks at the
other end of the food chain and those on fixed incomes has barely
budged. A six-figure salary, especially in this part of the
province, is still a much better than average income.
HOLDING PATTERN
The longest running test pattern in television history just might
be the Ontario legislative channel which covers the legislature ...
when it is in session. And just a thought, what do all those people
paid to keep the legislature running do when it has been shutdown
for months?
HIGH PROFILE CASE
Former Cornwall lawyer Diane Lahaie has been an Ontario Court
Justice for less than a year but is involved in a high profile
Ottawa court case involving a restaurant owner found guilty of
criminal libel after carrying out a smear campaign against a
customer who wrote a critical review of the ByWard Market eatery on
the internet. The New York Times and Dr. Phil have mentioned the
case. The Crown has asked for a 90-day jail sentence. A decision on
sentence was to be made Friday.
RYAN TURNS 32
Hollywood heart-throb Ryan Gosling, who calls Cornwall his
hometown, turned 32 on Monday. A great video has been uncovered in
somebody's garage of a 10-year-old Gosling and his sister Mandi
performing during a talent show at Aultsville Hall. Talk about
talent ... wow!
BAD HABITS PAY
If everybody stopped smoking, drinking and gambling today, the
provincial goverment - deprived of billions of dollars in sin taxes
-would be hanging out the bankruptcy sign on the front door of
Queen's Park. True, there would be some savings in health-care costs
but they would take years to kick in. But on the flip side, people
would live longer putting an even bigger strain on pension plans.
IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR
Lebano's Store at Fourth and Amelia streets, a favourite hangout
for the 1950s and 1960s Cornwall Collegiate crowd ... Kennedy's Soda
Bar on Pitt, next to the old police station ... Lawn's Pool Hall at
First and Pitt streets ... Central Billiards on Pitt next to the
LCBO ... Modern Billiards on Third Street West between Pitt and
Adolphus ... the old A and P store (manager Harold Smith) on Pitt
Street ...
VOICE FROM THE PAST
Former Standard-Freeholder sports editor Dave Shoihet checks in
with Coffee Break. Now 74, he lives in Ottawa and has fond memories
of his time in Cornwall before moving to the Montreal Gazette where
he toiled under the legendary Red Fisher.
CARE'S GREAT, FOOD ISN'T
A South Stormont resident who spent 30 days as a "guest" of
Cornwall Community Hospital after breaking a hip is back home
singing the praises of the staff that cared for her. However, she
can't same the say about the food. She called it slightly tastier
than cardboard. One of the problems is that in budget-cutting, the
food is pre-cooked in Ottawa and trucked to Cornwall. "I'm sure they
nuked the toast after making it in Ottawa," she said.
IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT
The need for the city to cut off-peak ice rental rates at the
Benson Centre to attract clients puts a twist to the Field of Dreams
line "If you build it, he will come." In the case of the
multi-million B Centre, it is "If you build it, they will come ...
if the price is right."

Full text: Why a week off in the middle of a playoff run, you ask?
So we, as golf fans, can figure out just what the heck is going on.
Quick, get out the abacus and tell me the probability of No. 70
Chris Stroud, currently with an impressive-sounding total of 788
points, catching No. 1 Webb Simpson, who, with 4,711 points, is
3,923 up in the manufactured race for the FedExCup.
Having decided about mid-way through my middling high-school career
that advanced mathematics just weren't for me, I fear I cannot offer
you much in the way of statistical analysis. But who can, outside of
the PGA Tour number crunchers who made this crap up?
Sure, there was an exciting finish to the Deutsche Bank
Championship, where This-ain't-your-father's-belly- putter poster
boy James (Webb) Simpson and I-won-the- Canadian-Open-once-and-
haven't-done-much-since Chesney (Chez) Reavie battled it out in a
playoff. But some of the best stories from the Labour Day finish
were about guys who made it in by the skin of their teeth.
Ernie Els thought he needed a birdie on the 18th on Monday to make
it into the top 70, and he hit a 6-footer to make it (even though it
turned out par would have been fine). Stroud plunked in an eagle on
18 to seize the final spot in the BMW Championship. And Geoff Ogilvy
birdied 18 to live to play another day with the 69th rank.
"I knew if I didn't make birdie here my season was over and I was

Interesting that Sir Nick Faldo recently told a Montreal newspaper
that Tiger Woods' window for passing Jack Nicklaus' record 18 majors
had closed, in his estimation, at the age of 35.
Faldo won his last major-- the 1996 Masters--at the age of 38, but
told the Montreal Gazette that Woods has too much going on in his
life to be able to focus fully on golf.
"Once my quality of mind-set for practice was broken, it's been
broken ever since," Faldo said.
A big hiT
While it's an impressive feat and a first since the PGA Tour
started keeping those stats, Dustin Johnson had little to show for
leading in both driving distance and driving accuracy at the
Deutsche Bank Championship.
The long-hitting Johnson averaged 344.1 yards from the tee and hit
the fairway 78.57% of the time, but putted poorly and faded to
finish tied for 42nd after averaging 30.3 putts per round.
Winner Simpson gave up 45 yards off the tee to Johnson, but his
28.728 putts per round got it done.
Perhaps the most well-rounded performance of the weekend, however,
came from Thomas Bjorn in his victory at the European Masters.
Bjorn led the field in driving accuracy (82.7%), greens in
regulation (80.6%) and was a respectable 24th in driving distance
(302 yards) and 28th in putting (29.3 putts per round).the impending

Three picks to win the FedExCup
Anyone in the Top-70 could, technically, win the FedExCup, but
catching leader Webb Simpson is likely going to take at least one
victory in the last two events.
DUSTIN JOHNSON
Current rank: 2
Points behind leader: 897
Why he can win: Won the first playoff event, the barclays, to
establish himself as a contender. Stumbled at at the deutsche bank
Championship but is defending champ of next week's tournament, the
bmW Championship.
LUKE DONALD
Current rank: 4
Points behind leader: 1,836
Why he can win: the world No. 1 is the model of consistency, but
it's no secret that he longs to show he can win the big tournaments
too, and the bmW and tour Championship fit the bill.
JASON DAY
Current rank: 6
Points behind leader: 2,354
Why he can win: this kid is always lurking and he's going to emerge
one of these times. the big-game player was right there at the
masters and U.S. Open and the $10-million FedexCup wouldn't be a bad
consolation prize.

were about guys who made it in by the skin of their teeth.
Ernie Els thought he needed a birdie on the 18th on Monday to make
it into the top 70, and he hit a 6-footer to make it (even though it
turned out par would have been fine). Stroud plunked in an eagle on
18 to seize the final spot in the BMW Championship. And Geoff Ogilvy
birdied 18 to live to play another day with the 69th rank.

It happens every Friday all year: It's called the cut. And just
making the cut usually isn't really something to celebrate.
Is it just me, or are the FedEx- Cup Playoffs just a bit too
contrived?

Interesting that Sir Nick Faldo recently told a Montreal newspaper
that Tiger Woods' window for passing Jack Nicklaus' record 18 majors
had closed, in his estimation, at the age of 35.
Faldo won his last major--the 1996 Masters -- at the age of 38, but
told the Montreal Gazette that Woods has too much going on in his
life to be able to focus fully on golf.
"Once my quality of mindset for practice was broken, it's been
broken ever since," Faldo said.

While it's an impressive feat and a first since the PGA Tour
started keeping those stats, Dustin Johnson had little to show for
leading in both driving distance and driving accuracy at the
Deutsche Bank Championship.
The long-hitting Johnson averaged 344.1 yards from the tee and hit
the fairway 78.57% of the time, but putted poorly and faded to
finish tied for 42nd after averaging 30.3 putts per round.
Winner Simpson gave up 45 yards off the tee to Johnson, but his
28.728 putts per round got it done.
Perhaps the most well-rounded performance of the weekend, however,
came from Thomas Bjorn in his victory at the European Masters.
Bjorn led the field in driving accuracy (82.7%), greens in
regulation (80.6%) and was a respectable 24th in driving distance
(302 yards) and 28th in putting (29.3 putts per round).the impending
storm, though.

Full text: After 11 months of the historic, sweeping American
presidential election, the race here in Quebec, where campaign
conflicts are of the much more entertaining front room variety
whereby someone actually calls the cops, makes for a nice change of
pace.
Liberal Premier Jean Charest called this election the day after the
U.S. presidential race concluded and three weeks after Canada's vote
in the apparent belief that a day without an election -- federal,
provincial, American, whatever -- is like a day without sunshine.
His public explanation was that with the U.S. economic meltdown
going global, he needs a majority government to marshal its impact
in Quebec.
"We can't face an economic storm with three different pairs of
hands on the rudder of our ship," he cautioned.
A Leger Marketing poll conducted last weekend for Sun Media's Le
Journal de Montreal, its TVA network and CanWest's Montreal Gazette,
indicates voters weren't buying it.
The results, released yesterday, show Charest's Liberals at 41% --
down a point from the last week of October. Pauline Marois' Parti
Quebecois is at 35% -- up a point from that last poll. Mario
Dumont's Action Democratique du Quebec is unchanged 14%.
The two most important things about this poll are that all the
shifts are within the margins of error and that it was conducted
largely before the worst news of the first few days of the campaign,
which tilted toward the PQ, including the nomination meeting brawl
of Saturday night, the news that the party is broke and a leak of
the party's own focus group results showing people think Marois is a
snob.
LABOUR ON FENCE
Rounding out the headlines in week one was the news that the
Federation des Travailleurs du Quebec, the traditional endorsement
equivalent of the Teamsters for the Democratic Party in the U.S.,
will be sitting on the fence.
Charest was taking heat yesterday for balking at a roundtable
format for the leaders debate, but anyone who saw even five minutes
of the federal version knows it's hard to look leaderish when you're
stuck in the political equivalent of a bad day on The View.
Action Democratique Leader Mario Dumont, having failed to use his
time in official opposition to establish himself in the minds of
voters as a potential premier, is campaigning on the same
inward-looking message he espoused during the reasonable
accommodation debate, directed at the same culture clash voters,
this time targeting the province's new mandatory Ethics and
Religious Culture course.
Marois, meanwhile, is being stalked by a chorus of radical hardline
sovereignists who support mandatory political discourse on the one
issue nobody feels like talking about, especially in an economic
meltdown (that's how the fist fight broke out).
In a speech to the Montreal Board of Trade last week, Charest mused
that, in tough economic times, it isn't Dumont who'll be signing
immigration deals and it won't be Marois who'll be negotiating a
common market with Ontario. In other words, why vote for someone
whose economic options are limited by other issues?
It's another month until Dec. 8, but if this keeps up, an election
call that seemed opportunistic and strangely heedless of what had
just not happened in the federal election could start to look not so
crazy after all.

Full text: MONTREAL (CP) - Hardline Quebec separatist Yves Michaud has filed a defamation suit against the Montreal Gazette and political columnist Don Macpherson about a column involving comments Michaud made about the Holocaust and Jews.
Michaud is suing over a column by Macpherson last December in which he criticized Quebec Premier Bernard Landry for appearing at a sovereigntist rally attended by Michaud.
Michaud had created a storm of controversy after he made comments to a legislature committee, calling B'nai Brith an anti-Quebec organization and saying that Jews believed they were the only people who had ever suffered.
Michaud, who has denied that his comments were hateful, is seeking $100,000 damages from the Gazette, claiming that the column contained "untrue and defamatory allegations" that damaged his reputation, dignity and honour.
Gazette lawyer Mark Bantey said the newspaper will fight the accusations.
"It's a question of fair comment," Bantey said.
The Quebec legislature censured Michaud the day after he made the remarks. He has petitioned the legislature to reverse the motion of censure against him. Michaud later withdrew his candidacy for the Parti Quebecois in the Montreal riding of Mercier.
Then-premier Lucien Bouchard referred to the remarks as one of the reasons he quit politics last year.
Michaud has previously filed suits against two other men who criticized him for the remarks.
Michaud is seeking $15,000 in damages from university professor Marc Angenot for comments he made about Michaud on a television program.
Last August, Michaud filed a $95,000 suit against journalist Robert Levesque and publisher Communication Gratte-Ciel.
