That dry, hot, sunny weather we've been seeing this week will be even more unbearable on Saturday with a projected high of 34 degrees C, which if it hits that will break the record of 32.7C set in 2012. The humidex is forecast around 40, with a UV index of 9 (very high).
The good news is there will be a few clouds and a light wind.
Tonight: A few clouds, low 22.
