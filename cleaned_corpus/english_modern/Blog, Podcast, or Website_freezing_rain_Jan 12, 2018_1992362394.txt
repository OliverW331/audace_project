Saturday will be the first of many instances where the entire Ville Marie Expressway will be closed as workers demolish the old structure.
Westbound traffic on the Ville-Marie was diverted to the eastbound span last month and will remain that way at least until the middle or end of 2019( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/gridlock-gridlock-gridlock-no-turcot-relief-till-middle-or- end -of-2019 ). Crews must demolish and then rebuild the westbound highway. Until then, both the eastbound and westbound traffic on the expressway will share one span, with traffic lanes reduced to two lanes for most of that span.
The westbound Ville Marie will be closed starting Sarurday at 11:59 p.m. until Monday at 5 a.m. All westbound traffic will be forced off at Exit 5 toward Robert-Bourassa Blvd. and the Bonaventure Expressway downtown. The highway will be closed from that exit all the way to the Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue/Angrignon Blvd. entrance where Notre-Dame-de-Grâce meets LaSalle.
The eastbound Ville Marie will be closed from Décarie to the De La Cathedrale St. entrance downtown according to the same schedule.
The entrances to the westbound Ville-Marie at St-Antoine St. and Hôtel-de-Ville Ave. will be closed, as will the entrance to the eastbound Ville-Marie from Décarie.
The entrance to Highway 20 west from Highway 15 north will be closed, as will the entrance from the Décarie Expressway to the westbound Highway 20.
Originally, Transport Quebec had planned for the closures to begin Friday, but the department revised the schedule because of bad weather expected Friday night( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ).
