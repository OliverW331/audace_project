Cottage-goers are able to enjoy campfires over the long weekend as the Quebec Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks has lifted their open-air fire ban for the south of the province.
The ministry said the decision was made to end the ban in the Outaouais, Laurentian, Lanaudière and parts of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue regions after preventative measures and increased rainfall has reduced risks of wildfires.
The ban, which had been in effect since Tuesday( http://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bonfire-ban-covers-vast-areas-of-quebec-including-cottage-country ), still covers northern parts of the province, including the Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Mauricie, Abitibi and Vallée-de-l'Or areas.
