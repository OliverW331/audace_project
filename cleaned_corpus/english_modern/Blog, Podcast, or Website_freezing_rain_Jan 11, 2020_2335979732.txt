Due to poor road conditions as we head into a weekend of rain and freezing rain( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-expected-to-frost-montreal-area-this-weekend ), the delivery of the Montreal Gazette Saturday paper could be late. We expect, however, to be able to deliver by 11 am.
Readers can access an exact facsimile of the Saturday print edition at no charge via our e-edition( http://epaper.montrealgazette.com/montreal-gazette ).
Our apologies for the inconvenience. We appreciate your patience and understanding.
