A semi-trailer carrying flammable material on Route 117 tipped over, causing its load to spill and forcing the evacuation of three homes in the Laurentians town of Lac-Saguay, 200 kilometres north of Montreal.
Route 117 was closed overnight Thursday, and was still closed Friday morning over 20 kilometres between Lac-Saguay and Lac des-Écorces, farther north, while crews were cleaning up the material. The driver was not injured.
A detour was in place using Route 105 or Route 309.
Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Marc Tessier said freezing rain and a slippery road surface could have contributed to the accident. He was not able to say when the residents of the area would be able to return or when the road would be reopened.
