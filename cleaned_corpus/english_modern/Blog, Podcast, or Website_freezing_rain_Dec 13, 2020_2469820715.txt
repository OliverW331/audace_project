Eastern Quebec has been hit with winter storm warnings Sunday morning.
Environment Canada meteorologists are expecting heavy snowfall in the Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie and Côte-Nord regions, leaving an accumulation of 15 to 30 cm in places.
The sudden precipitation and blowing snow along the river could complicate travel.
Weather conditions are expected to improve during Sunday evening.
Storm surge warnings have also been issued by the federal agency due to higher than normal water levels and large waves near the coast. A minor overflow was expected by midday.
Other areas further west were expected to receive less than a millimetre of ice early in the day, before the temperature rose above freezing.
