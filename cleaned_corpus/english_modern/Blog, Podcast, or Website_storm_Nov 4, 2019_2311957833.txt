Only during the 1998 Ice Storm did more people lose power across the province than people did during the wind storms that blew through the region last Friday.
On Monday, Hydro-Québec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/hydro-quebec ) CEO Éric Martel said power has been restored to 94 per cent of the utility's clientele. Some pockets in rural parts of the province remained off the grid, particularly in the Eastern Townships, Lanaudière and Trois-Rivières areas. A total of 1,400 workers were out repairing the parts of the network that were still damaged.
"Everybody is working around the clock to get people back up," Martel said. "We're now dealing with outages that just affect a few people. We're getting to areas that are hard to access, and each time we reconnect, only four or five customers are affected."
As of 7 a.m. Monday, 56,781 customers remained in the dark, and Martel promised nearly all would be reconnected by Tuesday.
The regions that remained without power Monday were those where high winds caused extensive damage to trees, which in turn fell on power lines. Repair crews in those areas prioritized the parts of the grid serving hospitals or water-treatment plants. About 50 schools remained closed on Monday because of the outages.

All of Hydro-Québec's repair crews were deployed during the weekend and were reinforced by colleagues from the city of Detroit in Michigan, Ottawa and New Brunswick.
At the height of the blackouts, a total of 990,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, leading Quebec Premier François Legault to compare the crisis to the 1998 Ice Storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning ) when 1.5 million households went without power, some for several weeks.
In 1998, the transmission network collapsed, with steel pylons crumbling under the weight of ice. In Friday's storm, most of the outages were caused by wires on smaller wooden poles near homes. Winds sent broken branches into the network at 2,500 sites, causing the massive blackouts.
Speaking to reporters Monday morning, Martel said the utility knew about the threat from high winds well in advance and had deployed teams in strategic locations to be ready for the outages.
Martel said the utility is still learning the lessons from the Ice Storm and beefing up its transmission lines. However, while the Ice Storm was a unique occurrence, extreme weather is becoming more common because of climate change, Martel said.
"The weather has been different, and we've observed that in the last two years," Martel said. "In the last four years, we have been doing a lot of work in our research centres. We're also testing how we cut trees, how we put new (covering) on our cables. We're thinking of redesigning the posts also. So we're in a testing mode."
Martel added that while some have suggested burying electrical cables to make them more resilient to weather extremes, that's a prohibitively expensive proposal and would not be the best way to make the network more resilient.
"It sounds like an easy solution, but it would cost $100 billion to bury all the cables," he said. "There are also a lot of other downsides when you bury cables; you would still have outages, and it would be harder to find the outages. The cables would also degrade much quicker if they are underground. We would not get our value for that money."
