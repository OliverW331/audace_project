Christmas is coming, but that's no reason for theatregoers to put up with too many silent nights over the next month or so.
There's the usual feast of family shows, and we've chosen 12 of the most promising, including a première from Cirque du Soleil, one or two children's classics, and some seasonal singalong specials with a touch of Broadway.
And before the regular theatres go dark, there are still some adult-oriented productions to be found, such as a dinner party from hell, courtesy of D2 Productions, that will hopefully help you enjoy your holiday get-togethers all the more by way of contrast.
Axel (Dec. 19-29, Bell Centre): Cirque du Soleil's second extravaganza on ice (the first being Crystal) gets its official première this month. It's the story of a young guy with a passion for skating, music and graphic arts who falls in love with an enigmatic young woman. Mounted on the scale of an arena rock concert, it features spectacular projections and variations on the music of Radiohead, Tears for Fears and the Bee Gees, among others. ($40-$140; 855-310-2525; evenko.ca)
Blizzard (Dec. 17-Jan. 5, TOHU, 2345 Jarry St. E.): More wintry circus from Quebec City's Flip Fabrique, as that titular snowstorm sweeps not only into the city streets, but into rooms as well. This is no grim apocalyptic vision, though, but a playful tribute to the magic of the season. ($33-$56; discounts available; 514-376-8648; tohu.ca)
Treasure Island (Dec. 13-Jan. 5, Hudson Village Theatre, 28 Wharf Rd.): It's time for Hudson Village Theatre to roll out its annual, unashamedly preposterous, Britstyle pantomime. Groan-worthy jokes, raucous singalongs and gaudy costumes will no doubt fuel this less-than-reverent Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation, as Long John Silver tangles with the Smuggler's Cove Women's Institute. ($23; 450-458-5361; villagetheatre.ca)
Peter and the Starcatcher (continues through Dec. 14, Casgrain Theatre, 21275 Lakeshore Rd., Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue): The theatre students of John Abbott College plunge into the world of Peter Pan in this adaptation of Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's popular children's novel, a prequel of sorts that includes origin stories of Captain Hook, Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys. ($15; students and seniors $10; 514-457-6610; brownpapertickets.com)
Mamma Mia! (Dec. 12-29, Théâtre St-Denis, 1594 St-Denis St.): Serge Postigo's Juste pour rire production of the sunny ABBA musical, which played here last summer, returns to warm up the season. All the songs, as well as the dialogue, are translated into French. Watch out for anglo theatre favourite Eloi Archam-Baudoin (a META winner for Hosanna) in the cast. ($70-$146.80; 514-849-4211; theatrestdenis. com)
Pinocchio (Dec. 27-29, Cinquième Salle, Place des Arts): Carlo Collodi's classic story of the little puppet boy with a penchant for alternative facts. This acclaimed francophone adaptation comes courtesy of Tout à Trac, the company behind the excellent version of Around the World in 80 Days that played at Théâtre du Nouveau Monde a few years back. ($20; 514-842-2112; placedesarts.com) Ça! (Dec. 18-Jan. 5, Théâtre Outremont, 1248 Bernard Ave. W.): Milva Ménard, who appears in the aforementioned Pinocchio, is having a busy season. She can also be found in this one-woman feast of music, magical lights and francophone storytelling, with texts from Louis-Dominique Lavigne and Étienne Lepage, who previously adapted the rather weightier War and Peace and The Idiot, respectively, on Montreal stages. ($15; 514-495-9944; theatreoutremont.ca) Musicals and Mistletoe (Dec. 15 and 18, Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave.): A collection of Broadway and holiday hits, courtesy of the West Island company Full Circle Productions (whose Six Degrees of Broadway Separation played at Centaur last spring). ($30; students and seniors $25; theatrerialto.ca)
Candlelight Christmas (continues through Dec. 8, Concordia's Loyola Chapel, 7141 Sherbrooke St. W.): Another cosy evening of musical performance with a Broadway flavour, from the Lyric Theatre Singers. ($33; seniors and students $30; age 12 and under $16; 514-735-9908; lyrictheatrecompany.com)
The Nutcracker (Dec. 12-30, Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Place des Arts): Christmas in Montreal would be a duller place without Les Grands Ballets'annual presentation (now in its 56th year) of Fernand Nault's impossibly lavish production of the classic Tchaikovsky-scored ballet. Kids can also enjoy a French reading of E.T.A. Hoffmann's original tale an hour before each performance. ($50-$149; 514-842-2112; grandsballets.com)
À travers mes yeux (continues through Jan. 5, Maison Théâtre, 245 Ontario St. E.): A welcome return for this acclaimed dance show, which looks at everyday objects through a child's eyes and earned Hélène Langevin an award for best choreographic work at this year's Prix de la Danse. ($17; 514-288-7211; maisontheatre.com) It's a Wonderful Life (Dec. 7, D.B. Clarke Theatre, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.): Geordie Theatre's annual gala fundraiser brings back an old favourite: their adaptation of the irresistibly feel-good Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart movie about a man who loses it all, only to discover the true meaning of the season.
Mike Payette and Jessica Abdallah direct a cast of 31, which includes local legal, business and medical worthies. The $100 ($75 tax-credited) tickets include a cocktail and a catered reception. (514-845-9810; geordie.ca) Theatregoers who aren't yet done with more adult-oriented holiday treats could do a lot worse than Jordan Tannahill's Late Company, which D2 Productions is reprising from Dec. 10 to 15 at the Segal Studio (5170 Côte-Ste-Catherine Rd.). It's a searing, at times caustically funny, play about the tragic fallout from homophobic bullying and is beautifully performed, especially by Helena Levitt as the devastated mother.
There's a feast of new writing starting with Infinithéâtre's annual festival the Pipeline, whose readings continue with works by Oren Safdie (Dec. 7, 7 p.m., Rialto Theatre, 5723 Parc Ave.) and Marc-André Thibault (Dec. 8, 2 p.m., KIN Gallery, 397A Ste-Catherine St. W.).
There's a double bill of new plays from Black Theatre Workshop, Dec. 10-15 at the MAI centre (3680 Jeanne-Mance St.). It consists of Willow Cioppa's Dark Red, an epistolary barrage directed at past sexual partners, and Cry Baby, Kalale Dalton-Lutale's archival dig into her history.
Meanwhile, MainLine Theatre (3997 St-Laurent Blvd.) is keeping busy, with Late Night Double Feature (through Dec. 8), two one-act plays inspired by grindhouse cinema; The Living Room Sessions (Dec. 14), a cosy concert from musical theatre specialist Noelle Hannibal and pianist Ian Baird; and over in the Mini-Main the same evening, Dishonour on Your Cow, an evening of comedy storytelling from Silvi Santoso.
And don't forget, Centaur Theatre is still hanging out with puppet master Ronnie Burkett and his very wonderful Scrooge spoof Little Dickens, which has been extended to Dec. 21.
