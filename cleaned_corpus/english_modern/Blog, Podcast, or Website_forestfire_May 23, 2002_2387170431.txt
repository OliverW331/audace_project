Residents in the northern Saskatchewan community of Montreal Lake have been allowed to return home after a raging forest fire threatened their safety earlier this week.
Just over 140 people were allowed to return to their homes in Montreal Lake late Wednesday, Saskatchewan Social Services spokesman Doug Wakabayaski told globeandmail.com on Thursday. They had been staying at a college campus in Prince Albert since the blaze got dangerously close to their community on Monday.
The fire damaged a house in the area as well as some logging equipment. Several other homes had smoke damage.
The 558-hectare blaze is not under control, but fire crews are making progress, John Cook, spokesman for Saskatchewan's provincial forest fire centre in Prince Albert, told globeandmail.com on Thursday.
More than 130 firefighters are working on the fire but continue to face dry conditions.
"It is very, very dry," he said. "There is no rain in the forecast."
Saskatchewan Environment urges residents to use extra caution in the extremely dry conditions.
In Alberta, a forest fire about 130 kilometres south of Fort McMurray and 80 kilometres north of Lac La Biche continued to burn Thursday. The fire, still considered out of control, continued to cover an area about 70,000 hectares, said Terry Cunha, spokesman for Alberta Sustainable Resource Development.
"There has been no significant growth [in the fire]" Mr. Cunha told globeandmail.com on Thursday.
Just over 500 firefighters continue to battle the fire, 70 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide at it widest point, which started on Friday.
Fire crews faced warmer temperatures and lower winds on Thursday but there was no rain in the forecast.
"Hopefully we will get some precipitation in the area," Mr. Cunha said.
