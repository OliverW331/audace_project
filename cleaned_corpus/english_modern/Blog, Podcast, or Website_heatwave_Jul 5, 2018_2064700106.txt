A power failure that left close to 5,000 Hydro-Québec customers in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce area without electricity - and air conditioning - has been reduced in scope within half an hour.
The blackout that covered a swath of residences and businesses framed by Cavendish Blvd., Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Ave., De Maisonneuve Blvd. and Grey Ave. has been reduced to three, isolated outages affecting about 200.
The cause of the outages was not immediately known. Power is expected to be restored by 8:30 a.m.
Updates are available through Hydro-Québec's app or on its website( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/#map ).
