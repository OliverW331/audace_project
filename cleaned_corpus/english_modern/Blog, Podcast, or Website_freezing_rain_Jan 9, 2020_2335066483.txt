Iran says crash jet tried to turn back, while Ukraine probes missile theory: The Boeing Co. jet that crashed near Tehran Tuesday tried to turn back after takeoff, Iran revealed in an initial report as Ukraine said it's examining scenarios including a missile strike and terrorism. At least six Quebecers were among 176 who died when a Boeing 737-800 crashed shortly after takeoff( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-were-among-those-killed-on-plane-that-went-down-in-iran ). Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 disappeared from radar screens at 8,000 feet, and witnesses said they saw it on fire in the air, according to Iran's Civil Aviation Organization. The flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders were damaged but their core memory appears to be accessible, the report said. The findings are the first officially released from a probe fraught with difficulty amid heightened U.S.-Iranian tensions. Ukraine added to confusion around the crash, saying it's looking at whether the jet was downed by a missile or bomb after Iran had insisted it fell victim to a technical failure or engine fire. The scenarios are among several put forward to explain the disaster, National Security & Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Facebook, pointing to supposed evidence of missile debris found near the crash site and circulated on the Internet. Others include a collision with a drone or other object, as well as destruction of an engine due to technical reasons, he said.
