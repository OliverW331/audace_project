Heading in to work on Monday, Montreal commuters learned two hard lessons very early in the day: stay away from hills and don't even think about finding a parking spot.
Sunday's snowstorm might have been the coldest storm Montreal has seen in a century, almost exactly, as YUL Weather Records reports that on Jan. 16, 1920, we had a dump of 30.2 centimetres with a daytime high of minus-19.4 Celsius. In this latest storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ), Montreal saw 20 centimetres of snow with a high at 5 p.m. of minus-16 C.
Coldest snowstorm in almost 100 years possible tomorrow. Temperatures are expected to stay below -15°C with up to 25cm of snow.

Monday morning, the city deployed road and sidewalk plows on major thoroughfares in an effort to get ahead of the inevitable traffic jam that would welcome motorists and public transit users.
But the glacial temperatures that heralded Monday morning - minus 21 Celsius with wind chill of minus-34 C - rendered the use of salt useless and forced the city to resort to using gravel as an abrasive.
Worse, the frigid air created patches of black ice( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) that rendered some well-travelled hills in the city particularly challenging.
While provincial and local police reported scores of fender benders over the course of Sunday's storm, Montreal police recorded a more serious incident early Monday when a motorist apparently failed to stop at a red light at the corner of Larrey St. and the service road of Louis H. Lafontaine Blvd. in Anjou.
The car collided with a snow plow that was crossing the intersection around 1:15 a.m. The driver of the car was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries while the driver of the plow was unhurt.

Meanwhile, it appeared early Monday that the city had made good on its promise to clear streets as quickly as possible, with many major thoroughfares downtown completely plowed but at the cost of snowbanks appearing where parking spots used to be( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), creating another reason to leave your car at home.
The snow removal operation is scheduled to being at 7 p.m. Monday and last for most of the coming week. However, that operation may be complicated by a weather forecast as unpredictable as the city's road surfaces. While temperatures will remain well below zero Monday and Tuesday, Metéomedia's forecast for this week says those temperatures will rise to minus 3-C on Wednesday and hit plus 2 C - with rain - on Thursday before plunging back to minus 7-C on Friday.
Extreme cold and winter storm warnings were active for most of the rest of southern Quebec and Ontario. Environment Canada advises people to "cover up: Frostbite can happen in minutes."
