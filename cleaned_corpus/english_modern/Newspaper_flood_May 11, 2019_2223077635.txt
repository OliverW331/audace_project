Re: "Situation is stable across province, authorities say" (Montreal Gazette, May 6) Kudos to the city of Montreal and its workers for the proactive stand that saved many of us from another traumatic experience.
In 2017 flooding, we were so unprepared and the damage was extensive. This time around the city supplied us with sandbags and had an open line of communication.
Now the flood is practically over, my sincere thanks to all the workers of the great city of Montreal.
