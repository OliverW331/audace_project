A week that at one point saw more than 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region deprived of power by freezing rain and high winds came to a close Friday morning with fewer than 2,000 customers in the Laurentians waiting to be plugged back into the power grid.
As of 7:30 a.m., a total of 1,549 customers in the Laurentians were waiting for power to be restored while Hydro-Québec had re-connected all of but 15 clients in Laval and 26 in the Lanaudière to its network. By 5 p.m. Friday, fewer than 150 customers in all three regions combined were without power, and only 350 province-wide, out of 4.3 million total.
Those numbers contrast starkly with the count 24 hours earlier, when the number of homes and businesses in the dark stood at 106,000.
Since Monday, when the power grid suffered its worst damage, dozens of persons in the affected areas were treated for carbon monoxide intoxication after they resorted to using barbecues and other outdoor heat sources into their homes to combat the cold.
As of Thursday morning, the number patients treated stood at 46.
