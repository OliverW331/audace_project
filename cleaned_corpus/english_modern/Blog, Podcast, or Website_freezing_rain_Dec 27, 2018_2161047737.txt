Montrealers woke up Thursday to a frigid wind chill of minus-18 Celsius under mostly clear skies, but over the next 24 hours the temperature is expected to creep up, turning long-hoped-for snow into freezing rain.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and the Longueuil areas. Although it could snow after midnight, the precipitation is expected to turn to rain by dawn. It is expected to last about two hours and leave one to three millimetres on the roads, just in time for rush hour.
Temperatures will continue to climb, with a forecast high of 7 C Friday. The rain will continue to Saturday, which could reach 3 C. Will we have a white New Year's Eve? It's possible - Environment Canada is optimistically predicting periods of snow for Monday. But that's four days away - let's just get through the rest of 2018 safely first.
