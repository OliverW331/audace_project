As the city of Montreal clears away the snow that fell on the weekend, more precipitation is on the way.
Environment Canada is forecasting about five fresh centimetres of snow for Wednesday, probably followed by freezing rain and then rain.
"It's still early to get into details, but there's a good probability that we're going to see freezing rain - it could be late Wednesday afternoon or early evening," said meteorologist Alexandre Parent.
Rain is then expected between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Parent said.
"It's a couple of systems that are merging together," he said.
"The snow that we're going to get on Wednesday is an approaching system over the Great Lakes, but there's a development over the Eastern seaboard and it's bringing the rain and warmer temperatures."
Highs of zero and -2 C are forecast for Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
Colder weather will return by Thursday night, when the low is expected to be -11.
