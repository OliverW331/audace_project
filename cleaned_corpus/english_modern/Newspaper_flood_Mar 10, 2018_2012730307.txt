Re: "Quebec unveils plan to improve disaster relief" (Montreal Gazette, March 2) Quebec's declaration that it will subsidize new urban flood maps is welcome, but the government has yet to declare its support for conserving the remaining, yet significant wetlands on the island of Montreal.
Since wetlands are crucial in preventing flooding and are important areas of biodiversity, Quebec and Montreal should act quickly to preserve the Technoparc wetlands in St-Laurent and the large wetland area in west Pierrefonds, among others.
There is no need to destroy more eco-territories for the sake of condos and industrial buildings that can be built elsewhere.
