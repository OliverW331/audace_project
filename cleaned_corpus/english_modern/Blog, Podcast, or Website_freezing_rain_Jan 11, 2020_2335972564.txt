Construction will road closings involving the Turcot and Angrignon interchanges on Saturday.
However, provincial transport authorities warn also any and all construction could be postponed in case of poor weather, a distinct possibility given the weather cocktail expected to descend on Montreal on Saturday and Sunday.
The following closings are planned to be in effect until 5 a.m. Monday.
Construction on the Turcot Interchange Jan. 10-13, 2020, weather permitting.
. Eastbound Highway 20 between the Turcot Interchange and the access ramp for de la Cathédrale and Notre-Dame St. W.
. The ramp from southbound Highway 15 for eastbound Highway 720.
. The ramp from westbound Highway 20 for Exit 65 for Route 138 E. / Angrignon Blvd. / St-Jacques St.
. Access to eastbound Highway 20 from Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Blvd.
If those road closing do not deter you from weekend travel on local roads, just remember the condition of those roads are expected to be subject to rapid and perhaps treacherous change over the next 73 hours.
Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a "significant" amount of precipitation.
In a special weather statement for the Montreal area that was updated at 3:49 p.m. Friday, the federal weather service said rain throughout the day on Saturday will be followed by freezing rain on Saturday evening.
"Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant and make surfaces such as highways, streets and sidewalks treacherous.
"Strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are also expected on Sunday, and may possibly impact icy structures such as tree limbs and power lines."
The Outaouais, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière regions could also see significant amounts of snow and ice pellets.
