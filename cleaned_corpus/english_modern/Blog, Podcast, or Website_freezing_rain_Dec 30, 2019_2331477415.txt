With a major snowstorm bearing down on Montreal, thousands of West Island homeowners, many of them elderly, have been left in the lurch after one of the area's largest snow removal companies( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) has ceased operations.
Marc Guindon, the owner of Bo-Pelouse, sent an email to employees announcing the abrupt closing: "Hello, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you all know that after trying my hardest, Bo-Pelouse will be ceasing it's operations after 30 years. I had hopes even today that I might be able to continue but unfortunately it will not be possible on my own. I wish that you all may find employment rapidly and wish you all bright futures. With deep sadness."
Guindon had gained the trust of many customers and suppliers after operating in Pointe Claire and Dorval for decades.
After a small snowfall before Christmas, 26 tractor drivers fuelled up at Frank Mancuso's garage on Donegani Ave., as they have done for the last 20 years. But Mancuso suspected something was amiss when Guindon failed to pay him and didn't return a phone call.
"It's very sad," said Mancuso, who owns Donegani Service Station Inc. "It's a lot of money. We have a lot of customers who are older and they paid in advance. The drivers didn't know anything and a lot of them haven't haven't been paid."
Mancuso said Guindon worked hard over the years and had a lot of responsibility.
Pointe Claire city councillor Eric Stork, a friend of Guidon's, posted Guindon's e-mail message to staff on his Facebook page because he wanted to make citizens aware of "this unfortunate situation."
In the same post, Stork told residents they would have to make their own arrangements to clear the estimated 15-20 centimetres of snow expected by Tuesday.
Bo-Pelouse's website has been taken down and the voicemail inbox is full. Guindon could not be reached for comment. The company has about 5,500 customers in Pointe Claire, Dorval and Beaconsfield.
Several West Island residents were scrambling on Monday to try and sign up with one of Guindon's competitors. Others posted their frustrations on Facebook.
John Bradley turned up outside the company's office on Donegani Ave. after a neighbour told him that Bo Pelouse had shut down its operations. The office was closed and there was a message posted outside saying: "We are closed for the holidays from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3. We are open during snow removal operations. Happy Holidays."
Bradley, 59, said he paid the company $275 in October to have snow cleared from his driveway in Pointe Claire because his step-brother has a bad back and can no longer shovel.
"I have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)," he said. "If I do anything to exert (myself), I am done."
Bradley's elderly father has colon cancer and they and can't afford to pay another snow removal company because they're on a fixed income.
He said he is disappointed that he hasn't received an email or a phone call from the company.
Donald Chainey said the company has provided a good service during the three years he has been with them. He paid $175 upfront this summer to get an early bird special and is worried that he won't get his money back.
Rumours of the firm's demise have been circulating in the West Island for several days. The owner of another West Island snow removal company said he began hearing rumours from drivers that the company was in financial trouble.
The snow removal contractor, who operates in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Pierrefonds, said he's following the situation closely, but said he doesn't have enough equipment to take on any of Bo Pelouse's customers for the upcoming snowstorm.
"I have to take care of my own customers," said Marc-Antoine Tozzi, owner of Slyjack. "After the storm, we will see what happens." He suggested that homeowners who need their driveways plowed contact his company after the storm. "We are too busy to make a move at the last minute," he said.
However, a landscaping company called Southwest Garden and Snow, said it's preparing a service route for homeowners in western Pointe Claire. "Please be patient, we will have a competitive price in play for the balance of the season," says a message of the firm's Facebook page.
Last winter, Bo Pelouse made headlines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/snow-removal-signs-vandalized-in-dorval ) after about 72 of the firm's driveway markers went missing in Dorval.
Norm Aub√©, who owns a record store next door to Bo-Pelouse's office, said he was surprised to learn that the company has closed. He said he saw the Guindon about 10 days ago and nothing seemed amiss.
"A lot of customers were very happy with the service," he said.
