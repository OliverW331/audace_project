The Montreal area is expected to be hit with freezing rain Thursday at around 10 p.m. lasting until about 7 a.m. Friday, according to Environment Canada's( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) latest forecast.
A low-pressure system from the Gulf of Mexico should reach Quebec by Thursday evening, and it should dump between 20 to 30 millimetres of precipitation on Montreal.
"We're expecting quite a lot of precipitation with the system," said Dominic Martel, an Environment Canada meteorologist. "It should start with five to 10 millimetres of freezing rain."
Sidewalks and streets are expected to turn into sheets of ice overnight, but by 7 a.m. the temperature will start rising about the freezing mark, possibly reaching a high of 8 degrees Celsius by 3 p.m.
It will continue raining until midday Saturday, Martel said.
