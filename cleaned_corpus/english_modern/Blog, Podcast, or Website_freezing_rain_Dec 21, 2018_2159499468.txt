Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for the greater Montreal area, forecasting 10 to 20 millimetres of freezing rain starting Thursday evening and continuing overnight.
Around noon, the federal agency added a smog warning to the roster( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ). It predicts the smog will dissipate in the late evening as winds pick up - and by then, the rain should have started.
The freezing rain system will be felt first over southwestern Quebec before moving into the eastern half of the province Friday morning.
Areas just north of the St. Lawrence River are expected to be most affected by the precipitation. The freezing rain is expected to change to rain over the course of Friday and major rainfall accumulations could occur.
Travel is not recommended. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
André Monette, chief meteorologist at Météomédia, said the province can expect to see 30 to 60 millimetres of rain by Saturday morning( https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/meteo/quebec/montreal ).
Those rains and mild temperatures virtually ensure any region that doesn't already have a thick covering of snow - such as Montreal - will not be having a white Christmas.
Monette forecasts good weather for the holiday week, with temperatures slightly below normal.
Météomédia meanwhile is monitoring a system that could create a cocktail of weather conditions by Dec. 28 of Dec. 29.
The temperature is expected to drop to minus 2 C Thursday night before climbing to 6 C on Friday, with freezing rain or rain forecast for most of the day.
