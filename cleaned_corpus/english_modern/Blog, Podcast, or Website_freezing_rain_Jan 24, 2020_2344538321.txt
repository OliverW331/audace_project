Environment Canada on Friday issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area that, at the moment, forecasts a weekend of meteorological possibilities.
The statement, issued at 5:20 a.m., notes that a low-pressure system from the American Midwest will affect southwestern Quebec beginning Saturday evening. Describing the system as containing a "mixed bag of precipitation," the statement predicts that the precipitation will spread eventually toward eastern Quebec.
"Although precipitation is expected to begin as snow, it is highly possible that it changes to freezing rain over areas near the St. Lawrence River and even rain over areas further south," the statement says. "Total snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system evolves, but they could exceed 15 centimetres over areas north of the St. Lawrence River. Additionally, expected rainfall amounts should reach between 10 and 15 millimetres, at this time."
The statement warns also that travel could be difficult, but cautions "at this time, computer model guidance still shows significant variability regarding the system's track. Consequently, there is much uncertainty and the scenario could still change significantly."
