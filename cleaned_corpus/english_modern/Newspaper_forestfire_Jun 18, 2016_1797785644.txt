Montreal is excluded from an open-fire ban that encompasses most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River as of 8 p.m. Friday. Other exceptions are Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. The ban, which was recommended by SOPFEU, an organization that helps protect against forest fires, also excludes Ile Jesus (Laval), Quebec City and Charlevoix and certain areas of the Mauricie and the Laurentians. Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks Laurent Lessard decided to ban fires because of the heat wave we have just entered. Environment Canada forecasts sunny skies in Montreal with temperatures ranging from 27 degrees Celsius to 31 C from Friday till Monday. Fire danger over forested areas of Quebec range from high to extreme. There are two active forest fires in Quebec right now: Abitibi-Temiscamingue, and 20 kilometres northeast of St-Jerome in the Laurentians. Since the season began, there have been 224 fires over 156 hectares.
