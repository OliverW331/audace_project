Environment Canada lifted the week-old heat warning and day-old storm watch for the Montreal area early Friday as the region's deadly heat wave finally came to an end.
Provincial authorities have thus far attributed at least 33 deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ) to the extreme heat, which at some points over the past week created Humidex factors in the mid 40s.
The forecast for Friday calls for a high of 25 C and a Humidex of 31 C. The temperature is expected to drop to 13 C Friday night.
