A combination of wind and slow but steady freezing rain left nearly 200,000 Hydro-Québec customers without electricity in the Montreal area on Monday afternoon.
As of 2:15 p.m. the area hardest hit was the Laurentians, with nearly 74,000 customers blacked out.
Laval followed with more than 63,000 business and homes without electricity.
The Launaudière region had close to 46,000 clients off the grid, while power was out for nearly 16,000 customers of the island of Montreal.
While Montreal Island outages were to be repaired by late afternoon, Hydro-Québec could only assure customers in Laval and the Laurentians that repair crews were on route and would try to re-establish power as quickly as possible.
