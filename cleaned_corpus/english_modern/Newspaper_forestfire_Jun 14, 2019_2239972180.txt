Re: "Young Quebecers present case for climate change class-action suit" (Montreal Gazette, June 7) Government attorney Ginette Gobeil, in trying to stop a class action accusing Ottawa of climate-change inaction, asks: "How could one demonstrate that measures already adopted by the federal government will not achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets?" In fact, Environment and Climate Change Canada itself admits that current government measures will reduce emissions by only four per cent by 2030, against Canada's target of 30 per cent.
And even if one includes government measures under development but not yet fully implemented, this reduction figure rises to only 19 per cent.
Besides, a 30-per-cent reduction in emissions by 2030, even if achieved by all countries, will not, according to climate scientists, limit global warming to the 2 degrees C target, let alone the less damaging 1.5 C.
The youth bringing this class-action suit are right to argue that excessive warming can endanger their rights to life and security if, as predicted, it will result in potentially deadly heat waves, floods, forest fires, drought, sea level rise and sea acidification, and diminishing world food supply.
The court should take seriously this suit and hopefully find in favour of it, so that the government is moved to increase and accelerate its efforts to reduce emissions and limit climate change.
