Environment Canada has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Montreal, Laval and the South Shore.
It warned that atmospheric conditions were favourable for the formation of strong storms, warning of the possibility of strong wind gusts that could "toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles."
Meteorologist Alexandre Parent said that storms could appear this evening as a cold front moved into the region, signalling the end to the heat wave that scorched the city all week( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-33-quebecers-have-died-18-in-montreal-health-officials-say ).
