A woman in her mid-30s has apparently died in a multi-vehicle collision Saturday night on Route 117, near Lac-Pythonga, 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the La Vérendrye wildlife reserve.
Around 8 p.m., a 53-foot truck transporting food skidded and jackknifed on the icy road,( https://montrealgazette.com/news/environment-canada-issues-freezing-rain-warning-for-montreal ) dumping part of its load, said Sûreté du Québec spokesperson Sgt. Claude Denis. The driver of a long-distance bus was unable to stop because of the icy conditions and crashed into the truck at low speed, he said.
A second truck swerved off the road to try to avoid the pileup and landed on top of a car. Emergency workers used hydraulic tools to rescue the car driver but she showed no vital signs when she was brought out, Denis said.
The truck drivers and the driver and passengers of the bus were unharmed, but the driver of another vehicle was seriously injured and taken to a hospital in Montreal. The person's life was not to be in danger, Denis said.
Because of the investigation and the load spilled on the highway, it was partly closed, with drivers forced to alternate in each direction, he said.
