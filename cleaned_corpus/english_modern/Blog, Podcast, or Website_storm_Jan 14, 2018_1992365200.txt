Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after heavy snowfalls, which can block exhaust pipes and pull the odourless gas back into a car.
That warning was issued by the Montreal Children's Hospital this weekend in the wake of another heavy snowstorm in Quebec( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ).
Hospital officials noted that no children have died of carbon monoxide this season. Nonetheless, administrators want parents to be aware of their list of safety tips.
First, never leave a child alone in an idling car, hospital officials said.
Lorraine Brooke tries to clear the snow away from her car on St-Antoine St. W. near Laporte Ave. in Montreal on Saturday, January 13, 2018.
Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked. After a large snowfall, the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death.
The hospital also cautions never leave your car running inside the garage even if the garage door is open.
Signs to watch for include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.
More serious exposure can result in fainting, convulsions, coma and even death.
