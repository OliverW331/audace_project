Keys to the game for Montreal and Saskatchewan at Sunday's Grey Cup in Edmonton
? Montreal Alouettes
1. Stay loose. No matter how dominant they are in the regular season, quarterback Anthony Calvillo and the Alouettes' offence always seem to play tight on the biggest stage.
2. Man up. On a chilly Alberta evening, against a team that practises in blizzards and is known for its resiliency, Montreal is going to have to match Saskatchewan's heartiness.
3. Avon Cobourne. The most outstanding player from the 2009 Grey Cup game could make all the difference if he gets Montreal's ground game in gear.
4. Chip Cox. The outside linebacker has a nose for the ball (two interceptions against Saskatchewan this year), and his ability to blitz with speed and stealth could really disrupt the Riders' offence.
Saskatchewan Roughriders
1. Green energy. It is bound to be another home game for the Riders, and the Sea of Green could certainly help disrupt Montreal's offence.
2. Weston Dressler. The Riders' receiver owned Montreal defensive backs in two games this year (22 catches, 323 yards, three touchdowns) and will either be a primary target or one heck of a decoy.
3. Darian Durant. The Riders' quarterback also got fat on the Alouettes in 2010 (926 passing yards, seven touchdowns), and seems to be able to read Montreal's defences better than most opponents.
4. Special teams. The Alouettes are clearly better in this area, so it is incumbent on kicker Warren Kean, punter Eddie Johnson and return specialist Ryan Grice-Mullen not to make the big mistake.
