Stu Cowan: Habs weigh in as defiant Don Cherry goes out on his shield( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-habs-weigh-in-as-defiant-don-cherry-goes-out-on-his-shield )
It would have been interesting hear the conversation between Bart Yabsley and Don Cherry before the Sportsnet president decided to fire the star of Hockey Night in Canada's Coach's Corner on Monday.
I don't think Cherry believed he would be fired after his "you people" rant Saturday night, accusing immigrants of not buying poppies. Cherry had crossed the line many times before - insulting francophones, First Nations people, European hockey players, and ranting that female reporters don't belong in NHL locker rooms. Cherry has always refused to apologize for anything he says, standing behind his 85-year-old beliefs and refusing to evolve.
