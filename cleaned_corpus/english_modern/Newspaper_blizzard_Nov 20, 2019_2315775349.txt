The Wednesday Moment in Time feature included an incorrect spelling for Canada’s former governorgeneral Georges Vanier, after whom the Vanier cup is named.

The first game was held at Toronto’s Varsity Stadium and pitted the Alberta Golden Bears against the Toronto Varsity Blues. It was a cold day, with a biting wind, but a decent crowd of 3,488 still showed up to watch the hometown Blues beat the visiting Bears 14 to 7 to become the recipients of the inaugural Vanier Cup, named after George Vanier, this country’s first French-Canadian governor-general. For more than two decades, the game was played at the Toronto stadium before hitting the road in 1988. Since then, the cup has travelled from one end of the country to the other. It has been hoisted in a bone-chilling -36 C in Saskatoon (2006) and a blizzard in Hamilton two years later. Nasty weather aside, it’s a high point for university athletes who this year – for the 55th Vanier Cup – will go head on Saturday at Telus-Université Laval Stadium in Quebec City, where the Montreal Carabins will face the Calgary Dinos. The Dinos will be seeking their first Vanier Cup title since 1995. Montreal last won the cup in 2014. (The forecast? A relatively balmy -3 C). GAYLE MacDONALD
