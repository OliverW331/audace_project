A special weather statement by Environment Canada forecasting 15 centimetres of snow that could coincide with the Thursday morning rush hour has been amended - and the news isn't good.
While it was earlier suggested snow would begin Wednesday evening, the statement issued at 5:03 a.m. Wednesday( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#105024780154021011202001140504ws1070cwul ) is depressingly more precise, warning "snow will begin near midnight (Thursday) and intensify early in the morning."
"Areas south of a line extending from Montreal to Sherbrooke may see total snowfall amounts of up to 15 centimetres.
"This snow could be accompanied by blowing snow locally. Driving conditions will be hazardous during morning rush hour Thursday in Montreal and its suburbs."
The City of Montreal has taken precautionary measures in anticipation of the latest dump of precipitation, launching a snow clearing operation on Monday to remove the 11 centimetres of sleet and ice that accumulated during last weekend's cocktail of rain, freezing rain and ice pellets.
Meanwhile, local police forces took to social media to urge motorists to adapt their driving habits to the imminent spate of bad weather and remind them to clear snow off their car before embarking on roads Thursday morning.
Other bad-weather driving tips: ensure your car's windshield wiper reservoir and gas tank are topped up before you find yourself trapped in a traffic jam; have an ice scraper close at hand should your windshield white out because of the snow; and, if possible, ignore car travel altogether and use public transit.
