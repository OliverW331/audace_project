Montreal police are investigating the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a 35-yearold man in Lachine early Tuesday morning after believing initially that he died after slipping on an icy street.
"There were some new elements that were brought to the attention of the investigators that caused them to reopen the investigation," said Const. Jean-Pierre Brabant, a spokesperson for the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).
"It's now considered to be a suspicious death.
"The investigators are on the scene to know exactly what happened to the man."
At approximately 4 a.m., police and Urgences Santé responded to a 911 call, and found the man lying near a parked car on Provost St. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Earlier Tuesday, police said the probable cause of death was an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.
