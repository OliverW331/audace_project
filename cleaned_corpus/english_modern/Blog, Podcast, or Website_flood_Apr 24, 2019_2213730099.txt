The battle to keep Montreal's suburbs above water is going well, but it isn't over yet.
As melted ice and rain continue to fill the Ottawa River basin, water levels will probably peak by Thursday morning, according to Urgence-Quebec. And while the flooding isn't expected to exceed 2017 levels, officials are preaching caution for citizens who live in flood-prone areas.
"What I'm asking the population is to maintain their level of preparation at the highest level, to watch out for the safety of their neighbourhood, to help one another and to show solidarity," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance.
"(The rain) has a direct impact on water levels in the Montreal region. ... It's the weather that will determine whether or not the level will go up."
Lachance said the vast majority of dikes have already been built, but some still need to be raised or reinforced, especially on Île-Bizard. He also said authorities have no intention of evacuating Île-Mercier, south of Île-Bizard, even though the bridge to the island has been closed.
A parking lot is flooded in Pierrefonds. The street where the Club Piscine is located is beside the Rivière des Prairies. Many communities in the area are still in peril from rising waters.
As of midday Tuesday, 1,418 people across the province had left their homes, while 2,900 residences were flooded and a further 2,200 were cut off from their communities by flood waters or landslides caused by waterlogged soil.
But many of the communities that were devastated two years ago have been spared from the worst.
Deux-Montagnes resident Aimée Rupnik Subashi remembers the chaos of 2017; the water pierced through dikes and sent sewage pouring into people's basements and front yards. At the time, citizens banded together to keep their houses from going under, but dozens lost everything.
"We have friends whose house is still in the process of being repaired," said Rupnik Subashi, who lives near the flood zone by the Lake of Two Mountains. "Two years ago, we didn't have enough shovels, we weren't sure how to tie the sandbags down and it was sort of chaotic, it caught us by surprise."
Rupnik Subashi remembers people canoeing supplies up and down her street as rain battered the neighbourhood. Soldiers were eventually called in to save the nearby water filtration plant.
"This year, it couldn't be a more different picture," she said. "There's constant patrol of police, firefighters and city workers, the mayor's been by and not just for the pony show.
"The sandbagging and dike building was smooth and constant, everyone had a job to do, citizens organized volunteer groups on Facebook, the city built these massive dikes days before the flood ... my kids helped out after school. It was impressive."
Men look out at the Rivière des Prairies beside a house surrounded by water in the Ste-Dorothée area of Laval on Tuesday.
Meanwhile outside of Quebec City, the Beauce remains the province's most affected area by far, with the Chaudière River overflowing its banks and forcing the removal of 867 people, damaging 1,863 homes and leaving 80 others isolated.
In northwestern Laval, the Canadian Armed Forces and blue-collar workers continued to reinforce dikes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighters helped pump water from yards and basements in Laval West and Fabreville.
About 42 homes have seen their basements flooded, according to Const. Évelyne Boudreau of the Laval police. The presence of soldiers on the ground has freed up local firefighters and police to answer emergency calls from about 100 homeowners across the island.
"We're doing our best to work with the elderly and more vulnerable people," Boudreau said. "Meanwhile, we're repatriating a bunch of municipal employees to take phone calls from and advise citizens. It's all hands on deck."
Boudreau said the city closed the bridge linking Île-Bigras to Laval's main island on Tuesday and boat traffic between Laval and its northern neighbours was suspended to alleviate pressure on the dikes.
Back on the shores of Lake of Two Mountains, Steve Mason says the water has largely stabilized since Easter Sunday. Two years ago, it was not water directly from the lake that nearly washed away his home, but rather a breach in the city's dike.
"The dike was on higher ground, so when it went, it took about half an hour and there was four feet of water at our door," said Mason, who also lives in Deux-Montagnes. "That really put a panic into things. But this year, the city contained it and life is a lot easier."
This year, the city started work on its dike on April 16 and continued into Easter weekend. But in the end, Mason said he mostly counted on family, friends and neighbours to keep his home dry.
"We had an army helping us out for God's sake," Mason said. "We ordered something like 25 tonnes of sand and had a lot of good people helping us shovel it, tie it, bag it and stack it. It'll continue to rise but we're ready for it."
