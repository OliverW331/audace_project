Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left more than 800,000 clients in the dark Friday.
Wind gusts snapped many branches and trees, which in turn severed power lines. Many wood electrical poles were also damaged.
The hardest hit areas: the Montérégie, Montreal and the Laurentians.
The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
With blackouts set to last days, some local governments set up warming centres. Quebec City welcomed residents on Friday evening, while in Montreal, the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough said four buildings would be open on Saturday for those still without power.
It's the biggest service interruption since the January 1998 Ice Storm, when up to 1.4 million customers were without power in the dead of winter and it took weeks to reestablish electricity to all.
At the height of Friday's storm, close to 1 million customers were affected by outages.
Hydro said it had more than 1,000 employees on the ground and was also hiring private companies and asking neighbouring jurisdictions for help.
But the damage was so widespread it will take time to deal with the downed power lines that have caused 2,000 power failures across the province, Éric Filion, president of Hydro's distribution division, told a hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon.
"That's more than 2,000 places that our teams have to visit to make repairs," he said. "We have a lot of work to do."

Winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour swept through many parts of Quebec on Friday, a day after heavy rains drenched much of the province.
Filion did not yet know which areas of Quebec would get their power back first, in part because the storm was expected to continue in some parts of the province until Saturday. The storm was moving east and more customers were expected to go dark, Filion said.
Hydro-Québec dismissed comparisons to the 1998 Ice Storm.
"The big difference is that in 1998, the transmission lines collapsed and they had to rebuild the network, the grid," Filion said.
"The good news (in the latest storm) is that our steel transmission towers were not affected... This time, we're now talking about wood poles behind houses and although (many were damaged), the speed of repairing those is much quicker."
In advance of the heavy rain forecast for Thursday, Halloween, some municipalities, including Montreal, had urged parents to take their kids trick or treating a day later.
But in many parts of the province, Friday was worse because of gusty winds, colder temperatures and power failures; Hydro urged parents to exercise caution when taking children out, as streets in many neighbourhoods were pitch black. In some parts of Montreal, children in costumes did, indeed, go out on Nov. 1 to collect candy.
As of 8 p.m., 781,029 customers were without power across Quebec, including 170,658 in the Montérégie, 99,889 Laurentians and 57,423 in Montreal. Hydro was unable to say how many of those affected were residential customers.

The heavy rain led to flooding in some parts of Quebec on Friday.
In the Eastern Townships, homes were evacuated in Sherbrooke and Cowansville. In the Beauce, many roads were closed because of water overflow from adjacent rivers, and some evacuations were ordered because of flooding and a landslide.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault reassured Quebecers all steps were being taken to deal with the storm and its after-effects.
She indicated the government expects the intensity of the wind to drop overnight and flooding to start receding in most regions of Quebec, except the Eastern Townships.
"This is a big meteorological event hitting Quebec full-bore," Guilbault said. "I ask people to be extremely prudent. If you can stay home, avoid leaving your home, avoid going on the roads. Let this storm pass. By tomorrow, everything should be stabilized in most regions in Quebec. Avoid unnecessary risks.
"I want to reassure everyone things are under control. All our public security and civil security teams are deployed and in contact with municipalities affected."

In a tweet, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa is ready to provide any support or help Quebec may need.
Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the wind storms - please listen to your local officials and stay safe. We're monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide any support or help the provinces may need.

Earlier in the day, the strong winds flipped over trucks, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways. A fallen tree caused delays on the Deux-Montagnes commuter train line.
Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights.
They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents to call insurance companies, not 911, to report wind damage to their homes. And motorists were reminded when traffic lights are out, they must come to a complete stop before proceeding.
City crews had to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. Some West Island motorists and residents posted videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
Urgences-santé received 122 calls between 11 a.m. and noon, a period when it normally only gets half that number.
The high winds resulted in some unusual calls, said Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoît Garneau, including extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been blown out of his second-floor work area.
The storm and power failures had an effect on the political agenda. Guilbault announced the Coalition Avenir Québec general council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Quebec City has been cancelled so delegates can avoid travel and MNAs can stay in their ridings to help citizens.
