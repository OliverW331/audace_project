Another demonstration, Grand rassemblement tous unis pour un Québec inclusif, organized by the Canadian Muslim Alliance( https://www.facebook.com/events/1788271464606537/ ), was planned for 2-4 p.m. at Place Émilie-Gamelin, where a protest was held the Sunday before( https://montrealgazette.com/news/demonstration-today-to-protest-bill-21-at-place-emilie-gamelin ).
The bill before the Quebec National Assembly would prohibit authority figures like teachers, police officers, prison guards, prosecutors and judges from wearing religious symbols like the Muslim hijab, Jewish kippah or Sikh turban at work.
At its monthly meeting, which starts Monday, Montreal city council will vote on a bipartisan declaration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/religious-symbols-montreal-to-rebuff-bill-21-in-bipartisan-declaration ) opposing Bill 21. "No one should live in fear or uncertainty about their job or place in Montreal society because they choose to practice their religion," it says.
While Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante says she would not defy the law if passed( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bill-21 ), suburbs like Côte-St-Luc, Hampstead and Montreal West have vowed not to enforce Bill 21's restrictions.
On Thursday, Plante joined a chorus condemning remarks by Hampstead Mayor William Steinberg, who compared Bill 21 with ethnic cleansing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/citing-media-storm-hampstead-cancels-special-meeting-on-bill-21 ).

Politicians from Premier François Legault to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have roundly condemned Steinberg's comments, made April 5 at a press conference to announce Sunday's rally in Côte-St-Luc.
Plante demanded that Steinberg apologize( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/apologize-withdraw-from-secularism-debate-plante-tells-hampstead-mayor ). She has also called on him to scrap his decision to convene a special meeting of the Hampstead council Monday to adopt a resolution saying the town will not apply the legislation.
In a statement Thursday, Steinberg said he understood his words were "painful to some and it was not my intention to upset anyone, only to have people see the effects of an odious bill."
"Sometimes strong words are necessary to open people's eyes," he added.
Steinberg has said( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/apologize-withdraw-from-secularism-debate-plante-tells-hampstead-mayor ) he would not participate in Sunday's rally because he does not want to be a distraction.
The protest is set for 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. in front 5801 Cavendish Blvd. It is one of a number( https://montrealgazette.com/news/demonstration-today-to-protest-bill-21-at-place-emilie-gamelin ) that have been held in reaction( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/we-wont-be-silent-in-fight-against-bill-21-westmount-high-teachers-say ) to Quebec's Bill 21.
