This Sunday's Montreal marathon has been cancelled by organizers because of the heat.
The forecast for the day calls for a high of 30 C, with a humidex factor of 39 C.
The Rock 'n'Roll Oasis Montreal marathon was to start at 8:30 a.m. from the Jacques Cartier Bridge.
On their website, organizers said that "in consultation with medical services officials and our city partners, event organizers have determined that the unseasonably warm weather conditions are not suitable to provide a safe race experience for the 42.2-km distance. The full marathon will therefore not take place."
The half-marathon or 21.1 km will go on, but will start at 7:30 a.m. instead of 8:30, and runners will have three hours to complete the event rather than the six originally planned.
The 10K event will begin as scheduled at 8:45 a.m.
Anyone who is registered for the marathon can choose to participate in the half-marathon, organizers said.
They can also defer their entry fee "to any open Rock 'n'Roll Marathon Series, including Montreal 2018, or receive a full refund."
Half-marathoners can opt to not race, and either defer their fee or receive a refund.
To help runners combat the heat, organizers say they will have cooling buses along the course, as well as iced towels and water and ice at the finish line.
