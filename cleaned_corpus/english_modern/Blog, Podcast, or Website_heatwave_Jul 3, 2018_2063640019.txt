More than 36,000 clients of Hydro-Québec were waking up Tuesday morning without power - and air conditioning - as a record-breaking heat wave continued to crush parts of the province.
As of 7 a.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting that 36,640 customers didn't have electricity - 6,495 of them in the Outaouais( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/outaouais.html#bis ) region, 14,209 in the Lanaudière( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/lanaudiere.html#bis ) and 8,815 in the the Laurentians.
The outages were caused by a chain of severe thunderstorms that swept through Monday evening, Hydro-Québec said.
By contrast, only 80 customers lost power in Montreal, which was narrowly missed by the storms but was put under a severe thunderstorm warning( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/severe-thunderstorm-warning-issued-for-montreal-and-surrounding-areas ) Monday evening.
Hydro-Québec said that it was too early to say when power would be restored to all its customers.
The outages continue on a day when temperatures are expected to climb as high as 32 C with a humidex of 37.
