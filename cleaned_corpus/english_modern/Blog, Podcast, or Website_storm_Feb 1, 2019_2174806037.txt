Premier François Legault has clarified his remarks on Islamophobia( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-francois-legault-rules-out-anti-islamophobia-day-in-quebec ), conceding it exists in Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments ) but stressing it is not commonplace.
In a statement issued by his office Friday in the wake of the storm of controversy sparked by his remarks Thursday, Legault clarified.
"Mr. Legault wanted to say there is no current of Islamophobia in Quebec," the statement said. "Islamophobia exists in Quebec, xenophobia, racism and hatred but not a current of Islamophobia. Quebec is not Islamphobic or racist."
Reached later, Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Legault, further clarified.
"Unfortunately, there are still too many racist acts that occur in our society and we have to do all that is possible to denounce and fight hatred and intolerance," said Sauves.
"However, there is no trend or culture of Islamophobia in Quebec. Quebecers are open and tolerant and they shall continue to exhibit these qualities.
Legault's statement follows a chorus of complaints.
Earlier, the province's Liberals and the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) called on Legault to retract the comment, which he made the comment after a caucus meeting of Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs in Gatineau. He had been explaining why he felt there was no reason to designate Jan. 29 - the date six Muslim men were murdered( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-mosque-shooting ) in a mass shooting in Quebec City in 2017 - as anti-Islamophobia Day in Quebec.
NCCM executive director Ihsaan Gardee said in a statement that the comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.
In a tweet posted on the same day as the Liberals entered the second day of a pre-session caucus, interim leader Pierre Arcand said Islamophobia exists in Quebec as it does elsewhere and Legault should reverse his statement.
L'islamophobie existe au Québec comme ailleurs. @francoislegault( https://twitter.com/francoislegault?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) a été catégorique en affirmant que ce phénomène n'existait pas. Je l'invite à se rétracter.#PolQc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolQc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #PLQ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLQ?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

And arriving for the caucus meeting, Liberal MNA Gaétan Barrette, the former health minister who now acts as the opposition's treasury board critic, waded into the debate as well.
"To say there is nobody who is Islamophobic here ... it exists as it does elsewhere( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments )," Barrette told reporters. "I am not saying it's systemic. I am not saying society is Islamophobic, but there are people, without a doubt, who are.
"To make such a categoric statement seems to me short-sighted, but coming from Mr. Legault it it not surprising."
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Friday that there are Islamophobic acts in Quebec.
"We can't deny this. We can't forget that two years ago, some men were killed in cold blood when they were praying in a mosque. This is the reality," she said. "Is this what defines the Quebec people? No, but there are Islamophobic acts, and we have to be able to call it out, and act, and to raise awareness. This is for sure."
Plante said she recognizes that for some people, creating a day against Islamophobia is the way to tackle the problem. She said she is looking at what other actions could also be taken.
"Raising awareness is very important," she said. "How can we make sure that in the public discourse, we don't allow Islamophobic words and actions to be taken? To me, that's the first thing that needs to be done. It's not acceptable to say things specifically that are Islamophobic."
NCCM's Gardee wrote that in his opinion, Legault is clearly disconnected from the reality of Islamophobia on the ground in Quebec. The NCCM said Legault's original statement pandered to populist and reactionary sentiment to the detriment of Muslims.
Statistics Canada reported in November that the number of hate motivated crimes reported to police increased sharply in Canada in 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/hate-crimes-targeting-blacks-jews-muslims-on-rise-statcan-says/wcm/9ccbab60-a97a-4e85-aa2c-6c33793f239b ), with incidents targeting black people, Jews and Muslims accounting for most of the events.
Toronto Mayor John Tory, meanwhile, has designated Jan. 29 as a day of action against Islamophobia in his city.
