After a weekend that saw the city endure rain, freezing rain and snow, the City of Montreal will begin snow removal operations at 7 p.m. Monday.
Jean-Fran√ßois Parenteau, the city executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, announced the operation on his Twitter account Monday morning.
He said 11 centimetres of sleet and ice had fallen since Saturday night. "Even if the accumulation on the ground seems small, it is already very compacted, likely to freeze and not melt. So this is a preventive measure.
"Since this heavy snow won't melt there is no advantage to wait for further precipitation. ... So it will be picked up and we'll preserve access to our sewer drains."
