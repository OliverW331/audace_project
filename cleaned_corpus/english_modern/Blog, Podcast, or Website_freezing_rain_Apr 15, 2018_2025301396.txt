Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for the Montreal area.
A "significant event" of freezing rain is expected to begin Sunday afternoon, starting as ice pellets and then turning into freezing rain later in the evening.
Between 10 and 20 millimetres of precipitation is predicted to fall during this period, with several hours of freezing rain expected.
The warning is for the island of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Varennes, La Prairie and Ch√¢teauguay areas.
The agency warns the freezing rain will make for a difficult commute Monday morning, causing roads and walkways to "become icy, slippery and hazardous."
Power outages and falling tree branches may also occur due to the weather.
