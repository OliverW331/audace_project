INDOORS:
Bobby McFerrin with David Worm, Joey Blake and the Jireh Gospel Choir( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/En/Programmation/Concert/9494 ) (7 p.m., Maison symphonique de Montr√©al, $65.60 to $91.10)
There are worse ways to close out the 39th Montreal International Jazz Festival than in the presence of one of the world's greatest a cappella singers in our city's most sonically pristine concert hall. McFerrin revisits his 1998 improv album, Circlesongs, for which he engaged in lyric-less jams with 12 other singers. Prepare to be transported.
OUTDOORS:
The War On Drugs( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/en/Programmation/Concert/9670 ) (9:30 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne-Mance St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free)
Fresh off winning this year's Grammy for best rock album, Philadelphia's atmospheric rock band The War On Drugs headlines the jazz fest's closing free outdoor blowout. With the oppressive heat wave behind us, it's a night to let your mind wander to Adam Granduciel's expansive sounds, offset by a warm breeze and cold beer.
R.L. Boyce( https://www.montrealjazzfest.com/en/Programmation/Concert/9662 ) (9 and 11 p.m., Hyundai/CBC/Radio-Canada Stage, corner de Montigny and Clark Sts., free)
This veteran Mississippi bluesman was profiled in Montrealer Daniel Cross's wonderful 2016 documentary I Am the Blues. His latest album is called Roll and Tumble, and like the man behind it, it's the real deal.
