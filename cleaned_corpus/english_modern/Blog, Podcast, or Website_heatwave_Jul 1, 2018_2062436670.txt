The Bell Sports Complex in Brossard wasn't a bad place to be Saturday morning for fans who showed up to watch the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
With the temperature already at 27C and rising by noon - and late-afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast during Montreal's first heat wave of the summer - the Canadiens' air-conditioned practice facility was nice and cool.
Of course, it wasn't so cool for the players who were sweating it out on the ice during morning practice sessions and off-ice workouts before a 4 p.m. scrimmage that ended in a 1-1 tie with defenceman T.J. Melancon scoring for the Red team and centre Ryan Hughes scoring for the White.
Ryan Poehling( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=191764 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at the 2017 NHL Draft (25th overall), was still sweating when he met with the media on the facility's indoor soccer field after the morning practice ended.
"In Minnesota, it gets pretty hot," Poehling said about his home city of Lakeville, Minn. "But this soccer field in general is super hot."
Poehling, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound centre, added that the ice conditions on the rink were fine.
"That's the beauty about hockey, it doesn't change much," he said while wiping sweat off his forehead. "The ice is always going to be the same indoors, so that's nice."

Jesperi Kotkaniemi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=207533 ), the Canadiens' first-round pick at this year's NHL Draft (third overall), said it was "weird" playing hockey when it was so hot outside.
"It's so hot all the time when you're on the ice," the 6-foot-2, 182-pound centre said.
Summer hockey is something new to Kotkaniemi, who never played it as a young boy growing up in Finland. Instead, the 17-year-old played soccer during the summer as a striker. Kotkaniemi gave up soccer when he was 12 to focus on hockey.
Poehling did play summer hockey in Minnesota, but said it was only for fun on Triple-A teams he put together with his buddies. He grew up near a three-on-three rink called Total Hockey and would also play there.
"I used to play in leagues two or three times a week where I played three-on-three and then also there would be tournaments where you could play five or six games in one day," he recalled. "It's pretty fun.

"Nothing too crazy," Poehling added about the competition level of his summer hockey. "That's what I liked and enjoyed about being young guys. It's not about getting better when you're that young. It will just come and you realize that. It's about the relationships you create and I think that was the biggest part for myself. I created so many relationships when I was playing Triple-A that still stand today. It was for fun ... as it should be. I love it (three-on-three). It's fun. The rink's a little shorter, so it's not as much skating. It's more handling (the puck) and getting guys open. But I do enjoy three-on-three."
After this evaluation camp, Poehling is planning to take a break and visit his family's cabin for the July 4 Independence Day holiday in the U.S. After that, he will head to the U.S. 2018 World Junior Summer Showcase from July 28-Aug. 4 in Kamloops, B.C., in preparation for next season's world junior championship. Poehling will be returning to St. Cloud State University next season for his third year after posting 14-17-31 totals in 36 games last season.
To retain his NCAA eligibility, Poehling has to pay his own way to attend the Canadiens' evaluation camp.
"Right now, I'm not a professional," the 19-year-old said. "It's not my job yet. As much as I would like to make it that way, I can't. I have a bunch of schooling to do. I'm still young and I got schooling to do, I have friends to hang out with. There's just so much that goes into the summer. Obviously, I do a lot of working out, five days a week, and then I also stick-handle a lot off the ice. But actually on the ice, I don't do that much (during the summer)."

Neither does Kotkaniemi, who said he hadn't been on skates for three weeks before the evaluation camp started on Thursday.
"It was so tough. It was terrible to me," he said with a laugh about getting back on the ice. "It's getting better. Today was a better day."
Kotkaniemi, who will turn 18 on July 6, will return home to Finland after the evaluation camp wraps up with a 9:30 a.m. scrimmage on Sunday and will enjoy a two-week break before he starts practising with his Finnish Elite League teammates with the Assat Pori team. Playing in the professional league last season as a 17-year-old against men, Kotkaniemi posted 10-19-29 totals in 57 games. His father coaches the team.
Poehling said one of the most important things at this Canadiens evaluation camp is to stay hydrated.
"We don't skate much in the offseason," he said. "All of sudden, you get thrown into camp and you've got two skates a day and one workout. So the fluids are key, especially at night. You just got to drink them and stay hydrated."
