Re: "Plante administration takes heat over icy sidewalks" (Montreal Gazette, Jan. 30) I tip my hat to Anjou borough Mayor Luis Miranda for proceeding with snow-clearing and de-icing operations against city directives after the recent storm that turned the city into a death trap.
Miranda put people's safety first, while my borough mayor (Valérie Plante) and her lieutenant (François Paranteau) seemed content to cross their fingers and hope for the best, leaving the weather forecasters'prognostications to determine Montrealers' fate.
I've been watching plows on my street struggling to break down ice mountains - a time-consuming process that will cost a great deal more than it would have had the city not waited.
Plante needs to reconsider her priorities. How dare she raise taxes when we can't even count on her to deliver basic services.
People should be outraged, as indeed, by all accounts, they are.
