We all have some intuitive sense of what constitutes a heat wave.
It's like the meteorological version of Potter Stewart's "I know it when I see it" approach to jurisprudence.

So you're not wrong to think that a heat wave is when the city feels like an oven. It's just that there's some more math involved.
