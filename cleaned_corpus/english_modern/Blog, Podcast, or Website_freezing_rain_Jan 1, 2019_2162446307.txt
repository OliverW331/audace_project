A man has died after being found unconscious on an iced-over section of 26th Ave. in Lachine Tuesday morning.
At approximately 4 a.m., Montreal police and Urgences Sant√© responding to a 911 call found a 35-year-old man lying near a parked car on Provost Ave. He appeared to be suffering from cardiac arrest and was treated on the scene and transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Provost was closed between 25th and 32nd Aves. while police continue their investigation, but no criminal involvement is so far suspected. Police said the probable cause is an accidental fall on ice that blanketed the city during overnight freezing rain.
A freezing rain warning had been issued midday Monday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-warning-issued-for-montreal-area ) by Environment Canada. While the warning is no longer posted, road and sidewalks still had sections of ice as of 7 a.m. Tuesday.
