Despite inclement weather spanning Friday's daylong downpour( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-ice-pellets-and-snow-oh-my ), Saturday's dump of up to 30 centimetres of snow and Sunday's expected cold snap( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), not all Montrealers are hunkering down for a quiet weekend.
If you're going out on foot, in defiance of Urgences Santé's warning to stay in( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), or if you're hitting the highway, despite the Sûreté du Québec's advisory about perilous visibility and driving conditions( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), we've rounded up these safety tips, checklists and videos. Be safe!
City driving? How to avoid sliding, sliding ... bang!( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang )
Highway driving? Written after the February 2017 storm that saw drivers stuck for hours on Highway 13( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ), here is a checklist to get you prepared in case you get stranded in your vehicle( http://www.kaltura.com/tiny/q4vhn ) in cold weather.

Shoveling? Tap here( http://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ) so the ice you use tonight can go in your cocktail, not on your aching back.
Car buried in snow? On Saturday, the Montreal Children's Hospital issued a safety tip concerning carbon monoxide poisoning and idling cars. "In the past, the Montreal Children's Hospital has seen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning in children after snowfalls and we want to prevent it from happening again. A child should never be left alone in an idling car. Remove the snow from your car prior to starting the engine and ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked. After a large snowfall the exhaust pipe can become blocked by snow, and idling can produce carbon monoxide poisoning inside the car leading to death. Never leave your car running inside the garage even if the garage door is open."
Winter runner? Fitness columnist Jill Barker offers 5 weather-tested survival tips( http://montrealgazette.com/health/diet-fitness/fitness-five-weather-tested-survival-tips-for-winter-runners ).
And how about plain old safe winter walking? This first video has some walking tips from, yes, Vancouver, put together when they got hit by a storm just before last Christmas. (Walk like a penguin! For real!) And if that strikes you as the skittish advice of winter-weather dilettantes, check out the Montreal Gazette video response below it.
