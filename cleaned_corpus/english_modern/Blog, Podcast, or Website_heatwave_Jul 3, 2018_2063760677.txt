Montreal Mayor Val√©rie Plante announced Tuesday that police and firefighters will go door to door to visit vulnerable residents during the heat wave.
Certain areas of the city with high populations of seniors and low-income residents will be targeted, she said.
People suffering from mental illness and chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and respiratory illnesses are also particularly vulnerable to the effects of extremely hot weather.
"Our teams are on the ground and are following the situation closely to adapt their actions according to the needs of the public," said Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance, who is the coordinator of civil security for the Montreal agglomeration.
Environment Canada says the hot, humid weather that began over the weekend will last in southern Quebec until at least Thursday. A heat warning is still in effect for most of southern Quebec, Ontario, and parts of the Maritimes.
On Monday, the temperature reached 35.2 degrees Celsius in Montreal, with a humidex of 45. By noon Tuesday, it was 30 degrees with a humidex of 38, according to Environment Canada.
Humidex values in the Montreal area could go as high as 40 degrees Celsius Tuesday and may go over 40 C on Thursday, Environment Canada says.
