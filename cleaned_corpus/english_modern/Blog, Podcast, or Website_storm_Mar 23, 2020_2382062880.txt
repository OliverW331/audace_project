Middle-aged face 'very serious complications'
The elderly are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 but middle-aged Canadians also face "very serious complications" if they contract the disease, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said at a press conference today.
Significant complications affect about 15 per cent of middle-aged people with COVID-19, she said.
Two Montreal police officers infected
Two Montreal police officers have been infected with COVID-19, a police department spokesman has confirmed to the Montreal Gazette. Another 100 Montreal officers have been placed in quarantine.
The Montreal police department has more than 6,000 police officers and civilian employees.
20 deaths in Canada
At a press conference with federal ministers this morning, Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, this afternoon said there are now 1,474 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths.
Canada has tested 102,000 people. A growing number of the infected in Canada had not traveled, Tam said.
"Unrelenting" social distancing is required, she said.
To preserve Canada's food supply, the federal government is setting aside $5 billion to help farmers and agriculture companies get through the crisis, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said.
Asked about rumours of a shortage of meat inspectors, Bibeau confirms that there are problems. She said the government is working with provinces to make sure inspections take place. Retired food inspectors are also being contacted, she said.
'The pandemic is accelerating'
It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000, the World Health Organization said at a briefing this morning.
"More than 300,000 cases of #COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) have now been reported to WHO, from almost every country in the ??.
The pandemic is accelerating.

'Enough is enough - go home and stay home'
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he's frustrated that many Canadians are ignoring social distancing recommendations are putting others at risk.
"Sadly, as we can see there are some people who feel invincible who continue to go out," Trudeau said at his morning briefing.
"Enough is enough - go home and stay home. This is what we all need to be doing and we're going to make sure it happens."
He said people still going out and gathering in groups are putting at risk elderly relatives, friends with pre-existing conditions, front-line health care workers and people who work in grocery stores.
All Canadians need to follow recommendations, he said.
He said governments will ensure this happens, either via education or "by enforcing the rules if that's needed. Nothing that could help is off the table."
He did not clarify what other measures could be taken but said the federal government has tools at its disposal, including those in the Emergencies Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-4.5/page-1.html ) and the Quarantine Act( https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/q-1.1/index.html ).
No province has formally asked for the federal Emergencies Act to be invoked but the issue will be discussed at tonight's meeting with premiers, Trudeau said. Talks with provinces are necessary because under the Act, the federal government would take over some provincial powers.
Trudeau also said:
Canada will spend $192 million on developing and producing vaccines for the novel coronavirus.
He says being prepared to mass-produce a vaccine, no matter who creates it, will be essential for suppressing COVID-19 in Canada.
The Canadian Olympic Committee made the right call in announcing that Canada's athletes will not go to the Tokyo Olympics this year. He said it's difficult for athletes, coaches, staff and fans, but it was a prudent move.
He will speak to premiers tonight about the possibility of closing provincial boundaries.
The federal government will launch ads about the importance of social distancing.
78 new cases in Ontario
Ontario is reporting 78 new COVID-19 cases today, bringing the provincial total to 503, The Canadian Press is reporting. It's the largest increase in a day so far.
The total includes six deaths and eight cases that have fully resolved. At least six of the new cases are hospitalized.
Montreal police field 200 calls
Since the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings was issued Saturday, Montreal police have received about 200 calls from citizens reporting that some people are defying the decree, Commander André Durocher told the Montreal Gazette this morning.
"We are hoping that the fact the media is talking about it will get the message across (that people need to stay home,)" he said.
"We don't want to create (an atmosphere) where you are snitching on your neighbour because two people are walking. We are hoping people will show common sense. We want people to be civilized and not insult each other."

Montreal loosens parking rules
The city of Montreal says it's "modifying its parking regulations for all boroughs, to facilitate travel and ensure the safety of all."
Key points:
The date of entry into force of street-cleaning no-parking rules, originally scheduled for April 1, is postponed to May 1.
Expired resident-parking vignettes are considered valid until further notice.
Motorists still have to pay at parking meters according to posted schedules but city parking enforcing officers are focusing on "offenses that have the greatest impact on public safety."
What is essential travel?
Transat lays off 3,600 employees

The company says the final Air Transat flight prior to the full suspension of its operations is scheduled for April 1.

Vancouver planning stiff fines
From The Canadian Press:
Anyone who ignores Vancouver's state of local emergency declaration could receive a ticket and stiff fine if city council approves a recommendation supporting enhanced powers to enforce it.
Council votes later today on the recommendation that would immediately impose fines of up to $50,000 on businesses violating the declaration.
If approved, bylaw officers would also have the power to hand out $1,000 tickets to anyone not honouring social distancing requirements to stay at least one metre apart.
Vancouver declared a state of local emergency last week and did not include violation penalties in anticipation of compliance.
