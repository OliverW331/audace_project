Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until early next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left about 900,000 clients in the dark Friday.
The utility has more than 1,000 employees on the ground and is also hiring private companies and asking neighbouring jurisdictions for help.
But the damage is so widespread that it will take time to deal with downed power lines that have caused 2,000 power failures across the province, Éric Filion, president of Hydro's distribution division, told a press conference late Friday afternoon.
Starting late Thursday night, powerful winds snapped many trees, which in turn toppled power lines, Filion said. Many wooden electrical poles were also damaged.
He said Hydro doesn't know yet which areas of Quebec will get their power back first, in part because the storm continues in some parts of the province. The storm is moving east and more customers are expected to lose their power in the coming hours, he said.
Filion dismissed comparisons to the 1998 Ice Storm, when up to 1.4 million were without power at one point, with some not getting it back for weeks.
He said the main difference between that storm and the one that hit Montreal this week is that Hydro's steel transmission towers were not affected by the latest windstorm. That will make it easier to restore power, he said.
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault held a news conference to reassure Quebecers that all steps are being taken to deal with the storm and power outages.
She confirmed one death: a man in Bromont, who was hit by a tree. "I want to offer my sympathy to the family of this man," Guilbault told reporters.
She indicated the government expects the intensity of the wind to drop overnight and flooding to start receding in most regions of Quebec, except the Eastern Townships.
"This is a big meteorological event hitting Quebec full bore," Guilbault said. "I ask people to be extremely prudent. If you can stay home, avoid leaving your home, avoid going on the roads. Let this storm pass. By tomorrow, everything should be stabilized in most regions in Quebec. Avoid unnecessary risks.
"I want to reassure everyone things are under control. All our public security and civil security teams are deployed and in contact with municipalities affected."
Earlier in the day, as Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million - a number that could represent as many as three million users.

As of 5 p.m., 897,595 customers were without power across Quebec.
Storm damage is affecting the commute for many Montrealers.
Many traffic lights are out and the Deux-Montagnes train service was down for part of the day. The Exo agency that runs the service said it brought in diesel trains to replace electric ones but was also dealing with debris on the line, delaying some departures.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro earlier in the day tried to manage customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 km/h that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene, we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."

The numbers backed up Hydro's claim( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ).
As of 3 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 280 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 115,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Québec reported that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island, west-end and central Montreal as wind-blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
There are more than 2,000 power failures across the province and workers have to visit each site, Hydro-Québec says. Many trees have cut many power lines and many hydro poles were toppled. But main transmission towers intact. @mtlgazette( https://twitter.com/mtlgazette?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Urgences-santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls, when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.
Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoit Garneau said the high winds had resulted in some unusual calls being answered.
Garneau said those calls included extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been literally blown out of his second-floor work area.
Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so, or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents not to use 911 to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. However, some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours was evident on streets and highways, and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Heavy rain warnings remained in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations were being carried out because of concerns the St. François River would flood), Rimouski, St-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.
The storm and power failures have had an impact on the political agenda: Guilbault announced the Coalition Avenir Québec general council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Quebec City has been cancelled so delegates can avoid travel and MNAs can stay in their ridings to help citizens.
"We want our MNAs to be in the field with citizens, given the situation," Guilbault said.
