The weekend storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ), which is expected to dump up to 30 centimetres of snow on Montreal and surrounding areas, will cause delivery delays of the Montreal Gazette Saturday print edition.
We expect to have deliveries completed sometime Saturday. Thank you for your patience and our apologies for this inconvenience.
