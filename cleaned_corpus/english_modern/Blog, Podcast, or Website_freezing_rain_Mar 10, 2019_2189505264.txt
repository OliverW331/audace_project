The temperature will be a mild 1C on Sunday, but spring is not around the corner. Environment Canada upgraded its warning for the greater Montreal area( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), increasing the snow prediction by 5 cm: Expect to receive between 15 and 20 cm of snow starting in the morning.
Furthermore, strong winds - northeast 30 km/h gusting to 50 turning southeast 30 km/h gusting to 50 late in the afternoon - will make visibility very poor.
That snow could turn into freezing rain in the afternoon and is expected to continue overnight. Further flurries are expected on Monday.
The worst of the storm - the result of a low-pressure system from Colorado - is expected to hit north and east of the city.
Environment Canada has issued the snowfall warning for southern parts of the Mauricie, Lanaudière, Laurentides and Quebec City regions, as well as the northern part of the Centre-du-Québec region.
"Consider modifying non essential travel plans," Environment Canada said in its snowfall warning.
"Remove snow from roofs to avoid the risk of them collapsing under the weight of the heavy snowfall expected."
