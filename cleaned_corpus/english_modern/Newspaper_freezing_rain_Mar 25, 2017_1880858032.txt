A special weather statement issued by Environment Canada warns that a slow-moving system that arrived in the form of flurries Friday could leave the Montreal area with freezing rain by Sunday. The low-pressure system was still over Colorado on Friday, Environment Canada said, so it's hard to pin down exactly what type and how much precipitation will fall. Saturday and Sunday highs are expected about the freezing mark.
