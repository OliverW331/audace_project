After facing criticism for the way it has handled removing snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall says it is ready for the major snowstorm that is expected to blow into the city Tuesday afternoon.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, said Tuesday.
Environment Canada says at least 30 centimetres of snow are expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas could see 40 cm of snow. Strong winds are also expected.
Parenteau asked that people avoid non-essential travel Wednesday and use public transit if possible. Parenteau said snow removal operations are expected to begin on Thursday morning.
He said all available city workers will be on the road. After a storm in January, some snow-removal operations in the Sud-Ouest borough were slowed when some blue-collar workers couldn't go to work because schools had been closed.
But Parenteau said Tuesday that all blue-collar workers are expected to show up for work on Wednesday. There has been enough warning about this storm and they have had time to find alternative arrangements for child care if schools are closed, he said. It would be nice, Parenteau said, to know in advance if school boards are going to close schools, but he said he would not tell them how to manage their affairs.
The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the island's largest school board, said earlier Tuesday that it monitors the weather and road conditions the night before a storm but a final decision on whether schools will close is usually made between 4:15 and 5:15 a.m.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration with previous snow-clearing operations this winter.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are covered with thick layers of ice that will make snow clearing more difficult.
He said after last year's difficult winter the city should have increased its snow clearing budget, but didn't.
Parenteau said the ice that remains on streets and sidewalks should not slow down snow clearing or removal operations.
Transport Quebec is advising drivers to exercise caution on the road.
"Abundant snow and strong winds will greatly affect travel on many of Québec's major highways," the department said Tuesday morning. It urged motorists and heavy-vehicle drivers "to be very cautious and adapt their behaviour to road conditions. In addition, non-essential travel should be delayed or postponed."
Drivers should check road conditions before venturing out. For provincial roadways, use the Quebec511 service, which provides information via a website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ), mobile-phone apps( http://www.quebec511.info/en/quebec511/mobilite.asp ) and by dialling 511 on any phone.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed.
That trend is expected to continue this week. On Friday, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 4 C, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.

Montrealers advised to delay travel
Government officials and the provincial police force urged people to delay travel if possible during the storm.
The Sûreté du Québec said if driving, motorists should "reduce their speed, keep their distance from the vehicle in front of them and ensure that their windows, headlights and signal lights are clear."
The SQ said it would deploy patrol cars at "strategic areas" of the local road network during the storm and advised anyone who has to be on the roads over the next 24 hours to consult the Quebec 511 website( http://www.quebec511.info/en/Default.aspx ) to check the condition of the route to their destination. Quebec public security minister Geneviève Guilbault said 100 additional SQ officers would be deployed to oversee security on the province's roads.
At Trudeau airport, dozens of flights in and out of the city were cancelled or delayed on Tuesday afternoon.
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter rail service advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use to keep up to date with the state of service during the storm, as well as to exercise caution on train platforms that will probably be swept with snow during the storm. The Société de transport de Montréal said people show allow extra time for travel.
