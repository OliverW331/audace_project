Ready or not, a spring storm is coming. You can't hide.
On Saturday, Environment Canada issued freezing rain warnings for Southern Ontario, where power outages are expected.
The storm should hit Quebec on Sunday. It'll continue in a northeast direction across the province through Tuesday.
Meteorologist Steve Boily says temperatures will hover around zero. This stands to change the type of precipitation experienced in the Montreal region.
"Going to work on Monday may be chaotic and the end-of-day commute could be even worse if we've had 24 hours of freezing rain," Boily said. "I don't want to be alarmist, but this is a scenario that can't be ruled out."
Montreal hasn't been hit by a mid-April storm like this since 2007, the Environment Canada meteorologist said.
He advised drivers to wait until the end of the week before having their winter tires removed.
