Two cars swerved off a highway overpass in St-Eustache, north of Montreal, on Saturday night, ending up on a roadway below.
The crash occurred about 7:15 p.m. The two cars were heading east on Highway 640 when they crashed through a guard rail and ended up on 25th Ave. below, said Sûreté du Québec spokesperson Hugues Beaulieu.
The people in the cars suffered minor injuries, he said.
The cause of the crash was not known, Beaulieu said. Heavy rain and freezing rain may have played a role.
