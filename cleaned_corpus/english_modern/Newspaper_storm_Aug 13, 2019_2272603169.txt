Re: "Alouettes will only go as far as a healthy Adams takes them" (Montreal Gazette, Aug. 12) A happy Friday-evening crowd at Molson Stadium was deflated when a storm delay morphed into the cancellation of the CFL game.
Electrical storms are serious matters, but the long delay suddenly became a cancellation, leaving the visiting Saskatchewan squad with an incomplete 17-10 win. The Alouettes had been competitive and, with almost 18 minutes remaining, anything could have happened.
The rules did not allow for it, but even if the stadium had been largely empty, the remainder of the game should have been played.
If the Alouettes miss the playoffs by one point, this call will be infamous.
