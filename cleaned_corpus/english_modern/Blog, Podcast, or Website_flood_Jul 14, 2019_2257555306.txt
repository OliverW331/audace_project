On the afternoon of July 14, 1987, a trio of violent thunderstorms hit the Montreal region. A total of 55 millimetres of rain fell within a five-hour period, as well as some hail. Hydro-Québec declared a state of emergency as more than 300,000 customers across the island lost power. Most of the métro was shut down after tunnels flooded. Countless basements were flooded too, as sewers backed up. One motorist lost his life when his car got stuck in a flooded underpass on Beauharnois St. under Highway 15.
There were no fatalities when the trench-like Décarie Expressway flooded, but the scene was nonetheless dramatic, as shown in this photo by Pierre Obendrauf, which was published the following day in the Montreal Gazette, along with extensive coverage.
"All that could be seen of some cars trapped on the expressway just north of Plamondon Ave. was the roof - just barely," we reported. The water was 3.5 metres deep at its deepest point, near Ferrier St., we said.
Many motorists escaped their cars by squeezing through windows: "They huddled on rooftops and swam to the safety of highway medians, waiting for the flood to subside or rescuers to reach them," we reported. Firefighters spent more than two hours evacuating trapped motorists. More than 200 people in 75 cars were forced to abandon their vehicles, we wrote.
One woman we quoted said she had been terrified and felt like she was in a horror movie. But a firefighter told us that some others were laughing, and that "one fellow even went swimming in the dirty water for the fun of it."
