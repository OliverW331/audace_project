As Quebecers picked up the pieces - and branches - shaken loose by the storm front that bulldozed across Montreal Wednesday, Hydro-Québec reported that almost 6,300 customers remained without power as of 12:30 p.m. Thursday.
Most of those affected live in Montreal (3,354 clients) and the South Shore (2,942 clients) and indicated how much work the power utility had done since 6 a.m., when 15,000 clients were without power in those areas.
On Wednesday afternoon and at the height of the storm activity, a total of 175,000 clients saw their power interrupted as a line of storms thundered eastward across Montreal and Repentigny to Trois-Rivières. The storms were pushed along by wind gusts clocked at up to 93 km/h and tore branches off trees and, in one case, the roof off a residential building in St. Léonard.
A second line of storms tore across the Eastern Townships toward the Beauce region on Wednesday evening.
The heat warning for the Montreal area has been lifted, however, and today's forecast calls for clearing skies, with a high of 22 C and a low this evening of 11 C.
