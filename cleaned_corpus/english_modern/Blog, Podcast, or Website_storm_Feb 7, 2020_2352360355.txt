Montreal-area schools were shuttered and hundreds of plows took to the city's streets Friday as a winter storm warning issued by Environment Canada( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-7cb1 ) entered its second day, forecasting as much as 30 centimetres of snow would fall before the day was out.
As of 2:30 p.m. Friday, nearly 30 centimetres of snow had already fallen over the region since Thursday. Snow is expected to continue through the evening.
Schools across the island of Montreal were closed, as well as some CEGEPs.

Aéroports de Montréal( https://www.admtl.com/fr/vols ) reported that as of 3:30 a.m. Friday about 60 flights bound for elsewhere in Canada and to the tropics had been cancelled, although several planes had been able to take off by 6 a.m. By noon, more than two dozen arrivals had been delayed or cancelled while more than 90 departures were similarly listed.
About a dozen flights were cancelled at Jean-Lesage airport in Quebec City and Macdonald-Cartier airport in Ottawa.

No major accidents were reported on Montreal area roads but Highway 40 was closed temporarily in both directions at Saint-Sulpice near Highway 343 after a multi-vehicle pile-up at about 11:20 a.m. Eastbound Highway 40 in Vaudreuil-Dorion was also shut down after a 53-foot tractor trailer went off the road at Exit 26 for Highway 342. And southbound Highway 13 was reduced to one lane at Samson Blvd. when a tractor trailer went off the road.
There was no immediate word on any injuries.
The incidents pressed home the message from Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec that motorists postpone non-essential travel or adapt their driving to road conditions that on Friday were a combination of slippery city streets and poor visibility caused by snow blown by gusts of up to 60 km/h.
Quebec Transport Minister François Bonnardel took to social media to add his voice to those already counselling caution.
Mise à jour: Plus de 700 incidents nous ont été rapportés depuis ce matin. Dans les prochaines heures, la situation se dégradera encore. Les précipitations se poursuivront et le vent s'intensifiera dans plusieurs régions.
Je le répète, ÉVITEZ tous déplacements non essentiels.

"More than 700 incidents have been reported to us since this morning," the minister tweeted. "The situation will worsen over the next few hours. Precipitation and winds will intensify in many regions. I repeat - AVOID any non-essential travel."

Transport Quebec reported that all Montreal island highways were snow-covered, as were most of those in Laval and on the South Shore and was recommending motorists exercise caution if they were compelled to get behind the wheel. However the combination of weather-related cancellations and poor road conditions seemed to have convinced many drivers to stay home resulting in lighter than usual morning traffic conditions on all major thoroughfares.
Those who opted to use public transport were not spared the storm's inconvenience's however, with several routes having to be detoured around snow covered and icy sections of city streets - and hills.

Highways 20 and 132 were closed between Quebec City and Montmagny because of icy conditions and poor visibility.
Meanwhile, the Orléans Express bus line has cancelled all of its departures because of road conditions.

While it remains to be seen just how much snow will accumulate in the city over the next 24 hours, the city of Montreal announced Friday it will begin snow removal operations "progressively" at 7 a.m. Saturday.
The storm system hovering over Montreal is also expected to produce heavy snowfalls in Charlevoix, Drummondville, Nicolet, Bécancour, the Mauricie region and the Eastern Townships.
VIA Rail service between Montreal and Toronto was completely stopped until further notice but the interruption had nothing to do with the weather. A notice on viarail.ca( https://www.viarail.ca/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr7PGj-m_5wIVysDACh07PAlaEAAYASAAEgL9ivD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds ) said the disruption was caused by an ongoing protest on the tracks Belleville, Ont., and service would not be resumed "until the issue is resolved."
Via Rail train routes were halted due not to the snow storm in Eastern Canada, but to a protest.
The protest is being staged in solidarity with protesters in British Columbia trying to block a pipeline project.
The snow is expected to end by Friday evening and the forecast for Saturday calls for a mix of sun and cloud in the morning followed by clearing skies in the afternoon with a high of minus 13 C.
This story will be updated.
