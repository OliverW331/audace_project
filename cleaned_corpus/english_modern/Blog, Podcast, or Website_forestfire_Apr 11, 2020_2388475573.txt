Good morning and welcome to the Saturday edition of While You Were Sleeping.
Problems at long-term care homes in spotlight as House of Commons returns( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/problems-at-long-term-care-homes-in-spotlight-as-house-of-commons-returns/wcm/dc192f69-e50c-4478-ba9d-1dd96c9a8c68/ ): As the House of Commons returns Saturday in an effort to pass the wage subsidy bill to help beleaguered businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, Canada must also contend with major problems at long-term care homes. A group home for adults with disabilities just north of Toronto, Ont., reports that an outbreak there led most personal support workers to walk off the job Thursday. Meanwhile, regional health authorities in Quebec have taken over two facilities after troubling issues emerged in recent days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to make his televised address to Canadians from parliament on Saturday after doing it outside his home for the past 26 days.
Public health, police find bodies, feces at Dorval seniors' residence, sources say( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ): A privately run seniors' residence in Dorval that is grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19 has been described as a "concentration camp" - with unfed and soiled elderly residents inside - by health professionals who came to those residents' rescue, a Montreal Gazette investigation has found. Although the official COVID-19 death toll at RÃ©sidence Herron stood at two on Thursday, a worker said 27 residents have died in the past two weeks. This is highly unusual, as the facility reports an average of four deaths a month, the worker noted.
Meanwhile, the Canadian m( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/this-is-a-war-military-fight-against-covid-19-will-be-anything-but-easy/wcm/695a0dfc-72ab-4896-9e5c-ff3da456497e )ilitary is also going to war against COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/this-is-a-war-military-fight-against-covid-19-will-be-anything-but-easy/wcm/695a0dfc-72ab-4896-9e5c-ff3da456497e ): When 40 Canadian Rangers swung into action in northern Quebec this week to set up heated tents for COVID-19 screening and conduct other tasks in their local communities due to the pandemic, they formed the most visible military response to the crisis to date. The Rangers were mobilized in response to a request for assistance from provincial authorities, the first to the federal government because of COVID-19. Thousands more troops are standing by in case it isn't the last. But what exactly can the Canadian Armed Forces bring to bear in a fight with a pandemic? And how will commanders decide how to use troops who, once committed, could find themselves infected, or quarantined, and taken out of the fight? Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced last month that the military was mobilizing up to 24,000 troops so it would be able to respond to COVID-19 as well as floods and forest fires that have become commonplace in the spring in recent years. Equipment is being gathered at key military bases and warships have been ordered to wait off each coast.
