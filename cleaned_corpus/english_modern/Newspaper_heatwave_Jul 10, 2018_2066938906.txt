Health authorities say up to 70 people may have died in Quebec as a result of heat-related complications since the beginning of an early July heat wave that saw temperatures climb to more than 40 C with the humidex. Temperatures have since cooled off across the provinc.
Most of the deaths occurred in Montreal, with 34 cases reported to authorities. The city's morgue became so overcrowded during the heat wave that it partnered with a funeral home, where it sent bodies for storage.
Montreal's public-health office says the majority of people who died during the heat wave were older than 60 and suffered from chronic illnesses.
