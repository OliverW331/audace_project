Re: "Court says city must bury last bit of old river" (Montreal Gazette, July 11) The brook at Meadowbrook Golf Course is near and dear to my heart, both physically and emotionally.
The stream has been the tail-off of the storm sewer for at least the past 60 years and so far nobody (that I know of) has suffered at all, least of all the golfers who pass by there, who dip their hands in to retrieve golf balls, who (and I have seen it on one occasion) drive their golf carts into the stream.
It was certainly a happy home for a few duck families this spring and has provided nourishment for foxes and groundhogs all summer.
