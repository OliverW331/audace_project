The snow really has been relentless in Montreal this winter.
Between November and mid-February, 193 centimetres fell.
That's 36 cm more than Montreal normally gets by the end of February, according to an analysis of data collected by Environment Canada at Trudeau Airport.
And Montreal's current tally is only 15 cm short of the 208 cm the city normally gets in an entire snow season (November to April).
The season came in like a lamb, with Montreal receiving 13 cm fewer than normal in November (six, compared with the normal 19).
But in December, 61 cm fell, 12 more than usual.
And in January, 86 cm fell, 37 more than usual.
So far in February, 40 cm has fallen, compared with the 42 cm normally seen in the entire month.
As for rain, there has been less than usual this winter.
The exception was January when 44 millimetres fell - 63 per cent more than the 27 mm that normally falls that month.
Mayor Val√©rie Plante's administration and some boroughs have been criticized in recent weeks for snow-clearing operations deemed inadequate and for failing to properly de-ice sidewalks after freezing rain.
Montreal is in the middle of a reprieve.
The last snowfall occurred on Feb. 10 and there is only a hint of snow in Environment Canada's forecast (a 30-per-cent chance of flurries on Monday).
The city says it's ready for the return of snow.
On Wednesday, it announced that it will rent heavy-duty snowblowers for the next two months to help it deal with overflowing snow dumps.
By next winter, Montreal says some boroughs will have "ice crushers" to better clear sidewalks. ariga@postmedia.com twitter.com/andyriga
