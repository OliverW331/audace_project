Premier François Legault said Sunday it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move away to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes.
Visiting Île-Bigras, the largest of the Laval Islands in the Rivière des Prairies, Legault stopped to chat with homeowner René Rousseau, part of whose house is under water for the second time in three years.
"You have to ask yourself the question, do we think that this will keep happening regularly, because if so, it's not the same decision," he said to Rousseau, who had asked Legault how the government would help him out.
"We'll see what we can do that would be reasonable," Legault told him.
Later, Legault told reporters given the increasing frequency of floods because of climate change, the government would purchase homes in flood zones to avoid having to be on the hook to repair damage caused by repeated floods.

"Now it's twice in three years. So for sure there must be the impact of climate change and we have to adjust our programs," he said.
We have to adjust our programs to rapidly compensate people who have damage and need to do renovations. But at the same time, we have to be lucid, and if it's necessary to force people to move, we will have to do it," he said.
A "For Sale" sign on Rousseau's property peeked up through the water.
Rousseau, who has owned the house for 30 years, said he has dropped his price from $900,000 to just under $700,000, but eventually the house might end up being demolished. "The reason is simple: it's in a flood zone," he said.
Earlier, Laval police chief Pierre Brochet said the city has delivered two pallets of filled sandbags to all of the 950 homes at risk of being flooded. While there was less rain than expected over the weekend, Sunday's bright sun and warm temperatures could melt frozen ground and cause waters to continue to rise, he said.
Brochet said the indications suggest the water might not rise quite as high as in 2017 in Laval and predicted the worst would be past by Wednesday.
Later, Legault visited Île-Bizard with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante.
In the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, mayor Jim Beis appealed on Facebook for volunteers, trucks, trailers and empty bags to fill sand.
"It's not because it's sunny or clear that we're out of trouble here," he said in a video from the grounds of Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School at Anselme Lavigne Ave. and Rene Emard St. In Pierrefonds.
"We have 48 hours or so that we're really in a critical zone, so we're hoping that everybody comes out," Beis said.
In Rigaud, where 24 homes and 146 people in the flood zone near the Ottawa River were evacuated Thursday and 50 homes were isolated by flooding, residents watched nervously, fearing a repeat of 2017, when record flooding forced thousands from their homes.
William Bradley, whose house in Rigaud sits on a street that hugs the river, said Saturday he filled several hundred city-supplied sandbags this week. He's stacked them four high around doors and windows, wrapping the makeshift barriers in polyethylene.

"It's still coming up, coming up," said Bradley, 72.
He said flooding two years ago caused about $100,000 in damage to the ceramics equipment he stores at home for his small business.
As of Sunday morning( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/CruePrintaniere/Pages/Bilan-provincial-des-cons%C3%A9quences.aspx ), rising river levels had resulted in 980 flooded residences (up from 903 Saturday), 377 isolated residences (up from 251) and 1,264 evacuees across the province (up from 317), according to Urgence Québec.
Eight major floods were identified by Urgence Québec on Saturday evening, threatening thousands of Quebecers: the Chaudière River at St-Georges, St-Joseph, Scott and Vallée-Jonction, all in the Beauce region; Lake of Two Mountains at Rigaud and Quesnel Bay; and the Beaurivage River in Lévis in the Chaudière-Appalaches region.

Premier François Legault will visit flooded areas in Île-Bigras south of Laval on Sunday afternoon.
About 200 soldiers started filling sandbags and carrying out evacuations in Quebec's Outaouais and Mauricie regions Saturday night, with an additional 400 troops standing ready to deploy there and in Laval on Sunday, said Brig.-Gen. Jennie Carignan.

The soldiers are "extremely well-trained and prepared" for the flood fight, Carignan said. "They are used to doing it."
Quebec's public safety minister urged residents to stay safe and co-operate with authorities.
"Be careful, be vigilant ... please," Geneviève Guilbault said alongside Carignan at Canadian Forces Base Longue-Pointe in Montreal on Saturday evening.
A vehicle is seen in a gaping hole in the road in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa on Saturday.
Guilbault also offered her condolences to the family of Louise Seguin Lortie, who died early Saturday morning after driving her car into a massive sinkhole caused by flooding in the Outaouais region, according to police.
The accident left the 72-year-old's sedan upside down in a swollen stream after rising river levels swept away part of the road overnight, police said.
Sgt. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines police said a pair of witnesses parked near the washout tried unsuccessfully to warn the driver as she approached.
"That lady, who was driving by herself on that road, fell into a sinkhole basically because of the flooding. There was a culvert that was not there anymore, so the road was cut in half and she was not able to brake and avoid the accident," Fournel told The Canadian Press.
The woman was taken to hospital, but died shortly after, he said.
The accident occurred at about 3:30 a.m. in the Municipality of Pontiac, about 30 kilometres northwest of Ottawa.
Pontiac, which sits along the Ottawa River, is one of at least four municipalities in the Outaouais region to declare states of emergency, along with Gatineau, St-André-Avellin and Val-des-Monts. Trois-Rivières is also under a state of emergency.
"We'll stay as long as we have gas for the generator. We've got a boat - my daughter bought a boat and a motor for us in 2017," he said. "By the way, never buy a boat during a flood season. It gets pricey."
In Deux Montagnes, where flooding damaged hundreds of homes in 2017, city workers scrambled to put the finishing touches on a series of dikes Saturday night. The fruit of their labour is an impressive feat of engineering: a 10-foot cinderblock wall that stretches hundreds of meters along the shoreline.
They've been working at it since Tuesday and will continue reinforcing the structure into Sunday morning.

"We feel ready this year," said Éric Bélisle, who lives on 12th Ave. "In 2017, we lost a lot of houses on this street. There was six feet of water in my basement because the flooding backed up the city's sewers."
In Laval as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
More than 45 millimetres of rain fell on the Montreal area between Thursday and Saturday, according to Environment Canada. Rainfall warnings have been lifted, but water levels were already high and are expected to rise sharply over the weekend with warm temperatures and snowmelt runoff.
The city of Laval, just north of Montreal, said in a statement it had distributed sandbags to 900 homes and knocked on 550 doors to make sure people were safe as more than 1,500 homes and business remained under flood watch.
Quebec City and the Gaspé Peninsula can expect up to 30 millimetres of rainfall this weekend, said Environment Canada meteorologist André Cantin.

"That will help the snow to melt again, and we do not expect the river will be able to go down for at least 48 hours," he said Saturday.
Guilbault has said the province will allow stores - usually closed on Easter Sunday - to remain open this weekend so residents can stock up on supplies.
Some of the worst flooding Saturday appeared to surge through the Beauce region south of Quebec City, where 868 homes were flooded and 94 people evacuated as of 3 p.m., according to an Urgence Québec bulletin.
In Montreal as of noon from Urgence Quebec on Sunday, April 21, 2019.
In Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City, officials have asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance with evacuations ordered by the municipality.
Earlier this week, the Chaudière River burst its banks and flooded a large part of downtown. Officials called it the worst flooding since 1971, with 230 homes and businesses flooded.
In St-Raymond, about 60 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital, 24 seniors in three residences have been moved to higher ground as the Ste-Anne River continues to rise.

A local dam gave way Saturday, said Mayor Daniel Dion, prompting concerns about flooding. "The problem today is that there is a lot of ice. If they clog our channels, the water will have no space to circulate and that's where it overflows," he said.
In the Mauricie region, Canadian Armed Forces are focusing on Trois-Rivières as well as the municipalities of Becancour, Louiseville, Maskinonge and Yamachiche.
