What a difference a few dozen kilometres can make.
While many Montrealers in the city centre were basking in the warm glow of the first true spring weekend of the year, others residing on the edges of bodies of water in Pierrefonds, Île-Bizard, Laval and Rigaud were fighting to save their homes and their way of life from flooding.
It was truly magical downtown for those who had endured nearly six hellish winter months of frigid climes, incessant snow and icy sidewalks. Trees were beginning to bud. Flowers were starting to bloom. Families took to parks for picnicking. And bar/resto terrasses were filled with patrons soaking up the first rites of spring.
Yet it was anything but a blissful long weekend for those who spent it in hip waders trying to barricade their homes from fast-rising waters.
It seems so surreal and downright cruel, especially on a holiday weekend when many families would normally be stuffing their faces around the dinner table, not stuffing sandbags.
The horrendous floods that wreaked havoc on homes in 2017 in these areas were thought to be a once-in-100-years occurrence. Right. Two times in three years should suggest that we are all in it up to our eyeballs - and then some. Can you say climate change? And yet there are those - like the orange-haired denier in the White House - who still believe it's all some liberal hoax. (Maybe if the Potomac River overflows he'll have a change of heart.)
Trump is far from the only unbelieving government leader. But even the believers aren't doing nearly enough.
It's with a certain degree of irony that some of this weather madness took place Monday, on Earth Day( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-flooding-rainfall-is-behind-us-but-thaw-will-be-fed-by-melting-ice ) - when too many locals couldn't see much earth beneath them.
The harsh reality is that there are those who may have to leave their homes for good, because this continual flooding is clearly no coincidence.
François Legault said on Sunday that it might be necessary to force people in flood zones to move( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ), to avoid taxpayers having to constantly pay to repair their homes. This may have seemed somewhat rash and insensitive, but many felt he had a point. After all, there are some who have yet to complete repairs from the 2017 flooding and now must prepare for a second wave.
Legault tried to offer some solace by suggesting the government could purchase homes in flood zones, to avoid having to pony up over and over again to repair damage caused by repeated floods.
Kim Bronstein holds her son, Jake Romano, 2 years old, left to right, Noah Romano, 10, Joe, 12, father Itsik Romano and Teddy, 8, stand in the family's basement in November 2017. Itsik Romano says this time the government is doing a much better job communicating with residents and helping them hold back flood waters.
Pierrefonds resident Itsik Romano knows all too well about the agony of flooding. His house on des Maçons St. was heavily damaged by the overflowing waters of Rivière des Prairies in 2017. He recently completed renovations to the tune of $140,000, of which $60,000 came from the government and the rest from loans and a second mortgage.
Romano didn't have flood insurance in 2017. Now he does.
"When I bought my home in 2007, no one told me anything about being in a flood zone," says Romano, a digital media designer and father of five. "No one knew then. Surveys in the area were done in the 1950s. So even though we are half a kilometre away from the river, we were flooded on our street."
It could have been worse. His next-door neighbour's home was so ravaged that it had to be demolished.
This time, Romano is prepared for the worst. And so is the borough, he feels.
"The city actually started getting ready a year ago, and that's been the difference so far," says Romano, who credits Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough mayor Jim Beis for stepping up. "Communication has been amazing. They've been leaving sandbags at our doors. They've been sending volunteers. And, perhaps most importantly, they've been dealing with infrastructure issues to avoid the river from flowing into our street like the last time."
So far, so good. Romano's street and others in the area are dry. Two years ago, he had no sandbags; now his house is barricaded by them.
"We're not out of danger yet, but we're making sure that all our neighbours are protected this time."
In fact, Romano and his kids spent much of the holiday weekend filling up sandbags for others in their community.
Romano takes issue with Legault's comments about possibly moving residents from flood zones.
"Moving thousands of people around is just a Band-Aid solution which won't solve the problem," he says. "It would be a lot more effective and much cheaper to reinvest in the infrastructure. It has worked in countries like the Netherlands, and is working so far for us.
"We're not moving, either. We love this community. Over the last two years, we've been brought together and are now one big family."
