Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Montreal, Laval, Châteauguay, and Longueuil areas just before 5 p.m. Monday. By 6 p.m. the organization ended the warning.
According to their website( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#173820044815079580201807020504wu1070cwul ), meteorologists were tracking a line of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.
This warning comes after Environment Canada issued a severe heat warning for the same areas earlier Monday.
"Lightning kills and injures Canadians every year. Remember, when thunder roars, go indoors!"
