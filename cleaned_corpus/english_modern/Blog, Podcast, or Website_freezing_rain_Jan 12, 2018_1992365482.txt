It seems winter is testing us.
After a respite from bone-chilling temperatures on Thursday, Montrealers were waking up to a very rainy but warm Friday. However, the national forecaster warned conditions will just get worse over the next few days.
If you planned on doing outdoor activities this weekend, it might be more advisable to stock up on hot chocolate and have quiet time at home.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning early Friday, saying "hazardous winter conditions" are expected as the temperatures dip and the rain transitions to frozen precipitation.
The rain will change to freezing rain and ice pellets, making a slippery base for 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected to fall overnight Friday into Saturday.
"Snow will intensify Saturday and will be accompanied by brisk northwest winds giving local blowing snow," the statement said, adding that highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and difficult to navigate due to the ice and snow expected.
Friday's high of 9 Celsius will be reached at 1 p.m., but temperatures will take a steep downturn starting around 4 p.m. It's expected to be minus-10 by Saturday at 7 a.m., and the temperatures will continue to plummet throughout the day on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the minus-20s throughout the day. The high forecast for Sunday is minus-21, and Monday's high is forecast at minus-20. It will warm up slightly for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures around minus-10. A high of minus-3 is forecast for next Friday, Jan. 19.
