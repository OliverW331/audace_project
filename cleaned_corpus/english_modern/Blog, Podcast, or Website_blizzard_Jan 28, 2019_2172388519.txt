Stop us if you've heard this one before: sub-zero temperatures preceding a potentially major dump of snow on the Montreal areas.
A little more than a week after a blizzard dropped about 20 centimetres of snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-hits-the-ground-plowing-as-montreal-faces-a-week-of-wild-weather ) on Montreal, Environment Canada on Monday issued a winter storm watch to a city already shivering from a minus-27 wind chill.
The federal agency noted that "a Colorado low will track over the Great Lakes Tuesday and become a major storm Wednesday. Snowfall amounts could exceed 15 centimetres over these areas by Tuesday evening. In addition, visibility will be reduced to near zero in the blowing snow in the afternoon."
While the advisory is a watch rather than a warning, suggesting a last-minute fluctuation in weather systems could soften the blow, the MétéoMédia weather network in Quebec is also forecasting an accumulation of snow( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ) on Tuesday that will vary from 15 to 20 cm, with the first flakes expected to fall early Tuesday morning.
