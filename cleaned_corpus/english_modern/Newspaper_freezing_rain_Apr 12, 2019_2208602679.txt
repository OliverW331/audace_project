Thanks to the work of more than 500 repair crews deployed north of Montreal by Hydro-Québec since Monday's freezing rain and strong winds, the vast majority of customers had their power back by Thursday.
As of 10 p.m., just over 2,000 clients were without power, mostly in Laval, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions. In Laval, where residents were severely affected by the weather, 380 customers still had no electricity.
At dawn Wednesday, 106,000 customers were affected by power outages. At the height of the situation at the beginning of the week, the blackout affected more than 313,000 subscribers.
Since Monday, many residents in the affected areas tried to warm themselves up by using barbecues and other outdoor heating sources inside their homes, a practice that saw dozens of cases of carbon monoxide intoxication, but no fatalities thus far.
On Wednesday, Hydro-Québec's task was complicated by numerous mini-outages caused by falling branches and other debris, a situation that made it impossible to restore power to large areas with a single, major repair.
However, Wednesday's clear weather allowed repair crews, some of whom came from the United States as reinforcements, to concentrate on hard-hit areas without worries the system would be damaged further by the elements.
Municipalities in the affected zones set up warming stations for residents to eat a meal, take shelter and, in some cases, take a shower until their power was restored.
Environment Canada forecasts that the weather will remain clear for the rest of the week, although temperatures north of Montreal will be cool. Presse Canadienne
