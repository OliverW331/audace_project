After facing criticism for how it has handled the removal of snow and ice from streets and sidewalks so far this winter, Montreal city hall declared itself prepared for the snowstorm that hit the city Tuesday evening and was expected to continue Wednesday.
"It's going to be a major storm and we're ready," Jean-François Parenteau, Montreal's executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, told reporters at city hall.
Environment Canada said at least 30 centimetres of snow were expected in the Montreal area overnight. Some areas were expected to receive 40 centimetres. Strong winds were also in the forecast.
Montreal's major school boards - Lester B. Pearson, English Montreal, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys - took no chances and made an early decision: all announced Tuesday evening their schools would be shut to students and staff on Wednesday.
To speed up snow plowing, Parenteau urged people to avoid non-essential travel and use public transit if possible.
"Because of the quantity of snow that will fall and the speed with which it will fall, despite all the work we're going to do overnight (Tuesday), in the morning there will still be snow on sidewalks and streets," Parenteau said.
Montrealers have suffered through a mishmash of weather in recent weeks, with rain, freezing rain, drizzle and snow falling as temperatures seesawed. That trend is expected to continue. On Friday, the temperature is forecast to shoot up above freezing, with Environment Canada suggesting Montreal may experience periods of rain.
Parenteau blamed temperature fluctuations for the fact that thick ice remains on many streets and sidewalks. But he said that should not slow down plowing or removal operations. He said once the latest snow is removed, the city will go back and continue an ice-removal operation that is expected to continue for weeks.
After a storm in January, some Sud-Ouest borough snow-removal operations were slowed when some blue-collar workers did not go to work because schools were closed. But Parenteau said all blue-collar workers were expected to work Wednesday. They had ample time to find alternative child-care arrangements, he said.
Some Montrealers have complained about( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/snow-clearing-in-n-d-g-goes-from-bad-to-worse-residents-complain )the city's snow-clearing efforts in recent weeks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-raps-boroughs-knuckles-on-snow-removal ).
Lionel Perez, city hall opposition leader with Ensemble Montréal, said he hopes the city has learned a lesson from Montrealers' frustration. He noted it's unusual for the city administration to hold a mid-winter news conference about a snowstorm.
"This demonstrates the level of pressure and scrutiny that they are under and reflects the dissatisfaction on the part of Montrealers on this issue," Perez said.
He said Mayor Valérie Plante's administration failed to clear snow and ice from earlier storms and now many side streets are encrusted, making driving and walking difficult.
"Their decision not to clear the snow at the end of November when there were two moderate snowstorms is the root cause of this problem," he said. That left behind "a base of ice that ... can't be cleared. It's like hitting rock and (snow-loading) operators are not going to risk their machinery to remove that ice."
He said after last year's difficult winter Plante should have increased the city's snow-clearing budget, but didn't.

Quebecers advised to delay travel
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Transport Minister François Bonnardel teamed up to say provincial services at several levels had been put on alert to deal with the storm.
But Guilbault also urged Quebecers to exercise common sense.
"The easiest way to avoid any problems ... is to stay home," Guilbault told reporters. "If you can stay home, just do that. And we encourage every job-giver to be flexible and to maybe encourage their employees to stay home if it is possible, of course."
She said the government itself would show flexibility with its workers.
And she said the government has learned its lessons from past storms, including the incident on Highway 13 in 2017 when hundreds of motorists were trapped.
"With a big storm in the works, I can assure you that every single measure which could be put in place has been. Of course, zero risk doesn't exist, but we have done everything in our power to prevent any catastrophe."
Guilbault noted an emergency co-ordination centre created after the Highway 13 incident will be up and running 24/7, and the Sûreté du Québec( https://twitter.com/sureteduquebec/status/1095471975164715014 ) had called in 100 additional officers to cope with situations all over Quebec.
"Everybody will be working (Tuesday night) for sure," added Bonnardel. "There will be about 1,600 snow trucks on the road. So, as my colleague said, we hope people will stay home or adapt their driving."
Meanwhile, public-transit agencies warned that service could be slower because of the storm. Exo, the provincial agency that oversees Montreal-area commuter trains, advised its clientele to follow the social media accounts( https://exo.quebec/en ) of the rail lines they use. The Société de transport de Montréal said people should allow extra time for travel.
