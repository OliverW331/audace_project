The city, police and organizers of the Montreal Marathon need to better coordinate emergency procedures, a Quebec coroner says in a report on the death of 24-year-old runner Patrick Neely on Sept. 22.
The engineer from Beaconsfield, who suffered from congenital heart disease, died after collapsing during the half-marathon in the International Oasis Rock 'N' Roll Montreal Marathon.
Paramedics arrived at 10:03 a.m., about nine minutes after a first call from a police officer who tended to Neely after he collapsed on the last kilometre from the finish line, coroner Ge?hane Kamel says.
"We believe that the lack of communication in the organization of the marathon had consequences in terms of concerted planning with the city of Montreal by not having on site the necessary personnel for such a large deployment, nor clear instructions as to the deployment of aid to marathon runners," Kamel wrote in the seven-page report.
Neely died of multi-organ failure after suffering cardiac arrest, he found.
To prevent such a situation from happening again, the coroner recommended that:
Marathon organizers ensure that the location of defibrillators be known to all, including police officers.
Urgences-sant√© personnel ensure they know the position of its vehicles and paramedics and guarantees its services.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training be mandatory for all Montreal police officers.
The provincial health department issue instructions that cardiac patients be taken to a hospital centre that offers hemodynamic services rather to the closest hospital.
Montreal ensures, during sporting events, that the medical and organizational infrastructures comply with standards and not authorize the event if these standards are not met.
