Freezing rain and heavy winds are on the way. Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday. In a special weather statement for the Montreal area, the federal weather service said rain will be followed by freezing rain on Saturday evening. "Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant and make surfaces such as highways, streets and sidewalks treacherous. "Strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are also expected on Sunday, and may possibly impact icy structures such as tree limbs and power lines." Environment Canada said there is still "some uncertainty regarding the track of this system, which may affect total rainfall and freezing precipitation amounts."
