Environment Canada on Thursday issued special weather statements and heat warnings for several areas of southwestern and central Quebec as well as southern and eastern Ontario as a heat wave continued to hover over those regions.
In Montreal, meteorologists are predicting a high on Thursday of 34 Celsius, which, when coupled with the humidity factor( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ), will feel like 39 C.

On Wednesday, Quebec Health Minster Danielle McCann said the public health system was ready to face the heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ), with air conditioned common areas established in long-term care centres.
