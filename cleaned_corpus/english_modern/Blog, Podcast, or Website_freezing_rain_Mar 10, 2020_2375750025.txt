OK it won't be skate-to-work slippery in Montreal at least, but there will be a risk of iced, slippery sidewalks and roadways this morning and we're definitely in for a precipitation, especially outside Montreal.
Environment Canada started the day at 4:46 a.m. with freezing-rain and winter-storm warnings. The freezing rain( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) will likely wrap up for Montreal by late morning but could last into the evening in the Sorel-Tracy, Drummondville, Joliette, St-Jérôme, Nicolet, Trois-Rivières, La Tuque, Victoriaville, Québec, Lévis, St-Georges and Montmagny areas. Between 5 and 10 cm of precipitation could fall. In Montreal, rain might continue into the evening, with a high of plus 8. Meanwhile between 15 to 25 cm of snow is forecast in the communities of Bas-St-Laurent and in the Charlevoix region, in Kamouraska, Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, Trois-Pistoles and La Malbaie. Strong winds will accompany the snow in Saguenay and the North Shore, including Tadoussac, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles.
Tonight: Rain ending in the evening, then mainly cloudy. Low minus 4. Wind chill minus 9 overnight
