Dull haze covers city as smoke drifts in from fires
Montreal is covered in a dull haze early this morning because of smoke drifting in from forest fires in Quebec.
There are more than 50 forest fires burning in the province, including eight that remain out of control.
The smoke was not expected to pose a risk to Montreal area residents, but those with breathing problems should take precautions.
Environment Canada says the wind is expected to shift northward away from the city later in the morning.
About 1,200 firefighters, including some from Maine, New Brunswick, New Hampshire and western Canada are working to put them out.
One fire, about 300 kilometres north of Trois-Rivieres, forcd about 1,300 people from a Quebec reserve (Wemotaci) to spend a fifth night away from home.
