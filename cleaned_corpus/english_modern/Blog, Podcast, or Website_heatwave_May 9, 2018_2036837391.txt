By spring standards, it was nothing short of a heat wave.
Montreal terrasses filled with sun-seekers Wednesday as temperatures soared to 27 C at 4 p.m., just short of the record hit in 1979 with 30.7 C.
But the start of the al fresco season elation is expected to damper down for the rest of the week: The balmy weather won't last, Environment Canada says.
The agency is calling for showers on Thursday, a dip in temperatures on Friday with a high of 13 C, then more rain for the weekend.
The average high for this time of the year is 17.5 C.
