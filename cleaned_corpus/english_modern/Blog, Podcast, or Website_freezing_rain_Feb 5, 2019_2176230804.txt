First there was ice, now there's water - and soon it may all be ice again.
Montrealers woke up to a Tuesday morning without any weather warnings from Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ), but a glance outside their windows confirmed that one warning still applies: Be careful out there.
The forecast high for Tuesday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-63Rh ) could reach 6 degrees Celsius, but much of what melts could later be freeze over as temperatures are forecast to drop to minus 10 by midnight and minus 14 in time for the Wednesday morning commute.
While the city of Montreal has said its priority is to spread abrasives to lessen the risk to motorists and pedestrians, the results Tuesday morning were mixed. Major thoroughfares( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) were mostly ice free but still patched with some ice. Sidewalks on side streets - even those downtown - were frosted with a new layer of ice that forced some pedestrians into the street.
Environment Canada's freezing rain warning remains in effect for Québec, Saguenay, and the Charlevoix and Rimouski areas.
Transports Québec reported that by sunrise Tuesday many highways and roads were covered in ice, most notably Highway 20 between Ontario and Montreal, Highway 50 in the Outaouais, Highway 132 in the Montérégie, Highway 125 in Lanaudière, Highway 175 in the Réserve faunique des Laurentides and Highway 40 between Trois-Rivières and Quebec City.
All Commission scolaire des Samares and Commission scolaire des Laurentides( https://www.cslaurentides.qc.ca/ ) schools are closed for the day, as are a number of schools in the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board( https://www.swlauriersb.qc.ca/?page=EMERGENCYCLOSURES_MORE ).
While the Tuesday-Wednesday flash freeze will complicate matters over the next 24 hours, another low pressure system is expected to create another meteorological roller coaster for Thursday-Friday.
The forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) for the coming weekend is sunny but cold, with a forecast high for Saturday of minus 11.
