Snow removal operations across the city of Montreal were all but complete on Sunday evening, following the first major snowfall of the season that dumped about 20 centimetres on the region last Tuesday and Wednesday. Most boroughs were reporting snow removal operations were 100 per cent complete by Sunday evening, except for LaSalle (97 per cent), Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (99 per cent), Plateau Mont Royal (90 per cent) and Saint-Laurent (90 per cent). Light snow and freezing rain are expected in Montreal Monday, with accumulation of perhaps a centimetre of snow by Tuesday. Then Montreal should see temperatures up above zero on Wednesday, and then they will dip again on Thursday and Friday. Forecasters are still cautiously predicting a white Christmas for Montreal, with temperatures staying cold enough to hold onto most of the snowpack. Some were calling for milder temperatures and even rain on Dec. 23, but then things will cool off and there is a possibility of some new snow on Christmas Eve.
