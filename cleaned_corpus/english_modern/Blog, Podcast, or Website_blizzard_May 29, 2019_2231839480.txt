About a third of the way into Florence and the Machine's commanding Bell Centre show Tuesday, Florence Welch stopped spinning long enough to praise her fans: "I feel like you're giving as much as I am." It's no criticism of an enthusiastic audience to say it wasn't even close.
For nearly two hours, Welch gave a gale-force performance that blended possessed fervour and crowd-pleasing glee. For return customers( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/concert-review-florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-beautiful ), her spectacular charisma was nothing new, and yet it always is: Welch's stamina, elation and holy roar have few peers. And with every visit, her constant motion inches closer to the realm of modern dance, straddling the line between refined and visceral, much like the miniature orchestra sharing the stage.
She knows how to build anticipation, taking the room's temperature while the initially muted June escalated to a double-percussion attack as lights blazed through a slatted backdrop. Welch's sudden burst of physicality at the climax had the power of an exorcism and was soothed by a soulful Hunger, the bionic-lunged singer skipping across the stage without a trace of breathlessness.
If Welch had been rooted in place, she would have been riveting for her golden voice alone. Her vibrato sliced through the Bell Centre, but she left ample room for her eight-piece band. The billowing arrangements boasted an exceptionally rare dynamic range, and not just by arena standards. At its most sophisticated - the passionate nostalgia of South London Forever, a tense 100 Years - this was high art filtered through a chamber-pop prism.
And yet Welch remained within reach of her audience. Soon after taking a running leap off the riser in Queen of Peace, she seemed sincerely awestruck by a prolonged ovation. "I'm English ... we're not good with praise," she said endearingly, "unless a sarcastic joke added at the end makes you feel bad. So if you've got any ... 'Yeah, keep twirling!' "

A mighty Dog Days Are Over was especially galvanizing, with Welch pleading for phones to be pocketed and the general-admission floor taking up her invitation to jump for the sky. Later on, she dashed to the back of the floor in Delilah, living up to her words about breaking down divisions between stage and audience as she danced through the crowd on her return.
But she was more than capable of toning down. Dedicated to Patti Smith, Patricia was scaled back from the heart-racing clatter of the version on last year's High as Hope album. No Choir sounded full and warm with little more than voice and harp. The Game of Thrones ballad Jenny of Oldstones was "for Arya Stark," its Celtic shimmer silencing the room.
Cosmic Love was both humble and huge, with Welch thanking longtime fans for "keeping this song safe" for 10 years. She didn't overstate matters: it takes a special artist and devoted audience to shepherd music with such precious fragility into an arena without crushing it.
Big God was a further sign of Welch's delicate touch, the penultimate number anchored by ominous piano as a confetti shower drifted down like gold dust, in contrast to the typical cannoned blizzards. The cleansing Shake It Out that followed brought it all together: the vulnerability, the drama, the singular singer who can stand at the heart of a unified room.
