A freezing rain warning that covers the Montreal and Laval regions was issued by Environment Canada Thursday.
Up to five millimetres of rain and freezing drizzle are forecast for Thursday night beginning in the Lower Laurentians and Montreal. The freezing precipitation is expected to turn to rain showers on Friday, though more dangerous conditions could persist in central Quebec and the Saguenay area.
Environment Canada issues warnings when freezing rain has the potential to create a dangerous buildup of ice, and urges caution for those who must walk or drive.
The forecast high for the Montreal area on Friday is 5 degrees Celsius, and should remain above zero until Sunday.
