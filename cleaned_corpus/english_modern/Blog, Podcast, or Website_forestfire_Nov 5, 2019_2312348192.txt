Rufus Wainwright dresses up as Anna Wintour in his new video. Less than a week after Halloween, the Montreal singer-songwriter poses in drag as the famed Vogue editor-in-chief in the clip for his new song, Trouble In Paradise.
Directed and produced by Montrealer Mia Donovan, the black-and-white shows Wainwright staring into the camera - alternately uncomfortably, laconically, blankly and emotionally - at fairly close range.
He wears a blond bob wig, Wintour's iconic sunglasses and various necklaces. As the song proceeds, Wainwright ends up shirtless, with a hairnet, and later appears with his salt-and-pepper beard, sporting a leather jacket.
The video ends with images of what look like the California forest fires.
Steeped in lush, soulful harmonies and backed by slow, steady, country-tinged beat, it's a classic Wainwright torch song.
The first single off Wainwright's new album, his first proper studio release since 2012's Out of the Game, it talks about how appearances can be deceiving:
"There's always trouble in paradise," he sings. "Don't matter if your drinks are neat or on ice / There's always trouble in paradise / Don't matter if you're good or bad, or mean or awfully nice."
