More than 500,000 Hydro-Québec clients were still without power Saturday morning after a violent windstorm hit the province on Friday.
As of 8:00 a.m., the utility was reporting that 511,156 customers were without power, down from a peak of nearly 1,000,000 on Friday. Montérégie (95,767), the Laurentians (71,914) and Chaudière-Appalaches (68,731) are the hardest-hit regions. 16,137 of Hydro-Québec customers in Montreal were without electricity at that time.
Hydro-Québec says it has more than 1,000 employees, including 800 linemen, working to restore the power. However, some clients in hard-hit areas will not have electricity until early next week.
Nos équipes sont toujours sur le terrain pour rétablir le service. Au plus fort de l'événement, plus de 950 000 clients étaient en #panne( https://twitter.com/hashtag/panne?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Il en reste environ 665 000. Le travail se poursuivra jour et nuit et pourrait prendre plusieurs jours avant le rétablissement complet. pic.twitter.com/DeybjStFc7( https://t.co/DeybjStFc7 )

The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault and Energy Minister Jonatan Julien are scheduled to provide an update on the situation Saturday morning in Quebec City.
