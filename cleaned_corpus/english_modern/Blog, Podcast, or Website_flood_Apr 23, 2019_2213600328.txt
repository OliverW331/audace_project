As expected, the number of those affected by flooding across Quebec continued to increase on Tuesday, but that toll is expected to stabilize over the next 48 hours.
Environment Canada is predicting rain for the swath of the province stricken with flooding - a corridor that stretches from the Outaouais region to the Chaudière-Appalaches area south of Quebec City - but precipitation is expected to be light and scattered.
Public security officials have said over the past few days that the high-water point is expected to be reached Tuesday or Wednesday, after which water levels will either stabilize or start to drop, a process that has already begun in several areas.
As of 9 a.m. Tuesday, 1,418 people across the province had left their homes, while 3,152 residences were flooded and a further 1,869 cut off from their communities by floodwaters or landslides caused by waterlogged soil.
The Beauce remains the most affected area by far, with the Chaudière River overflowing its banks and forcing the removal of 867 people, damaging 1,863 homes and leaving 80 others isolated.
Montreal fire chief Bruno Lachance called on residents of flood-prone areas not to let down their guard.
"What I'm asking the population is to maintain their level of preparation at the highest level, to watch out for the safety of their neighbourhood, to help one another and to show solidarity," he said to reporters during a visit to the fire department's command centre on Mount Royal.
Lachance noted that more rain is expected in the Ottawa River basin.
"That will have a direct impact on water levels in the Montreal region," he said. "It's the weather that will determine whether or not the level will go up."
Lachance said the vast majority of dikes have already been built but some still need to be raised or reinforced, especially on Île Bizard.
He also said authorities have no intention of evacuating Île Mercier, south of Île Bizard, even though the bridge to the island has been closed.
In northwestern Laval, the Canadian Armed Forces and blue-collar workers continued to reinforce dikes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighters helped pump water from yards and basements in Laval West and Fabreville.
About 42 homes have seen their basements flooded, according to Const. Évelyne Boudreau of the Laval police. The presence of soldiers on the ground has freed up local firefighters and police to answer emergency calls from about 100 homeowners across the island.
"We're doing our best to work with the elderly and more vulnerable people," said Boudreau. "Meanwhile, we're repatriating a bunch of municipal employees to take phone calls from and advise citizens. It's all hands on deck."
