The humidex had hit 31 degrees Celsius by late Tuesday morning on its way into the 40s.
Environment Canada renewed its weather warning, calling it an "oppressive heat wave" in its 4:30 a.m. notice. Excluding the humidex, the temperature is expected to hit 35 C and will remain in the 30s until at least the weekend.
Drink plenty, but hold the alcohol, and wear light clothing, Environment Canada advises. Stay in air-conditioned spaces where possible.
The heat warning covers Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and Ch√¢teauguay, but separate warnings were issued for much of southern Quebec and parts of eastern Ontario. Farther north, severe thunderstorms are a possibility.
