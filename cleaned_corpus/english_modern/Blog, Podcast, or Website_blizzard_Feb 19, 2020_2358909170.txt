Twelve people were transported to a hospital and two others remained stuck in their vehicles three hours after a blizzard caused a major pileup on Highway 15 in La Prairie on Wednesday.
The incident occurred around noon, and nearly 200 vehicles were involved in the pileup, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said in a news conference. Highway 15 was closed in both directions at the Matte Blvd. access ramp Wednesday afternoon, and was likely to remain closed well into the night, as emergency crews extricate drivers and clean up the scene. Some diesel was spilled on the highway when a tanker truck was pierced during the crash.
While there were no immediate reports on the number of injuries or vehicles involved, aerial images broadcast from the scene by TVA depicted a massive traffic jam forming behind the accident site. Provincial police said buses had been called in to house the injured and those unable to remain in damaged vehicles.
There were whiteout conditions at the time of the crash, as snow and high winds reduced visibility to zero, Bonnardel said. He added that two snow-clearing operations had been carried out minutes before the crash, as there had been intense snow in the morning.
"The conditions were nice, but the high winds caused the zero-visibility situation," he said.

The aerial footage showed at least two people were being treated by first responders at the accident site, which involved the highway's southbound lanes. It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown on the roadbed by winds from nearby fields and had formed into snowbanks.
The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
Around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau said it was too early to give the state of health of the people involved in the crash, saying they were still doing triage.
Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.
The incident came a day after westbound Highway 10 was closed at Marieville( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/accidents-force-closure-of-highway-10-near-marieville ) for several hours in the wake of a chain-reaction pileup involving dozens of vehicles due to poor road conditions.
