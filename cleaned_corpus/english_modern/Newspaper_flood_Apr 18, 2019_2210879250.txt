By Sunday morning, Victoria Square was a lake. The floodwaters that had inundated Montreal's low-lying neighbourhoods of Pointe St. Charles and Griffintown the day before, surged into the city's core overnight. Firemen at the central fire hall on Craig Street, now St.
Antoine Street, were seen paddling, too - from the station in rowboats. Along McGill Street, boatmen charged 50 cents to ferry people a few hundred feet.
"Men could be seen hanging around unable to reach their homes which they had left on Saturday," the Montreal Gazette reported. The flood-prone city had expected a deluge; dikes were reinforced, water pumps tested. Few, however, were ready when the St. Lawrence began rising behind a wall of ice that dammed the narrows near Longueuil. Pointe St.
Charles was hit hardest, with water as deep as 2.5 metres. "The sidewalks floated around and were used by inhabitants as rafts," the Gazette reported.
Floodwaters began to subside early Monday. By 3 a.m., rafts along Craig Street were stranded, the Gazette reported, and "at the corner of Francis Xavier Street the crossing was dry." A Royal Commission was struck to investigate the flood's causes, leading to the construction of massive flood walls in Cit√© du Havre.
