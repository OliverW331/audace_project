Montreal is getting off with a warning - or more accurately, without a warning - as severe storms sweep across parts of the province, bringing with them the possibility of hail, strong winds and flooding.
Quebec City has been put under storm surge and coastal flooding warnings by three federal agencies: Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Meteorological Service of Canada and Environment Canada.
Strong winds and high tides could cause coastal erosion, the warning says: "People close to the shoreline should stay on the lookout for worsening conditions."
To the west of us, Environment Canada has issued severe thunderstorm watches that stretch from TÃ©miscamingue to Gatineau.
People in those areas can expect hail, strong wind and heavy rain. Alarmingly, "boaters may be surprised by strong gusts on smaller bodies of water," the warning says.
Meanwhile in Montreal, thundershowers could begin any time this afternoon. Rain is in the forecast till Thursday, and Friday and Saturday should be hot and sunny.
