Montreal is partnering with three environmental organizations to achieve its climate goals, Mayor Val√©rie Plante announced Monday.
Flanked by representatives of the David Suzuki Foundation, C40 and the Trottier family foundation, Plante signed a two-year agreement to work together to achieve the goal of making the city carbon neutral by 2050( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/it-looks-like-greenhouse-gas-reduction-targets-are-out-of-quebecs-reach ).
The partnership will make it possible to pool resources, knowledge and know-how, she said.
The foundations will contribute at least $250,00 to the city's efforts to reduce carbon emissions over the next two years, with the possibility of spending up to $400,000, depending on how needs evolve, she said.
"Together, we want to make Montreal a true leader in the struggle against climate change, and bring concrete solutions to achieve change and succeed in the ecological transition," she said.
David Miller, regional director for North America of the C40 Cities Leadership Group, called the partnership unique and said it would help Montreal achieve its 2050 target.
"This partnership I hope will be a model to other cities globally," he said.
Karel Mayrand, director of the David Suzuki Foundation for eastern Canada, said the 90 deaths during last summer's heat wave demonstrated the urgency of acting to limit planetary warming to within 1.5 degrees.
"We're happy to unite behind this leadership to make the metropolis a model for ecological transition and resilience," he said.
