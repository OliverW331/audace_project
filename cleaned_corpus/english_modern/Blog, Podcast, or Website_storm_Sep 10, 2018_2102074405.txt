This is the Montreal Gazette's live blog on the Quebec provincial election for Monday, Sept. 10. It will be updated throughout the day. Email me at ariga@montrealgazette.com( mailto:ariga@montrealgazette.com )
4:35 p.m.: New poll Tuesday
We have in our hot little hands the results of a new Montreal Gazette-Le Devoir- Léger poll, conducted Sept. 7-10.
Philip Authier will have a full story at montrealgazette.com( http://montrealgazette.com ) at midnight - and in the paper on Tuesday morning.
In the meantime, here's apreview by Phil( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-many-quebecers-still-undecided-poll-says ) and one by Stéphane Baillargeon on Le Devoir's site( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/536435/44-des-electeurs-pourraient-changer-d-avis-avec-les-debats-des-chefs ).
3:25 p.m.: PQ sticks with controversial candidate
Jean-François Lisée is still standing by Michelle Blanc( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-anti-semitism-question-continues-to-dog-pqs-lisee ), the Parti Québécois candidate in Mercier riding whose social media past continues to make headlines.
Lisée says she just has a twisted sense of humour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays ) and he had noted that she has apologized( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) for some of her outbursts.
The Parti Québécois leader has previously dumped two candidates( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ) after their hateful comments about Muslims( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-some-candidates-with-baggage-kept-safely-on-board ) were exposed.
So far, posts have surfaced in which Blanc has:
Accused a critic of being a pedophile( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pq-candidate-who-called-critic-a-pedophile-on-twitter-defends-her-social-media-history ).
Suggested she would use the N-word( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-pq-candidate-implies-party-critic-is-a-pedophile ) to describe an African.
Said she was sorry she had forgotten to "celebrate Hitler's birthday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-pqs-lisee-slams-bnai-brith-on-eve-of-high-holidays )."
Said she would be happy if Hasidic Jews "disappeared from my view( https://www.michelleblanc.com/2007/01/15/suis-je-raciste/ )" after a member of the community cut in front of her in line at a flower shop.
Asked voters to "vote white( https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/08/13/michelle-blanc-efface-un-tweet-apres-de-nombreuses-critiques-1 )," before deleting the tweet, which was an apparent play on her name (blanc=white).
If history is a guide, you should stay tuned for more.
In 2014, Blanc was a staunch defender of the PQ's proposed Charter of Values, which would have banned religious symbols in the public sector.
Lisée is sticking with Blanc even though her Internet tantrums have consumed a good part of his campaign over the past two weeks.
And even though election-projection sites suggest the PQ does expect Blanc to actually win in Mercier riding.
Qc125.com is forcasting a win, by a wide margin, by Québec solidaire's Ruba Ghazal, a business-administration expert who moved to Canada from Lebanan at age 10.
Mercier was the riding of Amir Khadir, the former QS co-spokesperson who is not seeking re-election. Khadir won the riding by more than 6,600 votes in 2014( https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/francais/provincial/resultats-electoraux/elections-generales.php?e=74&c=1010&s=1#s ).
1:20 p.m.: Independence, GND, a vox pop, milking NAFTA
All four parties have posted new videos on social media in recent days.
Though it's promising not to hold a referendum, the Parti Québécois is touting independence in some ads.
Surprise - a Coalition Avenir Québec vox pop found voters ready to dump the Liberals and trash the PQ.
Québec solidaire is banking on the popularity of former student leader Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois
The Liberals, meanwhile, are hoping voters will be mooved by its promise to preserve milk quotas for Quebec farmers in NAFTA talks.
12:45 p.m.: Jobless immigrants
Last week, I put into context( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec-election-notebook-putting-french-immigration-stats-in-context ) some of the numbers CAQ Leader François Legault uses when discussing immigrants and the French language.
Here's a look at another number.
On Friday, Legault suggested 15 per cent of new immigrants to Quebec are unemployed( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/quebec-election-legault-softens-opposition-to-new-montreal-metro-line ) during their first five years in Quebec. He used the figure when discussing his plan to cut immigrations by 20 per cent (10,000 fewer per year).
But just as newcomers tend to learn French the longer they stay in Quebec, so do they tend to find jobs.
Here are the Statistics Canada unemployment rates( https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410008301&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.7&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.8&pickMembers%5B2%5D=4.1 ) for 2017 by category:
6.1 per cent: total population.
15.8 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for less than five years.
7.6 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for between five and 10 years.
7.1 per cent: landed immigrants in Quebec for more than 10 years.
11:45 a.m.: Leaders weigh in
On Monday, CAQ Leader François Legault praised the Canadiens' early morning trade( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) of Max Pacioretty to the Vegas Golden Knights.
"Like with Quebec, we need change!" he tweeted before making a bad pun using the name of one of the new Montreal players (Slovakian Tomas Tatar).
Is Legault comparing himself to Marc Bergevin cleaning house at the Bell Centre, or to one of the Canadiens' new players( https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-trade-captain-max-pacioretty-traded-to-las-vegas ) swooping into the city?
And if the trade is a sign that the Habs will spend years rebuilding, does that mean we won't have much to celebrate during the first few years of a CAQ government?
Legault was apparently a big fan of Pacioretty locker-room rival PK Subban.
During the last election campaign, in 2014, Legault wore a Subban jersey( https://journalmetrocom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/franccca7ois-legault-chute-hockey.jpg ) in a friendly game with supporters in Terrebonne. And a year before that, Legault tweeted that( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/391001148368232450 ) Subban was "the best Canadiens player since Patrick Roy."
Bon échange du #CH( https://twitter.com/hashtag/CH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ).
Comme pour le Québec, ça prend du changement!
Mieux vaut Tatar que jamais... https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5( https://t.co/JQ0aJz74Y5 )

Couillard, who apparently is Max Pacioretty in Legault's analogy, was more muted in his response.
He suggested the Canadiens can now look to the future thanks to its two young new players.
Philippe Couillard parle de l'échange de Max Pacioretty. "Faut regarder l'avenir", dit-il, en disant qu'il y a désormais deux jeunes joueurs. #Quebec2018( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Quebec2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Pacioretty( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pacioretty?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Le Devoir's Florent Daudens found that spikes in interest in Pacioretty have surpassed interest in both Legault and Couillard in recent weeks.
