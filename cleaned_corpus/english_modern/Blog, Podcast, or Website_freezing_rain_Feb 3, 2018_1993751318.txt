Catch up on all the big stories that happened this week in Montreal.
Montreal ices plan to heat Ste-Catherine St. sidewalks( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks )
The dream of heated sidewalks for Ste-Catherine St. is over. The administration of Mayor Valérie Plante has decided not to pursue the idea, first proposed by former mayor Denis Coderre, because it has been judged too expensive, potentially prone to costly breakdowns and could delay the first phase of the infrastructure overhaul that has just begun on Montreal's main commercial artery. The cost estimate for heating the entire 3.3 kilometres of sidewalks to be dug up as part of the Ste-Catherine St. and Phillips Square makeover has ballooned to $120 million. For the first phase of the project alone, which involves rebuilding 700 metres of Ste-Catherine and its underground infrastructure from Mansfield to Bleury Sts., the estimated cost has risen to $32 million, when granite slabs are factored in. The initial estimate was closer to $20 million.
MUHC launches Code White team recruitment campaign( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/muhc-launches-code-white-team-recruitment-campaign )
Facing a shortage of hospital personnel willing to respond to Code White violent incidents involving patients and visitors at the McGill University Health Centre, the MUHC launched an internal recruitment campaign on Friday. Historically, orderlies, security guards and nurses have been members of such response teams, but the MUHC is now resorting to recruiting secretaries, housekeeping staff and food preparers as well to subdue highly agitated or violent individuals during emergencies known as Code Whites. Participation in the response teams dwindled after the MUHC in 2016 eliminated Code White premiums - so-called danger pay -under pressure from Health Minister Gaétan Barrette to slash operating costs( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/union-slams-120-million-in-budget-cuts-to-muhc-over-past-five-years ). The recruitment campaign for Code White volunteers comes after the publication of an investigative series in the Montreal Gazette( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-new-safety-concerns-arise-at-montreal-general ) last week that exposed numerous security problems at the Montreal General Hospital (part of the MUHC) following the near-strangulation of a nurse( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hospital-insecurity-anatomy-of-a-nurse-attack-at-montreal-general ) by a patient last September.
Snow piles up at Angrignon Blvd. site on Jan. 17, 2018.
Allison Hanes: Snow crisis? More like snow fiasco( http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-snow-crisis-more-like-snow-fiasco )
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante and Jean-François Parenteau, the executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, are blaming trouble with city snow-clearing operations this winter on extraordinary circumstances. But the events of the last few days seem more like the result of extraordinary incompetence. There has been more snow this winter, Parenteau claimed (incorrectly) on Wednesday. The snow dumps are almost full, he warned. Climate change is resulting in more freezing rain, Plante noted (correctly). We're in the midst of a snow crisis, the mayor insisted. More like a snow fiasco. Montreal has existed for 375 years and counting. We can be reasonably sure it has snowed in each and every one of those years. So at this point, we should be experts when it comes to clearing roads and sidewalks. The only thing different about this winter is the people in charge at city hall. Montreal is not in a snow crisis. But the Plante administration sure is.
Union decries Concordia plan to pick students for task force on sexual misconduct( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/student-union-dismayed-by-concordias-plan-to-tackle-sexual-violence )
The Concordia Student Union lashed out Thursday against the university's planned sexual violence task force, saying it's not properly representing students. At a news conference in the morning, Leyla Sutherland, the CSU's student life co-ordinator, said she is concerned the university is nominating students to the task force when that job should be left to the CSU, which represents students. Concordia launched a Task Force on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence,( https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2018/01/25/message-jan-25.html?c=about/administration-governance ) which will include student, staff, faculty and administration representatives. The university issued a call for potential members on Jan. 25, and the deadline for applications is Feb. 8 at 6 p.m. The school has said it will choose which students sit on the committee and they must be students in good academic standing. The task force was set up in the wake of allegations of lecherous behaviour by some professors in the Creative Writing program. The university also issued new guidelines on professor-student relationships( http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/docs/policies/official-policies/BD-4-guidelines-relationships.pdf ) last week.
"We feel cheated," said St-Michel resident Mario Caluori, who will pay $3,454 in taxes this year. "This is a heavy burden for people on low income who do not have cost-of-living increases built into their revenue."
Montreal tax bills are going out and they may shock some taxpayers( http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal-tax-bills-are-going-out-and-they-may-shock-some-taxpayers )
Montreal sent out tax bills this week, detailing for the first time exactly how taxpayers will be affected by a controversial tax hike Plante imposed in her first budget( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-city-council-poised-to-vote-on-budget-controversial-tax-hike ). This weekend, as taxpayers take a closer look, they might be surprised by what they find. That's because the figures bandied about in news articles, press releases and politician sound bites can be misleading. The average tax hike for residential homeowners is 3.3 per cent, an increase for which Plante has taken heat( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/activist-peter-sergakis-promise-city-hall-protest-during-budget-vote ) because she campaigned on a promise( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/promise-tracker-valerie-plante-and-projet-montreals-pledges-for-first-year-in-office ) to raise taxes by no more than the rate of inflation (about 2 per cent).
