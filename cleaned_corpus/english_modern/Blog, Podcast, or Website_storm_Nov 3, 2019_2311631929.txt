The situation for power outages has greatly improved over the last few hours in Quebec, but 156,165 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power as of 10 a.m. Sunday, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
The vast majority of households should be reconnected by Sunday night, but outages in some areas are expected to continue for some time. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien will give an update Sunday afternoon in Quebec City.
More than 1,200 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, Nova Scotia and Detroit, are hard at work to restore service, said Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre.
Progress might appear to be slower than at the start of the blackout that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), when 990,000 homes and businesses were without power, but that's because the areas where Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, he explained.
"Now we're working on outages that affect a smaller number of customers," Huard-Lefebvre said.
As of 10 a.m., the area with the greatest number of blackouts was the Montérégie region south of Montreal, where 25,480 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. The next-worst was central Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, where 24,341 customers out of 242,633 had no power.
"The storm caused more significant damage in certain regions, like the Montérégie, Centre-du-Québec and Chaudière-Appalaches (Beauce)," said Huard-Lefebvre, noting that complete sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others.
It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole, he said.
"We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
On Saturday, Prime Minister François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
Legault acknowledged that power failures could last longer in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie region, the Beauce, central Quebec, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.
