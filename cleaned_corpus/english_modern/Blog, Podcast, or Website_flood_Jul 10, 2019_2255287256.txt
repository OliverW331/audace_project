When new flood zone maps( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/preliminary-flood-zone-map-is-ridiculous-dorval-mayor-says ) were released by the Quebec government this summer, shock rippled through waterfront communities throughout the province.
Areas apparently now considered to be at risk of flooding included not only those which were flooded in 2017 and 2019, and properties below the zero- to 20-year flood line, but also many properties that were not even within the 100-year flood zone. In Pointe-Claire alone, the mayor said there were 265 properties that had never been affected by flooding that were marked in red on that map.
Not surprisingly, homeowners - and municipal governments - panicked. The new flood zones, supposedly calculated based on aerial photography and satellite images, seemed as arbitrary as if someone's toddler traced the shoreline with mommy's lipstick.
Public consultations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/bureaucrats-booed-by-hostile-crowd-during-flood-map-consultation ) were held last Thursday in 25 locations across the province on the same day and time. Fear fuelled attendance.
At the session for Off-Islanders at the Château Vaudreuil on Thursday, so many upset homeowners turned up that people were turned away. The line of parked cars stretched from the hotel's jam-packed parking lot back to the nearest highway exit, on both sides of the road. Those I spoke with said they didn't know if they even needed to be there, but they feared what might happen if they didn't show up to find out.
The new map matters. Owning a home in a flood zone is no joke. Those coloured by the lipstick-like lines may have to put their dream homes on hold indefinitely. Others may have difficulty finding insurance (or have to pay more for the privilege of coverage). Still more may have trouble selling, or find themselves fielding insultingly low offers as investors circle vulturelike, hoping for a deal. According to the latest statistics from the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers Vaudreuil-Soulanges is the only area in Greater Montreal where sales volume decreased in June, with sales decreasing by 11 per cent following this year's floods.
It's clear that after suffering two "once in a lifetime" floods in the last three years that our flood maps need to be revised. But it has to be done responsibly, and respectfully.
At the meeting, bureaucrats clarified that the red zone on those infamous maps marking the "ZIS" (zone d'intervention spéciale) was intended to identify areas that were affected by flooding in 2017 and/or 2019. Those properties face a moratorium on new development, as well as on reconstruction or renovations greater than 50 per cent the value of the home. Those whose properties are marked in the red zone but were not affected by those floods were asked to email zis2019@mamh.gouv.qc.ca( https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=zis2019@mamh.gouv.qc.ca ) to ask for an exemption. The deadline to submit comments or request corrections to the map is Aug. 19.
As several people pointed out at the public information session in Vaudreuil-Dorion, it will take an army of bureaucrats to process the avalanche of exemption requests that are sure to follow this debacle. Meanwhile, homeowners who were ready to build, renovate or rebuild are in limbo.
They deserve better.
