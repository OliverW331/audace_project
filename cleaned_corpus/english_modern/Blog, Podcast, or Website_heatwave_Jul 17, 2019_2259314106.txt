Environment Canada on Wednesday issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area and other regions of southern Quebec warning of soaring temperatures expected on Friday and continuing into Saturday.
The statement, issued at 4:44 a.m., notes that "a warm and very humid airmass will move into southern Quebec on Friday and remain in place until Saturday. Humidex values( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ) will be high and approach 40, especially in heavily urbanized areas."
Apart from the Montreal area, the statement covers Pontiac, Maniwaki, Saint-Jérôme, Joliette, Saint-Hyacinthe, Drummondville, Sorel-Tracy, Shawinigan, Trois-Rivières and Victoriaville.
By sunrise on Wednesday, the humidex reading in Montreal was already 30 C.
During times of extreme heat the regional public health authority recommends( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-are-6-things-to-avoid-doing-during-a-heat-wave ) that people spend at least two to three hours a day in a cool environment, regularly drink water without waiting to feel thirsty and reduce physical effort.
It also warns that children should never be left in cars or in poorly ventilated areas during heat waves, and that regular checks of friends and relations, particularly those that are elderly, be made and if necessary, that they be accompanied to a cooler area.
