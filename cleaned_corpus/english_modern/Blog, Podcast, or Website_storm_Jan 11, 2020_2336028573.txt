Authorities say they are ready to respond to treacherous road conditions and widespread power outages as the weather is expected to turn ugly Saturday night into Sunday.
Rain is expected to change to freezing rain overnight Saturday, but in some areas outside of Montreal, there were already slippery conditions reported early Saturday. At least 10 cars slid off the road in the Quebec City region Saturday morning, but there were no serious injuries or damage, said Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau.

She warned people to stay home if they don't have to travel when the roads are slippery.
Environment and Climate Change Canada( https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html ) has forecast that rain will be changing to snow( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ), accompanied by freezing rain Saturday night into Sunday. Accumulations in some spots could exceed 25 centimetres of snow, but only about five cms are forecast for the Montreal region. More snow is expected later in the week.
Transport Quebec teams were out Saturday, and the city of Montreal issued a statement saying it is prepared to act to keep the roads safe in the wake of the changing weather conditions, by salting and plowing.
Nos équipes surveillent l'évolution des conditions météo et sécurisent du mieux possible les 10 000 km de rues et de trottoirs.
Malgré les efforts déployés, les conditions météorologiques rendront les déplacements difficiles. La prudence est de mise.

On its website, Hydro-Québec( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) said it had 100 teams ready to intervene as strong winds could knock down hydro poles or cause tree branches to fall on wires. The utility said there could be many outages in the next few hours, with the regions most at risk being Montreal, the Laurentians, the Montérégie and Outaouais.
