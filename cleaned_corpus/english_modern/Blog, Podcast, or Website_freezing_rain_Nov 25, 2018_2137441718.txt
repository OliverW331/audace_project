Freezing rain slickly coated roads and sidewalks across southwestern Quebec overnight, and Environment Canada warns this downpour is due to continue Sunday morning.
The agency's alert( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#200257307386478079201811230504ww1070cwul ) for Montreal and the surrounding areas now forecasts between two and five millimetres of freezing rain.
Hydro-Qu√©bec is listing a few minor power outages( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/#bis ) across its network, but as of 8:30 a.m. none of them are in Montreal.
Temperatures in southern Quebec are expected to climb above the freezing point on Sunday and Monday. As that happens, the freezing rain is expected to give way to simple rain.
