If you thought March would immediately end Montreal's winter misery, Environment Canada has some unfortunate news for you.
In a special weather statement issued Sunday morning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1401059021638113659202003010504ws1070cwul ), the agency warned that the Montreal area should prepare for freezing rain starting Monday afternoon.
The downpour will extend into Monday evening, and Environment Canada says it "could amount for significant freezing rain accumulations".
"There may be a significant impact on the afternoon commute," according to the statement.
