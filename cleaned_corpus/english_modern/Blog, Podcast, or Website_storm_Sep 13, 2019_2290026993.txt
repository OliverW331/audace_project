It was a small note on the society pages of the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 13, 1952: "Dr. and Mrs. Max Stern returned this week in the Empress of Canada from a three months trip to England, France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy."
But as this photograph, taken before their departure, makes clear, it was no ordinary trip. Stern, a pioneering Montreal gallery owner, was on a mission to find paintings stolen from his family's gallery in Dusseldorf, Germany, by the Nazis.
In the uncredited photo, Stern and his wife, Iris, are looking at reproductions of some of the missing paintings. During the trip, they located one work: Judgment Day by 15th-century master Hieronymus Bosch. "Another - St. Anthony - by an unknown 15th-century painter, is being contested by Hamburg law courts," the caption said.
Stern died in 1987. But restitution efforts continue for art looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis. Only last year, two more paintings were returned to the heirs of Max and Iris Stern.
In November 2018, Storm at Sea by Dutch painter Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek was presented by a Dusseldorf auction house to the Stern heirs and three universities who are beneficiaries of the Stern legacy: Concordia and McGill in Montreal and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
Another Dutch painting, Women of Weinsberg, was returned in May 2018.
