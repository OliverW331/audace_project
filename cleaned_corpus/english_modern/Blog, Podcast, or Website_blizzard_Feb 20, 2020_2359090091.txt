Two people were killed during a massive pileup of cars midday on Wednesday.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The Sûreté du Québec confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.
The state of the other injured crash victims was not known on Wednesday night, and the SQ did not divulge the identities of those who died.
The injured were sent to the Anna-Laberge Hospital in Châteauguay, the Charles-Le Moyne Hospital in Longueuil and the Haut-Richelieu Hospital in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Those hospitals all declared Code Orange protocols, signalling the procedure for an event with mass casualties.
There were whiteout conditions at the time of the crash, as snow and high winds reduced visibility to zero, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said during a Wednesday news conference. He added that two snow-clearing operations had been carried out minutes before the crash because there had been intense snow in the morning.
"The conditions were nice, but the high winds caused the zero-visibility situation," he said, adding that the area is not known to be prone to accidents.
Highway 15 was closed in both directions at the Matte Blvd. access ramp into the night as emergency crews transported at least 12 people to a hospital for urgent care. Rescuers had to use saws to extricate people out of at least nine vehicles.
Others were taken from the scene by bus and treated for minor injuries either in a hospital or at the nearby Centre multifonctionnel Guy-Dupré. In all, at least 40 people were injured in the crash, according to a preliminary report. About 150 people were transported to the community centre.
Crews also had to clean up diesel fuel that was spilled on the highway when a tanker truck was pierced during the crash. More than 125 cars and trucks had to be towed away from the scene.
A school bus was also involved in the crash, but Bonnardel said no one on board was seriously injured.

It appeared the accident happened in a location where snow had been blown onto the road by winds from nearby fields. The decision to close all lanes was based on the need to accommodate first responders and support vehicles.
SQ Sgt. Daniel Thibodeau urged drivers to be cautious on the roads when there are windy conditions.
"It looks sunny and nice, but it's misleading. The high winds can really cause problems," he said, adding that drivers should slow down in areas that are noted for high winds.
The incident came a day after westbound Highway 10 was closed at Marieville( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/accidents-force-closure-of-highway-10-near-marieville ) for several hours in the wake of a chain-reaction pileup involving dozens of vehicles because of poor road conditions.
