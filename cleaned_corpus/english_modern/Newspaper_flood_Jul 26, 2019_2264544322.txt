Re: "Municipal Affairs Ministry defends much-maligned flood-risk map" (Montreal Gazette, July 24) A spokesperson for the Municipal Affairs minister is quoted as saying "we have done a courageous thing to review the rules in the flooded areas" and "we're working with the tools we have."
I suggest they use the only tool that counts: Have municipalities advise them of which zones flood and which don't, put that information together and issue the accurate results. Case closed.
