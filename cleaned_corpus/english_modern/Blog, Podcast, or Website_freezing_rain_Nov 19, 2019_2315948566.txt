After days of threatening snow and freezing rain, the slippery weather arrived Tuesday morning.
A freezing rain warning was issued by Environment Canada, which forecast two to five millimetres of freezing precipitation during the morning. The warning covers Montreal, Laval and Longueuil-Varennes. Similar warnings were issued for several parts of southern Quebec, including the Eastern Townships and Lanaudière.
Icy roads make school-bus travel more dangerous. Some school boards cancelled classes and daycare service for the day, including the Eastern Townships School Board, the Commission scolaire de Saint-Hyachinthe, Commission scolaire des Hautes-Rivières and Commission scolaire Val-des-Cerfs.
Ugences-santé said Tuesday morning that it was experiencing a high volume of calls and encouraged citizens to get themselves to clinics if they were not in danger. The 811 phone line is available 24 hours a day, allowing people to speak with a nurse.
Nous recevons un très haut volume d'appels à la suite de la pluie verglaçante. Si vous pouvez vous rendre par vous-même à la clinique ou si votre vie n'est pas en danger, appelez plutôt le 8-1-1 pour parler à une infirmière compétente qui pourra vous guider.

The temperature was expected to hover around minus-1 Celsius most of Tuesday, with flurries in the late morning that were expected to taper off by evening. Wednesday and Thursday were forecast to hit the freezing mark, with rain and a high of 6 C expected by Friday.
