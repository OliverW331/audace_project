Environment Canada has issued a heat wave warning for the Montreal region starting this weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach or exceed 30 degrees on Saturday, Sunday and Monday in Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and Longueuil. The weather conditions will be particularly "moist" on Sunday and Monday, Environment Canada is warning, with humidex values hovering between 38 and 42. A cold front is expected to bring some relief by Tuesday or Wednesday. In the meantime, the federal government suggests rescheduling or planning outdoor activities during the coolest time of day.
