11:30 a.m. 31 dead at Quebec senior's care residence
A total of 31 people have died at the Résidence Herron in Dorval since March 13, Quebec Premier François Legault said on Saturday.
During his daily briefing, Legault said it was too soon to know how many of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but said at least five have been confirmed.
A police investigation is also underway, Legault said.
The update came a day after a Montreal Gazette investigation revealed dangerous( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources/wcm/19011f52-7b04-41c4-a674-93bc26283749/ ), unsanitary conditions and misleading death tolls at the private residence.

Passage of legislation needed to implement the program was assured after Conservatives dropped their attempt to tie the bill to the longer-term question of how Parliament should function in the midst of a national health crisis.
At a morning news conference just hours before the House of Commons was to meet for a rare emergency sitting on the Easter long weekend, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party has agreed to support passage of the bill later today and to continue discussions on the future of Parliament later.
The program will provide companies that have experienced a 15 per-cent drop in revenues since March 15 with a 75 per-cent wage subsidy for each employee.

The RCMP says arrests under the act, violations of which could include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months, will be a last resort.
Trudeau said Friday he is not planning to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government sweeping powers.

The Alberta government will double its budget this year for infrastructure maintenance and renewal to $1.9 billion to counter job losses due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday morning.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asks a question during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
The governing Liberals and Opposition Conservatives are locked into what appears to be a game of political hot potato over why Parliament has yet to be recalled to pass the latest COVID-19 economic aid bill.( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/conservatives-not-holding-up-aid-bill-but-want-to-see-improvements-scheer/wcm/eadd2340-a3d1-4a44-a0f5-e9bc417de49d/ )
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing the Tories of refusing to sit to debate the bill without provisions in place that would govern how Parliament can function over the long term.
Trudeau suggested he's willing to put his Easter plans on hold this weekend to get the bill passed.
"While we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions -which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and to all of us - we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the House so we can get the help out to Canadians and that is my focus this weekend," he said.
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party supports the program and wants to be make it better.
But the bill doesn't require urgent assent, he argued.

Girl Guides' fall mint cookie campaign crumbles
Girl Guides of Canada's fall mint cookie campaign may be crushed( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/covid-girl-guides ) as long as COVID-19 pandemic policies are in place.
Girl Guides CEO Jill Zelmanovits said in an email Wednesday the fall campaign is not part of any plans at the moment because of the pandemic protocols brought in by the federal government.
Sherwood Park unit leader Kim Papp said on Wednesday there are no plans to have the second campaign since members can't sell door-to-door. Members have been finding solutions to the contactless cookie sales by reaching out to prospective customers and posting fliers around neighbourhoods. Once orders are placed, members leave the cookies on doorsteps.

9:50 a.m. Normality will not come until we get a vaccine, says Trudeau
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says it will take months of a continued and determined effort to avoid a COVID-19 worse-case scenario.
"Things will get better and once they do we can be sure that our country will come roaring back," he said.
Commenting on federal projections made public this morning, Trudeau said: "The initial peak - the top of the curve - may be in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer."
But he said more outbreaks will follow until a vaccine is developed.
"Our health care systems are coping for the time being but we're in a fork in the road between the worst and the best possible outcomes," Trudeau said.
The best outcome will happen if Canadians follow public-health recommendations to stay home and to remain two meters away from others when going out for essential reasons such as grocery shopping, he said.
How long will the federal economic aid measures last? "No matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians," he said.
Will there be multiple waves of shutdowns and economic slowdowns? "Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine," he said.

9:25 a.m. Alberta, B.C. urge long weekend travellers to stay home
Health officials for B.C. and Alberta have issued a joint statement to residents ahead of the long weekend( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/covid-19-b-c-and-alberta-issue-joint-statement/wcm/e6ccb8a5-2a4f-44ac-89cc-9c2ba7bab9e2 ), urging travellers not to cross the border between the two provinces.
B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix and Minister of Health for Alberta Tyler Shandro say they realize the long weekend is usually a time to visit friends and family in other provinces. But they are asking people to stay home instead.
"This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk - and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside," said Dix and Shandro, in the joint statement issued Thursday.

9 a.m. Best case scenario for Canada is 11,000-22,000 dead
In a best-case scenario, Canada's total COVID-19 deaths can range from 11,000 to 22,000,( https://edmontonjournal.com/news/canada/full-text-canada-projections-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths-cases/wcm/aeb72652-6584-4b2d-9813-69d497a9aed2/ ) public health officials revealed Thursday in their projection modelling.
That figure requires keeping the spread of infections to just 2.5 to five per cent of Canadians. Based on the modelling, to get there Canada will have to keep a high level of physical distancing measures in place for a while. In the bad scenarios, where infections reach up to 70 to 80 percent of the population, deaths go well over 300,000.
"These stark numbers tell us we must do everything we can now to remain in that best-case scenario," Dr. Theresa Tam said in a sombre presentation. "We must minimize the population infected... in order to keep deaths, ICU admissions and hospitalizations as low as possible."
Tam said it appeared the spread of the virus was moderating and that Canada could bring the epidemic under control by the end of summer if social distancing and the other measures remained in place and were strictly adhered to. With spotty controls, we could still be battling the tail end of the pandemic a year from now, she said.

Ed Sims, WestJet CEO and president, said in a video posted late Wednesday that the Calgary-based airline will return the laid-off employees to the company payroll under the federal program, following "substantial discussions" with Ottawa.

6:45 a.m. Canada lost 1,011,000 jobs in March
Statistics Canada reports the economy lost 1,011,000 jobs in March( https://edmontonjournal.com/pmn/business-pmn/newsalert-canada-lost-1011000-jobs-in-march-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-8/wcm/fd5cf80f-827d-49f7-b04b-3f159ab12cdc/ ) as the COVID-19 crisis began to take hold, which lifts the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent.
The 2.2 per cent increase in the national unemployment rate marks the worst single-month change over the last 40-plus years of comparable data and brings the rate to a level not seen since October 2010.
Economists warn the numbers are likely to be even worse when the agency starts collecting April job figures, with millions more Canadians now receiving emergency federal aid.
Job losses were felt across all provinces, with the largest in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta. Ontario shed 403,000 jobs, Quebec lost 264,000, B.C. saw a drop of 132,000, and Alberta lost 117,000 compared to just one month earlier.
