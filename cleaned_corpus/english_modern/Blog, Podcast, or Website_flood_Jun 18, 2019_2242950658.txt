Residents across the West Island and Off-Island in the past year or so have taken up causes to block developments or replacement projects. Some succeeded in their goals, other decisions favoured the promoter, and some contentious sites remain a battleground.
In Pincourt( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/off-island-gazette/pincourt-citizens-ramp-up-fight-to-preserve-shrinking-green-space ), activists held a concert last Saturday to help defray fees for legal advice or for environmental studies to back up their opposition to a proposed housing project in an area dubbed the Rousseau Forest. They consider the area to be a wetland and green space. What's problematic is that the site is privately owned and has been zoned for development since the 1950s. Whether or not they successfully lobby Pincourt city council to reconsider accepting a potential housing project, you have to give these activists credit for being creative in sourcing financial backing from the community. Meanwhile, the city is planning to base its decision on a report it has commissioned. I wonder how the sparks will fly if the city's report suggests it's OK to green-light the housing project?
In Pointe-Claire, three contentious projects recently considered by city council led to confrontational debates: the redevelopment of the Pioneer bar site, the Walton Ave. strip mall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-city-council-overturns-demo-committees-walton-decision ) and a community hall project for the local Coptic church( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/opponents-to-church-expansion-concerned-by-halls-commercial-license ). Although the city has given its approval for the church hall and the Pioneer( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/citizens-group-takes-legal-action-to-save-pioneer-bar-from-demolition ) projects, court challenges launched by citizens are pending.
In the coming years, Pointe-Claire will probably have to deal with a major residential-commercial development near the future REM station being built just west of Fairview shopping centre. The mall's owner, Cadillac Fairview, announced( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/bold-vision-for-redevelopment-of-land-near-fairview-mall ) that it has partnered with Ivanhoe Cambridge to realize such a project. Without a doubt, environmentalists will pack city hall once a project is formally proposed and a request is made for a building permit.
Some Pointe-Claire residents are also petitioning against a replacement project on their street for a single-family home. The spacious lot holds a small home built in the 1940s. It will be bulldozed in favour of a larger, modern home. There are a dozen similar examples currently posted on Pointe-Claire's online demolition committee information page( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/demolition-committee/ ).
In Dorval, the city made a valiant attempt last year to buy the McConnell Woods, located along the waterfront, but the offer was rejected. The land was later sold to a promoter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/mcconnell-woods-to-transform-into-royal-quai-luxury-development ) proposing to build about 30 luxury homes.
However, a portion of the land is in a flood zone. So should residents who signed a petition against the development now still hope all the land will be transformed into a public green space?
"No," Dorval Mayor Edgar Rouleau told the West Island Gazette, adding that the McConnell Woods project will proceed as planned.
It's commendable that residents stand up for what they believe is best for their community. It's certainly preferable over total apathy or not paying enough attention to what elected officials are approving until it's too late.
It's interesting to note that residents are often more upset about the prospect of a project blocking their view than anything else. And when citizens are unhappy, the not-in-backyard approach remains a popular go-to.
No matter how transparent a West Island municipality is about a project being considered, there is still most often backlash or calls for revisions, whether for condominiums or townhouses.
Citizens airing their grievances can, at times, become frustrated, especially when elected officials share a difference of opinion. However, the discourse should remain respectful. Some of the exchanges at public meetings are becoming increasingly toxic. Is that a good look for the West Island?
