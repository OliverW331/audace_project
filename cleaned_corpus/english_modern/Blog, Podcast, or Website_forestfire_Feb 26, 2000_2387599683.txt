It's that time of year when schools close their doors --
Where you live determines the exact dates on which it falls. But along with death and taxes, March Break is a certainty of life for parents everywhere. Becoming the full-time master of ceremonies, even if for only a week or two, can be a daunting job. Herewith, some cue cards to help you get through it all:
Vancouver
Pacific Space Centre , 1100 Chestnut St. (604-738-7827), home of the H.R. MacMillan Planetarium. The centre has interactive exhibits that include a virtual voyage and a chance to touch a piece of the Moon. Even better, March Break Space Camp (March 20 to 24) has a number of kid-centric things on offer, priced from $40 to $175 and lasting one to five days. Among them: involves an introduction to robotics and the use of robots in society, and the chance to build a Hyper Peppy robot, which has a sound-and-touch sensor to control its direction. teaches kids about the International Space Station, helps them create their own space-station models, and looks at Canada's involvement in space research. teaches kids about astronaut training, microgravity and spacesuits, and allows them to make rockets, space-shuttle gliders, and to take a ride on a motion simulator.
You can't consider Vancouver with the kids without considering Stanley Park , the city's 400-hectare heart of dense West Coast forest, marked trails, beaches -- and one-of-a-kind playground with vintage fire engine, pool and water slides. There's also thegreat Stanley Park Horse-Drawn Tours (604-681-5115), guided, hour-long meanders through the park.
