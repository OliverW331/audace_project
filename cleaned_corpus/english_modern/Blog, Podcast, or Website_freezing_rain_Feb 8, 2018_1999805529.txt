Citing an average annual snowfall of 220 centimetres and 13 episodes of freezing rain over the past year, Aéroports de Montréal announced Thursday that it has invested more than $6 million in new snow-removal equipment for Trudeau airport's 2018 winter season.
The funds will go toward adding spreaders and spreader trucks to its fleet of maintenance vehicles as well as additional equipment, including a large loader and three front-end loaders.
"Major fluctuations in winter weather conditions are forcing us to review our ways of doing things and refine our techniques," the ADM's Sylvain Marchand said in a statement.
