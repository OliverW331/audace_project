With an average temperature of 24.2 degrees Celsius, Montreal just completed its warmest July since 1921( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hot-damn-july-was-one-of-hottest-on-record-in-montreal ).
While the heat wave of 2018 might harken back to that summer, a lot has changed in the intervening decades.
Let's revisit that summer, shall we?
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, Médric Martin was the city's mayor.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the city had a population of 618,506.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, red and white had still not been declared Canada's colours.
Last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the city looked like this:
Montreal as seen from Île Ste-Hélène in 1921.
St-François Xavier St. looking south from what is now St-Antoine St. in 1921.
Mind you, the last time a July was this hot in Montreal, the Habs had just missed the playoffs. Clearly, the key to a comfortable summer is a good hockey team.
