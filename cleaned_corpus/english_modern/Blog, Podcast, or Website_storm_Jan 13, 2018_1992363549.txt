Stay at home if you can on Saturday.
Environment Canada has issued yet another winter storm warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#81512006251998304201801120504ww1070cwul ), with "hazardous winter conditions" and a further 10 to 15 centimetres of snow expected to fall. Combined with the overnight snowfall, the storm is expected to dump 20 to 30 centimetre in the Montreal region.
Heavy snow will continue Saturday morning and end gradually after 2 p.m( https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/hourly/qc-147_metric_e.html ).
The combination of snow and brisk northwesterlies reduce visibility in many parts of Quebec.
Temperatures will dive during the afternoon, falling to minus-23 - with a wind chill of minus-31 - by Sunday morning at 7. Expect sunny skies with a high of minus-18 tomorrow.
Urgences-Santé is "strongly recommending" that residents of Montreal and Laval stay home this weekend.
Despite that recommendation, paramedics have been very busy since Friday night: more than 200 calls were made to 911 between midnight and 6am Saturday morning - double the normal amount.
Urgences-Santé reminded the public to contact Info-Santé at 811 regarding non-urgent health problems rather than calling 911.
And if you do call an ambulance, you should spread abrasives on slippery surfaces like steps and paths leading to your home, if possible.
City buses are running, but way behind schedule in many cases.
At Trudeau Airport, dozens of arrivals and departures are delayed. Check the Aéroport de Montréal website( http://www.admtl.com/ ) for flight status.
Reduced visibility was reported on several sections of Highways 20, 40 and 10. In the Montmagny section of Highway 20 east of Quebec City, visibility is nil.
A number of cars have slid off roads since Friday night, according to the Sûreté du Québec. No serious injuries have been reported.
The SQ is calling on drivers to exercise caution and has extra officers on hand during the storm.
