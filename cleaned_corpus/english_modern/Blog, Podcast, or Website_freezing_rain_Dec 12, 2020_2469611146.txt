If you haven't already, today's a good day to put your crampons by the door.
Up 5 millimetres of freezing precipitation is expected in the Montreal area starting Saturday afternoon, Environment Canada said in a weather warning.

It could last from six to 12 hours before changing to rain.
The warning also covers Laval, Longueuil and Ch√¢teauguay.
