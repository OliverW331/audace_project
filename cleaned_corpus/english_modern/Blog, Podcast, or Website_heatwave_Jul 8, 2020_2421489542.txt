Citing conditions favourable for the development of "dangerous thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain," Environment Canada on Wednesday morning announced a severe thunderstorm watch in effect for the Montreal area.
Issued at 11:20 a.m., the watch covers the areas of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Ch√¢teauguay-La Prairie.
The federal agency said the watch is in effect for this afternoon and "possibly into early this evening."
Boaters are warned they may be surprised by strong wind gusts over bodies of water. Environment Canada noted that large hail from major storms can damage property and cause injury while very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, topple trees and blow large vehicles off the road.
