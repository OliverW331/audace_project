With a looming special weather statement that promises 10 to 20 centimetres of snowfall for the Montreal region, boroughs were racing against the clock to clear last week's brutal 40-centimetre dump.
Three boroughs are done and ready to go again, according to the city of Montreal's website: Anjou, Outremont and St-Léonard. Trailing boroughs include Pierrefonds-Roxboro, at 69 per cent cleared, and LaSalle at 76 per cent as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. As a whole, Montreal was 85 per cent cleared, the site said. When the storm hit Wednesday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/live-major-snowstorm-wallops-montreal-33-cm-so-far ), Mayor Valérie Plante said it would take seven or eight days to remove all the snow.
If all goes according to plan, that means we'll have mostly clear streets and sidewalks( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ice-and-snow-montrealers-should-expect-better-services-plante-says ) by the time it starts all over again Wednesday night.
