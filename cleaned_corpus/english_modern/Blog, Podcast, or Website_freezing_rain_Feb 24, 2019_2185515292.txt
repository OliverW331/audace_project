In case the pinging sound on your windows doesn't give it away, Montreal's Sunday morning is beginning in a rain of ice pellets, changing to freezing rain later this morning. Streets, sidewalks and parked cars were crusted with ice downtown. Walking and driving are tricky.
Environment Canada's weather warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) says the freezing rain could last through to mid afternoon. A northeast wind of 30 km/h will gust to 50, becoming southeast at 40, gusting to 60 in the afternoon.
Rain this afternoon and this evening could cause water accumulations on streets and sidewalks so drivers, please mind the pedestrians trying to avoid your wave of slush. Pedestrians, be careful. Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ). Put on or get some ice crampons for your boots.

Tonight: Rain will change to light snow in the evening and continued windy at 20 km/h, gusting to 40, becoming 40, gusting to 70, in the evening, and a low of minus 4.
