A Quebec organization has issued a warning to hikers and campers that the dangers of sparking forest fires over the weekend is pegged at "very high, if not extreme, levels" in most of the province.
Most forest fires are caused by human carelessness, and the beginning of two weeks of summer construction holidays means it will be high season for unwanted fires, said Melanie Morin of the Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU).
The construction holidays are coinciding with beautiful, warm weather and no rain in most of Quebec for the next four or five days, she explained.
"We're asking people for cooperation, we want them to be careful," Morin said.
The association's recommendations for those venturing out into nature:
- Don't smoke in the forest.
- Don't burn waste.
- Avoid lighting fireworks near wooded areas.
- Use marked trails for ATV rides.
- Use outdoor fireplaces equipped with fire arrestors.
The Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks has banned open fires in or near the forest due to the conditions. The ban comes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. and applies to parts of the regions of Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Mauricie, Capitale-Nationale, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Outaouais, Laurentides, Lanaudière and Chaudière-Appalaches. Information on the exact areas covered by the ban can be found on SOPFEU's website.( http://sopfeu.qc.ca/restrictions/interdiction-de-faire-des-feux-a-ciel-ouvert-en-foret-ou-a-proximite/ )
For several weeks, SOPFEU teams in Canada and the United States have mobilized to control fires caused by lightning in the province. Since the beginning of the season, 427 fires have burned 28,404 hectares of forest. By comparison, the average during the same date over the last decade is 301 fires in ??33,958 hectares.
