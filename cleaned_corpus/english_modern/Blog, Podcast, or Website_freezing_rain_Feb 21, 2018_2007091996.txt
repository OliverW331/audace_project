The freezing rain that covered the Quebec City region Tuesday night has played havoc( http://nouvelles.hydroquebec.com/fr/pannes/hq/180/la-pluie-verglacante-cause-des-pannes-dans-la-region-de-quebec/ ) with Hydro-Québec's distribution network, leaving more than 100,000 clients without electricity on Wednesday morning.
As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, more than 108,700 Hydro customers were without power( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ) due to 138 power failures.
In the neighbouring region of Chaudière-Appalaches, close to 9,600 clients were also waking up to no electricity.
Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) forecasts that freezing rain will transform into rain over the course of the day as the temperature is expected to reach 6 C. The temperature is then expected to plummet to -11 C overnight.
Icy conditions on local roads and sidewalks have made getting around difficult and potentially dangerous. As a result, the Capitale, des Navigateurs, des Premières-Seigneuries and des Découvreurs school boards have cancelled classes for the day for elementary, secondary and adult education courses.
Bad weather has also caused interruptions of service at Jean-Lesage airport, with many flights to Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa cancelled. If you're travelling to Quebec City today, check with the airline or the Aéroports de Montréal( http://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/departs ) before heading out.
