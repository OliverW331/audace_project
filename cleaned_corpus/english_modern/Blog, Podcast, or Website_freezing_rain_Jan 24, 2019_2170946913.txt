Montrealers woke up Thursday to Day 5 of a nightmarish weather cocktail that saw a sub-zero snowstorm on Sunday( https://wp.me/p4Uzqt-61tJ ) followed on Wednesday by a day of snow and freezing rain that turned highways and streets into slush-filled quagmires, and then steady rain beginning early Thursday that turned all of the above into ice-sheeted streets and sidewalks with intersections like small ponds.
All Montreal island school boards have cancelled classes and operations for Thursday while local road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ) range from dodgy to downright treacherous.

But cracks began to appear in that strategy early Thursday, as Montreal executive committee chairman and Sud-Ouest borough mayor Benoit Dorais took to Twitter to say that because of the school closures, many snow personnel in his borough were unable to come in to work.
