Anyone in Montreal who complained about not having a white Christmas can expect to be rewarded with plenty of snow on Monday.
Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning, saying the Montreal area, including Laval, Longueuil and Ch√¢teauguay, might receive up to 20 centimetres of snow.
"Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 centimetres are expected beginning Monday afternoon into Tuesday afternoon," Environment Canada noted in the statement posted on its website Sunday afternoon. "Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations."
The temperature for Monday is expected to hover around minus 2 Celsius for most of the day.
