I read the heat wave warning posted on Environment Canada's website last week and noticed they suggest keeping alcohol intake to a minimum. Alcohol is a diuretic; it makes your kidneys work harder and you urinate more often, causing your body to lose more fluid. Combined with sweating, this effectively increases the possibility of dehydration.
I guess it's best to keep your martini drinking to air-conditioned rooms. My solution is to drink lower-alcohol beverages, and there are none better than cider. Whether sparkling or still, most ciders come in at under eight per cent alcohol by volume. And there are so many really good Quebec-made examples.
Although the province's wine industry has made great strides of late, cider has a much longer history. In apple-growing regions like France's Normandy and northern Spain, drinking cider is part of day-to-day life. Yet in apple-rich Quebec, it never caught on.
The reason can be traced back to a government oversight. In 1921, when the Quebec liquor commission was established, cider was not included in the law, making it effectively illegal to produce or sell. This led to bootlegging and a lack of investment in both technology and technique. Lots of bad cider was produced, which turned the population off the beverage.
Things have changed. There are now over 80 artisanal cider producers in Quebec, and the SAQ carries more than 130 varieties, not including ice-cider. A number of cider houses are planting different types of apple to create even better products. Hopefully, this will attract more Quebecers to cider. Even if it doesn't, there are plenty of opportunities outside of the province. According to the Beverage Trade Network, worldwide cider consumption has increased by 50 per cent over the past decade.
Ciders are also relatively inexpensive, most under $16. The vast majority of local production is in sparkling ciders, which can range from relatively dry to off-dry. One of the best introductions to sparkling ciders is the Crémant from Cidrerie du Minot( https://www.saq.com/page/en/saqcom/sparkling-cider/cidrerie-du-minot-cremant-de-pomme/245316 ). At 2.5 per cent alcohol, its lightness and explosion of fruit make it a great aperitif.
If you want something a little drier, try the Vergers de la Colline's Les Russet( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/les-vergers-de-la-colline-les-russet/13107641?selectedIndex=52&searchContextId=266762767410519997 ) or the Cidre mousseux( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/union-libre-cidre-mousseux-2014/12641948?selectedIndex=70&searchContextId=266762767410742678 ) from Union Libre. If you want a rosé, both Domaine Lafrance( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/domaine-lafrance-cidre-mousseux-rose-2016/13258289 ) and Michel Jodoin( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/michel-jodoin-cidre-rose-petillant/13514297 ) make great examples. The Jodoin comes in 330-millilitre bottles as well.
One of the most exciting aspects of this new age in Quebec cider is the derivative products, especially the aromatic ciders which are fermented with other fruits. I love both the cranberry( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/entre-pierre-et-terre/12030291 ) and strawberry Spritz( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-mousseux/spritz-entre-pierre-et-terre-cocktail-au-cidre-petillant/13612663?selectedIndex=7&searchContextId=2667627674103330100 ) from Entre Pierre et Terre, as well as the raspberry from Coteau Rougemont( https://www.saq.com/page/fr/saqcom/cidre-aromatise/coteau-rougemont-rose-framboise-cidre-aromatise/12358173?selectedIndex=18&searchContextId=2667627674102918427 ). If you are a fan of Campari and soda, try using these instead of soda.
