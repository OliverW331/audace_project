QUEBEC - Even if the number of new confirmed COVID-19( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coronavirus-live-updates-new-possible-exposure-points-reported-in-montreal ) cases is growing at a slower rate than the day before, there is little chance Quebec schools will open by the end of March, Premier François Legault said Friday.
Moving to deal with a new threat on his flank - tongue wagging by panicky people - Legault took the time to deny wild rumours that as pockets of COVID-19 emerge in cities the government will use the extraordinary powers at its disposal to order a confinement.
"I don't want false rumours," Legault told reporters at his daily briefing on the evolution of the coronavirus. "Closing down the Eastern Townships is out of the question. Closing down Montreal is out of the question. These are all false rumours and it's important to say it."
Legault made the comments even as the mayor of Côte-St-Luc( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/cavendish-mall-closed-as-cote-st-luc-grapples-with-coronavirus-exposure-points ), Mitchel Brownstein, asked Quebec for the authorization to quarantine his city in the wake of news that two points of exposure had been discovered.
Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, also tried to calm the waters, noting pockets of the virus in individual centres may make headlines but they were expected and do not necessarily represent a province-wide threat.
On Friday, it was announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quebec rose by 18 from the day before to 139. One person in Quebec has died and 10 are in hospital, including six in intensive care.
Results are pending for another 2,400 tests. More than 7,700 tests have been negative.
#COVID19( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) - Au Québec, en date du 20 mars 13h, la situation est la suivante:
139 cas confirmés
1 décès
1 personne guérie
2403 personnes sous investigation
7666 analyses négatives

Arruda noted that the 18-case increase is less than the 27 new cases announced Thursday.
"We're noticing the number is going up, but a little bit slower than it was going up even if we have increased the number of tests," Arruda said, adding he does not want to get overly optimistic. "The situation is under control."
Quebec, nevertheless, continues to prepare for the worst with Health Minister Danielle McCann announcing the province has freed up 4,000 hospital beds by delaying things like elective surgery. McCann has also been overwhelmed with applications from 17,000 retired health-care workers prepared to return to work if needed.
Legault said Quebec has enough medical equipment for the short term, but may call on industries to help produce things like masks. He wouldn't speculate when asked again what percentage of Quebec's population could end up infected.
"The lucky party for us is that we started acting (on the threat) sooner than others so that should allow us to have a flatter curve (in terms of cases)," Legault said. "But listen, you can talk to five different experts and get five different sets of numbers."
As for the re-opening of Quebec's schools, Legault said he is being realistic.
"I think students in the CEGEP and university system will be able to complete their school year this summer thanks to remote teaching methods," Legault said. "We are looking at different scenarios on schools, but it's unlikely that they will be back by the end of March. We are in the process of checking whether it will be possible by early May."
The original scenario was to re-open Quebec's elementary and high schools by March 30.
Despite calls by some in the construction industry to shut down sites because it is difficult to impose social distancing rules and hand washing, Legault said the sector is too essential to the economy( https://montrealgazette.com/business/quebec-unlocks-2-5-billion-to-help-companies-weather-covid-19-storm ) to allow that. Instead, Labour Minister Jean Boulet is working on plans to install wash stations on sites and larger trailers so the workers can respect social distancing on their breaks and lunch hours.
"It's important to protect our construction workers," Legault said. "We are going to need them. It is a critical part of the economy."
There will be work for them.
Legault said Quebec is now working on plans to move up spending on public infrastructure projects - from roads to schools - to replace lost jobs as the private sector puts building projects on hold. Quebec's construction sector employs 260,000 people.
For his daily thank you ritual at his news conference, Legault highlighted the important work the media( https://montrealgazette.com/ ) is doing during the crisis in getting essential information out to Quebecers.
"We need you to inform the population," Legault said while sitting in front of 10 reporters who have to respect the distancing rules even at the news conference. "It is essential work."
Legault also reached out specifically to the English-speaking community, adding a section in English to his opening remarks for the first time since the crisis started.
"I want to say a few words in English," Legault said. "The situation remains under control. Every action we take to limit physical contact will save lives. If you feel sick, stay home. We must continue our effort and we'll get through this together."
To get the message about staying home out better to people over 70, Legault announced entertainer Dominique "Dodo," Michel( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Michel ) and respected retired journalist Bernard Derome( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dTjqjKFogU ) have recorded telephone messages to be played to older Quebecers.
Afin de rassurer les personnes aînées & leur rappeler l'importance de respecter les consignes de santé publique, des appels automatisés, enregistrés par Bernard Derome & Dominique Michel, seront effectués à compter de 18 h.

Legault's handling of the crisis is earning him praise on many fronts. On Wednesday, a new Léger poll( https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/575143/le-quebec-uni-derriere-le-gouvernement ) conducted for Le Devoir revealed 85 per cent of the population, regardless of age or language, support his government's handling of the crisis.
Legault confirmed he and deputy premier Geneviève Guilbault are keeping their distance to ensure if Legault falls ill - as many politicians have - there is someone to replace him. The 62-year-old Legault has not taken a day off since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in Quebec and is working out of the provincial capital even though his home is in Outremont.
"I'm in good shape and I don't see any problems," Legault said answering a question from the Montreal Gazette on how he is holding up. "I think it's important to have a backup, but I feel well."
Legault added that rules limiting travel from one region to the next apply to him as well.
"I know that is the birthday of one of my boys Sunday," Legault said. "Unfortunately, I won't be able to see him. He's in Montreal, I'm in Quebec City, but that's life."
Legault's son, Victor, turns 26 this weekend.
