After a weekend that saw the city endure rain, freezing rain and snow, the City of Montreal began its snow removal operations at 7 p.m. Monday. Jean-Fran√ßois Parenteau, the city executive committee member in charge of services to citizens, said 11 centimetres of sleet and ice had fallen since Saturday night. "Since this heavy snow won't melt, there is no advantage to wait for further precipitation. ... So it will be picked up and we'll preserve access to our sewer drains."
