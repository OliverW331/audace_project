A winter storm involving an unusual - and unpleasant - combination of snow, cold temperatures, and high winds struck Montreal on Sunday morning.
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ) issued a winter storm warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#71737450348731252201901190504ww1070cwul ) for the city and its surrounding areas, which warned that 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected.
Along with the snowfall, Montreal is facing strong winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-do-yourself-a-favour-and-stay-in-bed-today ) of 40 km/h, gusting to 70, which are expected to result in "extensive blowing snow."
They'll also contribute to a forecasted wind chill of minus 35 degrees Celsius. Three provincial ministers have issued a joint statement to alert citizens( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/situation-urgence/Pages/Tempete-hivernale.aspx ) to the frostbite risk.
Environment Canada meteorologist Alexandre Parent says this combination of snow, cold and wind rarely happens in Quebec. He notes that temperatures usually go up when it snows.
On the island of Montreal, 25 power outages affected 4,496 households Sunday morning. The West Island was particularly hard hit, with broken equipment causing a major blackout affecting thousands of homes in Pointe Claire and Beaconsfield starting at 5:50 a.m. Power is being gradually restored throughout the morning.
The Société de Transport de Montréal has rerouted some buses away from steep hills because of slippery conditions. Buses will not run on Ridgewood Ave., Beaver Hall Hill and Victoria Ave. The bus routes affected are Nos. 11, 35, 36, 61, 75, 124, 168 and 711.
The Ministry of Transport is reminding Quebecers to be careful on the roads because abrasives are much less effective when it's so cold outside.
The Sûreté du Québec is calling on drivers to exercise caution and avoid driving if not necessary.
Until the weather improves, Environment Canada is counselling Montrealers to put off non-essential travel.
