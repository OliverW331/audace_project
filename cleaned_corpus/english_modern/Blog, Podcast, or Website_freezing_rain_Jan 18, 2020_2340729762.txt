Hanes: Is Montreal ready for the Big One?( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-is-montreal-ready-for-the-big-one )
Residents across the Montreal region may have hunkered down over the weekend with candles, a supply of water and non-perishable snacks in anticipation of an all-too familiar threat from Mother Nature. Mercifully, the freezing rain storm that hit Saturday night into Sunday morning turned out to be less dire than forecast( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/less-freezing-rain-than-expected ), though it did knock out power to more than 130,000 Hydro-Québec customers. On Monday morning, however, many people were shaken awake by another natural phenomenon. A 3.6-magnitude earthquake centred along the Quebec-New York border( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/did-the-earthquake-wake-you-up-it-was-magnitude-3-4-near-valleyfield ) rocked a broad swath of Quebec, from Rigaud to St-Bruno. Fortunately, it caused no material damage or injuries. But the tremor is a reminder of a potential danger for which we are ill prepared.
Brownstein: Harry and Meghan living in Montreal? A jolly good idea!( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/brownstein-harry-and-meghan-living-in-montreal-a-jolly-good-idea )
Have we got a castle for you, Harry and Meghan! Now that Queen Elizabeth has "reluctantly" agreed to the couple living a more independent future and splitting time between both sides of the pond, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle should forget about moving to Toronto or Vancouver but instead come to Montreal where the gin and tonics flow, the food is decidedly finer and the real estate is relatively reasonable. The latter, of course, is a major consideration since the Sussexes seek to be financially independent and work for their daily crumpets.
As Montreal's vacancy rate plummets, Mayor Plante seeks funding help( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-addresses-housing-crisis )
Montreal's rental vacancy rate has dropped to 1.5 per cent while rents have risen by 3.6 per cent, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. That marks a 15-year low in the city, where finding a reasonably priced apartment is harder than ever. The average rent in the city is now $841 a month, according to a report( https://eppdscrmssa01.blob.core.windows.net/cmhcprodcontainer/sites/cmhc/data-research/publications-reports/rental-market-reports/2019/rental-market-reports-montreal-64411-2020-a01-en.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=r&se=2021-05-07T03:55:04Z&st=2019-05-06T19:55:04Z&spr=https,http&sig=bFocHM6noLjK8rlhy11dy%2BkQJUBX%2BCDKzkjLHfhUIU0%3D ) on the 2019 rental market released Wednesday. The average rent for a vacant two-bedroom apartment in Greater Montreal is about $1,080 - about 25 per cent more than the average for units that are presently occupied. Mayor Valérie Plante called on the federal and provincial governments to open the purse strings to help solve the growing housing crisis.
Ensemble Montréal calls for ban on e-scooters( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ban-scooters-boost-bixi-opposition-urges )
Montreal's opposition party is calling on the administration to pull the plug on electric scooters after last year's pilot project resulted in widespread shirking of helmet and parking laws. "From what we've seen, it's clear that it was a failure," Ensemble Montréal Leader Lionel Perez said Thursday after a press conference at city hall. In August, Lime introduced 430 e-scooters in Montreal, followed by Bird, with 250 scooters. The two-wheeled devices were popular, with Lime averaging 1,500 rides a day. However, compliance with parking rules was so poor, the city announced in September( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-e-scooter-e-bike-riders-to-be-fined-50-for-illegal-parking ) it would impose $50 tickets on riders caught in the act of parking illegally.
Thérèse Tanguay Dion in 2008.
Maman Dion was 'the mother of all of Quebec'( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/maman-dion-was-the-mother-of-all-of-quebec )
Thérèse Tanguay Dion wasn't just the mother of Québécois pop superstar Céline Dion. She was also a much-loved Quebec personality in her own right, which is why so many people here reacted so emotionally when news broke Friday morning that she had died( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/maman-dion-celines-mother-has-died-at-age-92 ). Maman Dion, as she was affectionately known, died Friday at the age of 92. No cause of death was announced, but her daughter Claudette said she had been in failing health for several months. "She's like the mother of all of Quebec because everyone wants to have a Maman Dion as their mother," said TV host and producer Julie Snyder. "Céline was the darling of Quebec, but she was the mom of Quebec. And she's the most famous mom in the world. There is no star who has a famous mom like her. You don't know the mom of Paul McCartney. You don't know the mom of Beyoncé."
