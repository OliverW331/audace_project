A combination of wind and slow but steady freezing rain left roughly 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers without electricity in the Montreal area on Monday afternoon.
As of 6 p.m. the hardest hit was the Launaudière region with close to 94,600 clients off the grid, while power was out for nearly 22,400 customers of the island of Montreal.
At its peak, Laval had more than 63,000 business and homes without electricity but that figure was down to 22,000 by Monday evening.
South of the island, the Montérégie region had 12,000 homes affected by the blackout.
While Montreal Island outages were to be repaired by late afternoon, Hydro-Québec could only assure customers in Laval and the Laurentians that repair crews were on route and would try to re-establish power as quickly as possible.
