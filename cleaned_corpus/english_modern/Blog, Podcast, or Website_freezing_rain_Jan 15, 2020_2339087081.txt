Environment Canada has lifted a special weather statement issued Wednesday morning for the Montreal area and that had forecast 15 centimetres of snow that could coincide with the Thursday morning rush hour.
While the statement originally warned that driving conditions "could be hazardous during morning rush hour Thursday in Montreal and its suburbs," an amended forecast now calls for 4 to 8 centimetres to fall over the area over next 24 hours with high of 0 Celsius on Wednesday and of -3 on Thursday.
