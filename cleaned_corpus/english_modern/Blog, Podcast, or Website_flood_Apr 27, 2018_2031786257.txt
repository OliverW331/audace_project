A high-profile member of Premier Philippe Couillard's Quebec Liberal government won't seek another mandate.
At a news conference in Montreal Friday afternoon, Martin Coiteux confirmed the departure speculation from earlier in the day, saying he is leaving for personal reasons.
Earlier in the day, Couillard paid tribute to Coiteux.
"He has made a significant contribution to Quebec," Couillard said. "If you look at the public finances, if you look at the three laws that he introduced to really transform the relationship between Quebec City and municipalities, the way he acted during the big flood that we had, unfortunately, last year."
The premier played down the significance of Coiteux's departure just over five months before the Oct. 1 provincial election. "Every person has to think about this; there's no other significance. There will be departures; there will be arrivals as well."
The premier also addressed rumours that longtime MNA Geoff Kelley, the minister responsible for native affairs, would also be leaving politics. Kelley has represented the West Island riding of Jacques-Cartier since 1994.
"I haven't spoken directly with Geoff about this," Couillard said. "Everyone has to make these decisions at each election."
Coiteux was among a trio of candidates recruited in 2014 by Couillard to form an "economic team" tasked with reforming the government's finances.
As head of the treasury board, the MNA for the riding of Nelligan presided over two years of government spending cuts that saw billions slashed from government programs. As municipal affairs minister, he was in charge of legislation that saw special status bestowed on Montreal as the province's economic centre.
Most Montrealers, however, particularly those living in the West Island, will recall him as the cabinet minister in charge of relief efforts during last year's spring floods.
