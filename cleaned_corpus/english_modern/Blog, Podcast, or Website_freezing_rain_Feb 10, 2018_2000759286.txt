If you thought we had hit peak precipitation with Wednesday's snowfall( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/yes-its-snowing-again-get-ready-for-tough-commute-home-montreal ) - which left roads around Montreal in a mess - think again.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1915031272045374221201802090504ws1070cwul ) for Montreal, Longueuil, Laval and Ch√¢teauguay this weekend.
A mix of snow and freezing rain will hit southern Quebec, with 12 cm of snow expected Saturday followed by freezing rain on Sunday.
Light snow will begin Friday evening, intensifying late Saturday morning.
Snow will resume Sunday morning, then comes freezing rain in the afternoon or evening, with 2 to 5 cm expected. Precipitation should end Sunday night.
This weather system may cause challenging conditions for drivers in southern Quebec throughout the weekend.
And if that has you thinking about snow clearing, the city's snow-clearing tracker site says, as of 4:30 p.m. on Friday, that the city was 82 per cent cleared( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/deneigement/avancement ).
