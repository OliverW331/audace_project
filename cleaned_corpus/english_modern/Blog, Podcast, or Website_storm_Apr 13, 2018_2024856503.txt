Environment Canada has expanded on a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#32047390255769761201804120504ws1070cwul ) warning a winter storm is headed for Quebec. It's expected to hit Sunday and Monday.
Motorists should be prepared for bad road conditions, especially if there's snow or ice buildup Sunday or Monday. Poor weather could lead to airline travel delays.
A low-pressure system will cross the border from the U.S. Midwest, bringing with it a "wintry mix." As of Friday, no one seems sure just which path it'll take or how it's going to affect the Montreal area, but you can choose your own adventure with the possibilities: snow, freezing rain, rain, strong winds.
Here are some other things that aren't weather that are imported to Quebec from the Midwest:
Cars, tires and aircraft parts
Mineral or chemical nitrogen fertilizers
Liquor
Radar detection and remote control apparatuses
Soy bean residues
