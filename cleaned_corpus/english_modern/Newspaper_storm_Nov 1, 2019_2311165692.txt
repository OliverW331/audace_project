Re: "Halloween storm plays tricks on kids who want treats" (Montreal Gazette, Oct. 31) What's next - change Christmas Day if there is a snowstorm? I had two children who never missed a Halloween outing unless they were bedridden. Not going out on Halloween night just because of poor weather is ridiculous.
It's a safety issue because of slippery walkways and driveways? Be more careful and dress accordingly, just Iike we did back in the day as we endured rain and sometimes snow.
Changing the date only softens up our ghoulies for the realities of life. It also creates a confusing precedent about what day will be mandated Halloween in any given year.
