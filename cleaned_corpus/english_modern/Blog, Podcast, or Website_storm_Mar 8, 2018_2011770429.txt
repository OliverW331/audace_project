A powerful storm hitting the northeastern United States had ripple effects in Montreal Wednesday, causing several delays and cancellations at Montreal's Trudeau International Airport.
According to Anne-Sophie Hamel, a spokesperson for the airport, the storm caused a total of 60 departures and arrivals to be cancelled Wednesday.
Most cancellations were for flights either leaving for or arriving from Philadelphia, Boston and New York.
"It should be pretty stable from now on," Hamel said Wednesday evening. "But in the winter, we always ask travellers to doublecheck the state of their flights before leaving for the airport."
Environment Canada is calling for roughly five centimetres( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) of snow to fall in Montreal on Thursday.
A special weather statement is in effect for other parts of the province, including the Qu√©bec City area, where up to 15 centimetres of snow could fall before the weekend.
