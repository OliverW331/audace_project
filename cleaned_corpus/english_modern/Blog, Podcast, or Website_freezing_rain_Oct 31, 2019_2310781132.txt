With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least eight Quebec municipalities, including Montreal, are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the cities of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes ) Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ), St-Lambert, Mont-St-Hilaire and St-Colomban are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante joined the chorus. "Weather advisory: I invite little and big Montrealers to have Halloween on Friday because of the rain and strong winds announced tomorrow," Plante said via Twitter. It is believed to be the first time Montreal has suggested postponing Halloween.
In Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 millimetres, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.
Montreal's children have braved inclement weather before.
October 1933, for example, was snowy and frigid in Montreal.
The temperature dipped as low as minus-7 Celsius, and 22 centimetres of snow had fallen by Oct. 25, Environment Canada statistics show.
"Most heavily hit ... were the children who had for weeks been waiting impatiently to go out in their new costumes to celebrate the festival of Hallowe'en," the Montreal Gazette reported in a 1946 article about the winter of 1933.
The children "were forced to make their rounds of neighbours' homes with collars and scarves hiding their faces, and heavy boots covering their feet, (their) mittened hands reaching out for the customary 'charity.'
"And the strangest sight of all was seeing the kids dragging their booty along the streets in sleighs."
