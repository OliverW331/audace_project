The Olympic Basin at Jean-Drapeau Park will open in the first week of July, while Jean-Doré Beach and the Aquatic Complex will open in the second or third week of July, the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau announced Sunday.
Measures will be taken to ensure that visitors comply with health guidelines on preventing the spread of COVID-19, the paramunicipal organization said in a statement.
Although Jean-Doré beach and the Aquatic Complex will open in a few weeks, the changing rooms will not be accessible, which means that swimmers will have to arrive at the park wearing their swimsuits. Physical distancing measures will be implemented. At the Aquatic Complex, only the large recreational pool will be open.
The park has started gradually opening its parking lots. For more information, visit www.parcjeandrapeau.com
