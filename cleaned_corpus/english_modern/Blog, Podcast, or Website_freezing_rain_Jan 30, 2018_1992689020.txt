The largest cities in two of the world's three happiest countries, as ranked in the latest World Happiness Report published by the United Nations( http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/HR17-Ch2.pdf ), have heated sidewalks.
In Reykjavik, Iceland, thermal energy harvested from hot springs is used for snow melting. Hot water is pumped through tubes under many of the sidewalks. It's like in-floor heating, but outside. Meanwhile in Oslo, Norway, uses electric heating elements embedded in sidewalks to melt snow.
Montreal's experiment with heated sidewalks at Place Vauquelin also used electric elements. While the world's happiest country successfully implemented this system, Montreal had to replace the first elements it installed in the square after they failed to function properly( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ste-catherine-st-project-begins-in-downtown-core ).
The failure of that trial run along with the escalating costs of heating a 3.3-kilometre stretch of Ste-Catherine Street were cited Monday as sources confirmed to the Montreal Gazette that the city's plan for heated sidewalks was dead( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-ices-plan-to-heat-ste-catherine-st-sidewalks ).
This decision might not have improved Montreal's happiness quotient, seeing as the city's coming off a week of freezing rain and ice-covered sidewalks.
Incidentally, Canada lags behind Iceland and Norway in the latest World Happiness Report.
