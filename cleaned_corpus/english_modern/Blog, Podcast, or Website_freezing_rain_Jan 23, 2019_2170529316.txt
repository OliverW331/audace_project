Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal.
"As a warm front approaches, a band of freezing rain will develop over the Outaouais region and Montreal area late today," the federal weather office said.
As of 11:25 a.m. on Wednesday, the warning applied to Montreal, Chateauguay, Laval, and Longueuil.
About five centimetres of snow were expected to fall on Wednesday morning. The snow is expected to change to freezing rain late in the afternoon. And the freezing rain will change to rain near midnight.
"Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery," Environment Canada said. "Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions."
More rain is expected on Thursday, when the high is expected to reach 4 C.
