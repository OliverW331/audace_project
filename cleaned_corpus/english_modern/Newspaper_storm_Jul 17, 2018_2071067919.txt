Re: "Court says city must bury last bit of old river" (Montreal Gazette, July 10) The fate of the last remaining piece of the St-Pierre River turns on the legal question of whether the brook that goes through Meadowbrook golf course is a river at all, or whether it's just a ditch fed by a storm sewer.
That very question shows just how far we've come in transforming our urban environment. Storm sewers are, of course, the city's underground rivers, pipes that were created to carry the water that once flowed above ground.
Our urban rivers were buried throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries out of fear there was no way to keep contaminants out of these waterways. Today we know better, and most modern sewage systems separate storm water from the industrial and household waste that has to be treated before going back into the environment. In principle, this should give cities the opportunity to bring the underground rivers back to the surface, creating more diverse urban environments for people and the other critters with whom we share the city.
To bury the Meadowbrook creek would not only mean losing an important piece of history and urban biodiversity, it would also signal a failure of urban planning and of the urban imagination.
The only reason the water needs to be buried is that CÃ´te-St-Luc and Montreal West have failed to keep raw sewage out of the city's most important underground river, the St-Pierre. The problem is upstream, and burying the river would only be conceding to those municipalities'inability to get their s--together.
