If the persistent snow banks didn't make getting around hard enough, freezing rain is expected to be added to the mix on Wednesday and Thursday.
We've gone from deep freeze, to seasonal norms, to unseasonably warm weather and are now bracing for freezing rain, rain, a snowstorm, and then back to the deep freeze. The coming weather even led to Air Canada issuing a travel warning and to waive the usual fees for anyone wishing to change their travel plans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 14.
Travel Alert - January 11-12-13-14: Toronto (YYZ & YTZ), Montreal (YUL) & Ottawa (YOW). Details, Flight Status & rebook online. Change fees waived: https://t.co/j6Q9rcq8zw( https://t.co/j6Q9rcq8zw ).

If the winter were a children's toy, it would be a yo-yo, as Montrealers have dealt with extremes during the first three weeks of winter.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante saluted the work of snow removal crews( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-rush-hour-slightly-less-arduous-as-snow-clearing-operations-continue ) who are carrying away the roughly 30 centimetres of snow that fell since the beginning of the year, but progress has been slower than most residents care for, as snowbanks are wreaking havoc on narrow streets, making it nearly impossible to park without having to shovel out mounds of snow.
"We're improving our services and it shows," Plante said at the webcast of the executive committee meeting Monday morning, after saying that the city received 1,600 fewer complaints than it did at this point of the season last year.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the city reported it had completed 42 per cent of the snow removal operation. According to the city's website( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ), the best borough was Anjou where 61 per cent of the streets had been cleared. The boroughs with the least amount of snow cleared were Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at 30 per cent.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sue Montgomery, Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough mayor, acknowledged the slow pace of snow clearing in her borough. In a Facebook post she said she understands residents' frustration and asks for their patience.
"What I'm told is that the equipment was set to pick up the piles of snow on Monday but then had to be dispatched to plow snow because of the snowfall that day. And I'm told it's bad everywhere in Montreal," she wrote. "Believe me, I'm watching and asking so we can get it right."
The snowbanks will become crustier and heavier in the coming days, as freezing rain is expected to start falling around dinnertime.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 )at 11 a.m.( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and the Châteauguay and La Prairie areas, saying roads and sidewalks could become slippery as temperatures warm up to 6 C on Thursday and Friday. Temperatures will dip back down near the freezing mark on Saturday and the rain will change to snow. About 15 centimetres of snow is expected before temperatures plummet to a high of -14 C on Sunday.
The warmer temperatures were expected to cause river levels to rise with a buildup of frazil ice (crystals) causing flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laval-monitoring-river-levels-as-frazil-ice-forms-on-waterways ) for some residents along the Rivière des Prairies in Laval and Terrebonne.
