Enjoy it while it lasts.
Montreal's summer is ending with a bang - the high temperature has surpassed 25 degrees Celsius every day over the past week, while nighttime lows have hovered around 15 C.
Those temperatures are about 10 C warmer than normal in September - and the warmer-thanusual weather is expected to last until the end of the month, Environment Canada says.
"Usually in September we will have three or four days of very warm temperatures and very sunny days, but this year it's over a prolonged period - that's what makes it more exceptional," meteorologist Amelie Bertrand told the Montreal Gazette Tuesday.
September has also been dry, with lower than normal rainfall so far, she added.
The last rain fell on Sept. 7. No new temperature records have been set in September, however. "Records in September would be 30 or 31 degrees during the day," she said.
The nice weather should stay beyond the official start of fall on Sept. 22, but expect a turn toward cooler, wetter weather in about 10 days. "We might get our first deep frost in southern Quebec starting in early October so we'll see a change in the pattern," Bertrand said.
"In October, temperatures should be slightly below the average and the same for November." Expect more precipitation, as well.
Montreal's summer began in June with weather that was cooler and wetter than normal, Bertrand said.
"It rebalanced in July and August when we had more normal temperatures and a little bit less rain," she said. "But Montreal did have not any significant heat waves. It was not a very hot and humid summer."
Since summer started June 21, the temperature did not surpass 30 C.
