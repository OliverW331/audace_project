Environment Canada has issued a smog warning for the Montreal area as a record-breaking heat wave enters its sixth and perhaps final day.
The federal agency says high concentrations of ozone are expected and will result in poor air quality with high concentrations of pollutants expected to persist through Thursday evening.
The warning notes that smog particularly affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease, and recommends these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the warning is lifted.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada has maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area and recommends individuals drink six to eight glasses of water par day, avoid alcoholic beverages, take at least one shower or cool bath per day and cool their skin several times per day with wet towels and limit physical activities.
Thursday's forecast calls for a high of 35 degrees Celsius and a humidex of 45 C. There is a risk of thunderstorms Thursday night with clearing expected Friday morning and a forecast high of 23 C with a humidex of 25 C.
