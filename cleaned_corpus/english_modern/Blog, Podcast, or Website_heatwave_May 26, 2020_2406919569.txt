Here's what happened Monday night.
Montreal city council voted to expand Station 9 in Côte-St-Luc, sealing its merger with Station 11 in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Councillors voted 39 to 22 to spend $2.1 million to rent the station on Westminster Ave. from Sept. 1 until Jan. 31, 2027. The 6,000-square-foot station will be enlarged by 2,000 square feet. Opposition members called on the city to put the station merger on hold for one year and refer the issue to Montreal's public security committee. Independent councillor Marvin Rotrand said he was disappointed that the administration has not yet followed up on his suggestion of substituting a mini-station in eastern N.D.G. Loyola councillor Christian Arsenault said the administration demonstrated its open-mindedness by investigating the possibility of a mini-station in N.D.G. If residents are unhappy with the merger after one year, the administration would re-evaluate the situation, he promised.
Montreal is backing down on its plan to close St-Laurent Blvd. to traffic in Little Italy In city council on Monday, Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie Mayor François Croteau promised to respect merchants' wishes after a survey showed local businesses overwhelmingly oppose a proposed bike path on St-Laurent between St-Zotique and Jean-Talon Sts. The path was part of a plan Plante announced 10 days ago to set aside 327 kilometres of space on Montreal streets for pedestrians, cyclists and terrasses. Croteau also walked back an announcement he made last week that the borough would transform the stretch of St-Laurent into a car-free "transit mall" this summer.
