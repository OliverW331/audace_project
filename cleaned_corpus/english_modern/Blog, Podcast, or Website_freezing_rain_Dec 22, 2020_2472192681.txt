Environment Canada is forecasting a "rainy and windy" Christmas that will see anywhere from 20 to 50 millimetres of rain that will then freeze and render local roads and highways slippery.
In a special weather statement issued at 5 a.m. Tuesday for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Ch√¢teauguay - La Prairie, the federal agency notes that starting "Christmas Eve, a strong southerly flow will bring mild temperatures, sustained winds and rainfall over the whole province. These conditions will spread from west to east until Christmas day. Areas north of the St. Lawrence River will receive the most significant amounts of rain."
That rain may cause flash floods and pooling on roads, the statement warns.
On Christmas Day, the temperature is expected to drop below the freezing mark and a transition from rain to snow may cause icy road conditions.
The forecast high for Thursday, Dec. 24 is 9 C. while that for Christmas Day is 12 C.
The temperature will then drop to a high of -3 C. on Dec. 26 with a mix of sun and cloud.
