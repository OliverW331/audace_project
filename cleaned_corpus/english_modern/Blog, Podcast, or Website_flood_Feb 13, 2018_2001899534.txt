Despite repeated claims by the Quebec government that it has tried to fast-track compensation claims by those who suffered damage or displacement by last year's spring floods( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ), less than 10 per cent of the more than 1,000 claims made in the Montreal area have been successfully completed, the Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec charged on Tuesday.
Armed with numbers provided by access to information requests, CAQ MNA Sylvie D'Amours issued a statement contending that as of Jan. 18 of this year, only 89 of the 1,026 claims filed in the wake of floods in April and May of last year had actually been closed.
D'Amours, who saw much of her riding of Mirabel swamped by floodwaters, described the success rate as evidence that the Liberals had mismanaged the post-flood relief effort.( http://montrealgazette.com/news/our-patience-has-run-out-quebec-flood-victims-feel-abandoned-by-government ) "How can (Premier) Philippe Couillard tolerate that families ... are still being crushed by Liberal paperwork and bureaucracy nearly a year after the flood?" she wrote.
The CAQ is demanding that Couillard immediately facilitate the claims process in Montreal to allow families to begin or finish repairing the damage to their homes.
