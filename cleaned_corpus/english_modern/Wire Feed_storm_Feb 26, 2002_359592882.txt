MONTREAL (CP) - Hardline Quebec separatist Yves Michaud has filed a defamation suit against the Montreal Gazette and political columnist Don Macpherson about a column involving comments Michaud made about the Holocaust and Jews.
Michaud is suing over a column by Macpherson last December in which he criticized Quebec Premier Bernard Landry for appearing at a sovereigntist rally attended by Michaud.
Michaud had created a storm of controversy after he made comments to a legislature committee, calling B'nai Brith an anti-Quebec organization and saying that Jews believed they were the only people who had ever suffered.
Michaud, who has denied that his comments were hateful, is seeking $100,000 damages from the Gazette, claiming that the column contained "untrue and defamatory allegations" that damaged his reputation, dignity and honour.
Gazette lawyer Mark Bantey said the newspaper will fight the accusations.
"It's a question of fair comment," Bantey said.
The Quebec legislature censured Michaud the day after he made the remarks. He has petitioned the legislature to reverse the motion of censure against him. Michaud later withdrew his candidacy for the Parti Quebecois in the Montreal riding of Mercier.
Then-premier Lucien Bouchard referred to the remarks as one of the reasons he quit politics last year.
Michaud has previously filed suits against two other men who criticized him for the remarks.
Michaud is seeking $15,000 in damages from university professor Marc Angenot for comments he made about Michaud on a television program.
Last August, Michaud filed a $95,000 suit against journalist Robert Levesque and publisher Communication Gratte-Ciel.
