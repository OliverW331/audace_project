It's a bitterly cold rain, and more than 35,000 Montreal homes and businesses were without power Thursday afternoon as a fall storm tried to shake a few more leaves from the trees.
Power outages were reported( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#map ) in western and central Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and in Côte-St-Luc, Verdun, Hampstead, Montreal West, Pointe-aux-Trembles, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Pierrefonds, Dorval, Candiac and Brossard. Close to 2,000 were blacked out in Dollard-des-Ormeaux and Beaconsfield. There were outages in Laval as well.
As of 2 p.m. more than 106,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without electricity across the province. Hydro said nearly 200 teams had been dispatched to trouble spots. While most people should have their power back by the end of the day, Hydro said that customers in more remote areas or where there was more damage may only get their electricity back on Friday.
Much of southern Quebec remained under a rainfall warning issued by Environment Canada. It has increased its forecast rainfall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/an-intense-rainstorm-is-brewing-over-montreal-environment-canada-warns ) to between 50 to 80 millimetres by Thursday evening. The rain Thursday morning was being propelled by high wind gusts that snapped branches off trees and in some cases sent debris from home fronts out into the street.

Montreal police and the Sûreté du Québec were reporting no accidents or damage reports in connection with the rainfall.
Heavy downpours can cause pooling on roads and hydroplaning - take it slow out there, and if you're driving, leave lots of room between you and the car ahead of you.
The rain will continue till early Friday morning, according to Environment Canada, and Friday should be cloudy with a high around 8 degrees Celsius. The weekend is expected to be sunny with temperatures ranging around 10 to 12 C.
Elsewhere in Quebec, the low pressure system plowing through the province is being monitored as a possible risk for storm surges and coastal erosion on Thursday, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada.
The areas at risk have been identified as Rimouski, Mont-Joli, Matane, Gaspé, Percé, New-Carlisle and Chandler.
In Quebec City, a wind warning has been issued with gusts expected to reach 90 km./hr.
