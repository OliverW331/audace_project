Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning of a mixed bag of precipitation( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#101738801593906667201911160504ws1070cwul ) over southern Quebec starting Sunday, including freezing rain by Monday afternoon.
The warning for the areas in and around Ch√¢teauguay-La Prairie, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and the island of Montreal blames the incoming heavy weather on a low-pressure system tracking up from the U.S. eastern seaboard starting Sunday. Freezing rain is expected Monday afternoon or evening, changing to snow overnight.
"Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant over several areas Monday and make roads and other surfaces very slippery," the statement read, adding, "The exact track of this system remains uncertain, which may influence areas at risk. Further details will be provided in future forecasts."
