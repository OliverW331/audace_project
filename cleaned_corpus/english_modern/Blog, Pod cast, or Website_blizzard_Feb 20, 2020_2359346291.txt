The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.
