Re: "Lure passengers with better service" (Letters, Jan. 23) It is time that public investment brought transport into the 21st century to alleviate the use of cars.
While letter-writer Raymond Graham lives in the West Island, I'm in Rivière-des-Prairies in the east end. As an avid Concordia Stingers supporter, I travel frequently from home to the Loyola campus in N.D.G. from September to March. The trip takes at least one hour and 45 minutes each way with the use of a bus, the métro and another bus.
It seems to me that the coming REM light-rail network is good for commuters in the West Island and north and south shores, but what about the east end of the island? Mayor Valérie Plante's proposed Pink Line is a good solution, but she makes the mistake of stopping it in Montreal North. It should continue at least to the west end of R.D.P.
Then again, the powers in Quebec City might be more agreeable if this line went farther to off-island communities to the east, such as Repentigny.
Then they could muster even more votes from those ridings.
Mind you, they seem to be focused on a tramway that would go from Pointeaux-Trembles to downtown - something I cannot wrap my head around given the freezing rain and increasingly erratic weather we've been seeing. Jim Cartier, Rivière-des-Prairies
