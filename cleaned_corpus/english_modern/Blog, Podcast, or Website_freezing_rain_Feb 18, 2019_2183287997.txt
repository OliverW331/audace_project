After a weekend of roof collapses( https://montrealgazette.com/?s=collapse ) and a month of seesaw weather that has seen heavy snowfalls followed by bouts of freezing rain, thaws and flash freezes, the Quebec minister responsible for building safety is reminding property owners of the importance of clearing snow from their roofs.
"We can never repeat too often that an owner is responsible for the safety of those who live in or use their buildings," said Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, who is also responsible for the province's Régie du bâtiment du Québec. "So it's essential to remain vigilant for the warning signs that could be precursors to the collapse of a roof."

Those signs could include cracks appearing in walls, doors that don't open properly and sagging or other deformations in ceilings.
Laforest also recommends that building owners make a point of ensuring snow has also been removed from balconies and temporary car shelters and that, when necessary, the job be done by specialists who have the proper equipment to carry out the job.
