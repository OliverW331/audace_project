Yet another heat wave is expected to wash over Montreal this weekend.
In a special weather warning issued Friday afternoon, Environment Canada said highs will be near 30 degrees Celsius during the day with humidex values ranging from 35 to 39 on Saturday and possibly exceeding 40 on Sunday.
The warning covers the Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and Longueuil areas. The heat could last until Monday.
The agency is asking people to reschedule outdoor activities and to visit loved ones suffering from a loss of autonomy throughout the weekend to ensure they're staying cool and hydrated.
