At least the daytime part of Saturday is looking pretty good - unless you are elderly or asthmatic or suffering from heart disease, in which case the continuing smog alert will make the whole day thoroughly unpleasant and you should stay indoors.
Environment Canada, which issued the smog warning Friday that was expected to extend into Saturday, said wood heating in winter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-wood-burning-ban-starts-oct-1-what-you-need-to-know ) is the main source of the particles, "more than industrial activities and transportation."
Also issued Friday was a weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) warning of freezing rain later in the day, which we can blame on a Colorado low. That freezing rain is expected to change to rain, but that switch could cause icy patches, so be cautious on the streets and sidewalks.
During the day, there will be a mix of sun and cloud and a high of 2 C. An east wind will pick up around midnight making the -1 C feel like -7 C.
Early next week, the federal meteorological agency expects temperatures around 5 C and more rain. If all goes according to plan, we should see the sun again by Tuesday.
