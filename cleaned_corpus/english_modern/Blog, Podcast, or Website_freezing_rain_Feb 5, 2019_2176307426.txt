Montreal's respite from harsh winter weather is proving to be shortlived.
Environment Canada has issued a flash freeze warning for the areas of Montreal, Longueuil, Chateauguay and Laval.
"Temperatures are forecast to fall rapidly," the government agency warns. "Ponding water, slush, and any falling precipitation will freeze as the temperature drops."
After a warm morning, where roads and sidewalks began to thaw as temperatures climbed above zero, there's plenty of water and slush to freeze over.
The temperature in Montreal is expected to dip below zero in mid-afternoon on its way to a nighttime low of minus 12 degrees Celsius.
