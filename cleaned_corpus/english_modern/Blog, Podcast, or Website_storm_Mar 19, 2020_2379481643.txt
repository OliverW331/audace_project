Emergency room overcrowding across Quebec has plunged as people stay home in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/covid-19-first-death-reported-in-quebec ) and as hospitals cancel non-essential appointments and reduce other clinical activities.
It's perhaps the only silver lining in a public health system that is struggling to prevent the spread of the rogue coronavirus and that is bracing for an influx of COVID-19 patients.
On Thursday morning, the Lakeshore General Hospital was reporting an ER occupancy rate of 65 per cent( https://www.indexsante.ca/urgences/ ), compared with rates routinely soaring above 200 per cent( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-are-urged-to-avoid-citys-ers ) in January. It was the same story at the Jewish General Hospital, which reported that it was filled to less than 50 per cent of its capacity.
"ERs like mine have very very low counts," a nurse at the Lakeshore in Pointe-Claire told the Montreal Gazette.
"The reason is simple: people are scared to go out, much less, to the ER."
However, the nurse - who agreed to comment on the ER stats on condition of anonymity - warned that this might very well turn out to be like the calm before the storm.
"Because primary care is so poor in this city, this will only go on for a little while longer. Then, whoever will no longer be able to put off the abdominal pain, cough, minor foot infection or whatever because he/she will be too sick, into the ER they will come, likely in droves.
"Combined with those patients will be all the people who were not tested for COVID-19 who should have been," the nurse added. "Many will be positive because the virus is (likely) spreading within the community."
The nurse expressed concern about the capacity of ERs to treat patients who might be suffering from the most severe complications of COVID-19.
"These patients will have pneumonia-like symptoms and some will be in respiratory distress. The combination of both sets of patients - those with ailments other than COVID-19 who are too scared to come in now and those sick with the virus - will put ERs into a terrible situation. Forced overtime will be instituted, many nurses will be sick with the virus and all the flaws in our already fragile health-care system will be exposed.
"I do hope I am wrong but I just cannot see this going any other way," the nurse concluded.
Hospitals like the Jewish General are preparing for a potential wave of COVID-19 patients by cutting back on some clinical activities. The Côte-des-Neiges( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jewish-general-hospital-braces-for-a-wave-of-covid-19-cases ) as one of four COVID-19 treatment centres in the province.
"Non-essential outpatient appointments at the JGH are being postponed," confirmed Glenn J. Nashen, a spokesperson for the centre-west health authority in charge of the Jewish General.
"Calls are being made by staff to advise those patients affected by these postponements. Patients needing ongoing care and those with emergencies are being seen."
Across Montreal, overall ER occupancy stood at 70 per cent early Thursday morning. In contrast, ER overcrowding surged in Montreal's two psychiatric hospitals, the Douglas and the Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal, which both reported rates of 150 per cent.
