Montreal will slither, splash and slide into the first full week of February with a Monday that already has seen a freezing rain warning and freezing drizzle advisory, and forecast temperatures that vary from 5 C on Tuesday to -11 C on Saturday.
Monday's freezing rain warning notes that two to five millimetres of ice are expected locally, while regions in the Ottawa Valley and regions north of the St. Lawrence River between Lachute and Quebec City could receive more than 10 millimetres of freezing rain.
A low-pressure system tracking across Quebec Monday and Tuesday is to blame, and its precipitation will begin as snow Monday morning in western Quebec and then quickly change to freezing rain. It is expected to spread toward regions of central Quebec later in the day. Eastern Quebec will see snow changing to freezing rain overnight from Monday to Tuesday.
Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
Meanwhile, freezing drizzle is expected to persist throughout the Montreal area for most of Monday, adding to the general weather malaise.
Tuesday, however, is expected to see sunny skies and a forecast high of 5 C - eight degrees warmer than on Monday. But on Wednesday the temperature tumbles to a high of -7 C, with light snow, before spiking to zero on a cloudy Thursday, nudging up to 2 C on Friday with rain showers and then, just in time for the weekend, plummeting to -11 on Saturday.
