"You might think I'm lying ..."
Sam Smith( http://samsmithworld.com/ ) has a showman's smile, but it's an honest smile. So when the English pop/soul powerhouse told his Bell Centre audience Tuesday that his 2015 performance at the venue( http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/words-and-music/concert-review-sam-smith-stays-true-to-himself ) was "the best show I've ever done in my life," you were inclined to believe him even before his pre-emptive protest. This is someone who can exclaim "this room is f-ing huge" with believable wonderment even when his itinerary is packed with f-ing huge rooms. Because it's just not possible to fake the enthusiasm Smith brought to every song, monologue and arena-sweeping wave in his crowd-pleasing return engagement.
Crowd-pleasing, but not pandering. This was as classy and subtle as arena pop blowouts get, with Smith's whisper-to-falsetto swoop and conversational cheer the central attractions. His crack band was tightly rehearsed but let the arrangements breathe, in contrast to a sometimes overbearingly slick presentation at that 2015 show. And big-budget set pieces were mostly limited to the artful triangular stage and a geometric backdrop that separated and blossomed. Even when confetti fell for the climactic and characteristically controlled Stay With Me, it was more of a dusting than a blizzard.
Smith's arrival itself was quiet, the star appearing seated without fanfare in near silhouette as cathedral choristers gave gravitas to Burning. He quickly shook off the heartache, his face lighting up for One Last Song's street-corner soul and the buoyant I'm Not the Only One. The latter's striking a cappella intro was equalled by an uncommonly delicate piano-and-voice ramp-up to Lay Me Down; both numbers sparked joyous sing-alongs that elevated the performances without drowning them out.
Smith's warmth ensured that he sang to everyone at all times, even though the innovative stage design meant he had his back to a good chunk of the audience at any given point. His interactions with the backup singers and musicians managed to look both choreographed and spontaneous; when he talked about all the work and the joy that went into the show, you believed him.
Pigeonholed as a wounded romantic, Smith offered more variety than he gets credit for. The backdrop turned neon to match Omen's clubland pulse, before Nirvana's gospel uplift and the unapologetically bombastic 007 theme Writing's on the Wall. Latch was stripped and slowed down; Money on My Mind escalated from a gentle guitar backing to dance-floor release. (It says something about the eclectic arrangements that country-pop singer Cam's engaging support set didn't seem incongruous.) One of the few constants was Smith's steadfast smile.
The "love is love" anthem Him was a resonant showstopper, the black-and-white screens smashing to colour as Smith waved a rainbow flag to what may have been the loudest cheer of the night, at least until Too Good at Goodbyes closed the main set with the crowd picking up the vulnerable heaven-bound chorus.
"You've done it - this is better than last time," Smith proclaimed before he exited the way he entered. And once again, you believed him.
