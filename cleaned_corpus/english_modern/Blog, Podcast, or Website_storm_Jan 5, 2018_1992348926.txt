Power was restored Friday to all but a handful of customers in the Montreal area, according to the utility.
The outages were reported overnight. For estimated times of reconnection, clients can download the Hydro app or go to hydroquebec.com( http://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/#map ).
The Bas-Saint-Laurent region was also hit, with 600 customers still in the dark Friday afternoon. More than 450 were without power in the Quebec City region but all were reconnected by Friday afternoon.
Meanwhile in the Maritimes, tens of thousands of people were waking up in the dark Friday morning after a ferocious storm blasted through Atlantic Canada, flooding coastal roads, battering sailboats and downing trees with hurricane-force winds.
Nova Scotia Power says 125,000 customers were without electricity in an area that stretched from one end of the province to the other after winds gusting to 140 kilometres an hour whipped through the region late Thursday and into Friday.
In New Brunswick, more than 130 outages were affecting 11,000 customers throughout the province that was also hit with heavy snowfall, while P.E.I. was also largely in the dark.
The Canadian Press contributed to this report.
