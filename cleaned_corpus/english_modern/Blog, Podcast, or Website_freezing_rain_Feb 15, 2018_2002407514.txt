The good news is that temperatures are forecast to remain above zero today.
Things, may however, be messy in the morning, when Environment Canada is predicting periods of rain and possibly even some freezing rain to go with a daytime high of six degrees.
More rain is forecast for late in the evening, when the low will be six degrees.

Quote of the day:
Bicycling is a big part of the future. It has to be. There's something wrong with a society that drives a car to workout in a gym.
