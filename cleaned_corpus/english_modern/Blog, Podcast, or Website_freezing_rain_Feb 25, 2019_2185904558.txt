A week after a pair of roof collapses prompted Quebec's minister responsible for building safety to warn owners to regularly clear ice and snow off the tops of their properties, four more collapses late Sunday have added more urgency to her message.
At least four roof collapses occurred north of Montreal between late Sunday and early Monday - two in Terrebonne, where the roofs of a supermarket and a garage collapsed because of the weight of ice and snow, as well as incidents in Joliette and St-Jérôme, where a television screen factory in the former locality and a warehouse in the latter were shut down when their roofs collapsed.
There were no injuries reported in any of the incidents, which occurred at the end of a day that saw the Montreal area swept by flurries, rain, freezing rain and ice pellets.
Last Monday, Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest, who is also responsible for the province's Régie du bâtiment du Québec, reminded building owners of their responsibilities and of the urgency of ensuring snow and ice did not accumulate on the roofs of balconies of their properties.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-reminds-building-owners-to-clear-the-snow-from-roofs-balconies ) That appeal followed a roof collapse at an empty commercial building in Trois-Rivières and in a grocery in Lévis that left two people slightly injured.
Quebec's association of fire prevention technicians is warning that the presence of heavy snowfall in the east of the province and that of rain on top of the snow that has fallen in its western sector has increased the threat of roof collapses across Quebec.
