A winter storm that will dump at least 30 centimetres of snow is expected to break over Quebec beginning Saturday, and the wallop is expected to be particularly brutal along the St. Lawrence Valley.
In its weather forecast posted Tuesday night, the MétéoMédia weather network predicts 40 cm of snow will fall on Montreal and Quebec City by Sunday, while nearly 50 cm will accumulate farther east.
MétéoMédia warns also that the snowfall could be accompanied by high winds that would create blizzard conditions. And temperatures are expected to remain frigid, staying well below minus-10 Celsius.
The closest the forecast gets to a silver lining is the prediction that should the storm front sweep through the province a little farther to the south, the minimum accumulation of snow would be 20 cm rather than 30.
Environment Canada, meanwhile, is forecasting snow for the region late Saturday and on Sunday with a predicted high of minus-13 Celsius.
The federal agency's forecast for Wednesday calls for flurries ending in the afternoon and then clearing. However, its forecast for the evening predicts temperatures will plummet from minus-9 C to minus-22 C with a windchill of minus-32 C.
