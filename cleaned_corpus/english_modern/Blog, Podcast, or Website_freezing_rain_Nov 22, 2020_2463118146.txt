Montreal will get five to seven centimetres of snow starting Sunday at 6 p.m. the Environment Canada weather office says. But the white stuff probably won't stick around, since rain is expected Monday.
Sunday's snowfall will amount to close to five centimetres on the South Shore, and between five and 10 centimetres north of Montreal, said meteorologist Maxime Perron.
"This is pretty normal for this time of year," said Perron, who noted that the first major snowfall usually arrives in mid- to late November.
"We're right in the climatological normal," he said.
Temperatures will hover around zero overnight in Montreal, when the snow will turn to freezing rain or rain.
Monday's forecast calls for rain ending early in the afternoon, with a high of plus 4, falling to 2 in the afternoon.
The recent weeks saw an unusually warm spell, but the trend is back to normal temperatures now, so we're not likely to see another stretch of warm weather before winter sets in, Perron said.
According to the long-term outlook for the coming winter, there's a 55-per-cent chance Montreal will have slightly warmer temperatures than usual, with a normal amount of precipitation, he said. To calculate that outlook, weather experts look at global patterns to come up with a statistical probability. However, the results are far from certain.
"It's slightly better than a coin toss," Perron said.
