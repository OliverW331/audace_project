A combination of wind and slow but steady freezing rain left about 300,000 Hydro-Québec customers without electricity on Monday evening.
As of 8 p.m., the hardest hit was the Laurentides region with close to 94,000 clients off the grid, while power was out for just over 20,000 customers on the island of Montreal.
There were about 90,000 homes in the Lanaudières region, just northeast of the island, still without power on Monday night. Meanwhile, Laval had more than 80,000 businesses and homes without electricity as of 8 p.m.
South of the island, the Montérégie region had 12,000 clients affected by the blackout.
While Montreal Island outages were to be repaired by late afternoon, Hydro-Québec could only assure customers in Laval and the Laurentians that repair crews were on route and would try to re-establish power as quickly as possible.
