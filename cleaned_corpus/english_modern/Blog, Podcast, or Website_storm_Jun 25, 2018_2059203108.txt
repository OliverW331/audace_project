Cam Hillis( http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectdetail.htm?cat=1&dpid=112011&sort=finalRank&year=2018 ) had plenty to celebrate on his 18th birthday Sunday after the Canadiens selected him in the third round of the NHL Draft.
"It's very special to have this dream come true," Hillis told reporters in Dallas after being drafted on Saturday.
When it was pointed out to Hillis by a reporter that he will now be of legal drinking age in Quebec when the Canadiens open their four-day evaluation camp Thursday in Brossard, Hillis smiled and said: "Yeah, that's true."
La Belle Province is familiar territory to Hillis since his family has a condo in Mont Tremblant, which they visit at least once a year. The Oshawa, Ont., native also speaks some French after going through a French-immersion program in school.
"It's a surreal feeling," he said about being drafted by the Canadiens. "You dream of this as a kid and to kind of finally experience it with friends and family it's second to none. You can't really describe it."
In 60 games with the OHL's Guelph Storm last season, Hillis posted 20-39-59 totals. He was ranked No. 67 among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting.
Hillis and the 10 other players selected by the Canadiens at the NHL Draft in Dallas will take part in the team's evaluation camp this week. Canadiens assistant general manager Trevor Timmins described Hillis as "the little engine that never stops." But Hillis, a centre who is listed at 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds, will have to make that engine bigger before he's ready to play in the NHL.
"I think maybe I can put on a couple of more inches and I definitely got to fill out a little more if I want to play at that next level," Hillis said.
"I rely on my hockey sense and my compete level every night, seeing the ice and making those little plays because I'm not the biggest player out there," he added. "I kind of have to think the game a little faster and play a lot harder. So that's definitely something I use to my advantage."
Said Timmins about Hillis: "This kid's driven. He has outstanding VO2. He never stops. ... He was a pure rookie in the OHL this year and ended up being the first-line centre for that Guelph team, who had a number of NHL drafted players on it. Made it to the Canadian national under-18 team at the end of the year. But he's a kid that never stops and he's got good hockey sense, so that's a good combination."

Before joining the Storm, Hillis played for St. Andrews College - a private prep school in Aurora, Ont. - posting 37-62-99 totals in 73 games during the 2016-17 season. He said the part of his game that needs the most improvement is his skating.
"I've never really worked with a skating coach before and I'll be working with (former Canadian Olympic figure-skater) Barb Underhill two or three times a week this summer," Hillis said. "A guy I kind of watch is (the Canadiens') Brendan Gallagher and he's got that breakaway speed. He can kind of push off guys and create that gap for him, so that's definitely something I'm looking to kind of develop down the road. Obviously, I'm not the biggest guy out there so I kind of have to rely on my speed and smarts to play the game. So skating's going to be a huge aspect for me."
Timmins said he sees some similarities between Hillis and Gallagher.
"The way he competes, sure, yeah," the Canadiens' assistant GM said. "I wouldn't say (Hillis) is as physical, but he's as determined as Gallagher is."
Said Hillis about Gallagher: "I love his tenaciousness. That's kind of what I try to bring every night. I try to be the hardest-working player on the night every night. He's definitely a guy that does that, too. I see some similarities in our game. It would be pretty cool to meet the guy down the road."
