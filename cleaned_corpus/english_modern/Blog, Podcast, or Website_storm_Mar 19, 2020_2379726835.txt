The news sent Dennise Ann Del Mundo reeling: She had less than a week to gather her things, leave Concordia University's downtown dormitory and find a new place to live.
It isn't like Del Mundo could just move back in with her parents - they live 10,000 kilometres away in Qatar. So the marketing major scrambled and managed to find accommodations until she can move into a new apartment next month.
Concordia is closing its Grey Nuns residence Sunday in order to minimize students' risk of exposure to the coronavirus( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ). They announced the decision Wednesday afternoon and, according to Del Mundo, it sent a wave of panic through the dormitory, which houses 600 students, many of whom came to Montreal from overseas.
"I had already made arrangements to move out but some people aren't that lucky," said Del Mundo. "It's making a lot of us anxious."
With Montreal's rental vacancy rate below two per cent and most leases not expiring until June 30, this puts international students in a bind. Many come from places in Europe that have been hit hard by the pandemic and, given the risks travel poses, Del Mundo says they may be safer in Quebec.
There are 121 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Quebec and one coronavirus-related death( https://msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/maladies-infectieuses/coronavirus-2019-ncov/#situation-au-quebec ) since the pandemic began. Experts say that number will continue to spike before the effects of social distancing and quarantine are felt.
Dennise Ann Del Mundo outside Grey Nuns on Thursday. She's grateful that she at least has made plans. Fellow students are not so lucky.
Del Mundo says the dormitory has been emptying out since Concordia cancelled classes last Friday in response to government measures to contain the pandemic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/coronavirus-quebec-closes-elementary-high-schools-cegeps-and-universities-for-two-weeks ). With students living, sleeping and eating in close quarters, she says the dorm can be something of a Petri dish at times.
"Even with your basic flu, you see a few people that have it one day and the next it triples," said Del Mundo.
In a statement sent to the Montreal Gazette, Concordia spokesperson Vannina Maestracci said( https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/offices/cco/covid-19/2020/03/18/students-in-resdidence-to-move-out-by-march-22.html ) the university will make exceptions for students in "exceptional circumstances." She called the decision to close Grey Nuns a "precautionary measure to reduce the spread and impact of the virus and to assist national and local efforts to flatten the curve."
The university said it will refund students the balance of their rent and meal plans.
After being contacted by students facing eviction, university president Graham said Thursday that not a single student will be left behind.
"Concordia will support any student who has nowhere to go to the best of our abilities by providing them with accommodation, meals and other services until conditions improve," Graham said.
There are about 100 students remaining at Grey Nuns, according to Del Mundo.
"It's an old, creepy building that used to be a convent so it feels a little bit haunted," she said.
As they await the Sunday deadlines, staff at Grey Nuns residence are dealing with and tightening quarantine measures. Cafeteria visits are staggered, students eat on paper plates using disposable utensils and sit alone at tables. A major common space in the complex has been shut down.
McGill University, for its part, has decided to keep its dormitories open but is "strongly encouraging" residents to return home, according to spokesperson Cynthia Lee. For those who remain, measures are in place to ensure they adhere to strict social distancing protocols.
Both Concordia and McGill won't require students to be physically on campus for the remainder of the winter 2020 term.
At Université du Québec à Montréal, administrators met Thursday to discuss how students can finish their term without being penalized by the pandemic( http://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2020/mesures-interimaires-encadrement-activites-academiques ). Deadlines for any papers, projects or theses due have been put on hold until at least Friday at UQAM.
The office of international students at Université de Montréal has been working with students since Tuesday on deciding - on a case-by-case basis - whether they should return home for the rest of the semester. Classes will resume online beginning Saturday.
The school has a web page (urgence.umontreal.ca) set up to exclusively deal with COVID-19 news.( https://urgence.umontreal.ca/ )
