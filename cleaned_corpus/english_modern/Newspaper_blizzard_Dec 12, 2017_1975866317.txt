Only in Quebec could a transport department hold the citizens of its major metropolis captive for years while it complacently goes about its highway reconstruction program with seemingly incompetent remedial measures and no sense of urgency.
At best, its "mitigating alternatives" will serve only to reroute traffic to already heavily congested streets and neighbourhoods.
Remember, this is the same department whose "expertise" over the years has allowed the de la Concorde overpass collapse in Laval, the paralume collapse in the Viger Tunnel of the Ville Marie Expressway and, more recently, the unwanted "free overnight parking" fiasco on Highway 13 during a blizzard.
And yet, the provincial government - regardless of which party is in power - seems content to sit idly by while this seemingly untouchable lumbering beast goes about its business at taxpayers' expense.
Let's be honest: No commercial business would survive for long if it conducted itself with the lethargy, disdain and apathy with which Transport Quebec treats its clients - us.
Clearly, a housecleaning is needed. I wonder if anybody within the government has the temerity to act.
