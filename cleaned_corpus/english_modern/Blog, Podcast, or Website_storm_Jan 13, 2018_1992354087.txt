Also: Snow, snow and more snow
To get through flu season, Quebec is spending $23.25 million to open 350 additional beds in Montreal and on the North and South Shores( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/barrette-pays-premium-to-add-more-beds-for-quebecs-flu-season ). Health Minister Gaétan Barrette announced the measure on Friday. The places, mostly in the private sector, will allow emergency rooms to clear short-term beds for patients who have already been seen by a doctor but are still there because of a lack of room elsewhere at the hospital. The new spots will accept patients who need care that's less intensive than that offered in a hospital.
Montreal has been blanketed by yet another winter storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/here-we-go-again-montreal-blanketed-by-another-winter-storm ). It snowed overnight and with snowfall expected to continue into the afternoon the accumulation could end up in the range of 20 to 30 centimetres. Urgences-Santé is "strongly recommending" that residents of Montreal and Laval stay home this weekend. Reduced visibility has been reported on several sections of highways 20, 40 and 10. The SQ reports that a number of cars slipped off roads overnight, but no serious injuries were reported.
The African group of ambassadors to the United Nations has issued an extraordinary statement condemning the "outrageous, racist and xenophobic remarks" by President Donald Trump and demanding a retraction and apology. The African ambassadors issued the statement late Friday following an emergency meeting after Trump used vulgar language to reject an immigration bill, asking why the U.S. would take in more people from Haiti and "shithole countries" in Africa. Trump has denied using that language but others present say he did. The new statement expresses concern over the Trump administration's apparent increasing denigration of Africa "and people of colour."
Whoa. I've never seen a statement like this by African countries directed at the United States. After an emergency mtng today @UN( https://twitter.com/UN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ), Africa group says it "is extremely appalled at...outrageous & xenophobic remarks" attributed to Trump & "demands a retraction and an apology." pic.twitter.com/5KkdwppUzL( https://t.co/5KkdwppUzL )

Here's an unusual way to fight off the cold. A British butcher who got locked in a freezer says he was saved by a frozen sausage that he used as a battering ram. Chris McCabe says he became trapped in the walk-in freezer at his shop in Totnes, southwest England, when wind blew the door shut. The safety button to open the door had frozen in the -20 chill. McCabe said he tried unsuccessfully to kick the button free before picking up a 1.5 kilogram (3.3 pound) black pudding, a form of blood sausage. He whacked the button with the sausage until it came unstuck. The grateful butcher told the Daily Mirror: "Black pudding saved my life, without a doubt."
