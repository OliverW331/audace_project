Environment Canada on Thursday issued a winter storm warning for the Montreal area that forecast as much as 45 centimetres of snow for the region by Friday evening.
The warning, issued at 5:01 a.m., predicts that "a first snowfall will give five to 10 centimetres before the snow weakens (Thursday) afternoon. The snow will redevelop again tonight and will be very heavy until late day Friday."
The warning goes on to say that a further "25 to 35 centimetres of snow are expected Friday" and suggests that those in the region "consider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve."
Thursday's forecast for the Montreal area calls for a high of minus 6 Celsius and a windchill of minus 14.
