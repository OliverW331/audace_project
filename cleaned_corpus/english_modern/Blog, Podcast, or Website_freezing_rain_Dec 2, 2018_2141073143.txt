Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/this-weekends-freezing-rain-isnt-done-yet-environment-canada-warns ) posted a freezing rain warning for Montreal and much of Quebec on Sunday.
Freezing rain across southwestern Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) in the morning will spread to central parts of the province in the afternoon. The affected areas include Greater Montreal, the Laurentians, Abitibi, Eastern Townships, South Shore to the U.S. border, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Drummondville and central Quebec.
Between two and five millimetres of freezing precipitation is expected in those regions, reaching up to 10 millimetres in some areas north of the St. Lawrence River.
Drivers are urged to avoid unnecessary trips, and to adjust their driving to road conditions( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/road-conditions ). Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.
Freezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.
