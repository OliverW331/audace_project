A heat warning was issued by Environment Canada early Thursday morning for the Montreal area and much of southern Quebec.
Just before noon, the meteorological agency added a severe thunderstorm watch.
Temperatures in the Montreal area hit 30 degrees Celsius on Thursday with humidex values up to 37. The next few days will feature heat in the high 20s and low 30s.
During the heat wave in June, officials offered advice including: - Drink six to eight glasses of water per day. - Avoid alcohol.
When possible, spend at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places. - Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool skin several times per day with wet towels. - Limit physical activities. - Wear light clothes.
The city of Montreal has an interactive map (bit.ly/3dPVkGN) showing pools and air-conditioned spaces that are open and subject to physical-distancing measures.
The hottest spot in Canada Thursday was Toronto at 31.7 C, and it was a cool 1.6 C at Nakiska Ridgetop, Alta. Postmedia News
