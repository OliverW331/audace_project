A news article by John Meagher, Pointe-Claire heritage society, city argue over windmill restoration( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-heritage-society-city-argue-over-windmill-restoration ); Montreal Gazette; Nov. 20, 2019, inspires a few analogies:
For one, there is the notion of a Mexican stand-off where three gunslingers (The city, the "hysterical" society and the Catholic Church) are floating in the doldrums over who reattaches the municipally symbolic windmill's fallen wings( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claires-signature-windmill-badly-damaged-by-storm ). On a more spiritual stretch, I liken it to the son and father and Holy Ghost not coming to a lasting agreement.
On to a literary simile: As many literate people will note (so that excludes tedious trolls), the expression "chasing a windmill" refers to the book Don Quixote, where the main character - a daffy sort - attacks a windmill thinking it is a giant; it means chasing something that isn't there. Okay, I only used this example because it has a windmill in it, but the thing that isn't there is the solution to the problem (which I have.)
Back up (beep-beep-beep): I used to live in LaSalle, a long time ago, very close to the stone windmill that is also that town's logo. The windmill has always been in beautiful shape. LaSalle no doubt appreciates the importance of constantly maintaining its symbol (unlike the water tower( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/schukov-10-things-to-do-with-an-abandoned-water-tower ) in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue which stood rotting for too long, before finally being beautified.) Only difference between the two aforesaid wind-cranked logos is that Pointe-Claire doesn't own theirs. On the surface, one can sympathize with two of the participants in this surmountable technicality: Pointe-Claire and the associated heritage society. They both want it fixed but the actual owner is the slum landlord who won't repair the leaky faucet, much less quick to agree to do so. (Whatever happened to a bit of house pride?)
Yeah, yeah - the Pointe-Claire windmill is located on church-owned land, and the city is in talks with the diocese to make repairs (You wonder just how fast things get done in this regard dealing with a church overseer.) Understandably, heritage people are frustrated by the inaction to date. Although the windmill is on property of St-Joachim Parish, the La Pointe area on Pointe-Claire has heritage protection. So, the Pointe-Claire Heritage Preservation Society( https://patrimoinepointeclaire.org/ ) maintains the city is responsible for restoring the windmill irrespective of parish ownership (Blah blah blah.)
But there is an obvious solution: The church should donate the windmill to the city in good faith (Pardon the pun.) Which brings me to yet another simile: 'It's better to give than to receive' is from the Bible, Acts 20:35 (King James Version.) Again, why can't the church donate it to the city? God knows (pardon the pun) the church is not adverse to the concept of accepting donations and isn't it better to give than receive? Wow, this has such a jagged angle to it, it borders on hypocrisy. Personally, I think if the church cannot extend itself, Pointe-Claire should get another logo. Maybe we should telex the Pope.
Hockey analogy: Reminds me of CBC not wanting to spend extra money on their signature Hockey Night in Canada theme song( https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/tsn-has-no-plans-to-give-up-rights-to-theme-made-famous-by-hockey-night-in-canada ), so CTV/TSN bought it and CBC got a new tune. Problem solved.
