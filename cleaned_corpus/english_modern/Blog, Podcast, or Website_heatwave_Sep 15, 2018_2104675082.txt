Almost 1,000 people are expected to take to the streets Saturday afternoon in Montreal to press political leaders to put the environment at the centre of their electoral platforms, and develop carbon reduction strategies - now.
Under the heading "The Planet Joins the Campaign,"( https://www.facebook.com/events/264044397570388/ ) demonstrators will meet at the Montreal Science Centre at the Old Port at 2 p.m. and make their way to Mont Royal Park at the corner of Duluth and Parc Avenues.
Citing ever more alarming statistics about the local effects of climate change - eight heat waves this summer, responsible for causing 90 deaths in Quebec - organizers want the political parties to "finally acknowledge that the climate is the foremost challenge of our time" and to commit to establishing a carbon budget that would allow Quebec to reach its own emissions reduction targets: 20% below the 1990 level by 2020, and 37.5% by 2030.
Speakers expected to take the microphone at the demonstration include former Québec Solidaire leader Françoise David, Charles Ste-Marie, of the Conseil central du Montréal métropolitain, and Laure Waridel, a co-founder of Équiterre.
"We ask that the political parties present a coherent environmental program, because now more than ever, our planet needs coherence," organizers wrote.
