Our family has been discussing the report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and our grandparents reminded us of the rapid, huge industrial changes during the Second World War in order to defeat the Nazi war machine. The IPCC report and Paris accord make it clear that our generation is facing a threat to our planet greater than any in history. By the time we are 35, or sooner, unless we make sacrifices the way our grandparents did and reduce greenhouse gases, scientists from around the world tell us the climate crisis will have reached catastrophic levels.
What can we do? Nobel Prize winner William Nordhaus calls for carbon taxes worldwide. That is possible, in the same way that the world adopted the Montreal protocol to save humanity from a depleted ozone layer several decades ago. Similarly, we can drastically cut greenhouse emissions.
We know we can fight climate change because more than 2,000 people have visited our grandparents' off-grid house, where we've learned about the huge economic potential of solar, wind and sustainable buildings. Canada can be a leader in saving our world and future generations from the worst of the coming heat waves, floods and other catastrophes by developing fossil-fuel alternatives. If our leaders won't act, we young people can start a global tsunami of youth activism via the internet to rescue our future from them.
