As Quebec deals with more flooding, memories of 2017's catastrophic floods have galvanized support among West Island residents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flooding-residents ). From donating drinks and food to knocking on doors to make sure elderly and vulnerable residents have flood protections in place, hundreds of volunteers are pitching in to help their neighbours. "It's really heart-warming to see everybody turning out to lend their support to people who need it," said Rachel Shizgal, 50, of Dollard des Ormeaux. The floods of two years ago remain seared into residents' memories, she said. Vicky Belisle, 72, went out to check on her neighbours. Two years ago, she recalled, bags for filling with sand were in short supply. "People were fighting over bags. People were using pillow cases (as sand bags)," she said. Over the last week, Shizgal said, there have been plenty of sand bags to go around. Of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough, she said "you can't fault them this time.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he wants all public infrastructure of his city fed by "zero-emission Canadian hydroelectricity"( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/new-york-city-mayor-wants-a-contract-with-hydro-quebec-by-next-year ) and he wants a deal signed by 2020. Quebec Premier François Legault hailed the announcement on Twitter.( https://twitter.com/francoislegault/status/1120416464681492480 ) "Wow!," Legault said. "Hydro-Québec could become the green battery of northeast of America." Hydro-Québec said it would be "happy to engage in discussions with New York City" to firm up the Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line project, which would have a capacity of eight terawatt-hours of electricity. Cables would be buried under ground and under water for more than 530 kilometres. The project has been on the table for at least 10 years. The original plan was to start construction in 2018 and have the network live in 2021.
WOW! Le maire de New-York annonce la relance des négociations avec Hydro-Québec.
Hydro-Québec peut devenir la batterie verte du nord-est de l'Amérique. https://t.co/OnMP9y7Vjf( https://t.co/OnMP9y7Vjf )

It wasn't a routine day for a sheriff's officer after she spotted a donkey meandering along Interstate 90 near Chicago. Video( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5O0z8bn-l4 ) from a body camera taken Wednesday shows the bewildered Cook County officer radioing: "There's a donkey in the middle of I-90." The officer then ordered the donkey to "come here, sweetie." She asked a motorist to stand with the donkey while she could figure out what to do. The officer also asked the donkey where it was from. It turns out the animal's name was Dusty, who was eventually returned to its owner.
