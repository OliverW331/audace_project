Montreal appears to be in the clear as the snowstorm affecting eastern North America is expected to merely sideswipe the city.
Between five and 10 centimetres of snow are predicted to fall in Montreal Thursday night into Friday - no where near the major snowfall expected in the east of the province.
The Gasp√© Peninsula is expecting as much as 50 centimetres of snow starting Thursday, as the area is affected by a storm that has been called a bomb cyclone, which will also hit the Maritimes.
Areas along the coast of the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and throughout the Maritimes are under a storm surge warning, as heavy winds are expected to kick up intense waves.
While Montreal will be relatively unscathed by major precipitation, driving could be difficult as high winds are forecast throughout the weekend.

Travellers to and from Montreal could experience hardships, as the storm that hit most of the U.S. Northeast - it snowed even in parts of Florida - caused some flight cancellations at Trudeau airport( http://www.admtl.com/fr/vols/arrivees ) on Thursday.
The weekend will see a return of extreme cold temperatures, with a high of -17 Celsius expected on Friday, a high of -22 C on Saturday, and back to -17 C on Sunday.
Temperatures are expected to return to near-seasonal norms on Monday, with a high of -3 C and five to 10 centimetres of snow.
