Some Quebec rivers overflowed Friday, notably in the Beauce and Gaspé regions.
In Ste-Marie-de-Beauce, the Chaudière River is overflowing, forcing 19 people to leave their homes. About 100 houses have been isolated, and 250 homes have had to pump water, according to Urgence Québec.
The municipality opened a relief centre for flood victims, Mayor Gaétan Vachon said.
Citizens can check water levels in their areas by going to the civil security department's Vigilance site, at geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/( http://geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/ ).
