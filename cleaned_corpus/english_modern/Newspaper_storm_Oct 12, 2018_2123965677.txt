The global warming crowd blames climate change for the devastating tornado that struck the Ottawa area on Sept. 21, 2018.
Politicians have been leading proponents of that contention.
According to the Montreal Gazette, the mayor of Gatineau claims the tornado was caused by climate change. Other politicians echoed that belief.
But, weather history muddies that argument. Particularly illuminating is recent Russian-published research that shows the Northern Hemisphere has been cooling since 2013 and that recent extreme weather events are unrelated to the ongoing warming in the Southern Hemisphere.
According to the U.S.-based National Climate Data Center, Canada's first recorded tornado occurred near Niagara Falls in June 1792, in a climate interval (A.D. 1650-1850) so cold it was called the 'Little Ice Age'. Forbes.com confirms that Canada experienced exceptionally cold conditions virtually throughout those 200 years: Rocky Mountain glaciers expanded and the Great Lakes had unusually expansive ice cover.
Within that cold period were three significant Ontario tornadoes in 1829 (Guelph, Collingwood and Galt): the latter resulted in Ontario's first tornado-caused human fatality.
A very severe F4 tornado touched down near Elora, Ont. in 1884, and an 1888 tornado near Cornwall claimed three lives. In 1898, nine people died and dozens were injured in a tornado near St. Catharines.
On June 20, 1912, a major F4 tornado killed 24 people and injured over 300 near Regina, Sask., and two years later, a powerful tornado blew a freight train off its tracks near Medicine Hat, AB.
Multiple tornadoes in southern Manitoba in June 1922 killed five people and injured hundreds. In 1935, a deadly F4 tornado struck Benson, SK and five days later, an F3 tornado devastated Smiley, SK.
Closer to home, on May 4, 1953, an F4 tornado killed seven people, injured 40 and destroyed over 500 homes at Windsor, Ont. Aug. 20, 1974, nine people died and many were injured at Windsor due to an F3 tornado. In Aug. 1979, an F4 tornado struck Woodstock, killing two, injuring 150 and destroying 480 homes.
In 1980, there were 47 tornadoes recorded in Canada: 24 in Ontario. Between 2001 and 2004, there were 32 Canadian tornadoes, including an F1 tornado near Ottawa. In 2005, F2 tornadoes struck Fergus, Elmira, Salem and Guelph.
Between 2009 and 2013, there were 205 tornadoes recorded in Canada, almost half in Ontario. Between 2014 and 2017, there were 209 tornadoes recorded in Canada; 71 in Ontario.
Almost unbelievable wind speeds have been confirmed for some Canadian tornadoes. In June 2007, in Manitoba, a twister had wind speeds of up to 510 km/h.
Environment Canada researchers stress that tornadoes are weather phenomena generated by local storm conditions. Shifts in the Jet Stream are contributing factors.
