Loud cracks of thunder might have woken you up before your alarm Monday as a storm front pushed through the Montreal area.
Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch, warning of the possibility of "strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain." The watch also covers Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and the Longueuil-Varennes areas.
We should see up to 25 millimetres of rain, and it's going to be hot - at least 30 degrees Celsius with a humidex that's promising to hit 38C.
