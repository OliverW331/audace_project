Montreal public health authorities say they're better prepared to handle a potentially deadly heat wave this summer than the one last year that was blamed for the deaths of 66 people, 13 more than the initial tally.( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/heat-wave-death-toll-reaches-53-in-montreal-but-could-get-higher )
"I think we've improved our interventions and our capacity to work together," Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of the public health department, told a news conference Wednesday following the release of an exhaustive report on last summer's heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/at-least-15-montrealers-transported-to-hospital-for-heat-related-injuries-urgences-sante ).
Drouin acknowledged that it will always "be difficult to have zero deaths associated with heat waves," but authorities have learned a great deal from last summer's experience. The biggest lesson learned is the need to set up a detailed registry that will show neighbourhoods and homes that are at the highest risk.
Contrary to some news media accounts( https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2018/07/04/des-conditions-execrables-denoncees-a-sacre-coeur ) last summer that focused on heat-related deaths in hospitals and long-term care centres, the report( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/news/news/extreme-heat-66-deaths-in-montreal-in-2018/ ) found that 80 per cent of the victims died at home.
Researchers discovered that two-thirds of the deaths occurred in so-called heat islands - neighbourhoods with few trees to provide shade. For example, the heat-related mortality rate was 1.2 per 100,000 residents in leafy Notre-Dame-de-Grâce compared with 5.8 in the largely concrete-and-brick environment of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
In the event of a heat wave this summer, the Montreal Fire Department and police officers would visit properties that the registry indicates are at high risk of being affected by heat waves, including rooming houses and private seniors' residences. The public health department also plans to work with community groups to reach out to people who live with mental illness.
"Low income and social isolation are also important risk factors during heat waves," Drouin said, adding that authorities can expect more heat waves as a result of climate change.
Last summer's heat wave lasted from June 30 to July 5, and at one point there were so many deaths that the city's morgue was filled to capacity( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-morgue-filled-to-capacity-due-to-heat-related-deaths ). Still, the mortality rate overall was lower than a heat wave in 2010.
Of those who died during the 2018 heat wave, 72 per cent suffered from chronic diseases and 66 per cent were at least 65 years old. What's more, a disproportionately high number of those who died - 25 per cent - lived with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
The registry is expected to be completed by next month. It will combine data from the city's housing department with a heat map of Montreal Island as well as the input of the city's first responders.
Last summer, firefighters and police conducted 42,000 door-to-door visits. Louise Desrosiers, prevention section chief of the fire department, said firefighters can recommend during visits that the owners of rooming houses install air conditioning for their tenants.
The city of Montreal would also be ready to install temporary vegetation on some building walls and in other areas that are prone to high temperatures, said city councillor Laurence Lavigne-Lalonde, a member of the executive committee who is in charge of the environment portfolio.
"I think it's a global responsibility to take real and strong action regarding a city that is greener and better adapted to fight against heat waves," Lavigne-Lalonde added, noting that the city will spend $16 million this year to plant trees that will also absorb the heat.
The report warned that summer temperatures will rise by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius in Montreal and Laval in the coming decades. During last summer's heat wave, the maximum temperature soared to 35.5 degrees.
