Nothing arouses Montrealers' indignation quite like debates over their beloved mountain.
Nothing, that is, except debates over their beloved cars.
Put the two together and you have a nearly 26,000-name petition( https://www.change.org/p/val%C3%A9rie-plante-non-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ), a 7,000-name counter-petition( https://www.change.org/p/oui-%C3%A0-l-interdiction-de-traverser-le-mont-royal-en-voiture ) and a whole lot of grumbling against Mayor Valérie Plante's fourth-month-old administration.
Controversy has been raging ever since Feb. 6, when Luc Ferrandez, the member of the city's executive committee responsible for large parks, announced a pilot project( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-green-less-cars-on-mount-royal-says-plante-administration ) to eliminate through traffic on Mount Royal starting this spring.
Will the shutdown split the mountain in two, as opponents claim?
Or is it the road itself, opened in 1958, that divides the mountain, creating danger and pollution for walkers and cyclists, as supporters say?
It all depends on how you look at transportation on Mount Royal - a topic that has been polarizing citizens since the horse-and-buggy era.

While most Montrealers would agree that the mountain is the city's most priceless treasure, they have a long history of arguing over how to get there. From calèches to a funicular (a railway for steep slopes), and from streetcars to automobiles, each new mode of transportation on the mountain has sparked heated debates.
And somehow, those disputes always seem to ignite underlying tensions - whether it's between rich and poor, west and east, French and English, cyclists and drivers, or urbanites and suburbanites.
"The tone is so strident," says Daniel Chartier, a landscape architect who retired from the city of Montreal in 2014, after 37 years.
"People have stopped listening to each other, even though there are many things they can agree on. I read the comments on social media, and people are saying stupid things," said Chartier, who was responsible for Mount Royal from 1991 to 2014.
"What worries me is that people will say: 'No, no, no, we want things to stay the same. But they need to change," he said.
The death of 18-year-old cyclist Clément Ouimet, who was hit by a car on Camillien-Houde Way last October, spurred calls to make the mountain safer for bikes and pedestrians.
Numerous studies, including a report by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in 2008, have called for the drastic reduction or elimination of cars on Mount Royal.
New York City recently permanently banned cars in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, after a pilot project over the summer, following years of partial bans.
"Restoring Prospect Park as a car-free oasis will improve the lives of the millions who use this park today and of generations to come," New York mayor Bill de Blasio said in October.
But the consensus reached in Brooklyn seems to elude Montreal.
The guiding principle in decisions on the park should be "the quality of the experience" for park-goers, said Chartier, an expert on Frederick Law Olmsted - who designed both Mount Royal and Prospect Parks.
Considered the father of American landscape architecture, Olmsted designed many urban parks across North America, including New York's Central Park and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, mostly working with a senior partner, Calvert Vaux.

Rather than taking the quickest route to the top of Mount Royal, Olmsted's design called for the main carriage road in the park to ascend gradually, allowing visitors to experience the transition from pastoral fields, to forest, to rugged mountaintop, noted Chartier, a trustee of the National Association for Olmsted Parks.
Olmsted said footpaths and roads should be screened from each other by shrubbery, to preserve the sense of being surrounded by nature.
"It's not a wild nature. It's a nature that's been beautified by human hands, but subtly," Chartier said.
For the first half-century of the Mount Royal Park's existence, Montrealers wrangled over whether streetcars should be allowed to intrude on what Olmsted called the "poetic charm" of the mountain.
East-end politicians said the lack of public transit excluded the working masses, who couldn't afford to hire a horse-drawn cab - the main means of transportation in the park.
But self-appointed defenders like the Parks' Protective Association (later the Montreal Parks and Playgrounds Association), opposed streetcars, saying they would disfigure the mountain and lead to other forms of commercialization. Streetcars won out when tracks were laid from Côte des Neiges Rd. in 1924 and from Park Ave. in 1930.
The rise of car culture in the 1950s prompted schemes by Mayor Jean Drapeau's administration to "improve" Mount Royal by adding a divided freeway, giant tower, outdoor auditorium, museum and bus station. Most of those projects were never built.
"There is plenty of natural beauty in the Laurentians. We don't need it in the centre of a big city," Paul Lambert, a prominent architect and member of Drapeau's Civic Action League, said in 1960.

Cars were finally allowed on the mountain in 1958, when the city built Camillien-Houde Way along the former streetcar route, blasting the former tunnel to create an open-air drive.
Gazette reader Mrs. H. Wyatt Johnston was among those who protested in a letter to the editor( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Fr8DH2VBP9sC&dat=19581013&printsec=frontpage&hl=en ) against "the idea of injecting this horror into Montreal's last refuge."
Despite the bitter battles over Mount Royal, the good news is that the park is still intact, with many of the original features Olmsted designed, Chartier said.
"The lesson of history, I would say, is that people say the mountain has been incredibly attacked. But it's not true. If you look at the size of Mount Royal Park today, it's actually larger than Olmsted's project," he said.

Timeline of different modes of transportation on Mount Royal
1845: On Jan. 11, 1845, 11 prominent businessmen with villas on Mount Royal petition unsuccessfully for a boulevard on the mountain, near present-day Pine Ave. They present a second petition in 1851. But the proposal is dropped, except in Westmount, where The Boulevard is built in 1880.
1852: Mount Royal Cemetery, a scenic nature park for the dead, opens on the Outremont side of the mountain. Taking a carriage drive out to the rural cemetery, just over three kilometres from the city, becomes a popular activity for tourists. The creation of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery follows three years later.
1862: On Nov. 10, Major Alexander Stevenson orders his militia to drag four cannons up to the summit of Mount Royal to fire a salute for the 21st birthday of the Prince of Wales.
Stevenson, an alderman, has been lobbying the city to turn the mountain into a park, but critics say the land is too steep. So Stevenson orders his troops up the hill to prove that it is accessible. The next year, he repeats the feat.
1863: The city sets up a subcommittee on the proposed park.
1864: A report on the proposed park is submitted to city council.
1869: The city borrows $350,000 to acquire land for the park.
1872: On March 2, citizens hold an "indignation meeting" after a landowner cuts timber on 40 to 50 acres of the mountain. The controversy spurs backers of the park to redouble their efforts.
1876: Mount Royal Park opens. But critics complain that without some form of public transportation, it is not accessible to the working masses.
1885: Construction of a funicular (incline railway) from Park Ave. to the summit. "A very great convenience has been provided for the class of Montrealers to whom cheap pleasures are a necessity," says the reform-minded Montreal Herald.
1895: A proposal by the Montreal Street Railway for a streetcar on the mountain begins 35 years of controversy. The next year, the tram company withdraws the proposal in response to public criticism.
1911-1918: The Canadian Northern Railway tunnels under Mount Royal. Even though promoters launch a real-estate venture, the Town of Mount Royal, to offset the costs of the project, the tunnel pushes the railway into insolvency.
Funicular on Mount Royal Park. It once cost a nickel to ride to the top of the funicular, which was declared unsafe in 1918.
1918: The funicular is discontinued because of safety concerns.
1924: Streetcars go into service on the mountain after tracks are laid from Côte-des-Neiges Rd. to the Smith House via Remembrance Rd. (then called Shakespeare Rd.).
1930: Streetcar service from the Park Ave. side begins, following construction of a tunnel in the steep terrain.
Streetcar emerges from tunnel on Mount Royal in 1933.
1958: Cars are finally allowed on the mountain with the construction of the Camillien-Houde Parkway, designed by American landscape architects Clarke & Rapuano. The new road follows the former streetcar tracks.
The same year, the city inaugurates The Tempest, a miniature train on rubber wheels operating on weekends during the summer between Beaver Lake and the Chalet. It runs until the 1980s.
1961: The Park/Pine interchange is inaugurated.
1990: A plan to eliminate car traffic on Mount Royal is withdrawn amid controversy, after a front-page article in the Montreal Gazette.
2005: After decades of pressure from community groups, the Park/Pine interchange is demolished.
2008: The Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) recommends traffic-calming measures on Camillien-Houde as "the first step in a strategy aiming to completely eliminate through-traffic on Mount Royal."
It also recommends the city hold a pilot project to eliminate through-traffic on the mountain.
