Quebec is providing $12.7 million over three years for climate change research through the Ouranos consortium.
The announcement was made Monday by three Couillard government ministers in the offices of Ouranos in downtown Montreal.
The funding is intended to finance applied research projects on how best to adapt to climate change.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough, Ouranos officials said.
They added we must also find ways to live with the effect of climate change on our infrastructure, agriculture and economic development.
"Science makes it clear that greenhouse gas reduction must remain strong, but it will only partially reduce the magnitude of the impacts of climate change," said Alain Bourque, general manager of Ouranos.
With the financial support received, Ouranos will be able to carry out some of the work that was already in the planning stage, such as mapping the risks of forest fires in mid-northern Quebec with forestry partners.
During the holiday season, the Gaspe Peninsula was hit by severe weather that took away or damaged several infrastructures, said David Heurtel, Quebec minister of sustainable development, environment and climate change.
"Ouranos has been talking about this risk for some years now. And it is through this work, these studies, these analyses, that when these events occurred we were able to react quickly and say that we are already at work to find solutions," Heurtel said.
"Clearly, on the public safety side, it's the mission of the department to ensure that our communities are resilient to these changes, which pose issues of civil security in particular," said Martin Coiteux, Quebec minister of municipal affairs and public safety.
