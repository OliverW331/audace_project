Re: "Stranding on Highway 13 'unacceptable': Coderre" (Montreal Gazette, March 16) Too often I wake up to a headline from a far away place about an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster, with devastating consequences for the population there.
Within hours, we start to see news reports about the rescue efforts, the lives saved, the volunteers who arrived to lend a hand, the pledges of international aid - all this often in geographic areas where there is little or no infrastructure. Then came the headline about hundreds of motorists stranded overnight on Highway 13. I am beyond angry that this could have happened here. Did the mayor put in a call to the minister of transport, or were both their cellphones turned off? Do we not have an islandwide disaster plan? A spokesperson for the Surete du Quebec is quoted as saying "at the end of the day, it wasn't a tragic event because everyone was safe for the whole event." Safe? The transport ministry has been riddled with problems for years. I hope there will be more than finger-pointing coming out of the external investigation ordered by Premier Philippe Couillard.
