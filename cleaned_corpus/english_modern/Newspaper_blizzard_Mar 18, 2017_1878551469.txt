A 73-year-old woman died Friday morning after being struck by a snow-removal vehicle in a St-Michel supermarket parking lot.
According to Montreal police, the woman was walking in the parking lot around 10:40 a.m., near the intersection of Jarry St. and Pie-IX Blvd., when the vehicle struck her.
She was brought to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
The driver, a 48-year-old man, was treated for what police described as a violent nervous shock.
The Montreal police force's collision squad is investigating to determine the cause and circumstances of the death. The incident comes midway through a massive snow-clearing operation following a blizzard that left about 40 cm of snow on Montreal.
