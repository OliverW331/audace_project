At least 15 Montrealers had to be hospitalized Sunday due to the extreme heat according to Urgences-Santé.
Jean-François Coornaert, a spokesperson for the organization, said that they transported several people to hospital who were suffering from heat stroke. He said that most of those cases weren't serious and were the result of people over-exerting themselves outside.
Urgences-Santé is expecting the number of heat stroke cases to increase over the next few days.
"We're preparing for more," Coornaert said. "There's emergency plans that are going to be put in place to deal with the heat."
Coornaert said that mitigation plans for the heat will likely be issued by municipal authorities in the coming days. On June 29, the city of Montreal announced that municipal pools would stay open late during the heatwave( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ). The city also encouraged residents to drink lots of water and to avoid outdoor physical activity.
Temperatures got up to 33 C Sunday but felt more like 44 C with the humidity factored in, making it the hottest day of the year.
But the heat isn't record breaking: in 1931, temperatures reached 36 C on Canada Day, according to Environment Canada archives.
Montrealers can expect even hotter weather in the coming week. Temperatures are set to climb as high as 34 C Monday, 32 C Tuesday and 35 C on Wednesday and Thursday according to Environment Canada.
Friday the mercury is still expected to hover in the low thirties, but the agency is forecasting a relatively frigid 27 C for Saturday.
