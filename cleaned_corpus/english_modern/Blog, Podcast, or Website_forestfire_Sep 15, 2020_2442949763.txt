Tuesday's Environment Canada weather forecast for the Montreal area called for sunny skies with clouds expected to move in later in the day. However, the overcast that placed a shadow over the city beginning Tuesday morning doesn't mean the federal agency was wrong.
The dull yellowish grey pall that covered the Montreal area was, in fact, wildfire smoke blown across most of the North American continent from burning forests in British Columbia and the western United States.
Environment Canada announced on its Twitter account Tuesday morning that "smoke coming from the fires in the western part of the continent is visible this morning in the sky for southern Quebec. This smoke is too high in the atmosphere to affect the quality of the air we breathe, but it makes the sky greyer."
The smoke has been drifting eastward from B.C. for the past five days.
