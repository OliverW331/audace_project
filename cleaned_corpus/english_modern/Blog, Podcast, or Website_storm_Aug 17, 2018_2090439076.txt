The city will be investing $7.6 million to purchase and renovate the 61 units in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and 90 in Rosemont. It will also offer a subsidy and interest-free loans to non-profits Habitations communautaires Olympia and Habitations du trentaine de la Société d'habitation populaire de l'Est de Montréal, who will be overseeing the projects. The Fonds d'investissement de Montréal, led by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert, will also be collaborating on the project.
This funding model is a pilot project that will allow Montreal to study how to best proceed with future affordable housing programs, the city says.
McGill and MUHC given $500,000 for cannabis, cancer research projects( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgill-and-muhc-given-500000-for-cannabis-cancer-research-projects )
McGill University and the McGill University Health Centre have received $500,000 for two international research projects.
Announced Thursday, the funding is to be shared between two projects at the MUHC Research Institute. Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, a mental health researcher and expert in mood disorders, will look at the pharmacological properties of cannabidiol, an active chemical of cannabis, and its ability to reduce the anxiety and depression that's often associated with chronic pain. Dr. Pnina Brodt, a cancer researcher whose work focuses on the biology of cancer metastasis, will look for a new treatment of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer.
Brodt and Gobbi's laboratories are aiming to start clinical studies.
The projects are to be carried out in collaboration with university laboratory researchers in Canada, France, Israel and Italy.
McGill's funding is part of the Quebec government's research initiative plan, Stratégie québécoise de la recherche et de l'innovation 2017-2022 - Oser innover.( https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/objectifs/informer/recherche-et-innovation/strategie-quebecoise-de-la-recherche-et-de-linnovation/page/strategies-22541/?no_cache=1&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5Bmode%5D=single&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5BbackPid%5D=21871&tx_igaffichagepages_pi1%5BcurrentCat%5D=&cHash=b807607612a4dc8a18e052b985532619 )
Far-right group leader's court appearance postponed in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/far-right-group-leaders-court-appearance-postponed-in-montreal )
A leader of the far-right group Atalante Québec arrested for storming Vice's Montreal offices in May( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-called-after-members-of-far-right-group-storm-into-vices-office ) saw his court appearance postponed on Thursday.
Raphaël Lévesque, 35, was scheduled to appear at the Montreal courthouse, but his case has now been pushed back to Sept. 28.
He was expected to be formally charged with breaking and entering, mischief, intimidation and threats.
Most of the group's members were wearing masks when they stormed the Vice offices on May 23, but Lévesque was wearing only sunglasses. He was arrested at his home in Quebec City in June.
Several police officers were present outside the courthouse Thursday to keep watch on roughly 20 people protesting against the far-right group.
The protesters distributed flyers titled "Atalante fascists aren't welcome in Montreal (or anywhere else)."
Atalante Québec had planned to have a presence outside the courthouse as well, but it didn't seem to be the case.
