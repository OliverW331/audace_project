Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#201107528424489630202002030504ws1070cwul ) for the Montreal area that warns of the possibility of snow - as much as 15 centimetres of it - on Thursday.
The snow is expected to start falling over southern Quebec Thursday morning and may change to freezing rain in the southern edge of the province Thursday evening before reverting to snow on Friday.
While the statement notes that snowfall accumulation may vary from one region to another, it adds that it "may exceed 15 centimetres over most areas."
As is usual with special weather statements issued by the federal agency, Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/environment-canada ) cautions that "this scenario could change by the time the system arrives, given the uncertainty of its track."
