While thousands of Montrealers are expected to take to the highways and roads Monday night as part of their efforts to welcome 2019, they'll be doing so under conditions that are expected to be potentially hazardous.
Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, with the first precipitation expected early Monday evening and continuing throughout the night.
The federal agency notes that "surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions."
Monday's daytime forecast calls for mainly cloudy skies with a 60 per cent chance of flurries Monday morning and a high of -2 C and a windchill of -11.
On Monday night, snow beginning this evening will change to freezing rain then down to rain before Tuesday morning. About two to four centimetres of precipitation are expected.
