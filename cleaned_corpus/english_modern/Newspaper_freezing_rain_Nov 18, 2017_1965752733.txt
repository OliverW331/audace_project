From September to May, I see cars park on streets near high schools with engines idling for up to an hour before the last bell.
Why are we not ticketing or issuing warnings to these drivers? Turn off your engines, folks. Better yet, put your teenagers on public transit.
Similarly, every morning since September, I see motorists idling for 30 minutes or more before they head out to work. Again, turn those engines off. Please.
We had smog warnings lately with instructions to not use fireplaces.
But in these public announcements, no mention is made of cars needlessly idling all over the city.
According to the City of Montreal, "the bylaw regarding nuisances caused by motor vehicles stipulates that all persons who let their vehicles idle for more than three minutes are subject to a fine."
There are some exceptions, including emergency vehicles and taxis, and "when the outside temperature is below -10 C and it is necessary to warm up the vehicle because someone is inside and "when there is freezing rain or ice on the vehicle and it is necessary to heat it up in order to ensure safe driving."
