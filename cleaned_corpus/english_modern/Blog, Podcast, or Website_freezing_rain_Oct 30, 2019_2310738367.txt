With torrential rain and strong winds forecast for Oct. 31, at least seven Quebec municipalities are asking parents to delay trick-or-treating until Friday.
Saying it would be unsafe for children to be out on slippery streets, the cities of Ste-Julie( https://www.ville.sainte-julie.qc.ca/fr/Nouvelle/990/Sainte-Julie_reporte_la_fete_dHalloween_au_vendredi_1er_novembre_du_aux_mauvaises_conditions_meteo_exceptionnelles_annoncees ), McMasterville, Varennes ,( https://www.ville.varennes.qc.ca/une/20191030-lhalloweenreporteeauvendredi1ernovembreavarennes )Sorel-Tracy( https://www.ville.sorel-tracy.qc.ca/manchettes/4091-passez-l-halloween-en-toute-securite-reporte-au-vendredi-1er-novembre.html ), St-Lambert, Mont-St-Hilaire and St-Colomban are pleading with parents to postpone one of their children's most popular celebrations.
As of 3 p.m., the city of Montreal has not asked residents to postpone Halloween.
But in Ste-Julie, Mayor Suzanne Roy said the exceptional amount of rain forecast, as much as 40 mm, calls for drastic action.
"Taking into account the safety and comfort of the children and adolescents who would be in the streets to collect candy, we have decided to take the exceptional step of postponing (Halloween) until Friday," she said in the statement on the city's website.
"Under normal circumstances, rain would not force us change the date, but the exceptional nature of the rain has pushed us to do it."
In Varennes, several residents said they would prefer to celebrate Halloween on Friday, Mayor Martin Damphousse said.
While some residents of the affected towns welcomed the delay, others said the decision would pose numerous problems for parents.
Apart from breaking the news to excited children counting down the days to Halloween, some parents say they have already made arrangements to take Thursday off work or leave early.
Others said it's ridiculous to postpone the celebration because of rain, saying it has rained often in the past. "We will end up postponing Christmas because there's too much snow," one disgruntled Varennes parent said on Facebook.
Provincial police said officers will patrol the cities and towns they cover on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
"Some parents may choose to go out on Oct 31," said Sgt. Claude Denis of the Sûreté du Québec.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could be significant rainfall in more southern regions of the province and snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upward of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 C, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, St-Félicien and Roberval at Lac-St-Jean.
