Montreal woke up Wednesday to a just-below-seasonal-average of 13 degrees Celsius yet a frost advisory on the horizon.
Environment Canada warns that the Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay and Longueuil areas can expect temperatures to drop to near or below the freezing mark overnight. The agency issues frost advisories when the cold might lead to damage of plants and crops. Overnight temperatures the rest of the week will hover between 4 and 12 C, with rain expected Thursday and Sunday nights.
For vulnerable plants, a light nighttime cover that allows air to circulate, such as frost cloths, straw or evergreen branches can help retain some warmth.
