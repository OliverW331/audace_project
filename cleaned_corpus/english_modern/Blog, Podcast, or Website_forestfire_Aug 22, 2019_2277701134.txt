Jason Kenny
"(Jason Kenny's) spiel makes the noted Conservative in Alberta sound an awful lot like a Quebec Liberal of yore. This probably isn't a coincidence. In invoking separation, and positioning himself as the last bulwark against it, Kenney has glommed onto one of the oldest hustles in the country - one that has served Quebec mightily for decades. His timing is characteristically impeccable; with Quebec's separatist threat on the wane, the country suddenly lacks a serious existential threat. The question is: can it work for Alberta as it did so well for Quebec?"
