The bitter cold has finally loosened its grip, and Montrealers are able to breathe a little easier Wednesday, the first full day without an extreme weather warning from Environment Canada since Dec. 27.
The national weather service lifted an extreme cold warning early Tuesday afternoon as about five centimetres of snow started to fall on the Montreal region.
Flurries and light snow will continue until at least Friday, according to Environment Canada, which says we can expect highs of minus-9 Celsius Wednesday and Thursday. Friday will dip to minus-15 C.
The forecast isn't as rosy for the rest of the province. Much of southeastern Quebec is under a winter storm watch that begins near Rivi√®re-du-Loup and stretches into the Maritimes. The watch warns of heavy snow, high winds and possible flooding.
