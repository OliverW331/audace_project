Stifling heat is likely to effect Canada Day activities, according to Environment Canada.
The agency issued a special weather statement Wednesday morning for the greater Montreal area, saying rain showers this evening and Thursday are expected to clear by the weekend as a warm and humid air mass moves into the province.
Temperatures are forecast to hit 27 degrees Celsius Wednesday with increasing cloudiness. The UV index is 8 - very high.
The heat wave will last into next week. Daytime highs are expected to hit 30 to 35 degrees and might feel like 40 due to humidity. The weather statement covers most of southern Quebec as well as parts of Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I.
The agency said that heat warnings may be issued for the weekend.
