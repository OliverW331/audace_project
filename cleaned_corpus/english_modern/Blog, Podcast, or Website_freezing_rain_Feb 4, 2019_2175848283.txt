Freezing rain and icy road conditions are affecting our ability to deliver the print edition of the Montreal Gazette on Monday.
Some deliveries may be up to three hours late, and some subscribers on the South Shore will receive the Monday edition with their Tuesday newspaper.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Our readers are invited to access the electronic (e-paper) edition, which is a complete replica of the print edition, by going to montrealgazette.com/epaper.( https://montrealgazette.com/epaper )
