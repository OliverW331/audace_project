Freezing rain and icy roads caused the delay of dozens of flights at Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport on Tuesday, while driving some vehicles off highways in the Montreal area.
Environment Canada issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal at 3:35 p.m. The federal agency predicted that freezing rain would turn to snow later in the evening.
The forecast for Wednesday calls for about 2 centimetres of snow, with winds gusting up to 70 kilometres an hour in the afternoon.
Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau, of the Surete du Quebec, said that several cars slid off Highways 40 and 30, but there were no major accidents.
Meanwhile, the Aeroports de Montreal reported that more than three dozen flight arrivals were delayed at Trudeau airport. A dozen scheduled departures were also delayed, and there were a couple of cancellations. Postmedia News
