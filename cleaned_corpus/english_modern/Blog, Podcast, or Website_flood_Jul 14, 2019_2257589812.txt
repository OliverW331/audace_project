Remember the song?
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?
It was a top 40 (Why was it always 40 and not a nice round 50?) hit in 1971 by a Canadian( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada ) rock( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music ) group Five Man Electrical Band( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Man_Electrical_Band ). Seems, in Quebec, tolerance for expressive signage (advertising or not) has gone the way of religious symbols. Actually, in this kitchen-cooking province (last I checked, it was not a sovereign state but acts like one) of Canada where the pot continues to over-boil, tolerance is at a premium. As news bits on signage go, Seinfeld might say, "That's a giant matzo ball out there."
Chumming for trolls, I submit two recent West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/category/news/local-news/west-island-gazette ) stories:
The Hub Hardware store in Beaconsfield runs afoul of sign bylaw:
The iconic store in Beaurepaire Village removed a 71-year-old store sign after contravening a (2012) city bylaw; John Meagher, West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/the-hub-hardware-store-in-beaconsfield-runs-afoul-of-sign-bylaw ); June 12, 2019. Quote: Local businesses are allowed two exterior signs, and The Hub had exceeded the limit with seven:
What difference does any number of signs make? It's called ADVERTISING. The whole anal argument stems from the default insistence of "maintaining the character of the village." Grabbing that donkey tail, I wonder, how many bill boards on our highways is not too much and how does even one Godzillian Buffalo jeans sign off Highway 20 maintain the character of a ...uh... road? And by the way, a 71-year-old sign IS part of the village's character. (Whereas it's okay to have Coke and Pepsi flashed everywhere.)
Homestyle Bakery owner in legal spat with city of Beaconsfield:
Bob Simotas, outside his bakery and pub, said the city of Beaconsfield informed him that some of his signs don't comply with certain bylaws.
Quote: Owner says doing business in Beaconsfield is frustrating because he is often embroiled in legal snafus with city officials. John Meagher, West Island Gazette( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/homestyle-bakery-owner-in-legal-spat-with-city-of-beaconsfield ); June 26, 2019.
It would seem this sort of West Island by-law takes its zero-wiggle-room cue from the OFL.
I don't know if any other municipalities have any signage bylaws with anything that smells as bad as that of Beaconistan's but doesn't its City Hall have bigger fish to fry? (Maybe, on all counts, but doing research beyond shovelling my two cents - which today is rounded off to zilch - makes my head hurt.) I know Pointe-Claire doesn't mind you putting out a sign like a For Sale or a welcome flag as long as you pay them a permit fee. (Do Halloween and Christmas decorations count as signs if they have words on them? And as a tax bonus is there any carbon footprint associated with any of this?)
As for the fiefdom of B, I ask, "How many signs (including events mini-posters) is it okay to post on the front window of a d√©panneur? Some of them look more decorated than a Mexican bus.
People for the most part have accepted the whole ridiculous government affliction with squashing the human right to post self-expression (commercial or not.) In fact, Quebec is still a laughing point to outsiders when it comes to Bill 101, a law that says you can't use one of Canada's two official languages (if some Canadian tax payer wishes to do so) on a sign. Last I checked, Quebec is still part of We the North. So to those lawmakers both big and small (minded), when it comes to the quality and quantity of signage: Grow up.
(This space reserved for trolls and Beaconistan legislators.)
