4:30 p.m. Face coverings now required on flights in Canada
Transport Canada announced Friday those still taking flights in the country will be required to wear face coverings while travelling.
The new measure will come into effect on April 20.
In a statement, the federal government said travellers will be asked to cover their mouth and nose at Canadian airport screening checkpoints, when they cannot physically distance from others, or as directed by the airline employees.
"Aviation passengers on all flights departing or arriving at Canadian airports will also be required to demonstrate they have the necessary non-medical mask or face covering during the boarding process otherwise they will not be allowed to continue on their journey," the statement said.

4:30 p.m. Montreal widens sidewalks to facilitate social distancing
As part of its efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the City of Montreal is adding several "sanitary corridors" to widen sidewalks so pedestrians can pass each other while maintaining a safe distance.
The 4.5-metre-wide corridors, which close off part of the street next to sidewalks, were first tested in the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough with the installation of metal fences over Easter weekend.
In the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, they will be added on these streets:
Monkland Ave. between Draper and Girouard Aves.
Côte-des-Neiges Rd. between Jean-Brillant St. and Queen-Mary Rd.
Queen-Mary Rd. between Westbury and Clanranald Aves.
"I encourage everyone to stay home," borough mayor Sue Montgomery said in a statement. "However, going for a walk is good for our health. I am happy to allow pedestrians to enjoy beautiful spring days while maintaining a safe distance."

2:00 p.m. Situation at the Herron is under control as investigations continue, McCann says
Despite 31 seniors dying at the residence in the last month, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said Friday the situation is "under control" at Dorval's CHSLD Résidence Herron.
The regional health authority (CIUSSS) took over the residence on March 29 after staff reportedly deserted the nursing home en masse in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have since launched investigations into what went wrong.
But McCann said Friday the situation has much improved since the health authority took over, despite a Montreal Gazette investigation showing( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/records-reveal-chaos-in-the-days-before-staff-abandoned-the-herron/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1587131893 ) that many of the 31 deaths took place after March 29.
"The situation is under control right now. The CIUSSS has provided a lot of staff and is organizing all the work," McCann said.
McCann said she also requested a "special inspector" review the situation and report back to her in coming weeks.
"We know there are three investigations," she added, "so we will wait for the results of those investigations and take all the measures we need to take."
1:30 p.m. 'I am taking full responsibility' for not increasing orderlies' wages, Legault says
Quebec Premier François Legault said Friday he takes responsibility for how ill-equipped the province's long-term care centres were to handle the coronavirus crisis.
Legault said he now feels his government should have increased orderlies' salaries long ago, helping with the chronic understaffing that's plagued the centres for years and left them vulnerable during the pandemic.
"I admit it, and I am taking full responsibility," he said. "If I had to do it again, I would have increased the (orderlies') salaries earlier, even without the unions' agreement.
"We entered this crisis ill-equipped."
But Legault said his government is now in a "problem-solving" mode and looking forward, not back at what could have been done. He said it's not time to argue over salaries but rather the time to focus on saving as many lives as possible.
"We are getting more staff in the residences," he said. "We're going through a tough situation but doing everything we can to take care of our elderly."

11:15 a.m. Armed Forces with medical training will aid CHSLDs in Quebec, Trudeau says
The federal government is sending members of the Canadian Armed Forces to help in Quebec's beleaguered long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday.
The centres, known as CHSLDs, are at the heart of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec - 70 per cent of the provinces COVID-19 deaths have occurred in the homes.
Roughly 125 members with medical training will be sent to Quebec.
"We will continue to work with the government of Quebec to find other ways to help them," Trudeau said during his daily briefing Friday. That could include help from the Canadian Red Cross and specialized volunteers registered with Health Canada, he added.
Quebec had made the request for help on Wednesday, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent in to help the centre's overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Trudeau said Thursday the federal government was evaluating the request but needed time to decide how it could best help. The Armed Forces are usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he said, so the request was "somewhat different."
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already made two requests for members of the Armed Forces to be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord. Both were approved.
10:15 a.m. Records reveal chaos in the days before staff abandoned the Herron
As authorities continue to investigate the CHSLD Résidence Herron, the Montreal Gazette has obtained the complete records of all those who died at the Dorval long-term care centre from the beginning of March until the first two weeks it was placed under trusteeship.
The records provide new glimpses into the chaotic hours at the Herron before the staff deserted the nursing home en masse on March 29 in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak.

9:00 a.m. Application filed for class-action lawsuit against CHSLD Herron
An application to launch a class-action lawsuit against the Herron long-term care residence has been filed.
The application, which was filed at the Montreal courthouse on Thursday, alleges "inhumane and degrading maltreatment" as a result of the residence's failure to ensure continued and adequate care.
The lead plaintiff is Barbara Schneider, whose mother, Mary Schneider, died at Résidence Herron on April 10 after contracting COVID-19.
The Quebec coroner, the Montreal police and the health ministry have launched investigations into 31 deaths at the residence in less than a month.
