A rise in pedestrian fatalities was among the most worrisome trends Montreal Police( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/montreal-police ) faced last year, chief Sylvain Caron said Tuesday while unveiling the force's annual report for 2018.
Eighteen pedestrians were killed in traffic on the island of Montreal, up by nearly 17 per cent from 15 in 2017, the report reveals. Most of the victims were over 65.
Caron said the city's Vision Zero strategy to reduce traffic deaths and injuries( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-will-vision-zero-pledge-bring-attitude-adjustment ), announced in March, should help to reduce pedestrian deaths( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-five-pedestrian-deaths-in-four-months-in-montreal-is-an-outrage ). The vulnerability of elderly pedestrians is a major concern, he noted.
Another 87 pedestrians were seriously injured in 2018, up by 14 per cent from 78 in 2017. A total of 1,169 pedestrians suffered minor injuries, about the same as the previous year.
Three cyclists were killed in 2018, compared to four in 2017, while 20 were seriously injured, down from 32 in 2017, and 587 suffered minor injuries, down from 657.
There were 24 fatal traffic accidents, down from 26 in 2017, and 166 accidents with serious injuries, down from 178 in 2017.
Police chief Sylvain Caron speaks to reporters with Mayor Valérie Plante after being sworn in at Montreal city hall on Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018.
Montreal Police also dealt with a killer heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), the legalization of cannabis( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-marks-three-month-cannaversary-of-legal-weed ) and organizational restructuring to solve deep-seated problems within the force, Caron noted in a public presentation before Montreal's Public Security Committee.
During the 2018 heat wave, which killed 66 people according to Montreal's public health authority, about 690 police officers went door-to-door to visit more than 25 000 dwellings, specifically targeting seniors and other vulnerable residents.
The force, working with provincial and other local police departments, also cracked down on an illegal cannabis operations( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-police-target-illegal-drug-network-with-raids-across-city-region ). In November, it carried out an operation involving 18 raids, in which nine people were charged and investigators seized large quantities of cannabis and other items valued at $1.8 million.
Montreal Police are also targeting illegal cannabis suppliers by setting up the ACCES Cannabis program.
Caron, who was appointed to the job last November( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sylvain-caron-chosen-as-new-montreal-police-chief ) to replace interim chief Martin Prud'homme, said efforts to restore public confidence in police and shore up morale in the 6,000-member force (including civilians) remain a top priority.
Prud'homme took over in December 2018 after a damning report by lawyer Michel Bouchard revealed deep-seated problems within the force that resulted in the suspension of then-chief Philippe Pichet.
Caron said morale within the force has vastly improved in the wake of reforms introduced by Prud'homme( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/report-card-on-montreal-police-force-to-made-public-by-quebec ).
In March, Prud'homme, who had returned to his position as director of the Sûreté du Québec, was relieved of his duties( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sq-chief-martin-prudhomme-relieved-of-duties-due-to-criminal-allegations ) pending a probe into allegations of criminal conduct.
There were 32 homicides on the island of Montreal in 2018, a 33-per-cent increase from 2017, when there were 24. However, Caron said the increase should not cause undue concern, since the murder rate has dropped dramatically compared to 10 or 20 years ago.
Crimes against persons went up by nearly two per cent, while crimes against property dropped by nearly six per cent, the report said.
