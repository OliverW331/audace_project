Here's a look at a couple of stories that bubbled up overnight while you were trying to conjure a dream of a new future for the Habs.
Wait. How does anyone under 30 know about Jeopardy? Alex Trebek sported a beard( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/entertainment-pmn/alex-trebek-launches-new-season-of-jeopardy-with-beard/wcm/33fcedda-3e67-4035-814c-659bc155d068 ) as he launched the 35th season of Jeopardy! and the look has led to a poll. The bearded host appeared in a video on Instagram( https://www.instagram.com/p/BnjZ3j0FEF-/?hl=en ) under the caption, "It's time to embark upon a magical journey." He opened the first show of the season by saying, "No need to inquire how I spent my summer vacation." The game show has started a beard or no beard poll on Twitter. There have been more votes for the beard than against it. One person wrote that the beard reminded her of the actor Sean Connery while another compared Trebek to Santa Claus.
To beard, or not to beard: that is the question. Vote now! #AlexTrebeard( https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlexTrebeard?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Is Cali pot more dangerous or more dangerously tested?( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/business-pmn/many-california-marijuana-products-failing-safety-tests/wcm/4c0aa512-4bb4-4202-9657-804cf97bb5d9 ) Nearly 20 per cent of marijuana products in California have failed tests for potency and purity since the state started requiring the checks on July 1, a failure rate some in the industry say has more to do with unrealistic standards and technical glitches than protecting consumer safety. The testing has been especially tough on cannabis-infused cookies, candies and tinctures: about one-third have been blocked from store shelves. In much smaller numbers, testing companies licensed by the state are finding unacceptable levels of pesticides, solvents and bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella, according to data provided to The Associated Press by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. Recreational pot becomes available in Canada on Oct. 17.
On a more sombre note, Eastern U.S. braces for Florence( https://nationalpost.com/pmn/travel-pmn/the-latest-hurricane-florence-slightly-increases-in-speed ): As of 5:20 a.m. Hurricane Florence had slightly increased in speed as it heads toward the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center said it is moving toward the west-northwest at nearly 24 km/h and the storm will continue a slight increase in speed during the next couple of days. Last night, the forecast was that Florence could inflict the hardest hurricane punch the Carolinas have seen in more than 60 years, with rain and wind of more than 130 mp/h (209 km/h). North Carolina has been hit by only one other Category 4 storm since reliable record keeping began in the 1850s. That was Hurricane Hazel in 1954.
