Stock up on frozen treats and turn on your air conditioner: a heat wave is rolling into Montreal this weekend, bringing with it the city's hottest recorded July 1 temperatures.
Temperatures of up to 35 Celsius, which will feel closer to 40 with humidity, are expected for Canada Day (and Moving Day) on Sunday.
That's 10 degrees above the average daily high for July 1, according to historical data from Environment Canada, thus beating out 2014, as the hottest recorded Canada Day in Montreal since 1942.
"If the forecasted temperature is right, we will break a record, definitely," Environment Canada meteorologist Steve Boily confirmed.
The hot streak will likely continue until the end of next week, Boily said.
"It's going to become more and more uncomfortable," he continued, adding that Sunday and Monday will likely be the worse days.
Montreal has an average of nine to 10 days in July with temperatures above 30 C, Boily said. This year he said we might hit that number earlier than in past years, as the hottest days normally begin at the end of July.
Because of the heat, the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro has already cancelled their Canada Day parade( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,43117560&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&id=30341&ret=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/url/page/prt_vdm_en/rep_annonces_ville/rep_communiques/communiques ), though they will continue with other planned activities( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=8417,94697648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&_piref8417_94697654_8417_94697648_94697648.strutsAction=/cal/publique/detailEvenement.cal&langue=EN&gid=58182&portlet=recherche&entite=CALEND_PIERREFONDS&typeContenu=EVEN_GENERIQUE&returnTo=/cal/publique/resultatsRecherche.cal&date=allTime&DateDebut=&DateFin= ).
The Demi-Marathon RBC de Sherbrooke, which is scheduled for Saturday, has also announced that they'll be monitoring the weather closely to see if changes need to be made to their 21-kilometre race to ensure safety. Check the race's Facebook page( https://www.facebook.com/courirsherbrooke/posts/1659053370856622 ) for updates.
Many boroughs in the cities of Montreal and Longueuil( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/communiques/2018/chaleur-accablante-prolonge-heures-ouverture-ses-piscines-ses-pataugeoires-rappelle ) have also extended the hours of municipal swimming pools later into the evening, giving Montrealers more time to cool off.
Confederation Pool at 6265 Biermans Ave. in N.D.G. and Lasalle Pool at 475 10th Ave. in Lachine will both remain open until 8:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., respectively.
Montrealers can find more information about their neighbourhood pools and splash pads here( http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/banque311/content/%E2%96%BA-arrondissements-%E2%80%93-plages-piscines-ext%C3%A9rieures-pataugeoires-et-jeux-deau ), whereas Longueuil residents can find which of the city's more than 20 pools is closest to them on the city's website( https://www.longueuil.quebec/fr/ete ).
In anticipation of the upcoming heat wave, Sant√© Montreal has also issued a reminder( https://santemontreal.qc.ca/index.php?id=4554 ) to help citizens identify symptoms of heat exhaustion:
Dry mouth, which is a sign of dehydration
Headaches
Dizziness
Confusion
Fainting
The agency says the best ways to beat the heat are to drink water, even before you feel thirsty, stay in a cool, air-conditioned environment for at least a few hours a day, and - sorry to those moving July 1( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/moving-day-still-strong-though-movers-hope-it-will-fade?video_autoplay=true ) - reduce physical activity as much you can.
