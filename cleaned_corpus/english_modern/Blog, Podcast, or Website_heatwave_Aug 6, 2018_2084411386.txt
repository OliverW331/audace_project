Environment Canada maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area Monday, and added a severe thunderstorm watch in the early afternoon.
The federal agency had predicted daytime highs near 30 C and humidex values( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ) near 40 C - it reached those temperatures by noon Monday.
It warned storms could blow in with gusts, large hail and heavy rain in the afternoon and evening. The storm watch covered Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and Longueuil and came with the agency's standard message: "When thunder roars, go indoors!"
Environment Canada's public weather alerts page( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/index_e.html ) showed heat, storm and air-quality warnings covering quite a bit of the country.
