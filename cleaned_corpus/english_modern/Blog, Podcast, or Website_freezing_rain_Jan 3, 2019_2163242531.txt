The city of Montreal is to launch partial snow-clearing operations Friday morning, a day after a 2-cm snowfall was expected to cover sidewalks and streets.
Snowplows and snow-clearing trucks will fan out across the city as of 7 a.m. At the same time, workers will continue to spread abrasives to ensure the safety of pedestrians and motorists, the city announced in a statement.
The snow-clearing will proceed in the following boroughs: Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Anjou, Lachine, Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal North, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles, St-Laurent and St-Léonard.
The city noted the amount of snow expected on Thursday varied from borough to borough. In its statement, the city did not include the boroughs of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce or Ville-Marie, among others.
City officials were not immediately available to comment on why some boroughs were not mentioned in the snow-clearing statement.
In November, city officials vowed to improve snow-clearing with drones and bigger dump sites.
