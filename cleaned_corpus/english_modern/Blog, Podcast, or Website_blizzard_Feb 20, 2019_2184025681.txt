Potholes continue to be the bane of Montreal drivers, making for an uncomfortable ride as they do expensive damage to cars. Municipal authorities blame them on our freeze-and-thaw weather cycles; citizens tend to suspect that the city's road construction practices are at least partly responsible.
As demonstrated by this photo from our archives - it is labelled Cedar Ave. and dated Feb. 20, 1954 - the problem has a long history.
As the puddles suggest, the city was experiencing an unseasonably warm spell, what we referred to in a report published that day as a "heat wave." (According to the Environment Canada website, the high Feb. 20, as recorded at McGill University, was 6.7 degrees C.) It was a Saturday. There had been a blizzard earlier in the week, and "1,200 men and more than 20 snow blowers" were still busy clearing snow and slush from major thoroughfares, we reported.
While what appear to be muddy snowbanks are visible at the side of the road, the street itself is littered not by snow, but by crumbling pavement amid the craters.
Two days later, after considerable rain on the Sunday, we wrote: "Four days of mild weather have Montreal streets running with water, and under the surface the pavement is breaking up in many sections." Cars were described as lurching through potholes while "broken asphalt litters the street like pebbles on a beach after a storm." That almost sounds poetic, but no doubt most Montrealers would have used more prosaic language to describe the condition of the streets, as indeed they often do now.
