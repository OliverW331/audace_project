11:55 am. Trudeau reacts
From the Canadian Press:
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he has thanked Greta Thunberg for mobilizing so many people, particularly young people, around climate change.
The Liberal leader was asked about his meeting with the 16-year-old activist during a news conference( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/trudeau-promises-liberals-would-plant-2-billion-trees-to-fight-climate-change/wcm/78236962-a223-4bd8-8d3d-25af05af4aca ) in Montreal today.
Trudeau - who has faced criticism for his government's purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline project - says he agrees with Thunberg that Ottawa needs to do more for the environment.
He's made a series of announcements this week aimed at reducing emissions, protecting oceans and encouraging conservation.
From Reuters:
Trudeau is promising more climate action but has also had to defend his decision to buy and expand a major oil pipeline in western Canada.
"In my wonderful conversation with Greta this morning, we talked directly about the need to do more, much more. I thanked her for the amount of people that her call to action has mobilized," he told reporters after promising to plant 2 billion trees if re-elected.

11:15 a.m. Thunberg on Trudeau, Indigenous youth, Montreal and Trump
Activist Greta Thunberg speaks at press conference prior to big climate march in Montreal Sept. 27, 2019.
Thunberg answered four questions from reporters.
She was asked about her meeting with Justin Trudeau this morning.
"My message to all the politicians around the world is the same, just listen and act on the current most available science. I try not to focus so much on individuals and rather focus on the whole picture because ... of course it's easier just to blame someone. And of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough. Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."
Why did she invite Indigenous youth to help lead the march?
"Indigenous people have for centuries and millenniums protected the local environment and of course we need to because they are often the ones who are being, who are at the front line, so we need to be able to hear their voices. So that's why I think it's so important that indigenous people lead this fight."
Why did she decide to come to Montreal?
"Why I decided to go to Montreal, because I was planning on where to go and of course, I want to go to Canada as well and I was invited to attend the march in Montreal. I thought why not? And I decided to go there because I think it's fun to visit lots of different places. Because this is not just one country, this is everyone. Also because I know Canada is striking on the 27th and the U.S. is striking on the 20th so that's why I sort of changed countries because diff countries strike on different dates.
"From Canada I have already seen today that the strikes have been very big and I think and I hope the rest of the strikes of Canada will be very big as well. I know you have elections now, and that is always a very busy time when I really want to understand what is going on. I expect that you as well as other countries take your responsibility and do your part from a global perspective."
Does she have a theory about why some political leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, mock her?
"Of course I don't know. I don't understand why grownups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead. I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests or whatever it is, is threatened by and we should take that as a compliment that we are having so much impact that people want to silence us, we've become too loud for people to handle, so they want to silence us. So we should also take that as a compliment."
10:45 a.m. Thunberg speaks
Greta Thunberg addresses the press conference. The Gazette Facebook page is covering Thunberg's press conference live.
Thunberg, who has been tweeting images of marches around the world this morning( https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg ), said:
"It's great to be here with you all in Canada. I'm looking very much forward to today. So today there's another global climate strike and it is very exciting to be see the pictures and the videos from all around then world and to hear from everyone who has been organizing the local strikes.
"The strikes have been very successful today. I think it's too early yet to have any official numbers but I guess we will have to see how many turned out.
"I'm very excited to be here and it's going to be very much fun today and to once again stand together, people from all around the world, for one common cause, that is very empowering. It is very moving to see everyone, everyone who is so passionate to march and strike, people of all ages, all generations.
"It's a very good day I would say."

9:45 a.m. Thunberg is on her way
It was unclear if Greta Thunberg was going to take part in this morning's press conference by march organizers. But they now confirm she will indeed be there. She'll make a statement and answer a few questions.
But she seems to be running late. Will arrive in an hour.
One of the organizers confirmed a report that Thunberg arrived in Montreal in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.
"We're all here for the same reason: We are sick and tired. Things must change.
Our voices as youth will not stop. We will be here, whether you like it or not, to make sure you hear our voices." - Cédric Gray-Lehoux#MarchePourLeClimat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarchePourLeClimat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #ClimateStrike( https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateStrike?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #FridaysForFuture( https://twitter.com/hashtag/FridaysForFuture?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/Uq0kv1U04Y( https://t.co/Uq0kv1U04Y )

Gazette colleague Jesse Feith( https://twitter.com/JesseFeith ) is at the press conference. He writes:
François Geoffroy, spokesperson La Planète S'invite au Parlement (LPSP), opened the press conference.
"Nine months ago we launched a call, not just to march but to strike for the climate," Geoffroy said. "In 40 years, no government has presented a credible transition program. Our trust is running out, and so is our patience."
Ève Grenier Houde, from Fridays for Future, said: "We're the ones who will live the worst case scenarios predicted by science. Our resources are limited. We need support from our parents, teachers and elected officials."
She had a plea for Montreal's mayor, Quebec's premier and Canada's prime minister: "Madame Plante, Mr. Legault and Mr. Trudeau, it's your responsibility to ensure our future."
Dominic Champagne, spokesperson for the Pacte pour la transition: "The situation has not gotten any better since Earth Day in 2012. It's only gotten worse. But this movement will continue to grow until we reach a tipping point."
You can watch the press conference live( https://www.facebook.com/laplaneteauparlement/posts/554557248626500?__xts__[0]=68.ARBcGyNbBCOQIXAduQXGasrwFYVqZzM865KwJ8oYD3MdFJmPbkubpNnN7FHWALU7KybA418rRPsQovFyvULVpjLJWRERAdq_yhMVNo6Swj0bWrCOwpuPm5DlFXjSeUqvgN0G_-Le4MSY0o4Q3qQTIb5dAPzdXIGiKi0pScO5r_pb6YnxdvOII2D8_xWshNeCnLLZUObWntYZA2H1OD1ZkG0Bp_7hJRtrjQjEDs4bH7CKqpGiVVymimQlCgTYOakYfuDqie5F1PwLeIw9aZFW_LK-4gZcwAEPFv0L6nfkgHPwnQMLMD7XERujMOoypYUxKGM1amMH-YicQ5rmLlDVDNEejc9qf5YBQ4qOuLSz11XlmwHZeMCGbnufR1Wq9zbRG5Kl01Y8pmIkB_2dn1ytlW-91G2nayqpj783RnxXWUfDNfHukOdenJYlHv5fRCJXJFUhql5A5284JcHo-OmewRP5MCdiAHrv82MQMsTBoY1TE1zbGByfV67-sye5yn4&__tn__=-R ) on the Facebook page of La Planète s'invite au Parlement.
9:30 a.m. The premier says he's listening
Unlike politicians such as Valérie Plante, Justin Trudeau, Yves-François Blanchet and Elizabeth May, Quebec Premier François Legault decided not to participate( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/legault-may-not-be-a-climate-skeptic-but-hes-climate-inactive-liberals-charge ) in today's march, instead sending his environment minister, Benoit Charette.
But he posted a message on Facebook this morning, telling Quebec's youth that he hears their plea for action.
In reads, in part: "Do not be afraid of your beliefs and be proud of your passion. It is with great hope that I watch you walk for our future. And it is with a helping hand that I propose to help us build a more prosperous, greener and therefore more proud Quebec."
A poll out this week indicated that climate change is tied with health care as the number one issue( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues ) among Quebec voters.
9 a.m. The plan
Picture-perfect weather( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ), free transit( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-transit-free-in-and-around-montreal-on-friday-for-climate-march ) and Bixi bikes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ), tens of thousands of students( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/csdm-turns-sept-27-into-ped-day-for-climate-march ) and workers taking the day off to join, growing fears about the impact of climate change, and the presence of prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/acclaimed-teenage-environmental-activist-coming-to-montreal ).
You can see why some are expecting the youth-led march to be huge - even bigger than the one on March 15( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-lets-hope-our-childrens-concerns-dont-fall-on-deaf-ears ), when 150,000 university, CEGEP, high-school and primary students took over the city's streets. Some are predicting double that number will show up today. It could be the biggest ever climate event in Canada.
We'll know in a few hours. In the meantime, here's the schedule for the day.
9:30 a.m. Organizers hold press conference. It's unclear whether Thunberg will be there.
Noon. Four-kilometre march starts at the George-Étienne-Cartier-Monument( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monument+to+Sir+George-%C3%89tienne+Cartier/@45.5142452,-73.5896311,1383m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91a320b7b7cb1:0xd7b453760780c689!8m2!3d45.5142452!4d-73.5852537 ) on Park Ave. It is to end at Wellington St., near Nazareth St.( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rue+Wellington+%26+Rue+Nazareth,+Montr%C3%A9al,+QC/@45.4956082,-73.5594434,1128m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91af567769b9f:0xedac61585b5265bc!8m2!3d45.4957057!4d-73.5557907 )
5:30 p.m. Thunberg meets privately with Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante at city hall.
6 p.m. At public event, Plante gives Thunberg keys to the city. A photo op is planned but Thunberg is not scheduled to speak.
Colleague Jesse Feith has more about what to expect( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-fridays-climate-march-in-montreal ).
Stay tuned. A team of Montreal Gazette reporters, columnists and photographers will be on the ground all day. Come back often; this post will be updated throughout the day.

The map below, from the STM, shows the start/end points of the march, as well as the area affected by road closures and bus detours.
?? Marche pour le climat : planifiez vos déplacements ??
La circulation sera particulièrement difficile dans la zone comprise entre Berri, Peel, St-Joseph et de la Commune en raison des entraves et du grand nombre de participants attendu.
