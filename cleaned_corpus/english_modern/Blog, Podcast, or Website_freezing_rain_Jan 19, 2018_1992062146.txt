It's like the Weather Network says: "One week, two seasons."
Enjoy winter for the rest of Friday, then spend the weekend in spring, as the January thaw returns for a two-day return engagement.
The wintermission gets underway overnight Friday, as temperatures rise to the freezing mark. Environment Canada reports there is a high probability of freezing rain or ice pellets in the predawn hours, but once the sun rises Saturday we'll reach a dry high of 3 degrees Celsius. It'll be around zero on Sunday.
It won't be the best or worst Jan. 20 we've seen: In 2006, the mercury hit 6.4 C, and in 1970 it was minus-28.9 C, wind chill not included.
We'll be back to winter by Monday, so take advantage of the break to do something outdoorsy, like the FÃªte des Neiges( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/fete-des-neiges-de-montreal/ ) at Parc Jean Drapeau. There are tons of activities for all ages - dancing and workshops and human foosball, for instance - and things that are slightly higher on the danger scale, like axe-throwing and archery. Hopefully the ice sculptures will cope okay with the weather.
If the melting snow mixed with salt and pellets keeps you inside this weekend, might we suggest you celebrate anyway, with a homemade slush puppy.
