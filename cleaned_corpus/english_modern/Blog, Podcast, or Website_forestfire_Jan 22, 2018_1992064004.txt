Scores of Montreal firefighters were called in late Sunday and early Monday to battle a pair of fires that broke out in the city's north end.
The first blaze broke out at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday in an automobile repair shop and is being treated as a case of arson.
A witness told police that a car rammed the front of the shop, located on Forest St. in the industrial sector of the borough of Montreal North, prior to the fire. While the flames spread to two adjacent buildings, there were no injuries reported and no evacuations were required.
The second fire occurred at about 2:30 a.m. in a commercial building on Crémazie Blvd. E. near Lajeunesse St. in the city's Villeray district. No injuries were reported.
The cause of the second blaze has yet to be determined. Firefighters remained on the scene Monday morning, and Crémazie Blvd. is closed in both directions between Lajeunesse and St-Hubert Sts. until this afternoon.
