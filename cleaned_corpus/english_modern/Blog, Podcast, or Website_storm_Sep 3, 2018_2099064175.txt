The Montreal area was under a severe thunderstorm watch Monday afternoon as Environment Canada warned of possible damaging wind gusts, hail and "torrential rain."
The watch covered the Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and Longueuil-Varennes regions. In addition to storm warnings, the Eastern Townships and Richelieu Valley were under heat warnings.
Keep Environment Canada's advice in mind if you're caught in the weather: "When thunder roars, go indoors."
