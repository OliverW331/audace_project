The situation for power outages has greatly improved over the last few hours in Quebec, but more than 168,000 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power as of 8 a.m. Sunday morning, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).
The vast majority of households should be reconnected by Sunday night, but outages in areas where damage was greater are expected to continue for some time. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien will give an update Sunday afternoon in Quebec City.
At the height of the blackout resulting from Friday's storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), 990,000 homes and businesses were without power. On Saturday, Prime Minister François Legault called it "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
Legault acknowledged that power failures could last longer in the Eastern Townships, the Montérégie region, the Beauce, central Quebec, Lanaudière and the Laurentians.
