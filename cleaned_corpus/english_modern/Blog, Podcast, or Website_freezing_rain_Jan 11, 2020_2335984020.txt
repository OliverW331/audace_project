A woman in her 30s has died after a head-on collision Friday evening in Baie-des-Sables, in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region.
According to the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), the two cars - one carrying three people, the other just the driver - struck each other around 7:15 p.m. on Route 132.
One woman, who was lightly injured and removed from a vehicle with the Jaws of Life, was later arrested. The woman who died was a passenger. Two others travelling with her are in stable condition.
An investigation as to the cause is under way.
