The coronavirus pandemic( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus ) has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The ministry says its decision is based on preserving the operational capacity of its forest firefighting agency (SOPFEU) and other firefighting services during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.
According to SOPFEU, there are no forest fires detected at the moment in Quebec.
Since the start of the 2020 fire season, nine fires have broken out over 0.3 hectares. Over the past 10 years, the average number of fires recorded at this time of year is 17, affecting 8.9 hectares.
