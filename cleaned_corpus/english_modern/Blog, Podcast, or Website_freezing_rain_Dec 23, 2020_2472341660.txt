What's Christmas without a little bit of ... rainfall?
Environment Canada has issued a rainfall warning for the Montreal area, Laval, Ch√¢teauguay and Longueuil, with 20 to 40 millimetres expected to begin falling Thursday afternoon, continuing until Friday evening.
That rain may cause flash floods and pooling on roads, the statement warns.
Christmas Day is expected to be unseasonably warm, with temperatures up in the 13 C range, but the temperature will drop below freezing at night.
