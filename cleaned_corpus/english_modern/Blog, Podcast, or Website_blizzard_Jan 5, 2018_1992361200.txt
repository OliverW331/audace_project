Quebec provincial police are encouraging people to stay off the highway, if they can, as blowing snow is affecting visibility.
"If you can stay at home, stay at home," said Louis-Philippe Bibeau, a spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
He encouraged drivers to slow down and maintain their distance.
Drivers should turn their lights on during the day in these conditions, Bibeau said. While daytime running lights are turned on automatically, rear lights won't come on unless they're turned on. Having those rear lights on will help vehicles be seen by other drivers in the blowing snow, he said.
Bibeau said there were a few overnight collisions on roadways patrolled by the SQ in the Montreal area, however there were no serious injuries or deaths.
