Montrealers woke up to freezing temperatures and an Environment Canada-issued frost advisory Thursday morning.
The advisory warns that temperatures will drop below the freezing mark overnight, which could do some damage to plants left in outside gardens. This is the second overnight frost advisory the federal meteorological service has issued this week.
Things will improve over the weekend, with highs in the double digits throughout Friday and most of Saturday. Expect rain Friday night and Saturday during the day, then more frigid temperatures overnight.
Next week we're back to below-10 C temperatures and, if we're very lucky, we might see some flurries.
