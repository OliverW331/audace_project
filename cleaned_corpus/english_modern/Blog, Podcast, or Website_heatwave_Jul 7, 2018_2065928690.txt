A total of 33 people have died in Montreal since the beginning of the heat wave, according to public health officials.
The number climbed from yesterday's 28 reported deaths because more bodies were discovered and physicians determined that the deaths occurred at some point during the heat wave, said David Kaiser of Santé Montréal.
The public health agency is still on alert to heat-related health risks but expects a downward trend in the data they use to gauge the level of danger, which includes information on hospitalizations, ambulance transfers and the total number of deaths in the city.
"What we have from this morning seems to indicate that we're trending toward a resolution of the highest level of risk," said David Kaiser of Santé Montréal.
All 33 deaths have occurred in private apartments or seniors' residences, Kaiser said.
"The age and sex profile are essentially what we've been seeing and all of them have, when we have information, some underlying medical condition," Kaiser said.
