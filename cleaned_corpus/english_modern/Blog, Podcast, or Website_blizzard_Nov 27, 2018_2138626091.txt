Environment Canada warned on Monday that by the time it was over on Wednesday there could be 25 centimetres of snow on the ground( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/beware-says-environment-canada-snowfall-could-be-fast-and-flurrious ).
But by Tuesday morning the light, wet snowflakes that had begun to fall hours earlier were gone, the temperature was slightly above freezing, and by the time it's all over on Wednesday, the forecast now says we'll see a mix of snow and rain.
Meanwhile, Environment Canada's snowfall warning, issued Monday for the Montreal area, had disappeared as quickly as the remnants of Tuesday's snow flurries.
However, the rest of Quebec remains braced for more serious accumulations over the course of Tuesday.
A total of 10-15 centimetres are expected to fall on Sherbrooke by Wednesday while about 12 centimetres are expected in the Trois-Rivières area.
The Quebec City region meanwhile is expecting between 15-20 centimetres as well as whiteouts caused by wind gusts of up to 90 kilometres and hour. But the winter wallop( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ) seems poised to hit hardest in the Charlevoix region, where 20 to 30 centimetres of snow are expected Tuesday afternoon. The region is expected to receive a further 15 to 25 centimetres Tuesday night and another 10 to 15 centimetres on Wednesday.
