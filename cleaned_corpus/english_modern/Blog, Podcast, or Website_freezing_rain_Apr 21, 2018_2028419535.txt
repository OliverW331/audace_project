This, apparently, is what spring feels like.
But who can really be sure after a cold week that included freezing rain, snow and one spritzing of rain after another?
Anyhow, Environment Canada is forecasting a daytime high of ten degrees and clear skies on Saturday. The nighttime forecast calls for more clear skies and a low of minus two.
On Sunday, the agency is forecasting a daytime high of 11 degrees and nighttime low of three degrees.
Just about anything other than locust would have been an upgrade after this week, so this weekend forecast may be a lot for some to take in. One possible way to cope with the change involves going outside with a lighter jacket than a parka.
