The good news is we can expect a "classic Canadian" winter, according to the Weather Network. Whether that's also bad news depends on your perspective.
The meteorological organization says most of Quebec will see temperatures that are slightly below normal through December, January and February. That'll coincide with above-normal precipitation for the southern third of the province.
The Old Farmer's Almanac( https://www.almanac.com/ ) mostly backs up the Weather Network, forecasting the coldest periods during the second halves of December and January and saying the "snowiest periods will be in late November, early and mid-December, mid-January, mid- to late February and late March."
November has warmed us up, so to speak, for this chillier-than-usual winter( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/roads-are-slippery-as-montreal-digs-out-from-first-snowstorm-of-season ).
A polar vortex of consistently cold weather will be punctuated with extended periods of extreme cold, the Weather Network said, and "an active storm track will likely bring above-normal snow totals to much of the region, along with a risk for freezing rain at times, especially across southern Ontario and into southern Quebec."
"It's one of those seasons where you're going to need a parka, you're going to need a shovel - and a snowblower," a Weather Network meteorologist said, suggesting it'll be a great season for skating and skiing. "We could see some ice storms mixed in there as well."
If none of this appeals to you, just hold your breath and wait for the January thaw. It might be the only reprieve till sometime after March, since it looks like chances of an early spring are not good.
