Significant progress was made over the weekend in restoring power to the 990,000 Quebecers who lost it as a result of Friday's wind storm, with service returned to nearly 90 per cent of Hydro-Québec customers.
Utility president and chief executive officer Éric Martel told reporters Sunday afternoon "there could be exceptional cases," but 99.9 per cent of customers would have power restored by Tuesday night.
"We are doing all we can," he said.
As of 9 p.m. Sunday, 93,529 Hydro-Québec customers still had no power, according to the utility( https://poweroutages.hydroquebec.com/poweroutages/service-interruption-report/index.html#bis ).

Among them were Derek Burcombe and his fiancée, Sharron Perry, who lost power early Friday in their Knowlton house. By Sunday night, the temperature in the house was 10 degrees Celsius.
Being without power is "a total inconvenience," said Burcombe, 44 - unable to take a morning shower, prepare his morning tea or make dinner.
But on another level, "you realize how spoiled we are," he said Sunday night at the Knowlton Pub, where he and Perry had stopped in for a drink with friends after having dinner in nearby Foster.
"It's just the power that went out. We are all still alive, although we are all getting grumpy."
On Saturday, Premier François Legault called the aftermath of Friday's winds "the worst situation since the infamous 1998 ice storm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/more-than-500000-hydro-quebec-customers-still-without-power-saturday-morning )."
But to Burcombe, the ice storm of January of 1998 "was a whole different thing." For one, he was not worried on the weekend about his pipes freezing. Whereas temperatures during the ice storm were "devastatingly cold," Friday was 16 degrees Celsius.
"You have to look at it as a bit of an adventure," he said. Without the distractions of television or smartphones, he and Perry spent the past couple of nights cuddled under the covers, lots of candles on the night tables, playing Trivial Pursuit.
As of 9 p.m. Sunday, the area with the greatest number of blackouts was central Quebec, south of the St. Lawrence River, where 19,160 customers out of 139,226 still had no power. In Montreal, only 455 of 1,051,496 customers were without power.
Power had been restored by 4 p.m. Sunday to all but six of 50 priority cases, which include hospitals, social service centres, water- filtration plants and seniors' residences - and would be restored in the rest before midnight, Martel said. Of the 100 schools affected, power would be restored before midnight to all but 11, he said.
He thanked affected customers for their patience and their resilience, and thanked employees, who have been working flat out since Friday. About 1,400 Hydro workers, aided by crews from Ontario, New Brunswick and Michigan, were on the ground on Sunday. More workers from outside Quebec were expected for Monday, including 50 more from Connecticut.
Martel said the 1998 ice storm, which affected 1.4 million Quebecers, damaged transmission systems, which in some cases took weeks to repair. Friday's storm, on the other hand, affected mainly the distribution system - poles and wires - and repair is more rapid, he said.
If progress appeared slower than at the start of the outages that resulted from Friday's storm and high winds( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ), it's because the areas in which Hydro crews are working have fewer customers and the damage is greater, Hydro-Québec spokesperson Maxence Huard-Lefebvre explained.
In the case of 70 per cent of the remaining outages, the repairs affect no more than 20 clients at a time, Martel said Sunday, and are often in locations inaccessible to trucks and requiring specialized equipment like aerial buckets.
The storm damage was most significant in heavily treed regions, Huard-Lefebvre said. Entire sections of the power system must be rebuilt in some areas, while transformers and poles must be replaced in others. It takes two linemen five to seven hours to replace a downed hydro pole. "We still have a lot of poles to replace. There's a lot of work still to be done."
Martel noted it's not clear that installing wires underground, which costs four to 10 times what having them above ground does, is necessarily better. Underground wires have their own attendant problems and would not necessarily mean there would be fewer power failures, he said.
