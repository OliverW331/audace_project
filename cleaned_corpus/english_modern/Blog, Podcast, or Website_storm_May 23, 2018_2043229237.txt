A protest organized by the far-right group Storm Alliance to denounce the Canadian government's tolerance of what that group calls "illegal immigration"( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/far-right-and-anti-racist-groups-prepare-to-face-off-at-lacolle-border-crossing ) attracted about 250 people to the Lacolle border crossing Saturday afternoon.
A smaller group showed up earlier that day to denounce that protest. Police separated the two groups.
