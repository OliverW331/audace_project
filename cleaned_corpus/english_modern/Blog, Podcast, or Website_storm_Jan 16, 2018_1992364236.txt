After launching the season's fourth citywide snow removal operation on Sunday evening, Montreal officials reported Monday night that 25 per cent of the 36 centimetres of snow that fell on the city since Saturday had been cleared.
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the largest borough in the city, stood at 16 per cent at 9:30 p.m., and in downtown Ville-Marie, 20 per cent of streets were cleared. However some other boroughs - because of a larger residential population or less traffic - were appearing to more than outstrip( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/snowremoval/avancement ) the citywide average.
St-Laurent reported it had completed 42 per cent of streets, while St-Léonard had a 37-per-cent completion rate.
Some of the city's 19 boroughs reported below average results, with Ahuntsic-Cartierville at 18 per cent and Pierrefonds-Roxboro at only seven per cent.
The city has said it could take more than five days before all streets and sidewalks are cleared, because crews had not finished removing snow from the previous storm in some boroughs.
City officials are reminding motorists and pedestrians to keep a safe distance between themselves and the fleet of snow-removal trucks and other vehicles used in the clearing of 4,100 kilometres of streets and 6,550 kilometres of sidewalks.
N.D.G. resident Alison Neill pushes the stroller carrying her seven-month old daughter, Violet, over the uncleared snowbanks on Regent Ave. near Sherbrooke St., on Thursday.
