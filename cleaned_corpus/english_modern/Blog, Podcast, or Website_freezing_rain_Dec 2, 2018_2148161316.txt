A freezing rain warning issued by Environment Canada for Montreal( https://www.weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ), the Laurentians and the Eastern Townships was lifted on Sunday morning as temperatures rose above freezing.
Environment Canada( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/this-weekends-freezing-rain-isnt-done-yet-environment-canada-warns ) posted a freezing rain warning for Montreal and much of Quebec on Sunday.
The warning( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-133_metric_e.html ) remains in place for areas including Temiscamingue, Mont-Tremblant and Quebec City. "It should persist for those areas until later this evening or later tonight," said Ivan Dubé of Environment Canada.
Freezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces. Drivers are urged to avoid unnecessary trips, and to adjust their driving to road conditions as surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots become icy, slippery and hazardous.
In Montreal, it will be foggy this evening and overnight and there could be a bit of rain as temperatures remain above freezing overnight. But they will drop from Monday night into Tuesday, so puddles that have not dried up by then could freeze.
Temperatures will be cooler than average for Tuesday and Wednesday, Dubé said, with a low of minus 11 degrees Celsius expected for Tuesday night into Wednesday.
