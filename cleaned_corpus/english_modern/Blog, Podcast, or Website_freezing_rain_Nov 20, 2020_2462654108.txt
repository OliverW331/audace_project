Environment Canada on Friday issued a special weather statement for Montreal and Laval forecasting a "possible snowfall on Sunday."
The statement, issued at 10:45 a.m., notes that a low pressure system over the U.S. Midwest will affect southwestern Quebec beginning Sunday afternoon.
"This system will intensify as it makes its way to the province," according to the statement. "Depending on its track, which is still uncertain, this low pressure system could give significant snowfall amounts and cause strong winds over southern and central Quebec Sunday night, especially over regions along the north shore of the St-Lawrence River. It will then spread to eastern Quebec on Monday."
The precipitation is expected to begin as snow, then gradually change to rain with a risk of freezing rain during the changeover on Monday morning over most areas.
Environment Canada will update its statement as more details become available.
