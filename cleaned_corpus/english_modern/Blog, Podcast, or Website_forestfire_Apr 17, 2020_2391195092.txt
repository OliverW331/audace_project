4:30 p.m. Now more than 7,200 COVID-19 cases in Montreal
The city of Montreal reported 451 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 7,281.
An additional 90 deaths were also recorded, meaning 332 people have now died from the disease in Montreal.
But Montreal's public health director said she remains "confident" the city has reached the peak of the COVID-19 curve.
"If we look at the cases today and yesterday, we have attained a plateau," Dr. Mylène Drouin said on Thursday.
The situation continues to be most critical in long-term care facilities. Seventy-five per cent of the centres in the Montreal area are dealing with outbreaks, Drouin said.
Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also announced new measures aimed at helping the taxi industry, including a $260,000 grant to help taxi drivers install protective partitions in their cars.
Montreal is also setting up an automated call system that will call seniors to inform them about resources available nearby.
The calls will be made in English and in French, Plante confirmed.

1:30 p.m. 2,000 Quebec doctors have answered the call to help in CHSLDs, Legault says
At least 2,000 Quebec doctors have come forward to help in the province's long-term care centres, Premier François Legault announced on Thursday.
The announcement came a day after Legault pleaded with doctors to help out in the centres, appealing to their "duty" to come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
Legault said he knows it won't be easy to deploy the 2,000 doctors, but said he's confident the province can figure out a way to do so.
"It won't be perfect, but we'll adjust as we go," he said.
Now that the COVID-19 curve has flattened, Legault added, Quebec is preparing a plan to scale back its lockdown, which includes the opening of more businesses.
Legault also said that reopening Quebec's schools before May 4, which he mentioned last week and which provoked an outcry, is out of the question for now.

1:00 p.m. Quebec reports 997 new cases, 143 more deaths
Premier François Legault noted that many of the new deaths being reported today are not actually from the last 24 hours. Rather, the number is partially attributable to methodology.
A total of 15,857 cases have been confirmed in the province and 630 people have died.
For the second day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus has decreased.
12:40 p.m. Quebec loses its first doctor to COVID-19
Cogeco News is reporting a first Quebec doctor has died from COVID-19.
According to reporter Louis Lacroix, the doctor was a 44-year-old community health specialist from the Montérégie region.
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda confirmed the death on Thursday, but said the doctor did not work in hospitals or long-term care centres.
11:45 a.m. Canada evaluating how to help in Quebec's CHSLDs, Trudeau says
Canada has received a request from Quebec for help in its long-term care centres, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday morning.
Trudeau said the request was made on Wednesday.
The prime minister described the request as "somewhat different" - the federal government is usually called to assist with floods or forest fires, he explained - but said the government is evaluating how it can help, including how the Armed Forces and Canadian Red Cross could be of assistance.
"We recognize there's a need in CHSLDs and seniors' residences and we're looking into how the federal government can help at that level," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said the Armed Forces have some members who are trained as doctors, "but not that many."
During his own daily briefing Thursday, Quebec Premier François Legault confirmed the province has asked the federal government for help in the centres, asking for members of the Armed Forces with medical backgrounds to be sent to Quebec.
But there are only between 60 and 100 members who meet the criteria, Legault added.
It was the third request for aid Quebec has made to the federal government during the pandemic. The province had already requested members of the Armed Forces be sent to Nunavik and the Basse-Côte-Nord, which was approved.
Trudeau also announced the federal government is expanding its Canada Emergency Business Account to include more businesses. Firms with payrolls between $20,000 and $1.5 million in 2019 will now be eligible for loans, he said( http://montrealgazette.com/news/economy/trudeau-lowers-the-bar-for-small-business-loans-says-rent-relief-coming-amid-coronavirus-crisis/wcm/2efc6b86-e326-47fa-87d3-fcf257744705 ).
A new program to help those paying commercial rent is almost ready, Trudeau added, saying it will help companies with April, May and June's rent. The federal government is in talks with the provinces about the details.
11:00 a.m. Some caregivers granted access to CHSLDs as of today
Starting today, some family caregivers authorized by the Quebec health network will be allowed to enter long-term care facilities (CHSLDs) to provide care for a loved one.
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, about 10 per cent of CHSLD residents received aid from a family caregiver who fed and bathed them as well as made sure they remained hydrated.

10:15 a.m. Quebec bans open-air fires in Montérégie and Eastern Townships
The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Quebec forest ministry to impose a ban on open-air fires in or near forests in the Montérégie and in the Eastern Townships.
The regions subject to the ban include the territories of Sherbrooke, Brome-Missisquoi, Haut-Richelieu and Vallée-du-Richelieu, Longueuil and Beauharnois-Salaberry.

9:00 a.m. Doctors to be paid $211 an hour to work in CHSLDs
Premier François Legault upped the pressure Wednesday on Quebec's doctors to "do their duty" and come to the rescue of overwhelmed nurses and orderlies.
And after a brief war of words between both sides, Health Minister Danielle McCann revealed the agreement reached this week with GP and specialist federations.
The agreement stipulates each doctor working in a COVID-19 environment - including a CHSLD - will be paid $211 an hour, regardless of their tasks, to a maximum of $2,500 a day.
The average wage of an orderly now is $21.50 an hour.

9:00 a.m. Families decry slow rate of testing at Montreal-area seniors' centres
The families of senior citizens living in Quebec's long-term care centres say few residents or staff are being tested for COVID-19 despite government promises to carry out widespread screening at the province's hard-hit facilities.
Family members have been told by administrators that a lack of tests in the province is to blame.

9:00 a.m. Herron scandal prompts Quebec to consider background checks on CHSLD owners
Premier François Legault said Wednesday he found it "unacceptable" that while some employees who work at CHSLDs are required to go through background checks, a man convicted of drug trafficking is the president of a company that owns seven of the long-term care centres.
Katasa Group Inc. owns and manages seven long-term care homes for the elderly, including Résidence Herron in Dorval, which is being investigated amid allegations of negligence in how it responded to the coronavirus crisis. Thirty-one residents at the Herron have died since late March( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/covid-19-premier-legault-confirms-31-dead-at-dorval-care-residence/ ).
The company's owner, Samir Chowieri, has been convicted of at least two major crimes since 1981.

9:00 a.m. Montreal photographer aims to 'capture the soul' of shuttered restaurants
Montreal photographer Fannie-Laurence Dubé-Dupuis is documenting the city's deserted restaurants.
Dubé-Dupuis told reporter Susan Schwartz she's photographing the fronts and interiors of restaurants and bars "to succeed in capturing the soul of a place, sleeping, in all its sadness."
