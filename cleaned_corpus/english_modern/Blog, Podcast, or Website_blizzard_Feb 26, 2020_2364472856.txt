A special weather statement issued for the Montreal area is warning of a meteorological cocktail that will include snow, rain and freezing rain beginning Wednesday night and continuing into Thursday.
The statement, issued at 4:24 p.m. Tuesday, forecasts a winter storm for much of the province that in southwestern Quebec will manifest itself as rain and freezing rain on Wednesday night before turning into snow on Thursday.
"This system will bring heavy snow over most areas( https://montrealgazette.com/news/blizzard-proof-a-spadeful-of-tips-for-safe-snow-shovelling ), with general amounts upwards of 15 centimetres that could reach more than 25 cm over some areas," according to the statement. "Additionally, this system will bring strong winds that are likely to produce blowing snow over many exposed areas, especially along the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St Lawrence."
Motorists are warned( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-winter-driving-guide-how-to-avoid-sliding-sliding-bang ) that they should expect "poor travelling conditions due to low visibility and rapidly accumulating snow on untreated roads, especially Thursday morning. Consider moving ahead or postponing your travel plans."
The weather system is expected to slowly roll across the province for 73 hours and reach eastern Quebec by Friday.
As is usual in the case of such statements, more detailed information is expected over the course of the week as the track of the system becomes more certain.
