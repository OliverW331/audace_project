A little more than a week after a blizzard dropped about 20 centimetres of snow on Montreal and region, Environment Canada on Monday issued a winter storm watch to a city that is already shivering from a minus-27 wind chill. The federal agency noted that in its warning "a Colorado low will track over the Great Lakes Tuesday and become a major storm Wednesday. Snowfall amounts could exceed 15 cm over these areas by Tuesday evening. In addition, visibility will be reduced to near zero in the blowing snow in the afternoon." The MétéoMédia weather network in Quebec is also forecasting an accumulation of snow on Tuesday that will vary from 15 to 20 cm, with the first flakes expected to fall early Tuesday morning.
