As of late Tuesday afternoon, the city of Montreal says it had hauled away about one-quarter of the snow that fell on the weekend.
The snow-removal operation began Monday at 7 p.m. and is expected to take about one week.
Some boroughs are more advanced than others.
Verdun leads the pack, having removed 59 per cent of the snow on its territory. In second and third place are Pierrefonds-Roxboro (39 per cent) and St-Laurent (34 per cent).
Tied for last place are Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both of which stood at 18 per cent.
About 23 centimetres of snow fell on Sunday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-is-being-clobbered-by-an-unusual-uncomfortable-blizzard ). Montreal says approximately 2,000 vehicles are being used in the snow-removal operation.
