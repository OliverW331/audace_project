In 2019, isn't it time for underground hydro cables? When close to one million Hydro-Québec customers are in the dark again - the biggest service interruption since the 1998 Ice Storm - how can the utility and provincial government continue to refuse to build underground cabling in high-density population areas? The costs associated with restoring power - including loss of revenue, importing linesmen, vegetation maintenance, overtime wages, heavy equipment fleet, employee training, equipment replacement - are significant.
While there is an initial capital outlay in burying cables, it is time to think about longterm planning to ensure the reliability of the power grid.
Hydro-Québec generates billions in revenue from domestic and exported power. Some of these revenues must be invested in underground cabling to ensure Quebecers can continue to have reliable power.
All new and proposed hydro installations in urban areas should be built underground. For years, the Build it Underground DDO team has been seeking a commitment from to the previous government. Now is the time for the Coalition Avenir Québec to accept some short-term pain for long-term gain.
