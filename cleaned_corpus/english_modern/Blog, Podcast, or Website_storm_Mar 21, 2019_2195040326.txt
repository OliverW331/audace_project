If you're only interested in the ( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/weather ) - a date on the calendar that is not all that different than the one preceding it - tomorrow will be a good day.
This year's vernal equinox, which marks the beginning of spring, is due to take place at 5:58 p.m. on Wednesday( https://www.weather.gov/dvn/Climate_Astronomical_Seasons ).
At this point, you may be wondering how the vernal equinox materially affects your life. The short answer is ... not much, at least for now.
It's basically the point at which the Earth's northern hemisphere starts tilting toward the sun, leading to gradually sunnier days.
In a couple of months, when the days feel longer and you're not freezing your face off( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/winter ), remember to think kind thoughts about the vernal equinox.
But for now, it's nominally spring in Montreal and more cold and snow is still to come.
