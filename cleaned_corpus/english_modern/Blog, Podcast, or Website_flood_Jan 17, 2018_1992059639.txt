What do you do with $7.5 million worth of publicly funded concrete barriers bought for a road race that will no longer take place( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mayor-elect-plante-martin-coiteux-explore-ways-to-keep-montreal-moving ) in Montreal?
As far as Montreal Mayor Val√©rie Plante is concerned, you could repurpose them in time for the next round of flooding.
"While we're talking about various forms of (flood barriers), about sandbags and more sophisticated forms of technology, I think the borough of Ville-Marie has some creative suggestions on this subject," Plante told Wednesday's meeting of the city's executive committee. "I think I'll share it with you because I think it's quite creative - mobile dikes in the form of concrete barriers, because we have a lot of them in stock."
While Plante's suggestion drew some laughter, including from herself, she repeated the suggestion on her Twitter account even as the meeting continued, writing that "The concrete barriers purchased for the #( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FormuleE ) could serve as temporary dikes during the next round of flooding. Thanks to the creativity of our team in Ville-Marie (borough)."
The purchase of the barriers raised eyebrows - and the ire of Plante, then head of the official opposition - when their $7.5-million price tag became known just days before last July's Formula E race. Critics pointed out the barriers could have been rented for considerably less, although the administration of Denis Coderre argued they could be reused for other events.
One of Plante's first major acts as mayor of Montreal was to announce last month that the Formula E race had been cancelled after it became clear the event had been less than a success despite the city's $24-million investment.
Plante mused about recycling the barriers during a presentation by the city's civil protection department( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/documents/Adi_Public/CE/CE_DA_ORDI_2018-01-17_08h30_Inondations_2017.pdf ) to the executive committee detailing the city's response to last year's spring flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) and its costs.
The committee was told the emergency response teams and resources deployed during the month-long flooding cost more than $8 million, and while the response was, on the whole, successful, more could be done to improve communications between emergency personnel and the borough authorities.
The report also recommended that more be done to identify areas vulnerable to flooding and measures taken to mitigate damage once the flooding occurred.
