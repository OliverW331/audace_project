A heavy accumulation of snow and ice caused another roof to collapse in the borough of Montreal North early Tuesday, the second incident to occur in the borough in as many days.
The latest incident, which occurred at 2 a.m., saw the roof of an industrial building on Forest St. cave in. As was the case a day earlier at an auto parts shop on Edgar St., heavy accumulation of snow and ice atop a flat roof supported by cement pillars led to the collapse, a Montreal fire department spokesperson said.
There were no injuries in either incident.
The Montreal fire department is repeating its warning to building owners to ensure the roofs of their buildings are not at risk( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-reminds-building-owners-to-clear-the-snow-from-roofs-balconies ). Telltale signs of dangerous accumulation include cracked walls, doors not fitting into their frames and warping of the ceiling.
They caution also not to put too much confidence in warmer temperatures doing the work for them, since in many cases eavestroughs and drains remain blocked with ice and debris.
The two latest incidents followed a Sunday snowfall of more than 10 centimetres over the Montreal area.
