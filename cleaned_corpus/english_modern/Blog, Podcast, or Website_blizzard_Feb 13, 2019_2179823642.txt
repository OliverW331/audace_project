2 p.m.: Part of Highway 13 closed
Northbound Highway 13 in Laval at Notre Dame Blvd. in the city's Chomedey district has been completely closed to traffic after a tanker truck flipped onto its side after skidding into the median.
Two years ago during a snowstorm, hundreds of people were stranded on Highway 13( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/highway-13-how-a-minor-problem-snowballed-into-a-fiasco ) after two trucks got stuck in snow. There are no reports of stranded motorists this time.

1:20 p.m.: Clear your car exhaust pipe
A warning from the Montreal Children's Hospital trauma centre( https://www.facebook.com/lechildren/posts/10156710577552254 ):
"With the severe snowstorm currently underway and the copious accumulation of snow, remember to always clear your exhaust pipe prior to starting your car and never leave anyone in the car, including pets, while the motor is running.
"With a snowstorm such as the one we are currently experiencing, the exhaust pipe can become blocked and idling the car can lead to a deadly accumulation of carbon monoxide in the car as it has nowhere to go."
12:50 p.m.: Make that 40 centimetres
Environment Canada tells me that as of noon, 40 centimetres had fallen in Montreal.
11:50 a.m.: Warmer, wetter
A timely study( https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/uomc-con021219.php ) just came out that looks at the impact climate change could have on the weather in individual cities.
If current emissions continue, Montreal's weather in 2080 will be like that of Chester, Pennsylvania, according to University of Maryland researcher Matt Fitzpatrick. "The typical winter in Chester, Pennsylvania is 17.1°F (9.5°C) warmer and 10.7% wetter than winter in Montreal," according to the study.
Check out the study's interactive map here( https://fitzlab.shinyapps.io/cityapp/ ).
11:10 a.m.: The tally so far this winter
During a typical snow season (October to April), about 210 centimetres fall on Montreal.
So far this winter, according to Environment Canada statistics, we have received about 178 cm.
I put together this chart. February is an estimate because we don't have an official number for today's snowfall.
10:50 a.m.: Plante thanks Montrealers
By mid-day Wednesday, the city of Montreal expects about 42 centimetres of snow to have fallen.
In an update issued at 10:40 a.m., the city said snow crews have prioritized areas around hospitals, public transport stops and major arteries. They are currently focused on spreading abrasives and plowing streets and sidewalks.
"Despite the magnitude of the storm that has raged since last night, we see traffic is moving rather well," Mayor Valérie Plante said. "I thank the Montrealers who heard us and reduced their travel as much as possible to facilitate snow removal operations and clear access for emergency vehicles."
Starting tonight, about 2,200 snow removal vehicles will begin the loading operation, expected to take seven to eight days, the city says.
Jean-François Parenteau, the executive-committee member responsible for snow clearing, urged Montrealers to respect no-parking signs and to steer clear of snow-removal vehicles.
10:10 a.m.: Snow has tapered off
MétéoMédia says about 38 centimetres of snow have fallen in the Montreal region and counting. It's the biggest storm of the season so far. Scattered flurries are expected to end by early this afternoon.
Forecasters are expecting a bit more snow in the coming days. And maybe some rain on Friday. But Saturday is shaping up to be a nice day.

Colleague Philip Authier reports from Quebec City:
In Quebec City, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters the province appears to be coping with the storm and there have not been major incidents or deaths.
"Thanks to everyone for their work. We are continuing to follow the situation closely. The storm is moving on to eastern Quebec.
"I really want to thank citizens who contributed to this collective effort and all the personnel working to make sure everyone is safe on our roads."
Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he was in the Transport Quebec control centre at midnight and things were going well.
"We are following the situation well. We thank people for having adapted their driving and everyone who is working."

7:15 a.m.: Roads are in bad shape
The Sûreté du Québec says dozens of cars have skidded off highways since last night. But there have been no major crashes on its territory.
Montreal's police force is reminding drivers to clear all the snow off their cars before setting off. If you're driving a "mobile igloo," you won't be able to see the situation around you, and snow flying off your car could affect other drivers.
If you must use your car, for everyone's safety, adapt your driving to the #RoadConditions( https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadConditions?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Reduce your speed, increase your following distance and remove all the snow from the car. No mobile igloo.

7 a.m.: Take transit if you can, or stay home
Officials are urging Montrealers to stay home and if they can't to use public transit instead of cars.
But if you decide to take the bus, the STM says you should expect delays due to the weather and road conditions.
