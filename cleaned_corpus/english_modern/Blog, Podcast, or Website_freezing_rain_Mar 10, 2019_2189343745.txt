While the temperature might have risen slightly on Saturday, spring is not around the corner. Environment Canada is warning the greater Montreal area can expect to receive between 10 and 15 centimetres of snow starting on Sunday morning.
"Expect poor travelling conditions due to low visibilities and snow accumulation on the roads," the federal weather forecasting service warned.
That snow could turn into freezing rain in the afternoon and is expected to continue overnight. Further flurries are expected on Monday.
However, the worst of the storm - the result of a low-pressure system from Colorado - is expected to hit north and east of the city.
Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning for southern parts of the Mauricie, Lanaudière, Laurentides and Quebec City regions, as well as the northern part of the Centre-du-Québec region.
Those areas are expected to get more than 15 centimetres of snow and strong winds could cause blowing snow.
Environment Canada is encouraging people to modify non-essential travel plans and remove snow from roofs as the weight of the heavy snow that's expected could cause roof collapses.
Montrealers can look forward to warmer temperatures, though, with a high of two degrees and a low minus-one in the forecast for Sunday.
