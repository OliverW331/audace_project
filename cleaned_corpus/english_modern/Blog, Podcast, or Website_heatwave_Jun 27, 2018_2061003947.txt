Stifling heat will probably affect Canada Day activities, according to Environment Canada.
The agency issued a special weather statement Wednesday morning for the greater Montreal area, saying rain showers Wednesday evening and Thursday are expected to clear by the weekend as a warm and humid air mass moves into the province.
Temperatures were forecast to hit 27 degrees Celsius Wednesday, with a UV index of 8 - very high.
The heat wave will last into next week. Daytime highs are expected to hit 30 to 35 degrees and might feel like 40 because of the humidity. The weather statement covers most of southern Quebec as well as parts of Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I.
The agency said heat warnings may be issued for the weekend.
