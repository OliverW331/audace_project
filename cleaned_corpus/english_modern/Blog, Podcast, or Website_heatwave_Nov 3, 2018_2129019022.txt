Here's a look at Valérie Plante's eventful debut year as Montreal's mayor.
2017 November
. After running an energetic, upbeat, mobility-focused campaign, Valérie Plante of Projet Montréal wins the election( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-election-results-valerie-plante-headed-from-obscurity-to-history ), riding a wave of dissatisfaction with incumbent Denis Coderre to become the city's first female mayor.
. The incoming administration says it is surprised to find a $358-million budgetary shortfall( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/projet-montreals-first-challenge-a-358-million-budget-shortfall-report ) left behind by Coderre. It says it will have to make up for the deficit in its first budget.
. Plante unveils her executive committee. It features an equal number of women and men but includes no visible minorities or anglophones( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-executive-committee-will-reflect-balance-diversity-plante-says ).
The "Bonjour-Hi" controversy: Plante says "Bonjour" should be encouraged but won't say whether "Hi" should be dropped.
December
. After Quebec's National Assembly urged merchants to drop "Bonjour-Hi" as a greeting, Plante is asked if she will encourage the use of Bonjour( https://montrealgazette.com/news/valerie-plante-supports-bonjour-but-wont-say-if-hi-should-be-dropped ). "As mayor, I can't impose rules but ... Montreal is the francophone metropolis of North America," she says. "It's an asset, it's a plus and we want to showcase it." But she won't say if 'Hi' should be dropped.
. The Quebec government suspends Montreal chief of police Philippe Pichet after a damning report about the force's internal affairs division.
. Plante cancels the 2018 Formula E electric-car race( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/in-the-wake-of-bombshell-reports-mayor-to-address-formula-es-future-in-montreal ), one of Coderre's pet projects, after being unable to agree on a location with the event's promoters. During the election, she had vowed to move the event out of downtown Montreal.
. The new administration does away with a controversial bylaw that put strict limits on pit bull-type dogs( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-suspends-pit-bull-ban-will-consult-before-reworking-bylaw ), saying such dogs are no longer considered a dangerous breed in Montreal. It promises a new bylaw later in the year.
When the Plante administration unveils its first budget, the tax hike sparks a backlash.
2018 January
. The provincial government agrees to help pay for 300 new hybrid buses for the Société de transport de Montréal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-quebec-will-purchase-300-new-hybrid-buses-for-stm ), one of Plante's election promises.
. Plante unveils her first budget. The average tax bill will go up by 3.3 per cent( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-mayor-valerie-plante-hikes-taxes-more-than-expected ) in 2018. To many, that appears to break her promise not to increase taxes by more than the inflation rate, which in 2018 was to be 2.1 per cent. Suburbs are blindsided by the average 5.3-per-cent hike in what they'll have to pay the city - more than twice what they were expecting.
. Plante's tax hike sparks a backlash. Plante brushes aside criticism, saying she wasn't actually reneging on a pledge because the beyond-inflation increase was due to a hike in the water tax, not the city's "general tax." She later admits her administration could have done a better job( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-budget-we-could-have-been-more-clear-before-raising-taxes-valerie-plante-says ) explaining the budget.
. Plante's snow-clearing point person, Jean-François Parenteau, apologizes after an uproar over icy sidewalks and slow snow removal( https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-snow-crisis-more-like-snow-fiasco ). Plante promises to do better, spending more on salt, ordering bigger blowers for overflowing snow dumps and investing in "ice crushers" to deal with sidewalks.
The first and last Formula E race in Montreal in July 2017. Only 13,646 people paid to watch the race, organizers later reveal.
February
. It turns out 30,000 tickets( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-formula-e-10000-more-freebies-than-previously-revealed ) (10,000 more than originally thought) were given away for the 2017 Formula E, says the non-profit agency running the race as it reveals a deficit of almost $14 million. It later emerges that 35,000 tickets were actually given away; only 13,646 people paid to watch the race.
. One of Plante's top lieutenants, Plateau-Mont-Royal borough mayor Luc Ferrandez says of the tax-hike election promise( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/ferrandez-accuses-plante-administration-of-amateurism ): "We never, never should have promised that in the election campaign. It was amateurism." Some interpret it as a swipe at Plante.
. Details emerge of a pilot project to temporarily eliminate through traffic( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plan-to-stop-through-traffic-over-mount-royal-gets-mixed-reviews ) on Mount Royal. Many are surprised by the plan but during the election campaign, Projet Montréal had said it would "implement a plan for the progressive reduction of transit traffic" on Mount Royal.
. Some of the most vulnerable seniors, including anglophones and immigrants, are being excluded by the Plante administration's plan to consult elderly Montrealers( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/anglophones-immigrants-left-out-of-citys-consultations-on-seniors-researchers ) on how to make Montreal more senior-friendly, according to two research organizations. More meetings are added to assuage critics.
. Plante announces a committee will look into providing free or cheaper transit to seniors, children and people on low incomes( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-announces-consultation-on-reducing-transit-fares ). This fulfills an election promise.

. Plante sets up an advisory committee on diversity issues( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/new-advisory-committee-to-help-montreal-better-represent-minorities ) that will include people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as Indigenous Peoples, the LGBTQ community and those with reduced mobility.
The Mount Royal project: a segment of Camillien-Houde Way/Remembrance Rd. is closed to traffic from June 2 to Oct. 31.
April
. Plante says she is "very open" to letting Montreal police officers wear religious garb( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-doesnt-rule-out-hijabs-turbans-in-police-force ).
. A $21.2-million plan to encourage people to buy homes in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/plante-makes-announcement-on-housing ) is unveiled. The highest subsidies - up to $15,000 - are for families with children who purchase a newly built dwelling in the downtown core valued at up to $450,000. This fulfills an election promise.
. Plante announces a $123-million plan to remake a stretch of Ste-Catherine St. W( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-unveils-plan-for-ste-catherine ).

. In a scathing report, Montreal's inspector-general says former mayor Coderre's office( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/coderre-did-not-follow-rules-on-formula-e-inspector-general ) set up a non-profit organization to skirt the law on awarding contracts for the 2017 Formula E.

. West Island motorists and mayors denounce a decision by Quebec and Montreal to not allow cars on a planned access route( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/boulevard-to-access-kirkland-rem-station-wont-be-open-to-cars ) to the Kirkland station of the new Réseau express métropolitain electric light-rail line. Only buses and bikes will be allowed. A planned parking lot is also scrapped.

Legault says Plante's Pink métro line proposal is too expensive but says if it can be built cheaper and above ground, he is open to talking about it.

. Montreal opts not to pass its own cannabis bylaw( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreals-rules-for-pot-will-be-same-as-smoking-cigarettes-plante ), instead sticking with provincial rules that allow marijuana use in parks and streets.

If they receive funding from Montreal, non-profit organizations will be subject to the same access-to-information rules as the city( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-could-extend-freedom-of-information-to-paramunicipals ), Plante announces.
