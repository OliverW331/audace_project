The federal agency notes that a "warm and humid air mass from the United States will track into southern Quebec today. High temperatures combined with humidity will cause the Humidex values near 40 this afternoon," adding that "uncomfortable conditions will be particularly felt in these areas."
The high today is expected to be 31C( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-8 ), feeling like 40 when combined with the humidity. There is a 60 per cent chance of showers and thundershowers this afternoon, dropping to a 40 per cent chance in the evening.
Extreme heat can represent risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.
