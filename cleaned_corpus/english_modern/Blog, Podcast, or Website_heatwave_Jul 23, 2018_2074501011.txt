Forecasting that the Humidex value is expected to reach 40C, Environment Canada extended its heat warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1735280011683071624201807220504ww1070cwul ) for Montreal, Laval, Longueuil-Varennes and Ch√¢teauguay-La Prairie through to Monday evening.
In the warning, issued Monday morning, the federal agency noted that a "warm and humid air mass from the United States will track into southern Quebec today. High temperatures combined with humidity will produce Humidex values hovering around 40," adding that "uncomfortable conditions will be particularly felt in these areas."
The high today is expected to be 31C( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-weather-8 ), feeling like 40 when combined with the humidity. There is a 40 per cent chance of showers through the evening. The temperature will not go below 20C overnight.
Extreme heat can represent risks for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.
Heat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.
Youssef Amane, a spokesperson for the city's executive committee said officials will be watching forecasts closely for the next few days, but had no plan for now to issue an alert, or an intervention for extreme heat, because the average predicted temperatures are not expected to be as high as the heat wave that killed more than 50 people earlier this month.
