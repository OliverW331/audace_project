Parents of Quebec mosque killer Alexandre Bissonnette say his sentence is too harsh( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/parents-of-quebec-mosque-killer-alexandre-bissonnette-say-his-sentence-is-too-harsh )
Bissonnette received an automatic life sentence when he pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder last year. On Friday, Quebec Superior Court Justice François Huot determined that Bissonnette will have to serve 40 years of that life sentence before he becomes eligible for full parole( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-sentenced-to-40-years ). The Crown had requested Bissonnette, who is now 29, serve 150 years before he is eligible for parole, which would have guaranteed Bissonnette would be dead before he could appear before the Parole Board of Canada. On Monday, Bissonnette's parents, Manon Marchand and Raymond Bissonnette, sent a letter to media outlets stating they "consider this to be a very severe sentence."
Winter Laboratory looks at how Montrealers can enjoy a punishing season( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-laboratory-looks-at-how-montrealers-can-enjoy-a-punishing-season )
As Montreal hunkers down for what's predicted to be the worst snowstorm of the year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/evolution-of-the-storm-delay-travel-montrealers-told-ahead-of-mega-blizzard ), it may be heartening to discover there's a Winter Laboratory in the works to help Quebecers better appreciate what many look upon as their long season of discontent. While Montreal does well at large winter events like Igloofest( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/igloofest-old-port-music-event-puts-the-party-on-ice ), planners note it is lacking in widespread urban offerings that can help alleviate the winter blahs. Included among the key mood-lifting strategies are more small-scale public spaces for winter activities, adding refrigerated rinks, allowing outdoor or enclosed terrasses, and doing whatever it takes to combat slush.

CAQ government open to playing ball in Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-government-open-to-playing-ball-in-montreal )
The Coalition Avenir Québec government is very interested in the possible return of Major League Baseball to Montreal( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/baseball-commish-says-montreal-certainly-is-a-candidate-for-expansion ). But while the party says it is ready to spend taxpayers' money to bring back a team, it also insists the project would have to be financially viable, with revenues exceeding spending. "We are very open," said Chantal Rouleau( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/inside-the-caq-cabinet-francois-legault-names-13-women-13-men ), the minister responsible for the Montreal region, as she emerged from a cabinet meeting Wednesday. "We are in favour of the return of baseball to Montreal.
STM says it didn't have enough buses to go around in 2018( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-says-it-didnt-have-enough-buses-to-go-around-in-2018 )
The city's transit agency says hundreds of thousands of Montrealers have already been inconvenienced this year by its maintenance union's lack of productivity. "For the first five weeks of 2019, 430,000 customers were affected by cuts in service," Sylvain St-Denis, a supervisor at the Société de transport de Montréal's control centre, told a hearing at the Tribunal administratif de travail on Thursday. The STM asked the tribunal to intervene, claiming mechanics in its maintenance union are purposely working slower than usual because of a labour dispute, and that it amounts to an illegal pressure tactic.

CAQ election was more 'desire for change' than green light for party ideas, study says( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/caq-election-was-more-desire-for-change-than-green-light-for-party-ideas-study-says )
A new study indicates the October election of the Coalition Avenir Québec government was more driven by Quebecers' desire for change than an endorsement of the party's often controversial vision and policies. In fact, the study concludes, 40 per cent of Quebecers who voted CAQ today oppose the new government's plans to slash immigration levels by 20 per cent even though the CAQ repeatedly says it thinks it has a strong electoral mandate to proceed. The study( http://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/february-2019/quebec-2018-les-raisons-du-vote/ ), published Thursday in the web magazine Policy Options, operated by the Institute for Research on Public Policy, includes fresh poll data produced by the Ipsos firm. The poll concludes the movement that carried François Legault to power was above all "circumstantial" and motivated by Quebecers' desire for a change of regime after nearly 15 years of Liberal rule.
