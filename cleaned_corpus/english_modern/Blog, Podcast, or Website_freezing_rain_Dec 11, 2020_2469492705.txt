Cloudy, five degrees above zero. That meteorological period between the cozy walks of fall and the snowy wonder of winter will continue for the next few days. If you want to get out, though, today will be the day to do it because Saturday and Sunday will be rain and snow. There's even a special weather statement from Environment Canada warning of potential freezing rain, but they don't have a clear forecast for it yet.
Tonight, we're predicting a low of zero.
The sun isn't expected to return until next Tuesday, but by then temperatures will have plummeted with lows in the minus-teens.
But hey, two weeks until Christmas!
