The work of more than 500 repair crews deployed north of Montreal by Hydro-Québec since Monday was making itself felt Thursday morning, with the number of clients in Laval, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions without power standing at a little over 12,000.
At the height of the blackouts, caused by a weather system of freezing rain and high winds that punched a hole through much of the utility's distribution network, 313,000 clients had been left in the cold and dark( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ). But by 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Hydro-Québec was reporting 5,569 clients were still off the grid in the Laurentians, 4,117 had yet to be reconnected in the Lanaudière and 2,557 were without power in Laval.
Since Monday, many residents in the affected areas tried to warm themselves up by using barbecues and other outdoor heating sources inside their homes, a practice that saw dozens of cases carbon monoxide intoxication but no fatalities thus far.
On Wednesday Hydro-Québec's task was complicated( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-hit-80000-in-montreals-north-and-east-ends ) by numerous mini-outages caused falling branches and other debris, a situation that made it impossible to restore power to large areas with a single, major repair.
However Wednesday's clear weather allowed repair crews, some of whom came from the United States as reinforcements, to concentrate on hard-hit areas( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/208000-down-105000-to-go-hydro-crews-make-progress-in-laval-lanaudiere-and-laurentians ) without worries the system would be damaged by further by the elements.
Municipalities in the affected zones set up warming stations for residents to eat a meal, take shelter and, in some cases, take a shower until their power was restored.
Environment Canada forecasts that the weather will remain clear for the rest of the week, although temperatures north of Montreal will be cool.
