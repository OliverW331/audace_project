Motorists and pedestrians take note: it could be a slippery Sunday.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement Saturday warning residents of southwestern Quebec weather conditions might be hazardous on the roads and sidewalks.
After a relatively dry Saturday, significant precipitation is expected for the Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Ch√¢teauguay and Outaouais regions. Up to 10 centimetres of snow are expected to fall starting Sunday morning when the temperatures will be hovering just below the freezing point. As temperatures rise in the afternoon, the snow could mix with freezing rain before it turns to rain in the evening.
Sunday appears to be the outlier, as most of the week is expected to be dry and relatively warm, with temperatures climbing as high as 8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, according to the Weather Network.
Overnight temperatures are forecast to stay below freezing, which means perfect temperatures for sap to flow in maple trees.
