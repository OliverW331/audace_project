In a broad sense, glamping has simply come to represent an experience with nature that doesn't mean sacrificing comfort. But to find out whether your experience qualifies, you can ask yourself some specific questions. Is there a chandelier hanging in your tent? You're probably glamping. Do you have a butler who brings s'mores containing single-origin chocolate to your glass-ceiling geodesic dome? Definitely glamping. Have you woken up in a panic because everything around you is mysteriously damp, you seem to have an aggressively friendly bug in your sleeping bag, and there's an alarming howling that, oh my god, is it getting closer? Probably regular old camping.
And who wants that?
Glamping now encompasses a range of options, from supreme luxury to rustic charm. Some purveyors offer down-filled duvets, on-site organic farms, plunge pools, crystal stemware and guided stargazing or wildlife-spotting excursions. Accommodation categories include pods, ice hotels, barns, farmhouses, cabins, wilderness lodges, Airstreams and more. As a testament to how strong the trend is, the first Global Glamping Summit was held in Colorado this month.
It's a trend that is especially popular with families, says John Romfo, chief operating officer of Glamping.com. "Kids love to sing and roast marshmallows and the parents love that they're having a glass of wine with a butler to prepare everything." It also suits millennials who are perennially in search of more immersive, experiential, atypical and highly documentable travel. "What's cooler than a picture of you soaking in your woodfired cedar hot tub high in a treehouse?" he asks.
Even conventional hotels are getting into the glamping action, developing one-of-akind outdoor accommodation experiences that help them stand out, says Ruben Martinez, co-founder of GlampingHub.com. The Four Seasons Beverly Wiltshire (fourseasons.com/beverlywilshire), for example, offers "A night with the stars" in a pristine rooftop tent decked out with a queen-size bed, antique furniture and fur rugs.
