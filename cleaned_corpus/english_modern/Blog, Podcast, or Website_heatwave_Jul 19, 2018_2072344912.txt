Regardless of whether the sun shines, the temperature rises to 31 C or it pours rain, there are plenty of free events and activities around town to keep you busy on the weekends. (Which is good news since Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ) is predicting all three types of weather in the next few days.)
Here are some freebies happening in and around Montreal from Friday, July 20 to Sunday, July 22:
Movies in the park... and indoors
Tis the season for free outdoor film screenings, now that the heat wave is behind us and sitting outside is enjoyable again. Cinemania( https://www.festivalcinemania.com/en/featured/cinemania-unveils-its-summer-program ) will be screening the award-winning "farmland thriller" Bloody Milk on Saturday at 9 p.m. on the terrace of Renoir at the Sofitel Hotel Golden Mile downtown. On Sunday, Film Noir au Canal( http://filmnoiraucanal.org/ ) will present Jean Renoir's Les Bas-Fonds (French with English subtitles) at 9 p.m. in St-Patrick's Square.

And if it rains, there's always the Fantasia International Film Festival, with numerous indoor screenings all weekend (at a cost). Speaking of Fantasia...
An immersive Fantasia experience( https://fantasiafestival.com/en/programs/experience-fantasia-vr-1 )
Along with the vast array of feature films( https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movies/18-crazy-films-at-22nd-fantasia-festival-from-nicolas-cage-to-kung-fu ) and shorts being screened at Concordia University until Aug. 2, the Fantasia Film Festival is presenting 13 virtual reality experiences this weekend. From Thursday until Saturday, festivalgoers can immerse themselves in the works of French film director Alexandre Aja, Canadian playwright Jean Yoon as well as Montreal's Maude Thibodeau and Chantal Dumas - to name just four.
The event will be held in the atrium in front of Concordia's J.A. DeSève Theatre from July 19 to 21 between noon and 8 p.m. Sessions last 20 minutes, and participants are encouraged to vote for their favourite film.
You can't go wrong with fireworks( https://www.laronde.com/fr/larondefr/linternational-des-feux/feufive )
Finish your Saturday with a bang (or several). The Philippines' Dragon Fireworks Inc. will light up the sky this weekend in their first competition at L'International des Feux Loto-Québec. The theme: video games, arcade games and TV series. We're talking everything from Super Mario to Game of Thrones to Angry Birds.
As always, liftoff is at 10 p.m.
Special mention: Osheaga block party( https://www.evenko.ca/en/events/14186/block-party-gatineau/downtown-gatineau/07-21-2018 )
If you find yourself in Gatineau on Saturday, drop by the Osheaga block party as a prelude to the three-day blowout running in Montreal from Aug. 3 to 5 (or as a cheap alternative if you're not willing to shell out $320 for a general admission weekend pass to the festival).
Doors open at 2 p.m. in downtown Gatineau with an impressive assortment of Montreal talent, including producer Shash'U, rapper FouKi and urban electro DJ Poirier.
