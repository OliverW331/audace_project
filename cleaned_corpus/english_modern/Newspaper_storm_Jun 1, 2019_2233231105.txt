Re: "Legault presents an electric vision of a greener future for Quebec" (Montreal Gazette, May 27) Banning all fossil-fuel heating by converting entirely to electric now seems the favourite way for Quebec politicians to make a statement for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Considering the unreliable nature of Hydro-Qu√©bec's wooden-pole overhead power-distribution network, a loss of electricity is only a wind or ice storm away, leaving countless homes without vital heat for undetermined periods of time.
Let's hope common sense prevails by at least exempting the popular electric-fossil fuel hybrids, such as Dualand now Tri-Energy systems in which the oil/gas heat only kicks in below -12 C, reducing total emissions up to 90 per cent compared to a single-source fuel heating system.
And while not ideal, it leaves the option to install a small standby generator to power the fuel furnace and other domestic essentials during an outage.
