Quebec's transport minister says "swift action" will be taken to improve safety on Highway 15 where dozens of people were injured in a multi-car pileup Wednesday.
While he repeated the stretch of road is not considered an accident-prone area, Transport Minister François Bonnardel said he has heard the voices of citizens and local mayors who said it is not safe.
"Yes, beyond the statistics, the area did not have more accidents than elsewhere in Quebec," he said. "But I know the area well. It is an an area which can be risky under certain weather conditions."
The Sûreté du Québec said Thursday that one of the 29 people injured in Wednesday's monster pileup( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/multiple-injuries-reported-in-pileup-on-highway-15-in-brossard ) remains in serious condition in a hospital. Two people were killed in the accident. The Quebec coroner's office identified the dead as Charles Rivard, 54, and Pierre Boudreau, 69, both of them residents of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Highway 15 was reopened to traffic around 1 a.m., nearly 12 hours after the crash.
In all, about 200 vehicles were involved in the crash that appeared to have been caused by a sudden blizzard on Highway 15 in La Prairie.
The SQ confirmed the two deaths around 8 p.m. Wednesday. It appears the victims had been stuck in their vehicles for several hours, as they were only pulled out at 6 p.m. SQ Sgt. Stéphane Tremblay said they were surrounded in debris and carnage from the crash, which made it difficult for them to be extricated.

Bonnardel noted Transport Quebec trucks passed through the area at 11:26 a.m. and again at 11:56 a.m. Wednesday. The white out hit 25 minutes later.
Bonnardel said he asked his team Wednesday evening what can be done as of next summer to make the road safer. That could involve signs warning about high winds, or more vegetation.
"Do we need to erect a wall? These are things we can look at," he said. "We are looking all the options."
Bonnardel noted witnesses did say some motorists were travelling too fast in the area.
"We will have to take action rapidly next summer to prevent these types of accidents," he said.
