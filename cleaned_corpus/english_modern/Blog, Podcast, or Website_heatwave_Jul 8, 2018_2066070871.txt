The Montreal morgue has become crowded as a direct result of the heatwave that swept across southern Quebec over the past week.
La Presse has reported that the coroner's office had to make an agreement with a funeral home( http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/201807/06/01-5188633-la-morgue-de-montreal-deborde.php ) to house some of the remains.
Over the past week, public health officials have emphasized how the intense heat leaves elderly people who live alone at risk. Many of the bodies examined by coroners in recent days were in a state of advanced decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat in a dwelling before being found, according to Jean Brochu, a Montreal coroner.
All deaths associated with the heat wave are considered "traumatic" and are the subject of a coroner's inquest. The data collected is used to establish trends and is likely to influence public health interventions in the future.
Unclaimed bodies occupy a significant amount of the 128 places available at the morgue, Brochu said.
