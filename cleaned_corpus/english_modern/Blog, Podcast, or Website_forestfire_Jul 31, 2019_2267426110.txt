Members of the environmental group Greenpeace raised banners in downtown Montreal on Wednesday morning to focus public attention on the effects of the oil industry on climate change.
The 13-by-3-foot banners were raised at the corner of de la Gaucheti√®re St. and Robert-Bourassa Blvd. Each depicts an environmental disaster: drought, extreme heat, flooding, forest fires and violent storms.
Urban artist Roadsworth, whose real name is Peter Gibson, collaborated on the posters.
Greenpeace says the posters were raised at the same time the group held similar events in 25 other cities, including Manila, Athens, Oslo, New York and Amsterdam.
