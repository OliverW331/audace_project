A nasty spring storm that will bring ice pellets, freezing rain and strong winds to the greater Montreal region could lead to treacherous conditions on highways, roads and sidewalks on Monday, Environment Canada says.
Between 10 and 20 millimetres of precipitation is predicted to fall by Monday evening, with several hours of freezing rain expected, Environment Canada says in a weather warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#1614327341268895851201804140504ww1070cwul ) it issued for island of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Varennes, La Prairie and Châteauguay areas.
The freezing rain could cause roads and walkways to "become icy, slippery and hazardous," the agency says, making for a tricky morning and evening commute.
Power outages and falling tree branches may also occur during the slow-moving storm.
The English Montreal School Board sent out a tweet on Sunday night saying officials "will be monitoring the road conditions as the safety of our students and staff remains our priority."
The city of Montreal will spread salt and other abrasives on streets and sidewalks and Transport Québec has asked its contractors to spread abrasives on the highways.
Motorists who have had their winter tires removed need to be vigilant when driving on slick highways on Monday, said Mila Roy, a spokesperson for Transport Quebec.
Roy suggested that using public transit would be a better option than driving, if possible.
The storm may cause flight delays or cancellations at Trudeau Airport. Check with your airline( https://www.admtl.com/en/flights/departures )before heading to the airport.
The storm wreaked havoc as it crossed Ontario, causing hundreds of traffic accidents and power outages.
There is rain in the forecast for Montreal for the rest of the week, according to Environment Canada.
