'I felt like a damn fool': He fell prey to the paving scammers with Irish accents( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/irish-accented-driveway-pavers-scam-elderly-west-island-couple )
Theodore can't believe he fell for it. The 90-year-old Pierrefonds resident was the victim of a driveway paving scheme that roped in many West Islanders last month. His trusting nature cost him $3,500. For weeks, he didn't even want to talk about it, until his daughter convinced him his story could help others avoid the same ruse. Last Thursday, Montreal police issued photos of six men, age 25 to 45, who went around the West Island last month wearing orange vests and suckering residents with a scam( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/police-seek-irish-accented-paving-scammers-working-in-the-west-island ) that sounded all too familiar to Theodore. What's more, he recognized at least two of the suspects, and the fact that the police said they had Irish accents.
Cannabis: CAQ government raises consumption age to 21 in Quebec( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/as-of-jan-1-2020-quebecers-will-need-to-be-21-to-consume-cannabis )
The legal age to consume cannabis in Quebec will go from 18 to 21 as of Jan. 1. A year after the government tabled Bill 2 tightening the already strict cannabis consumption rules adopted by the previous Liberal government, the National Assembly Tuesday held a final vote on the legislation. The score was 64 for and 43 against with MNAs in the three opposition parties - Liberal, Québec solidaire and Parti Québécois - all voting against. Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs, including Premier François Legault, voted in favour. The section of the law setting the legal age comes into effect in 60 days (Jan. 1, 2020) because the government wants to give consumers and state-run cannabis stores( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-cannabis-stores-report-1-4-million-in-net-income-during-second-quarter ) time to adjust to the new system, junior health minister Lionel Carmant told reporters after adoption.
Study points to 'problematic' lack of English in Quebec health care( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/study-points-to-problematic-lack-of-english-in-quebec-health-care )
A new provincial government study has found a significant number of English-speaking Quebecers across the province "face language barriers in their daily lives" when it comes to accessing health care - a finding that appears to be at odds with the current position of the CAQ government. In January, Premier François Legault said he would not reverse a decision to remove English from longstanding signs at a hospital in Lachute despite concerns raised by nine mayors in the lower Laurentians( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-wont-protect-bilingual-signs-in-lachute-hospital-legault ). Legault said he was standing by a decision from the Office québécois de la langue française ordering the signs to be taken down in a region where English is the first language for about 15 per cent of the population. The study( https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/2585_portrait_communautes_linguistiques_reseaux_territoriaux_services.pdf ) by the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) notes obtaining health services is "problematic" for nearly 6 per cent of the population of Quebec - 454,000 people - who still cannot speak French.

#Halloweengate: Quebec's delay being met with mockery online( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebecs-halloween-delay-being-met-with-mockery-online )
Talk about your shared Quebec values. Less than 24 hours after the mayor of the Ste-Julie on the South Shore announced that her town would be "postponing" Halloween from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1 because of a poor-weather forecast( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) and even as nearly two dozen other municipalities( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/who-is-delaying-and-who-is-going-ahead-with-halloween-today ) - including Montreal - followed suit, online mockery and debate of the decision has been fast and furious. Many of the comments on the Montreal Gazette Facebook( https://www.facebook.com/montrealgazette/ ) page focused on whether municipalities had any business deciding when Halloween would be celebrated no matter what the weather: "Why are they, "municipalities," focusing on moving a holiday - as a parent you decide what is best for your child (find it unsafe - stay home and do something special for you kids - maybe buy candy, dress up for dinner, Halloween movie - use your imagination)."
Three cars were damaged by s fallen tree on Lorne St. in the McGill Ghetto on Friday, Nov. 1, 2019.
Some power outages from violent storm will last into next week, Hydro-Québec says( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark )
Many Quebecers will have to make do without electricity until next week as Hydro-Québec struggles to restore power after a violent windstorm left more than 800,000 clients in the dark Friday. Wind gusts snapped many branches and trees, which in turn severed power lines. Many wood electrical poles were also damaged. The hardest hit areas: the Montérégie, Montreal and the Laurentians. The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree. With blackouts set to last days, some local governments set up warming centres. Quebec City welcomed residents on Friday evening, while in Montreal, the Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough said four buildings would be open on Saturday for those still without power.
