In 1974, when moving from St-Laurent to the West Island, our real estate agent advised us to consider the flood plains of Montreal when choosing to live here.
Later or around that same time, the Montreal Gazette published an image of those well-known areas.
Though I sympathize with people who are awaiting government help, they also must realize they compromised their situation by moving to and living in those fragile places.
Perhaps when help comes, they will reconsider remaining where they are and move elsewhere.
The view might not be the same, but at least they will not see the water so close up.
