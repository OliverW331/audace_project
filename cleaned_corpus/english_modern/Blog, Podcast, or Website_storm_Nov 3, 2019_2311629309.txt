Almost all of the homes and businesses that lost power as a result ofFriday's windstorm( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ) will have electricity restored by Sunday evening, Quebec Premier François Legault( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/francois-legault ) said late Saturday morning.
"We are in a situation that is the worst since the infamous 1998 ice storm. But things are improving much faster than they did in 1998," Legault said during a press conference held with Hydro-Québec president Éric Martel. "Between now and Sunday evening the majority of Quebecers should have electricity."
Legault thanked the Hydro work crews who restored power over the course of roughly 24 hours to more than half of those who experienced black-outs when the windstorm hit early Friday morning. But he noted there are remain "problematic regions" where some public may find themselves without power beyond Sunday. The regions affected are the Eastern Townships, Beauce, Montérégie and Richelieu.
The premier noted areas surrounding the cities of Granby, Sherbrooke and Drummondville were among the hardest hit by the storms because a lot of utility poles were knocked down by the storm.
Quebec Premier François Legault, left, and Hydro-Québec president and CEO Eric Martel attend a briefing in Montreal on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019, where they updated news media on the continuing power outages in the province.
He asked people to be prudent and to throw out any food that requires refrigeration if they have been without power for more than 24 hours. He also invited people to use shelters that have been set up by the government in the worst hit regions if they have no other options available.
"At Hydro-Québec we have been in an emergency situation since early (Friday) morning. We have people who have been working 24 out of 24 hours and we will keep going until every client's power is restored," Martel said, adding more than 1,000 people were working on the problem. Forty teams of utility workers are expected to arrive from Detroit on Sunday morning and contractors from New Brunswick were lending a hand on Saturday.
Arborists work to remove a large tree limb that fell on a car on Madison St. in Notre-Dame-de-Grace on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2019.
Martel noted the improved weather witnessed across most of the province on Saturday was making things much easier for work crews.
"Just to give you an idea of the scale involved, we have about 250 (utility poles) to replace. To replace a pole takes between five and seven hours," Martel said, while adding at least 2,500 trees fell on power lines across the province.
Martel was unable to estimate the cost of repairing the damage caused by the storm.
As of 10 p.m. Saturday, Hydro-Québec reported more than 217,000 clients were without power in the province, down from a peak of nearly 1 million on Friday. A little more than 6,000 clients in Montreal remained without electricity late Saturday afternoon. Montérégie (35,520), the Laurentians (27,492) and Chaudière-Appalaches (34,333) remained the hardest-hit regions.
Speaking from Quebec City earlier Saturday morning, Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault said: "The worst is behind us a little everywhere (across the province).
"Things are improving slowly."
Urgence Québec has set up a shelter at 987 du Conseil St. in Sherbrooke. They have also set up several locations across Quebec where people can get services, including the Centre aquatique in Blainville (to take showers) and 349 chemin Val-des-Lacs in Val-des-Lacs, a town in the Laurentians.
Urgence Québec also reports there are six centres open in Laval during the day and recommends communicating with the municipality for details. More info on available services can be found at https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/Tempete_automnale/Pages/offrir-aide.aspx( https://www.urgencequebec.gouv.qc.ca/Fr/Tempete_automnale/Pages/offrir-aide.aspx )
Hydro-Québec says it has more than 1,000 employees, including 800 linemen, working to restore the power. However, some clients in hard-hit areas will not have electricity until early next week.
Nos équipes sont toujours sur le terrain pour rétablir le service. Au plus fort de l'événement, plus de 950 000 clients étaient en #panne( https://twitter.com/hashtag/panne?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ). Il en reste environ 665 000. Le travail se poursuivra jour et nuit et pourrait prendre plusieurs jours avant le rétablissement complet. pic.twitter.com/DeybjStFc7( https://t.co/DeybjStFc7 )

The storm left one person dead - a 63-year-old man in the Eastern Townships killed when a tree fell on him as he took photos of another downed tree.
More than 34,000 Hydro-Québec clients in the Eastern Townships still had no power as of late Saturday afternoon. Guilbault noted the situation in the Townships was more challenging. The Sherbrooke area was flooded after the St-François River spilled over on Friday after a heavy rainfall. About 30 roadways were flooded after 100 mm of rain fell in and around Sherbrooke. More than 250 homes also had to be evacuated. The minister also reported about 60 homes were flooded in Cowansville.
"It is difficult to get precise figures on the number of homes flooded and evacuations because they are based on the information transferred by the municipalities. Not all municipalities communicate the information to us because take charge of the situation themselves without necessarily asking for (the provincial government's) help," Guilbault said.
