Organizers of this year's protest in Montreal( https://www.womensmarchcanada.com/women_s_march_canada_montreal_20190119 ) say on their site that "the progress made in 2017 was not enough. There is still so much work to do to protect and advance the rights of women, and the rights of all vulnerable citizens in our country."
The original Women's March in Washington in 2017 was held the day after U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration, drawing hundreds of thousands of people. The exact size of the turnout remains subject to a politically charged debate, but it's generally regarded as the largest Washington protest since the Vietnam era.
Organizer this year submitted a permit application estimating that up to 500,000 people would participate, but the actual turnout is expected to be far lower. Parallel marches were planned in dozens of U.S. cities, across Canada and around the world.
The original plan in Washington called for participants to gather on the National Mall. But with the forecast calling for snow and freezing rain and the National Park Service no longer plowing the snow, organizers changed the march's location and route to start at Freedom Plaza, a few blocks from the White House, and head down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Trump International Hotel.
