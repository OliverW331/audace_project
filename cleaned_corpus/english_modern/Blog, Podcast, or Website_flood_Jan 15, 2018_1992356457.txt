An agency tasked with monitoring the effectiveness of rules that regulate the outflows from Lake Superior and Lake Ontario wants to hear from shoreline property owners on how much of an impact last spring's flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ) had on their homes and businesses.
The online survey, conducted for the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management (GLAM) Committee, asks a variety of questions on the extent of flooding, erosion, damage to shoreline structures, and related damage to residential and business shoreline properties. Respondents will also have an opportunity to upload pictures to document the extent of flooding/erosion impacts on shoreline properties.
Officials note that while Lake Ontario residents have been quick to respond to the survey, the response rate along the St. Lawrence River so far has been low. As a result, the deadline in Quebec for completing the survey was extended to Jan. 31.
The survey should take 10-25 minutes to complete, depending on extent of damage being reported on, and can be found at the "Take the Survey" link at www.ijc.org/en_/GLAM.( http://www.ijc.org/en_/GLAM )
