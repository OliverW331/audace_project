Montrealers should brace themselves for the possibility of being force fed another weather cocktail this weekend.
Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday morning, warning that several regions - including Montreal - could face "winterly precipitation" beginning Sunday thanks to a low pressure system headed our way from the United States.
"Snow changing to freezing rain is possible for the Greater Montreal, the Outaouais and the Eastern Townships. Regions farther north may receive significant snowfall amounts," reads the statement( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67#32047390255769761201804120504ws1070cwul ), which was issued at 5:42 a.m.
The weather monitoring agency expects the storm to continue on Monday "as the band of heavy snow and freezing rain will spread toward Quebec City."
The statement notes that the weather system's track remained uncertain as of Thursday, as did the amount and type of precipitation that can be expected.
