Premier François Legault has backed away from his remarks on Islamophobia( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/premier-francois-legault-rules-out-anti-islamophobia-day-in-quebec ), after sparking a controversy by saying it does not exist in Quebec.
In a statement issued by his office Friday in the wake of the storm of angry responses sparked by his remarks Thursday, Legault clarified, saying it exists( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/terrebonne-man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-posting-anti-muslim-comments ) but is not commonplace.
"Mr. Legault wanted to say there is no current of Islamophobia in Quebec," the statement said. "Islamophobia exists in Quebec, xenophobia, racism and hatred but not a current of Islamophobia. Quebec is not Islamophobic or racist."
Reached later, Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Legault, further clarified.
"Unfortunately, there are still too many racist acts that occur in our society and we have to do all that is possible to denounce and fight hatred and intolerance," Sauves said.
"However, there is no trend or culture of Islamophobia in Quebec. Quebecers are open and tolerant and they shall continue to exhibit these qualities.
Legault's clarification follows a chorus of complaints from all quarters.
On Friday morning, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) called on Legault to retract the comment, which he made after a caucus meeting of Coalition Avenir Québec MNAs in Gatineau.
He had been explaining why he felt there was no reason to designate Jan. 29 - the date six Muslim men were murdered( https://montrealgazette.com/tag/quebec-mosque-shooting ) in a mass shooting in Quebec City in 2017 - as anti-Islamophobia Day in Quebec.
NCCM executive director Ihsaan Gardee said in a statement that the comments were insulting to the families of the victims and the Muslim communities in Quebec and Canada who are still mourning the lives lost in the attack.

He was blasted by other politicians, too.
In a tweet posted on the same day as the Liberals entered the second day of a pre-session caucus, interim leader Pierre Arcand said Islamophobia exists in Quebec as it does elsewhere and Legault should reverse his statement.
L'islamophobie existe au Québec comme ailleurs. @francoislegault( https://twitter.com/francoislegault?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) a été catégorique en affirmant que ce phénomène n'existait pas. Je l'invite à se rétracter.#PolQc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolQc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #PLQ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLQ?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #Assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/Assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )

Later, at a news conference, Arcand said he accepted Legault's clarification.
"I think he recognized that he made a mistake and corrected it," Arcand said. "I asked him to apologize and that's pretty much what he did. I am satisfied."
Québec solidaire co-spokesperson Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois also pounced, urging Legault to have a look at comments posted on his public Facebook page after he made the remarks.
François Legault semble douter que l'islamophobie soit un problème réel. Il devrait peut-être aller lire le genre de commentaires laissés sur sa propre page Facebook suite à sa présence à la commémoration des victimes de l'attentat de la mosquée de Qc...#polqc( https://twitter.com/hashtag/polqc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) #assnat( https://twitter.com/hashtag/assnat?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) pic.twitter.com/yGVrngsUw7( https://t.co/yGVrngsUw7 )

Boufeldja Benabdallah, president of the Quebec City mosque, released a letter he sent to Legault in which he expressed his disappointment.
"I felt a heavy blow and on top to that I felt betrayed since what you said (in Gatineau) was the exact opposite of what you said at Université Laval (during the recent memorial)," Benabdallah says in the letter he released to the media.
Benabdallah said he accepts that the government does not want to have an annual anti-Islamophobia day, but added:
"With all due respect to you, premier, you did not measure the gravity of this sentence that came barely 48 hours after the commemoration of the shooting at the Grand Mosque. I fear your sentence gives credence to the active fringe of society that is feeding Islamophobia."
Friday night, Legault took to Twitter to say he called Benabdallah and assured him that the CAQ government would fight racism, hatred and intolerance.
Je me suis entretenu avec M. Boufeldja BenabdAllah, président du Centre culturel islamique de Québec. Je l'ai assuré que mon gouvernement combattra le racisme, la haine et l'intolérance.

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said Friday there are Islamophobic acts in Quebec.
"We can't deny this. We can't forget that two years ago, some men were killed in cold blood when they were praying in a mosque. This is the reality," she said. "Is this what defines the Quebec people? No, but there are Islamophobic acts, and we have to be able to call it out, and act, and to raise awareness. This is for sure."
Plante said she recognizes that for some people, creating a day against Islamophobia is the way to tackle the problem. She said she is looking at other possible actions.
"Raising awareness is very important," she said. "How can we make sure that in the public discourse, we don't allow Islamophobic words and actions? To me, that's the first thing that needs to be done. It's not acceptable to say things specifically that are Islamophobic."
NCCM's Gardee wrote that, in his opinion, Legault is clearly disconnected from the reality of Islamophobia on the ground in Quebec. The NCCM said Legault's original statement pandered to populist and reactionary sentiment to the detriment of Muslims.
Statistics Canada reported in November that the number of hate motivated crimes reported to police increased sharply in Canada in 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/hate-crimes-targeting-blacks-jews-muslims-on-rise-statcan-says/wcm/9ccbab60-a97a-4e85-aa2c-6c33793f239b ), with incidents targeting black people, Jews and Muslims accounting for most of the events.
Toronto Mayor John Tory, meanwhile, has designated Jan. 29 as a day of action against Islamophobia in his city.
