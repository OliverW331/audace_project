From flooded neighbourhoods to drivers stranded all night on a highway in a blizzard, Montreal has had its share of events that show what happens when a community is not prepared for emergencies.
Mayor Valérie Plante said on Monday the city now has a strategy for dealing with extreme weather and other unforeseen events, from train derailments to terrorist attacks.
"We're very well prepared, that's for sure," Plante said at a press conference at city hall where she unveiled Montreal's resilient city strategy.
In 2014, Montreal was the first city in Canada to join 100 Resilient Cities, a movement pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, she noted. Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver jumped on board the next year.
In addition to emergencies, the strategy also addresses poverty, inequality and aging infrastructures.
Actions so far have included promoting awareness of emergency preparedness, setting up the Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence, identifying emergency shelters across the city, promoting urban agriculture and revising urban planning to mitigate flood risks.
Plante noted that while the city is better prepared for weather-related emergencies, other catastrophes like terrorist threats are harder to plan for.
The city, she added, lacks jurisdiction over some aspects of emergency planning, like rail transportation, to prevent disasters like the 2013 Lac-Mégantic derailment that killed 47 people when a freight train carrying crude oil derailed near the Maine border.
