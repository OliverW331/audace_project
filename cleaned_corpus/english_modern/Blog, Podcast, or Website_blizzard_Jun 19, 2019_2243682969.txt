A Superior Court of Quebec judge signed off Wednesday on a settlement for motorists stuck on Highway 13 during a snowstorm on March 14, 2017, but the plaintiffs are still in a legal battle with the city of Montreal for compensation.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs were happy with the provincial government's settlement, which has agreed to pay between $350 and $1,375 per person, based in part on the number of hours they were stuck waiting to be rescued.
But the city of Montreal's lawyers "haven't even agreed to negotiate at all," said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Gabrielle Gagné, of Trudel Johnston & Lespérance. "They didn't settle, they had a chance to."
That leaves the plaintiffs - about 2,500 in all - no choice but to pursue the city in court, Gagné said.
"They felt that their case is strong, but we felt that our case is strong," Gagné said.
On Wednesday, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante reiterated that the incident occurred on Transport Québec territory and that city officials acted appropriately given the circumstances and are not liable.
Gagné said they expect to have a judge assigned to the case against the city in the fall.
The lawyers for the plaintiffs have received a lot of positive feedback about the Quebec settlement, but Gagné said some still feel it is an insufficient amount.
"Some members didn't understand that this amount was not final because we're continuing (the motions) against the city of Montreal," said Gagné.
Once the claim form becomes available online in the next month, people will have three months to complete it. It is expected that the complainants will be compensated in early 2020.
