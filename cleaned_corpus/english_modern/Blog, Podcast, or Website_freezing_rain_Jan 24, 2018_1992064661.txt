Hydro-Québec repair crews were deployed across the South Shore Wednesday morning after Tuesday's freezing rain damaged its power distribution grid to black out more than 45,000 homes and businesses in the Montreal area.
By noon, the utility was reporting 550 power interruptions in Montreal, and 6,876 customers without electricity across Quebec.
The week's weather cocktail made road conditions difficult across Quebec but they were gradually improving by Wednesday morning.
Roads were still partially frozen, but precipitation had stopped in the vast majority of the province. Westerly winds of up to 70 kilometres per hour made blowing snow an issue in places that got snow instead of rain, Environment Canada said, such as in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore and throughout the Gaspé.
The freezing rain warning was ended for the Montreal area. Flurries were predicted for most of the day, with a high of minus-5 Celsius. Thursday and Friday were expected to be sunny with highs of minus-10 and minus-7 respectively. The temperature will rise above freezing for a second weekend in a row.
