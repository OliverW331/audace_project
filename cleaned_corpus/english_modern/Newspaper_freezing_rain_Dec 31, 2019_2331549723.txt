Most Montrealers hunkered down Monday as a snow storm of ice pellets and freezing rain blanketed the city, turning some downtown streets into rivers of slush, causing collisions on the highways and resulting in the cancellation of more than a hundred flights at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.
Environment Canada maintained a snowfall warning Monday night, forecasting two to four centimetres of snow for the Montreal area Tuesday, with winds gusting to 40 kilometres per hour. Scattered flurries are expected on New Year's Eve.
Given the nasty weather throughout Monday, many Montrealers chose to stay at home during the holiday period, with road traffic much quieter than usual.
"It's been that way all day long," said Const. Caroline Chevrefils of the Montreal Police Department.
Likewise, Urgences-Santé did not report a spike in calls, as is usually the case when streets and sidewalks become icy.
"We didn't receive that expected surge in calls," spokesperson Antoine Ortuso said. "People are probably staying at home."
Still, the city's hospital emergency rooms were busy as usual. Ste-Justine Hospital's ER was the most overcrowded as of 7:30 p.m., with an occupancy rate of 169 per cent.
Off Montreal Island, the Sûreté du Québec reported more than a dozen highway accidents, although none involving serious injuries. Provincial police urged motorists to adapt their driving to the sometimes treacherous road conditions.
Transport Quebec noted that Highways 15 and 20 were partly snow covered.
Highways 13, 15 and 440 in Laval, and Highways 10, 15, 30, 132 and 138 on the South Shore were also partly snow covered.
About 50 flights scheduled for departure at Trudeau airport were cancelled Monday morning in anticipation of the snowfall in Montreal, as well as freezing rain and snowstorms elsewhere along the eastern seaboard.
By Monday night, the arrivals and departures of dozens more flights were either delayed or cancelled.
