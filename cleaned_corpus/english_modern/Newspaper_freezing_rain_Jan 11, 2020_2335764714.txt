Transport Quebec is warning motorists that infrastructure work will see road closures imposed in the areas of the Turcot and Angrignon interchanges.
However, provincial authorities warn also that any and all construction could be postponed in case of poor weather, a distinct possibility given the weather cocktail expected to descend on Montreal Saturday and Sunday.
The following closures are planned to be in effect from 11:59 p.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Monday:
? Eastbound Highway 720 between the Turcot Interchange and the access ramp for de la Cath√©drale St. and Notre-Dame St. W.
? The ramp from westbound Highway 20 for Exit 65 for Route 138 E. /Angrignon Blvd. /St-Jacques St.
? Access to eastbound Highway 20 from Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue Blvd.
If those road closures do not deter you from weekend travel on local roads, just remember that the condition of those roads are expected to be subject to rapid and perhaps treacherous change over the weekend.
Environment Canada says a major low pressure system will affect southern Quebec on Saturday and Sunday, bringing with it a "significant" amount of precipitation - 20 to 35 millimetres of rainfall and melting snow on Saturday, and 15-30 millimetres of freezing rain on Saturday evening and Sunday, with wind gusts of 60-70 km/h on Sunday.
