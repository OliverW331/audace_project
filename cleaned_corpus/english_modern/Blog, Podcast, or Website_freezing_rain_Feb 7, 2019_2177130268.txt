After days of freezing drizzle and rain and temperatures determined by yo-yos, Montrealers woke up to cloudy skies and damp air Thursday. On the South Shore, many school boards decided to not open schools and learning centres.
Montreal remains under a freezing drizzle advisory, which Environment Canada warns can lead to a buildup on roads and sidewalks to create extra-icy surfaces. The advisory covers Montreal, Châteauguay, Laval and Longueuil. Temperatures are expected to hit at least 0 degrees Celsius and the drizzle could give way to freezing rain, then outright rain, after dark Thursday.
Relief is in sight: The weekend should be sunny with highs around -8 C, Environment Canada predicts.
