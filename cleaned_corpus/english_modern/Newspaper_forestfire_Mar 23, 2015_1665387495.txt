Ken Dryden saw only 24 Washington Capitals shots on April 2, 1977, the Canadiens raining 42 on a shell-shocked Bernie Wolfe at the other end of the rink.
When the smoke had cleared that night, a forest fire having blazed in the Forum, the Habs were 11-0 winners, Wolfe was nursing a scorched neck from a goal light that was turned on seven times in the third period, and Dryden was the author of his 10th shutout of the season.
A nasty way to treat the homecoming Wolfe. The former Sir George Williams University goaltending star would go 0-for-18 lifetime against the Canadiens on some truly awful Capitals teams, beginning with a 9-3 loss on Dec. 6, 1975.
"Maybe management isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer," Wolfe told me with a laugh during a 2004 talk. "Since I was from Montreal, they figured they'd start me against Montreal every game."
If he listens carefully, nearly four decades after his cakewalk over the Caps, Dryden will hear a gentle knocking on his door this morning. And those would be the knuckles of Carey Price.
It's been since 1976-77 that a Canadiens goalie has recorded 10 shutouts in a season. With nine games remaining on the Habs schedule, Price's 2-0 whitewash on Saturday of San Jose gives him a lifetime-best nine.
And his 40 victories, also a career high, have him two behind a share of his team's record in that category: Jacques Plante won 42 in 1955-56 and 1961-62, Dryden won the same number in 1975-76.
With his shutout of the Sharks, Price equalled the 34 lifetime unblemished games of Canadiens Hall of Famer Bill Durnan for fourth place on the team's all-time list. Next up: Dryden's 46, Plante's 58, and the distant 75 of early-era George Hainsworth.
You've been hearing for some time that this season is a career year for Price. It is no longer "just" that, of course. This one is sprinkled with stardust, one for the ages, something magical that's been fascinating to watch.
The 27-year-old from Anahim Lake, B.C., and but most nights apparently from a planet not orbiting in this solar system, leads the NHL in wins (40), save percentage (. 938), goals-against average (1.86) and shutouts (nine, tied with Pittsburgh's Marc-Andre Fleury).
Sadly (typing this in the sarcasm font), Price's offensive game needs some work. He's in 22nd place in goaltender assists with only one, two offthe pace of a leading group of five.
Last Thursday, unbuckling his pads following a 4-0 defeat of the Carolina Hurricanes, Price quietly let slip that his father, Jerry, had been in attendance, the third shutout his dad had seen live this season.
"He's retired. Where else does he have to be?" Price joked when it was suggested that he keep Jerry around for a bit.
Indeed, Price pere was at the Bell Centre on Saturday for his son's second consecutive shutout, this one a 29-save effort featuring the usual assortment of sleight-of-hand stops.
It was not immediately clear whether Jerry would be in Nashville on Tuesday, when Price faces the Predators' Pekka Rinne in what has the potential to be a titanic goaltending duel.
"(Jerry) is going to move in for the playoffs," Price's wife, Angela, suggested in the wake of her husband's ninth shutout, and she might even have been kidding.
Here's Price in goals-against and save percentage on a grander scale, accurate comparisons through the decades admittedly impossible given how everything has changed in hockey except for the net opening's 24 square feet: If the season ended today, Price's goals-against would tie for the Canadiens' best in the socalled modern era. Hainsworth, in the 1920s, had seasons of 0.92, 1.05 and 1.47, and Georges Vezina was 1.47 in 1926-27; Jacques Plante is next best, with 1.86 in 1955-56.
Price's save percentage would be the team's best since the statistic has been kept, .007 better than Jose Theodore's .931 in 2001-02 - the year that Theo was voted winner of both the Hart and Vezina trophies as the NHL's most valuable player and best goaltender. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
A decade ago, researching a half-century of NHL save percentages from 1954-55 to 2003-04, Goalies' World magazine charted Plante's .942 in 70 games with the 1970-71 Toronto Maple Leafs atop the list, followed by his .940 in 37 games with 1968-69 St. Louis.
The Blues' Brian Elliott had a .940 in his 38 games in 2011-12, Boston's Tim Thomas a .938 over 57 games the previous season. Now at .938, Price is in rarefied air.
In 1976-77, playing behind the Big Three of Larry Robinson, Serge Savard and Guy Lapointe on defence, Dryden earned 10 shutouts with a 2.14 average and .920 save percentage.
The Canadiens would steam into the playoffs that season to win the Stanley Cup, their second of four straight, in 14 games, only two over the minimum, sweeping St. Louis, beating the Islanders in six, then sweeping Boston in the final.
Dryden would earn four postseason shutouts - one against the Blues to open, two vs. the Islanders and his final vs. the Bruins in a Stanley Cup
final sweep. His 10 shutouts that year are in a three-way tie for fourth place on the Canadiens' all-time list; he joined Durnan, who turned the trick in 1948-49, and Gerry McNeil, who had 10 in 1956-57.
Hainsworth had 1920s shutout seasons of 22 (the NHL record), 14 and 13, the trio at 10 immediately behind him.
Forget about his steely-eyed focus, positional play, lateral movement and puck-tracking, Price's best skill remains his deflections.
"I wouldn't be here without these guys," he told reporters after Saturday's game, crediting his shot-blocking, creaseclearing, furiously backchecking teammates.
"Those are just the cold, hard facts. There's no other way to sugar-coat it. That's just the way it is."
After a day offSunday, the Canadiens will practise Monday morning in Brossard, then charter to Nashville, where on Tuesday the Habs will face the superb Predators.
Better than that, the game will pit Price against Rinne, who on Saturday blanked Buffalo and heading into Sunday's games was ranked second in wins, third in goals-against and fifth in save percentage.
Nine games to the finish will be about more than the Montreal Canadiens' jockeying for their playoffseed.
They will be, as this entire season has been in Montreal, about the magnificent play of a goaltender who in 2014-15 has proved he belongs with the Canadiens' forever legends, icons Price is bringing back into focus night after puck-stopping night.
