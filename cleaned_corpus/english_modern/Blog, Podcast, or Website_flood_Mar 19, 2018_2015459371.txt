February's spring tease was just that, the Weather Network says. There are chilly days ahead for most of Quebec in the early spring, coupled with a higher-than-usual threat of winter storms.
Those storms will bring above-normal amounts of precipitation across Eastern Canada, but the extended thaw in late winter means much of the snow in the south of Quebec has already melted, reducing the possibility of severe flooding( http://montrealgazette.com/tag/flood ). The Weather Network expects March to be colder than normal in Quebec, then bounce back in April.
"While dramatic swings in weather are a normal part of the season, this spring looks to have a particularly volatile mood," says Chris Scott, chief meteorologist with The Weather Network.
Also coming this spring is the second of 2018's two blue moons. That's coming overnight March 30-31.
