Freezing rain Sunday morning could cause ice build-up and make streets, highways, paths and parking lots slippery and hazardous, Environment Canada warns( https://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=1ac04cc54442405c&a=55e7da3&hl=en&gl=CA&source=web ).
An intense low pressure system is causing precipitation across Quebec on Sunday and Monday, which could make travel hazardous in greater Montreal and the South Shore as well as the Outaouais region. The freezing rain will change to rain around 2 p.m., when temperatures are expected to rise above freezing.
Rain could cause local water accumulation on streets and sidewalks until it changes back to light snow Sunday evening. The snow will continue into Monday, when very strong west winds and colder temperatures could turn wet surfaces into a sheet of ice.
The weather office issues freezing rain warnings when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.
Emergency calls for falls on ice are very high this year( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/emergency-calls-for-icy-falls-jump-55-per-cent-in-2019 ). Put on or get some ice crampons for your boots.

Tonight: Rain will change to light snow in the evening and continued windy at 20 km/h, gusting to 40, becoming 40, gusting to 70, in the evening, and a low of minus 4.
