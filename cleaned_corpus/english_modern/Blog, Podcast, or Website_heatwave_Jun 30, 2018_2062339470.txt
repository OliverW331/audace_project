Max Domi( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130519 ) will wear No. 13 next season with the Canadiens as a tribute to former Toronto Maple Leafs star Mats Sundin.( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=5252 )
His first choice would have been No. 16 as a tribute to former Philadelphia Flyers captain Bobby Clarke( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=1019 ), but that number has been retired by the Canadiens in honour of Hall of Famers Henri Richard( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=4547 ) and Elmer Lach.( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=2887 )
Domi's father, Tie( http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=1391 ), was Sundin's teammate with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Sundin - a future Hall of Famer - became like an uncle to Domi while he was growing up. When Domi first started playing organized hockey, he chose Sundin's No. 13 instead of his father's No. 28 and he also developed Sundin's offensive skills instead of playing his father's tough-guy role.
But after Domi was diagnosed with having Type 1 diabetes( http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/living-with-type-1-diabetes ) at age 12, he switched to No. 16 because Clarke was also a diabetic and it didn't stop him from playing 15 seasons with the Flyers, winning two Stanley Cups and making it into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Domi had worn No. 16 ever since, including the last three seasons with the Arizona Coyotes before being traded to the Canadiens on June 15 in exchange for Alex Galchenyuk.

"As a Type 1 diabetic, every single day is a battle to a certain extent and there's a lot of adversity that goes with that," said Domi, a left-winger who is 5-foot-10 and 195 pounds. "But when you think of a person of that calibre (Clarke) that was doing it before we have all the technology that we have now .... geez, like how the heck did you do that? So you have just that much respect and when you're living it every day you know what that the grind is like.
"The first question I asked (after being diagnosed with diabetes) was if I could still play hockey," Domi added. "And as soon as they said yes, nothing else really fazed me. ... So just do whatever I have to do to make sure I can get to the NHL. When you have a guy that's done it before - way before your time and you have someone to look up to and kind of paved the path for you - it makes it that much smoother to get to. Playing in the NHL, you have to have pretty much perfect control of it (diabetes). Definitely proud to say that I've got a pretty good hold on things."

Domi now hopes he can inspire other young people with diabetes.
"You get a voice when you have a certain platform and you're playing in the NHL - or any type of professional athlete - and you can do whatever you want with that," Domi said. "Some guys like it, some guys don't, and everyone's kind of got their own feel and opinion on that. I've chosen to make the most of that and try and repay the diabetic community in the same way that Mr. Clarke did for me. If I can show some kids down the line that I'm living proof that you can do whatever you want, you can achieve your dreams, then that's kind of why I"m here. So it's pretty cool."
Domi also thought it was pretty cool to try on his new Canadiens jersey in the team's Brossard locker room Saturday afternoon as he dropped in on the club's evaluation camp during a 24-hour visit to Montreal.
"It's a little bit weird to see 13 with the last name Domi on the back of a Habs jersey," he said. "But I think it looks great. It's a great number."

Now Domi is hoping to put up better numbers with the Canadiens than he did last season with the Coyotes, when he posted 9-36-45 totals in 82 games with four of his goals being empty-netters. It was his second straight nine-goal season after scoring 18 during his rookie NHL campaign after being selected by the Coyotes in the first round (12th overall) at the 2013 NHL Draft. The Canadiens are hoping a change of scenery will help Domi and the Coyotes are hoping the same thing for Galchenyuk.
Domi grew up in a crazy Original Six hockey market and now he's happy to get to play in one.
"This is where I wanted to be and I couldn't be happier," he said. "Super excited. Everyone is different, of course. Some people might not want to play in a market like this, other people might want to, other people might not care. I'm definitely truly excited to be here and I want to be here. I'm hoping that this brings out the best in me."
Domi still remembers sleeping with a hockey stick when he was a young boy, dreaming about one day playing in the NHL, just like his father. But he never used his father's stick.
"He was a righty, so I didn't get to use his stick," said Domi, who shoots left. "His curve was terrible, anyways. The thing's like a shovel. It's more of like a dump-and-chase stick."
That drew a lot of laughs from the media in the Canadiens' locker room before Domi added: "You know what? He actually had a lot of skill."
But not as much as Mats Sundin or Bobby Clarke.
