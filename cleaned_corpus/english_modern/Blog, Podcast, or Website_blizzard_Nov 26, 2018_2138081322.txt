That low-level Monday-morning headache could be a harbinger of a low-pressure system headed here from the Midwest.
Because of it (the system, not your headache), Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning that covers Montreal, Laval, Châteauguay and the Longueuil areas, warning of changing precipitation Monday through Tuesday.
The federal meteorologists predict rain till after suppertime on Monday, at which time snow should begin to fall. Tuesday morning, the snowfall could be heavy and will be exacerbated by wind. This could cause tangles during the morning commute and possible slowdowns on bus routes.
"Beware, warnings may eventually be required for some regions over the next few days," the weather statement says.
By the time it's all over on Wednesday, we could see up to 25 centimetres of snow on the ground.
In the Quebec City region, very strong winds could cause power outages and Environment Canada warns rising river levels could be an issue at high tide Tuesday.
