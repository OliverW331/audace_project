Environment Canada maintained its heat warning for the Montreal area Monday, just as more than 150,000 Quebecers return from the province's two-week construction holiday.
The federal agency is predicting daytime highs near 30 C and humidex values( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-humidex-canadians-didnt-invent-humidity-but-we-labeled-it ) near 40 C.
No matter what line of work you're returning to, remember to drink plenty of water even before you feel thirsty and try to stay in a cool place.
Monday's forecast also calls for a mix or sun and cloud with a 40-per-cent chance of showers or thunderstorms this afternoon and this evening.
Environment Canada's public weather alerts page( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/index_e.html ) showed heat and air-quality warnings covering quite a bit of the country.
