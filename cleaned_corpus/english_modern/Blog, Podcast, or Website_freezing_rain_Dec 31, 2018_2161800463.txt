Mother Nature has New Year's Eve plans, and they centre around a snow storm and possible freezing rain due to hit southwest and central Quebec on Monday night.
Two low pressure systems, one coming from western Canada and the other from the southern United States, are expected to join forces over the Great Lakes and head towards Quebec.
Much of the province could be on the receiving end of 10 and 20 centimetres of snowfall, with Montreal expecting 5-10.
According to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada, "the Montreal region and southern regions may experience some freezing rain."
