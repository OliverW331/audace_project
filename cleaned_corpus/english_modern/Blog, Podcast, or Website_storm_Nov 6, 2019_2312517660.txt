Five days after violent winds ravaged its distribution network( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/high-winds-leave-thousands-of-montrealers-in-the-dark ) in southern and central Quebec less than 5,000 Hydro-Québec customers were reported on Wednesday to be without electricity.
As of 7:30 a.m. the utility reported that 5,208 customers were dealing with power outages, most of them in the Eastern Townships and central Quebec.
Hydro-Québec had given itself the objective of fully restoring power throughout the province by Tuesday evening, but that plan was delayed because repair crews had to deal with numerous outages affecting smaller numbers of clients.
A total of 1,500 persons were assigned to repair crews deployed to deal with the damage from last Friday's storm, including reinforcements( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/hydro-quebec-getting-more-out-of-province-help-to-assist-with-reconnections/wcm/95dcd43f-38af-45b1-b0d1-6a3111915428 ) from New Brunswick Ottawa, Detroit and Connecticut.
At the height of the crisis, a total of 990,000 homes and businesses were without power in Quebec.
