Montrealers woke up to a glaze of ice on sidewalks and side streets that seemed well on its way to melting Monday morning.
But while major thoroughfares were more slick than slippery, a freezing rain warning remained in effect( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal area, one that warned of "anywhere from five to 20 millimetres of freezing precipitation ... expected by this evening over Southern Quebec."
And that threat was enough for all Montreal-area school boards - including the English Montreal School Board, the Lester B. Pearson Board, the Commission scolaire de Montréal and the Riverside School Board - to shut their doors for the day.

There were several reports of traffic accidents Monday morning linked to the overnight barrage of rain and freezing rain, including a hydroplaning incident involving three cars on Highway 40 near Sources Blvd. Meanwhile, nearly 30,000 Hydro-Québec customers in the Outaouais region were without power, although their outages represented 48 of the 78 power failures reported across all of Quebec.
The aftershocks of Sunday's storm in Toronto( https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2018/04/15/second-wave-of-ice-storm-pummels-gta.html ) were making themselves felt early Monday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport, as many departing flights to that city were delayed or cancelled.
The forecast for Monday calls for a high of 3 degrees Celsius, with periods of freezing rain changing to rain this afternoon and more rain continuing into the evening.
