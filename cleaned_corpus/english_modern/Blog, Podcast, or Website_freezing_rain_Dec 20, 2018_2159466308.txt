With freezing rain in the forecast, and holidays approaching, the Jacques Cartier Bridge's multipurpose path - used mostly by cyclists - closed for the winter as of Thursday night.
The weather forecast called for freezing rain to begin Thursday( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-warning-issued-for-montreal-area-as-temperatures-climb ), but for a warmer than seasonal Friday. Despite the lack of winter weather, the path closed because the bridge authority has not figured out how to keep the path open safely during the winter months( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/winter-cyclists-gaining-more-respect-on-montreal-bike-paths ).
This is not for a lack of trying. Last year, the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated, the federal body that oversees bridge operations, embarked on a $1.67-million pilot project( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jacques-cartier-bridge-bike-path-to-be-cleared-this-winter-but-closed-to-cyclists ) to routinely clear snow from the path in hopes of finding a conclusive way to keep it free of snow and ice. Though the bridge was being cleared, cyclists were still not permitted to ride on it. The results of the pilot project were not conclusive, and the bridge authority will try once again this season to iron out the kinks in its snow-removal operations.
The path will reopen in spring 2019 once the bridge authority deems it safe.
