Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for the Montreal area in anticipation of what it describes as a "spring storm" expected to roll into Quebec on Tuesday evening and continue on Wednesday.
The service says a weather system developing in the central United States is expected to move across the Great Lakes region and "bring significant amounts of snow starting Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday evening for regions north of the St. Lawrence Valley."
Across southern Quebec the precipitation is expected to take the form of freezing rain in areas close to the St. Lawrence River and rain elsewhere, although Environment Canada acknowledges "uncertainty" over where exactly the system will head once it reaches Quebec.
