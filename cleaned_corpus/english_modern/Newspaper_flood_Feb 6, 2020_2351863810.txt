Re: "Pierrefonds-Roxboro mayor decries inaction on flood prevention" (Montreal Gazette,Jan. 30) Pierrefonds-Roxboro mayor Jim Beis has criticized Montreal and Quebec for not acting to prevent flooding in hisborough.
Yet Beis and his council have at least in the past supported housing construction in part of the 285 hectare environmentally sensitive floodplain inPierrefonds.
Ironically, the OCPM (Office de Consultation Public de Montr√©al) public hearing in 2017 for this very "development" was moved to the OCPM's Montreal's office because of flooding at the Pierrefonds-Roxboro boroughbuilding.
Beis should realize that among his best allies in flood prevention is our nature conservation movement, which opposes building over Pierrefonds'floodplain and its richbiodiversity.
