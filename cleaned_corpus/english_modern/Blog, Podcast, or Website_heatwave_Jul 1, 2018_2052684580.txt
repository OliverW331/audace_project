Pointe-Claire( https://www.pointe-claire.ca/en/news/eco-grazing-sheep-at-edgewater-park/ ) has found a natural way to trim the grass at Edgewater Park, located along Lake St-Louis near the Pointe-Claire Village( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claire-passes-planning-guidelines-for-village-district ).
Beginning Monday, the city will introduce six sheep to the park as part of an "eco-grazing project."
The project will run daily, from June 11 to July 20, between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.
The sheep will be allowed to graze in the park while in a temporary enclosure. "As they graze on grass, they will help maintain the park in a completely natural manner," the city said.
"We care about sustainable development, and this fun and educational initiative is part of our approach," said Mayor John Belvedere.
The public can buy feed for the sheep every Saturday for 25 cents.
"A shepherd will be at the park at all times to watch over the flock," the city said.
Pointe-Claire will also hold a series of educational activities at Edgewater Park( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/west-island-gazette/pointe-claires-edgewater-park-gets-a ).
June 14: Knitting with sheep - all levels
June 21: Bilingual story hour, followed by a craft (ages 3 to 6)
June 28: Art creation for families
July 5: Family picnic, followed by a children's show (in French)
July 12 : Yoga with sheep - adults (bring your own yoga mat)
July 19: Shearing and spinning demonstration
In case of bad weather - rain, storms or even heat waves - the sheep will be placed in a shelter, and the outdoor activities will be moved to the NoÃ«l-Legault Community Centre, located at 245 Lakeshore Rd., in Pointe-Claire.
