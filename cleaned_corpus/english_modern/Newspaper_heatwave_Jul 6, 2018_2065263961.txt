Indoors
Melanie De Biasio (8 p.m., Monument-National, $41.75) Few singers can cast a spell like Belgian chanteuse Melanie De Biasio. Borrowing elements of jazz, blues and soul, she can sound like Nina Simone or conjure the spirit of Tom Waits. Her fourth album, Lilies, recorded alone on her computer, drifts through stark, ethereal atmospheres interspersed with infusions of funky rhythms. Sure to be a treat in the intimate confines of Monument-National. Outdoors
Megative (9 and 11 p.m., TD Stage, corner Jeanne-Mance St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) Gus Van Go of Montreal '90s skapunk crew Me Mom and Morgentaler and Tim Fletcher of 2000s indie-rock act The Stills converge in this reggae-punk-electro act with enough urban cool to tame the heat wave and start a laid-back dance party for the hometown crowd - over two sets on the outdoor main stage. Woot!
Thornetta Davis (9 and 11 p.m., Hyundai/CBC/Radio-Canada Stage, corner St-Urbain St. and de Maisonneuve Blvd., free) Thornetta Davis was a backup vocalist for Bob Seger and Kid Rock before going on to become Detroit's Queen of the Blues. The good times will roll as she sings songs from her 2016 album, Honest Woman, on the ever-popular blues stage.
