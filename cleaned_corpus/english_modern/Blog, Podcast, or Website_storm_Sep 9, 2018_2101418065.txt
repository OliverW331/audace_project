Tropical Depression Gordon, which never quite made hurricane status as it slammed into Mississippi and Alabama last week, is expected to rain down on Montreal early this week.
While border crossings are notoriously busy at the end of every weekend, Gordon was expected to make its way into Canada from the central U.S. unfettered on Sunday.
Environment Canada warns residents of Montreal, Laval, Longueuil and Ch√¢teauguay to expect between 30 and 50 millimetres of rain starting Monday afternoon. Those areas could also experience thunderstorms.
Meanwhile in the south, Tropical Storm Florence( https://montrealgazette.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/cruise-passengers-who-were-supposed-to-go-to-bermuda-arrive-in-atlantic-canada/wcm/d5c66f77-a133-4905-aded-faeb5e2ca6c0 ) is bearing down on the eastern U.S. and could hit the Carolinas on Monday.
