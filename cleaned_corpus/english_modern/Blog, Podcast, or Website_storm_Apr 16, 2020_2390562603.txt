A minimum wage hike in the middle of a prolonged economic shutdown? Quebec business groups, predictably, aren't thrilled.
Labour minister Jean Boulet confirmed on Wednesday that the province's minimum hourly wage would climb by 60 cents( http://www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca/Pages/Article.aspx?aiguillage=ajd&idArticle=2804152285 ) to $13.10 starting May 1. More than 409,000 workers will benefit from the move, he said.
At 4.8 per cent, the increase represents more than double the rate of inflation in Quebec.
"The timing isn't great," François Vincent, Quebec vice-president at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview Wednesday. "A lot of small businesses don't even know if they'll survive. Many had trouble paying the rent in April, and now they're trying to see how they can pay it in May."
With Quebec having lost 264,000 jobs in March as the COVID-19 pandemic spread, "perhaps the government could have pushed this back by a few months," said Michel Leblanc, head of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. "Many smaller companies already have cash flow problems. Higher labour costs could make them reassess their plans to rehire when this is over."
Quebec first announced its intention to boost the minimum wage in December, when the provincial economy was still expanding and many companies were struggling to find enough workers to meet demand.
Four months later, the pandemic is in full flight and all non-essential businesses in Quebec are closed until at least May 4. As a result, companies are now focused on keeping costs down - and business groups say the government should at least help them offset the wage increase.
"The world has changed a lot since December," Norma Kozhaya, chief economist at the Conseil du Patronat du Québec, told the Montreal Gazette in an interview. "This minimum wage increase is an extra burden that no one needed, especially in sectors such as the restaurant business, where profit margins are slim at the best of times."

Only half of Quebec business owners surveyed by CFIB( https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/sites/default/files/2020-04/COVID-19-survey-results-April-15.pdf ) are confident their business will survive if current economic conditions last until the end of May. The group represents more than 110,000 small businesses across the country, including about 24,000 here.
Two-thirds of the Quebec businesses surveyed by CFIB say they've lost more than half of revenue because of the crisis, Vincent said. COVID-19 disruptions have cost Quebec businesses an average of 183,000$, CFIB data show.
Quebec unveiled plans on March 19 to commit at least $2.5 billion( https://theprovince.com/business/quebec-unlocks-2-5-billion-to-help-companies-weather-covid-19-storm/wcm/a9601eb8-e5ad-4faf-8ca0-16d5659d1576 ) to help companies overcome liquidity problems caused by the pandemic.
While praising Quebec for the help provided so far, organizations such as CFIB and the Conseil du Patronat are now asking for more - through measures such as a temporary suspension in provincial pension plan contributions or a reduction in municipal taxes.
CFIB is also urging Quebec to follow in the footsteps of Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia and give business owners an emergency subsidy of as much as $5,000 a month while COVID-19 closings last.
"The goal here is to preserve liquidity, to preserve jobs," Vincent said. "Once businesses go bankrupt, it will be too late."
