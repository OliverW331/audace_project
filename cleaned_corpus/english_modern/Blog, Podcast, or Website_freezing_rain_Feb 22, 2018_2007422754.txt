The Montreal area's topsy-turvy weather predictions continued Thursday with a special weather statement warning of freezing rain starting Friday afternoon.
With the temperature hovering around zero degrees Celsius, we could get 2 to 5 millimetres of freezing rain, meaning "untreated surfaces such as roads and sidewalks may become icy and slippery." The Environment Canada statement also covers Ch√¢teauguay, La-Prairie, Laval and the Longueuil-Varennes area.
It'll be 4 C and sunny Saturday, and some sort of precipitation could fall Sunday, when it's expected to be 5 C. The rest of the week will linger around 2 C.
Environment Canada's extended forecast ends on Feb. 28 (sunny, high of 3 C), so it's anyone's guess whether March will arrive like a lamb or lion. More to the point, it's your guess:
