The directive is based on prevailing weather conditions and is in effect until further notice.
The ban is aimed specifically at heavily wooded regions, including Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the Outaouais and the Laurentiens but also extends to Laval and Montreal and the Montérégie.
The ministry notes that as of Wednesday afternoon, there were four forest fires burning in Quebec and that 94 have been recorded since the start of the year.
The average number of fires recorded as of this date over the past 10 years is 125.
