Bill 40 passes 60-35 despite fury over last-minute amendments, including one that will see commissions let go three weeks earlier than expected:( https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/bill-40-opposition-parties-fail-to-block-caqs-use-of-closure ) Playing hardball to the bitter end, an unyielding Education Minister Jean-Fran√ßois Roberge infuriated MNAs Friday when he announced the government intends to fire hundreds of school board commissioners three weeks sooner than originally announced. As the final legislature debate over Bill 40 abolishing Quebec's 60 francophone and nine anglophone school boards dragged late into the night under the cloud of closure, Roberge tabled a surprise last-minute amendment to the bill moving up the date commissioners will be extinct. Instead of the previously announced date of Feb. 29, Roberge's amendment means commissioners are out the door as soon as the bill gets royal sanction, sometime Saturday morning, hours after the 3:20 a.m. vote that approved the bill 60-35.

Hamilton police looking for two suspects after dog is wounded in shooting: Police in Hamilton say they are looking for two suspects after a dog was shot in the city's east end Friday night.
