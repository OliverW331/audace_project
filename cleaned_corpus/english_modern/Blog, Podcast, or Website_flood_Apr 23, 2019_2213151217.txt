Wearing a security vest and clutching a megaphone, Johanne Hudon-Armstrong directs the steady stream of trucks arriving at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
"Barwick St. is an emergency," she barks as volunteers pile sand bags onto a trailer pulled by an SUV. And off it drives to bring protection and encouragement to West Island residents whose homes could be threatened by the rising waters of the Rivière des Prairies.
Shovelling sand into sacks or directing traffic in the hot sun is not everyone's idea of how to spend the Easter-Passover long weekend.
But the fear of a possible repeat of the catastrophic floods of 2017 has galvanized an outpouring of support among West Island residents.
From donating drinks and food to knocking on doors to make sure elderly and vulnerable residents have flood protections in place, hundreds of volunteers are pitching in to help their neighbours.
"I'm a project manager by nature, so I took over," said Hudon-Armstrong, who showed up to help with her daughter.
"It's really heart-warming to see everybody turning out to lend their support to people who need it," said Rachel Shizgal, 50, of Dollard des Ormeaux as she dug her shovel into a mountain of sand.
The floods of two years ago remain seared into residents' memories, she said.
"Everyone has stories. Everyone was affected in some way. If it's not them, it's a friend. If it's not the grocer or the dentist, it's somebody else you know," Shizgal said.
"We're dry. Others aren't," said Pierrefonds resident Dolores Carroll, 56, to explain why she and five other family members were volunteering their time.
Her son Eric Paquette, 24, said he had no problems spending the long weekend shovelling sand.
"It's nice and sunny," he said.

Blocks away, homeowner Ginette Roy, 69, gazed worriedly at the water surrounding the mature trees at the end of her waterfront property on Rive-Boisée Rd.
The 2017 floods, which caused $100,000 in damage to her house, "started just the way it is now," she said.
As she looked out, volunteer Lesley Steeves arrived at the house, pushing a wheelbarrow piled high with sand bags.
"Although our house isn't affected, many of my neighbours are," said Steeves, 46, whose husband, parents and sister were also giving their time.
Seeing so many people show up to help "is a reminder that there's some good out there," she said.
Roy, who has owned her home since 1979, said the property had never been flooded until two years ago.
"It was paradise," she said.
"The water never, never came up onto the property."
Walking around the side of the house, she showed where the flood had caused deep cracks in the foundation, which has since been repaired.
Vicky Belisle, 72, a 48-year neighbourhood resident, was also on hand to check in on Roy and other neighbours on the street.
Two years ago, bags for filling with sand were in short supply, she recalled.
"We have a lot of bags this time," Belisle said.
"You can't fault them this time," she said of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough.
"Last time, it was crazy. People were fighting over bags. People were using pillow cases (as sand bags)," she said.
René Leblanc, who lives on nearby des Maçons St., said he was "cautiously optimistic" of not seeing a repeat of what happened in 2017.
The floods caused extensive damage to homes on des Maçons even though the street is several hundred metres from the river, said Leblanc, a retiree and former city councillor.
"Six feet of water poured in within four minutes," he said.
"We weren't ready two years ago. This year, things are very different," he said.
Leblanc was forced to move out of his house for 88 days and spent $115,000 to repair the damage from the flood.
This time around, "our borough has done a brilliant job," he said.
Each households has received two pallets of sandbags and measures have been taken to prevent storm sewers from backing up as they did in 2017, he noted.
Jean Robert Télémaque, 62, a 19-year resident of des Maçons St., spent three days working from early morning to 10 p.m. piling rows of sandbags in front of his house and building a plywood barrier in front of the garage door.
In 2017, the surging flood blew in the garage door, filling the basement with six feet of water in minutes, he said.
"It's definitely stressful," he said.

Before and after
For Tim Coochey, 60, a 27-year resident of des Maçons St., the difference between the 2017 floods and this year is "night and day."
"Just look at the street," said Coochey, surveying the wall of sandbags residents have erected to prevent the damage that occurred two years ago, when several feet of water surged into basements.
"The difference between 2017 and now is that in 2017, they got caught with their britches down," said Coochey, known for the elaborate Halloween decorations he puts up each year, to the delight of neighbourhood children.
When the Rivière des Prairies overflowed its banks two years ago, rising waters caused storm sewers to back up, flooding a wide area, he noted.
"We had three four-foot storm sewers wide open. That was probably pushing two Olympic swimming pools worth of water a second," he said.
"For us, the flood initially started courtesy of the storm sewers," said Coochey, who spent $50,000 on materials to rebuild his basement, ruined by the flood.
Until 2017, the property had never flooded, he said.
This time, Coochey and other residents are leaving nothing to chance.
Not only has he built defences around his own home: he also spent the weekend picking up and delivering sand bags to other neighbourhood homes, making 48 trips from the command centre at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.
The 2017 floods are what build the sense of community on display this year, he said.
"We all ganged up together and helped each other," he said.
"Your kids grew up here, that's your house, that's your everything. That's the nest egg for your family," Coochey said.
Given the measures taken to protect homes, it would take a dramatic rise in the river to cause similar damage this year, he said.
"That river's got to come up another 36 inches before she'll breach that dyke over here," he said.
"If Mother Nature gives us three more feet in the river height, we've got problems. If she doesn't, let's get a beer, Coochey said.
