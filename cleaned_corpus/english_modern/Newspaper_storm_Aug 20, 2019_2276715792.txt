Re: "Calm turns to storm for fiery Kyrgios" (Montreal Gazette, Aug. 16) This is concerning the incident during the second round of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati in which Nick Kyrgios was fined US$113,000 for his extremely poor conduct, which included apparently spitting in the direction of the chair umpire.
In my tennis club, such an individual would have his membership privileges revoked - period. Perhaps it's time that the ATP bans Kyrgios from competing at least until he satisfactorily completes some sort of anger management training.
