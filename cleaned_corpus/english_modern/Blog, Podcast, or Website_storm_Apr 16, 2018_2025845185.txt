Although Montreal experienced a mostly watered-down version of a promised ice storm( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/freezing-rain-montreal-weather-warnings-are-watered-down-for-now ), the overnight double-whammy of precipitation and below-freezing temperatures left many streets a slick mess.
St-Fran√ßois-Xavier St. in Old Montreal can be a bit of a hassle at the best of times, but it was slippery enough Monday morning to inspire Joshua Walsh to pause for a 15-second video.
In it, pedestrians trying to make it from St-Antoine St. to St-Jacques St. have to cling to a centuries-old building or wait for the aid of a Good Samaritan who apparently hadn't changed their winter boots yet.
