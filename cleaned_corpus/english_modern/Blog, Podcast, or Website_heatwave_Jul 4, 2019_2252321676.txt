With Oka Beach being closed( https://www.sepaq.com/pq/oka/nouvelles/nouvelle.dot?id=4cb1ba6b-ef58-47db-8b92-55a527daded6&language_id=2 ) during the first heat wave( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/city-ready-for-heat-wave-plante ) of 2019, here are a few other options to beat the heat.
Verdun Beach( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/long-awaited-chilly-verdun-beach-opens-on-a-hot-saturday )
This brand-new beach opened on June 22, just in time for a classic Montreal heat wave. The beach opens from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., where you can enjoy the calm (and cool) water of the St. Lawrence River or lounge around on the sandy beach. The beach also features a climbing wall and slides for those looking to get a sweat going before taking a dip.
Jean-Doré Beach( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/jean-dore-beach-sand-swimming-sun-montreal/ )
Located five minutes from downtown at Parc Jean-Drapeau, this convenient beach is accessible by bus, car, métro or bike. Jean-Doré beach also features the Aquazilla obstacle course, free wifi, snack bar, changing rooms and lockers.
Aquatic Complexe, Parc Jean-Drapeau( http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/aquatic-complex-pool-swimming-competitions-montreal/ )
Some people would rather swim in a pool than a lake. If you're that person, hit up one of Montreal's public pools such as the Aquatic Complexe at Parc Jean-Drapeau. Featuring a recreational pool for wading and eight lanes designated for swimming laps, the Aquatic Complexe has all your swimming needs covered.
Parc Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Pool( http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7297,74577648&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL )
Located on Brébeuf St. within Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier Park in the heart of the Plateau, Laurier pool is another great option for Montrealers looking to seek refuge from the heat. The park features lots of great 'pool day' activities (Ping-Pong, playground, workout circuit, etc.), so you might want to pack a lunch and stay the entire day.
Splash Pads( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much )
With splash pads located all over the city, we asked some of our newsroom staffers to compile a list of their favourite pads to take their children( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/staff-picks-montreal-splash-pads-for-when-the-heat-is-too-much ) when the heat is too much to handle.
