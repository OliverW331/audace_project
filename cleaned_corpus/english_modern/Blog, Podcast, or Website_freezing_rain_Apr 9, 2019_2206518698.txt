There is sun at the end of the snow-swept tunnel.
After several weeks of see-sawing temperatures, full-fledged winter returned on Tuesday and was expected to dump up to 10 centimetres of snow on Montreal.
That's nowhere near a record. On April 9, 2000, Montrealers had to shovel 34 centimetres of snow.
Environment Canada issued a weather statement for the Montreal area on Tuesday morning, noting snow "could bring an additional weight on structures and trees that are already covered in freezing precipitation."
Areas north of Montreal were still recovering from freezing rain and strong winds that took down many power lines( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/hydro-outages-leave-more-than-240000-in-the-dark-in-laval-laurentians ) on Monday. As of 4 p.m., more than 220,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without power, most of them in Laval, the Laurentians and the Lanaudière region.
Spring should gradually return in the coming days. In Montreal, highs are expected to reach double-digits by Friday and Environment Canada's forecast calls for a sunny Sunday, with a high of 11 Celsius.
On Tuesday, the weather conditions impeded Canada Post mail delivery in the Montreal region.
"While every effort is being made to deliver the mail, some customers may not receive mail today," the postal service said. "Delivery will resume once it's safe to do so."
The weather also led the City of Montreal to cancel the launch of a flood-prevention campaign on Tuesday.
The city had planned to start an effort to visit more than 3,000 homes affected by spring flooding in 2017.
