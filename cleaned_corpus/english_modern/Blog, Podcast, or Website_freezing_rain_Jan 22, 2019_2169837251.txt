Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for Montreal.
"A band of freezing rain will develop over the Outaouais region and the Montreal area late Wednesday as a warm front approaches," the federal weather office said.
"Two to four millimetres of freezing precipitation are expected over most regions where a warning was issued."
As of 3:45 p.m. Tuesday, the warning applied to Montreal, Vaudreuil, St-Eustache, St-RÃ©mi and Mascouche.
On Wednesday morning, about five centimetres of snow are expected to fall. The snow is expected to change to freezing rain late in the afternoon. And the freezing rain will change to rain in the evening.
"Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery," Environment Canada said. "Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions."
More rain is expected on Thursday, when the high is expected to reach 4 C.
