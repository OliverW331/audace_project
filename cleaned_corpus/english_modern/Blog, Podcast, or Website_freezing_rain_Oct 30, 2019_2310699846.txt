Children preparing for Halloween in northwestern and central Quebec hopefully have costumes that work over or under a snowsuit. Montrealers, work a rain poncho into your outfit and hope for candy that melts in your mouth, not your pumpkin basket.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement warning there could snowfall in excess of 15 centimetres in several parts of Quebec and significant rainfall in more southern regions.
Those looking for someone to blame can point a finger at a meteorological depression from the Great Lakes region. In the Montreal area, the system will bring strong winds and upwards of 50 millimetres of rainfall Thursday and Friday. Nighttime temperatures could drop to 6 degrees Celsius, and will dip below freezing Friday.
Snowfall is expected to be heaviest around Amos, Saarland, Malartic, Rouyn-Noranda, Senneterre and Val d'Or, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, as well as Alma, Péribonka, Saint-Félicien and Roberval, at Lac-Saint-Jean.
