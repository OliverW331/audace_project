Summer will still begin on June 21. However, it doesn't look as if it will actually get started until sometime in July.
Météo Media's long-range summer forecast, made public Monday, calls for a chilly June with temperatures below normal and the prospect of actual summer weather not appearing until sometime between July and August and persisting until September.
Météo Média chief meteorologist André Monette said that once the heat does arrive( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/sixty-six-people-died-during-montreals-2018-heat-wave ), it will do so less brutally than in 2018, with fewer heat waves prostrating the province over the course of the summer.
The summer of 2018 saw a heat wave hit southern Quebec between June 29 and July 5. More than 260 local records for maximum temperatures were equalled or broken, and 66 deaths were linked to the intense heat.
Cooler temperatures will be the norm in eastern Quebec this summer due to a cold air mass parked in the middle of the continent. The cold air mass and a warm front along the eastern seaboard could lead to episodes of storms and rain in southern Quebec and Ontario.
"When you mix hot and cold in the weather, you get rain and storms, particularly in the summer, " said Monette. "In the St. Lawrence Valley, from Montreal up to Rimouski, through the Outaouais and Eastern Townships, there's a risk of higher than normal precipitation."
Monette said the rain would not be constant, but the amount dumped by storms could be high.
