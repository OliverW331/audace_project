The Montreal area could experience heavy downpours and thunderstorms in the late afternoon or evening, according to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada( https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html ).
The national meteorological agency warned that since the storms are moving slowly, significant amounts of rain could fall locally. Flash floods and ponding - when giant pools of water form - could happen on roads as commuters make their way home.
The statement was issued for the Montreal, Ch√¢teauguay, Laval and Longueuil regions.
