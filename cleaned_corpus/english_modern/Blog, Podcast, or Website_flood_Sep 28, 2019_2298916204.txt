Led by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets of Montreal Friday, calling for action on climate change.
Organizers said close to 500,000 people took part, paralyzing downtown as they walked a four-kilometre route from Jeanne-Mance Park to Old Montreal.

At the end of the march, Thunberg, a slight 16-year-old whose activism has spurred millions around the world to join the fight against climate change, stood on a box to reach the microphone to be able to address the crowd.
She urged Montrealers to keep up the fight.
"Today we are millions striking and marching (around the world) and we will keep doing it until they listen," she told the cheering throng. "It should not be up to us, but somebody needs to do it. This is an emergency and we will not be bystanders.
"Some would say we are wasting lesson time, we say we are changing the world so that when we are older we will be able to look our children in the eyes and say we did everything that we could."

Thousands of elementary, high-school, CEGEP and university students joined the march, after schools across the city cancelled classes.
They carried signs that read "We're missing our lesson to teach you one" and "You're stealing our future" and "Your opinion is not a fact, science doesn't lie." People lined the streets, cheering as the marchers passed.
It was one of dozens of climate strikes taking place across Canada and around the world.
Thunberg was at the head of the march, with a group of Indigenous students carrying a banner that read "Au front pour la Terre Mère/To the front lines for Mother Earth."
In a speech peppered with French, Thunberg joked about the similarities between her home country and Canada - the cold winters, the moose, the hockey. But then her words became serious.
"You are a nation that is allegedly a climate leader; Sweden is also allegedly a climate leader," she said. "In both cases, it means absolutely nothing. In both cases, it's just empty words."
Thunberg, who began striking for climate action outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, said the fight against climate change will not stop until world leaders take the problem seriously.
And she dismissed naysayers who say young people can't make a difference.
"I think we have proven that to be wrong by now," Thunberg said. "The people have spoken. We are the change and change is coming."
Some of those who marched behind Thunberg said they were inspired by the activist, who has become a global icon.
"A few years ago, climate change wasn't on my radar at all but - just as Greta said - I started listening to the scientists and I've changed the way I live," said Hélène Audrit, a PhD student in neuropsychology.
"I'm a vegetarian now, I no longer own a car, it's hard not to take action when you realize how urgent the situation is."
Kahawi Jacobs, who came from Kahnawake, said she felt the power of the crowd.
"Respecting and preserving the Earth is just part of who we are," Jacobs said. "Just to be on our territory with so many people behind us, it's phenomenal."
After the march, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante welcomed Thunberg to city hall, where she was given the keys to the city.
"Greta represents all the youth pushing us, the adults, the leaders, the companies, to take our responsibilities," said Plante, who was among those who took to the streets on Friday.
Thunberg told the mayor she was "very overwhelmed" by the reception she received in Montreal.

Earlier, Thunberg met Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau privately. She said she asked him to act on "the current, most available science."
"Of course (Trudeau) has a lot of responsibility and he's obviously not doing enough," Thunberg told reporters later. "Because this is a system that is wrong. My message to all the politicians is the same, just listen to the science, act on the science."
Climate activists have criticized Trudeau for his decision to buy the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.
While in Montreal Friday, Trudeau was targeted by a yelling anti-pipeline protester who called the prime minister a "climate criminal."
Later, during the march, several people yelled at Trudeau about pipelines, including one who attempted to throw eggs at him on Sherbrooke St. Police handcuffed the man and took him away.
The climate event was the latest in a series of Friday youth-organized climate marches this year, including one in March that attracted 150,000 people.
"We're the ones who will live the worst case scenarios predicted by science. Our resources are limited," Ève Grenier Houde of Fridays for Future, a youth climate group, said Friday. "We need support from our parents, teachers and elected officials."
Grenier Houde had a plea for Montreal's mayor, Quebec's premier and Canada's prime minister: "Madame Plante, Mr. Legault and Mr. Trudeau, it's your responsibility to ensure our future."
Legault did not attend the march, but posted a letter on Facebook Friday, telling Quebec's youth that he hears their plea for action.
A poll out this week indicated that climate change is tied with health care as the No. 1 issue among Quebec voters.
