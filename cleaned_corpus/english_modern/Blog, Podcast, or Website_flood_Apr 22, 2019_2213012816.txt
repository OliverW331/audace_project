Quebecers woke up Monday morning to a second week of spring flooding, with the worst of the damage in the Beauce region. The premier of Quebec had mused whether the time had come for some riverfront homeowners to consider moving elsewhere( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-watch-soldiers-deployed-across-quebec-as-flood-damage-claims-womans-life ).
As of 8:30 a.m. Monday, Urgence Québec reported that 2,389 homes across the province had been flooded, while 717 households had been cut off from their communities by floodwaters and 1,509 residents evacuated from their homes. Major flooding was recorded at five sites along Lac St. Pierre, the Chaudière River and Lac des Deux-Montagnes.
During a tour of flooded areas in Laval on Sunday, Premier François Legault wondered whether the time had come for those who find themselves repeatedly flooded during the spring thaw to relocate to higher ground. "If we have to oblige people to move, we will do so," he said, adding that "we have to be lucid" and understand that Quebec taxpayers should not have to pay for flood damage every other year.

That stark choice was particularly personal for Anna Lin and Eddy Girard, who spent Sunday watching the waters rise at the edge of their property on Île Bigras in Laval.
Since the floods of 2017( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/flood-victims-living-in-bureaucratic-limbo ), the two say they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate their home against flooding. They have lifted the structure by three feet and installed a waterproof foundation. Yet they worry it won't be enough.
"It's discouraging," said Girard. "It's tough to keep your morale up and it's tough for the family because there are always arguments. Do we rebuild? Do we leave? It's a big decision to make."
During his tour of Laval, Legault was informed that the water levels were expected to continue to rise until Wednesday at least.
On Monday, Laval city officials said that while the waters below the bridge linking Île Bigras with Laval were rising slowly, the security of the span could be jeopardized by debris floating along the current or high winds, at which point the span would be closed. Should that occur, emergency services would still have access to the island by water shuttle.
Thus far, a total of 200 Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to Laval to assist citizens and emergency services have made more than 1,450 door-to-door checks of residences in high risk areas.
Nearly 1,400 residences have received palettes of sandbags to deploy around their homes and the strengthening of dikes in the neighbourhoods of Laval-Ouest, Ste-Rose, Chomedey and the Îles Laval continues.

Meanwhile, the most critical flooding thus far in Quebec was in the Beauce region. A total of 200 people had to leave the town of Scott, an operation made more dramatic by the fact a fire broke out in a local machine shop, only to be extinguished in part by the flooding.
Water levels were also rising in the Outaouais area and in Rigaud, a town that was hard hit by 2017's floods( https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/watch-st-lazare-resident-captures-birds-eye-view-of-rigaud-flooding ), although weather forecasts suggest that this year's damage may not be as severe.
"The weather is on our side," said Quebec civil protection spokesperson Éric Houde. "There are other rain systems on the way, but the water that's flowing now won't be back."
Environment Canada predicts the spring thaw will be fed by melting ice rather than rain.
"The heavy rainfalls are behind us," said meteorologist Marie-Ève Giguère. "Now we're looking at runoff over the next few days, but no rain for Monday or Tuesday."
According Environment Canada, the flood prone corridor between the Outaouais and the Chaudière-Appalaches region will receive three rainfalls between Monday and the start of next week, although that rainfall will be light. About 10 to 20 mms. of rain will fall overnight Tuesday Wednesday, perhaps less in the Outaouais and Montréal areas, while another 10 mms. are expected late Thursday or early Friday. None of the weather systems bringing that rain expected to remain in the province for long.
Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to drop to more seasonal levels which should slow the melting of whatever snow is left in the areas.
Called in as reinforcements for local civil protection staff, a total of 600 Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed throughout Quebec, about 30 of whom will be deployed Monday in Île-Bizard-Sainte-Geneviève. The soldiers have been assigned to shore up sandbagging and dike reinforcement in areas at risk.
Urgences Québec is urging citizens who have to leave their homes because of the flooding to inform their municipality and to leave a note in their mailbox stating the time of their departure and their destination.
The extent of flooding and the status of water levels in various regions can be consulted at the Quebec public security website.( https://geoegl.msp.gouv.qc.ca/adnv2/ )
