As Montreal police urged the public not to call the 911 emergency number to report wind damage to their homes and the number of power outages on the island continued to climb, it became clear Friday that the high winds and expected damage predicted by Environment Canada were becoming a grim reality.
And as damage reports began to flow in from across much of the province in the form of flooding or wind damage, Hydro-Québec's tally of how many clients were without power closed in on one million - a number that could represent as many as two to three million users.
As of 3 p.m., 980,140 customers were without power across Quebec.
Storm damage may affect the commute home for Montrealers. Many traffic lights are out and the Deux-Montagnes train service is down until at least 4:15 p.m.
[PERTURBATION] ??Due to strong winds, a power breakdown occurred on the Deux-Montagnes line. Service expected to resume not before 4:15 pm. For more info, click here : https://t.co/0efMDfMyBj( https://t.co/0efMDfMyBj )

The good news: the worst of the storm appears to be over. Environment Canada lifted the wind warning for Montreal and surrounding areas at 3:40 p.m.
Hydro-Québec has scheduled a 4:30 p.m. press conference to provide an update on the outages and its efforts to restore power.
Saying its repair crews were out in full force and bracing for a second wave of wind gusts over the course of the day, Hydro earlier in the day tried to manage customers' expectations by acknowledging it could not predict when power would be fully restored.
"We are preparing for a second wave of strong winds with gusts of up to 100 km/h that could cause further outages," the utility wrote in a statement Friday morning. "Given the number of places where we are being called upon to intervene, we cannot say exactly when power will be restored at each site."
The numbers backed up Hydro's claim( http://pannes.hydroquebec.com/pannes/bilan-interruptions-service/#bis ).
As of 3 p.m., Hydro-Québec was reporting 280 power outages on Montreal island affecting more than 115,000 households and businesses, a total that could represent more than 300,000 users. That number dwarfed the reported 30,000 homes and businesses blacked out on Montreal island just five hours earlier.
Hydro-Québec reported that most of the Montreal outages were located in the West Island, west-end and central Montreal as wind-blown branches - and occasionally entire trees - severed power lines, bent stop signs and sent traffic cones flying across roads and highways.
Urgences-santé reported that as of 2 p.m., they had received 650 calls for assistance since noon, and that between 11 a.m. and noon they had received 122 calls, when the norm for that time period is between 60 and 70 calls.
Urgences-santé spokesperson Benoit Garneau said that while it was fortunate that no major injuries had been reported, the high winds had resulted in some unusual calls being answered.
Garneau said those calls included extricating a driver from a truck flipped by the wind, assisting in the evacuation of handicapped students from the upper floors of a school without power, and attending to a construction worker who had been literally blown out of his second-floor work area.
Garneau acknowledged first responders had been working non-stop since the winds began to sweep the city - picking up a patient, taking them to the nearest hospital and then quickly heading back out - and urged those able to get themselves to a clinic on their own to do so, or to call Info-Santé at 811 rather than the 911 emergency number if their injury was not serious.

Montreal and Laval police were kept busy providing security around fallen power lines and inoperative traffic lights. They were obliged to take to social media by mid-morning to urge residents not to use 911 to report wind damage to their homes.
"To report material damage to your property, contact your insurance," the Montreal department said on its Twitter account. "A police report is not required. If there is a traffic hazard or the safety of people is at risk, contact 911."
The tapering off of the rain that had washed the area overnight allowed city crews to deal with flooding in underpasses on Papineau Ave. and Hochelaga St. However, some West Island motorists and residents were posting videos of storm surges created by the high winds washing over piers and some local roads.
While Environment Canada lifted its heavy rainfall warning for the Montreal area, the residue of overnight downpours was evident on streets and highways, and motorists were advised to exercise caution during their morning commute.
Heavy rain warnings remained in effect in Sherbrooke (where precautionary evacuations were being carried out because of concerns the St. François River would flood), Rimouski, St-Georges, Saguenay, Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles. Between 40 and 80 millimetres of rain are expected to fall in those areas by the end of Friday.
Evacuations were also being carried out in Cowansville, where the Yamaska River has reached dangerously high levels.
In the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, about 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are expected in the areas of Amos, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Malartic, Senneterre, Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or.
