The Great Lakes have a little surprise brewing for the Laurentians and other regions just north of Montreal: freezing rain.
Thankfully, Environment Canada has ruined the surprise by issuing special weather statements for the Laurentians, Lachute-St-Jérôme, Lanaudière, Mont-Laurier, Mont-Trembant and Upper Gatineau. The federal weather service says the freezing rain is expected to start Wednesday morning, riding in on a trough from the Great Lakes.
The weather system should give way to rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures near zero, but in the meantime there could also be ice pellets and maybe some snow.
Be careful on the roads, Environment Canada urges, and report severe weather conditions by email, QCstorm@canada.ca( mailto:QCstorm@canada.ca ), or tweet with the #QCStorm hashtag. Don't do those last two things while you're driving, please.
