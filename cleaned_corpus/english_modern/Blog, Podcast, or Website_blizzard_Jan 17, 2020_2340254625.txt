Stop us if you've heard this one before, but it looks like we're in for 15 centimetres of snow just in time for the weekend.
Twenty-four hours after withdrawing a weather statement that warned the same amount of snow would fall on Thursday, Environment Canada issued a special weather statement on Thursday afternoon( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) for the Montreal-area forecasting snow that will begin to fall on Saturday and into Sunday.
"A low pressure system will track across southern Quebec and is expected to bring 10 to 15 centimetres of snow Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning," the federal agency said in a statement issued at 1:02 p.m. Thursday. "Also, moderate to strong easterlies will cause blowing snow, especially over exposed terrain such as the St. Lawrence Valley."
