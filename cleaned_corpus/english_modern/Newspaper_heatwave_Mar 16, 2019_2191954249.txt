A carrot is usually better than a stick when it comes to enticing people out of their cars and onto public transit.
If buses could maintain their schedules within reason and allow people to arrive in comfort, I am convinced that many more would use the service.
However, with Montreal's ever increasing construction madness, how can bus drivers maintain their schedule? Plus there are other problems at play, as has been widely reported, such as buses running out of fuel or being stuck in garages awaiting repairs.
When the temperature dips to -20 C or worse, with a howling wind, I can choose to freeze while waiting for the bus or sit in my heated car. Even if I don't save time, I am warm.
In the summer, when the temperature can reach above 30 C and the humidity can be oppressive, again I can choose the comfort of my air-conditioned car or take the bus and arrive a total sweaty mess. (Note, I am aware the STM does have some air-conditioned buses, but not enough.)
Surely there must be a way of organizing road construction so that it does not create total gridlock.
Also, having all buses with air conditioning would be a big draw during the summer heat waves.
