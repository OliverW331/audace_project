OK it won't be skate-to-work slippery, but there will be a risk of icy slippery sidewalks and roadways this morning and we're definitely in for a wet day.
Environment Canada started the day at 4:46 a.m. with a freezing-rain warning( https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?qc67 ) that could last into late morning. It is also pointing out rain, which might continue into the evening, with a high of plus 8.
Tonight: Rain ending in the evening, then mainly cloudy. Low minus 4. Wind chill minus 9 overnight
