Athletics and charity have always been a part of Rudy Erfle's life, and his ongoing battle with Parkinson's disease isn't stopping him from overseeing a fundraising event to bolster medical research.
Erfle, 58, learned he had the degenerative disorder in 2008. After a decade of living with Parkinson's, he decided it was time to organize a fundraiser - with the backing of Parkinson Canada( https://www.parkinson.ca ) - to help find a cure.
Erfle has participated in community runs, half-marathons and charity golf tournaments over the years, so organizing Rudy's Run for Parkinson's - with the help of his family - seemed like a good fit.
"It was lot of fun last year. It went very well," he said of the inaugural run that raised an impressive $70,000.
The second edition of Rudy's Run for Parkinson's takes place at Voyageur Park, just west of Sources Blvd. in Pointe-Claire, on Saturday. This year's initial target of $30,000 had already been surpassed as of Monday. Proceeds benefit the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital.( https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/ )
Erfle said local health experts have told him they are confident a cure can be found.
"I'm happy to contribute to the research," he said. "The more money they can get to do this research, the faster the cure (can be found)."
Erfle is past president of the Pointe-Claire Oldtimers Hockey league, whose foundation has donated more than $1.7 million to charities and local groups. He also coached minor hockey for many years.
While he has had to stop playing hockey because of Parkinson's, Erfle continues to golf and run despite the impact of the disease on his body.
The Pointe-Claire resident owns a custom cabinet/furniture business and continues to work daily, although the plan is for his sons, who already work with him, to eventually take over.
Rigidity, meaning stiff or inflexible muscles, is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson's.

"We call it 'freezing up,' and (sometimes) my legs won't move when I want them to," Erfle said. "I don't have a lot of the tremors people associate with Parkinson's, but I have this freezing up quite regularly. I've had Parkinson's for 11 years and it's getting worse all the time."
Participants can register online until Thursday or sign up in person Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at Voyageur Park. Registration costs $20 per adult. Participation is free for children 12 and under.
A kids' run/walk kicks off at noon and the 5-km and 10-km runs start at 12:30 p.m. Participants run or walk around the park's track.
There will be live music, a raffle and face painting as well as some food stalls. The event happens rain or shine, and about 300 runners are expected to participate.
Sponsorships and donations from local businesses and companies have helped make the run such a success, said Erfle's daughter, Marina.
"The $70,000 we raised last year was so unexpected," she said.
