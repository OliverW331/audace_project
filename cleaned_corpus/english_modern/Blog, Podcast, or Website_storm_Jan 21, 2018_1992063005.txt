A major winter storm is coming to Quebec early in the week and it's expected to launch with snow, then rain, wind and freezing rain.
The freezing rain will be "significant," Environment Canada said in a statement issued Sunday. The winter storm will affect southwestern, central and eastern Quebec beginning Monday afternoon through Wednesday.
The most affected regions will be the Outaouais, Montreal and the Mauricie toward Quebec City, with five to 10 millimetres of freezing rain.

As the storm is expected to worsen road conditions, the agency recommends drivers consider postponing travelling where possible.
