A combination of rain, freezing rain and snow could make for slippery surfaces and traffic disruptions in southwest and central Quebec starting Sunday afternoon and continuing into the evening.
Environment Canada has issued a freezing rain warning for the Montreal area. Between two and five millimetres of freezing rain are expected.
Gusts reaching 50 kilometres per hour are also expected in some parts of the province.
The storm is forecast to reach eastern Quebec later in the day, at which point it will mainly bring snow.
