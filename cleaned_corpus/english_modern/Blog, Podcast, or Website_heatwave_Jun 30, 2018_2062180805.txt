Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the island of Montreal and surrounding areas Saturday.
The agency warns of conditions "favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and torrential rain."
The watch is in effect until 11:00 p.m. and comes as a result of a warm, humid airmass hovering over Southern Quebec( http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-prepares-for-hottest-recorded-canada-day-as-heat-wave-rolls-in ) this weekend.
The agency also issued a heat warning for the Montreal area Saturday and reminded people to drink plenty of water and limit physical activity outside.
"Never leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly aerated room, even for a few minutes," the agency warned. "Check on your loved ones, especially those vulnerable or living alone."
